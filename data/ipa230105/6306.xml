In the lithium-ion battery, a separator is a porous, electrochemically inert medium between a positive electrode and a negative electrode, and the separator is not involved in an electrochemical reaction, but is crucial to safety of a battery cell. Currently, a commonly used polyolefin separator has poor ductility, and consequently when the battery cell is mechanically abused, the separator is easily punctured, and a short-circuit point is formed between the positive electrode and the negative electrode at a position at which the separator is broken. Consequently, the battery cell fails because of thermal runaway, resulting in a potential safety hazard.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of this application disclose a battery separator. The battery separator features a high elongation rate, so that a risk of separator breakage can be reduced when a battery cell is mechanically abused. In addition, the separator has a low temperature of closing a pore, so that a separator pore can be closed in advance when the battery cell is in thermal abuse, to improve safety of the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A first aspect of embodiments of this application discloses a battery separator, including a polyolefin-based porous separator. The polyolefin-based porous separator includes polyethylene resin. An elongation rate of the polyolefin-based porous separator in an MD direction (Machine Direction, machine direction, namely, a longitudinal or length direction) is greater than 120%, and an elongation rate in a TD direction (Transverse Direction, perpendicular to the machine direction, namely, a transverse or width direction) is greater than 120%. For the polyolefin-based porous separator, crystallinity at a first-time temperature rise of polyethylene that is measured by using a differential scanning calorimeter is less than 65%, and crystallinity at a second-time temperature rise is less than 55%.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this implementation of this application, a difference between the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise and the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise is less than 18%.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this implementation of this application, a temperature of closing a pore of the polyolefin-based porous separator is less than or equal to 140&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this implementation of this application, a temperature of breaking a separator of the polyolefin-based porous separator is greater than or equal to 150*:3.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this implementation of this application, a polyethylene resin raw material for preparing the polyolefin-based porous separator includes polyethylene resin with crystallinity that is less than 50%. Selection of the polyethylene raw material with low crystallinity may further improve an elongation rate and decrease the temperature of closing a pore. In this implementation, the temperature of closing a pore of the polyolefin-based porous separator may be less than or equal to 138&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this implementation of this application, the polyolefin-based porous separator further includes heat-resistant resin, and a melting point of the heat-resistant resin is higher than a melting point of the polyethylene resin. Introduction of the heat-resistant resin may effectively raise the temperature of breaking the separator. In this implementation, the temperature of breaking the separator of the polyolefin-based porous separator may be greater than or equal to 160&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this implementation of this application, the heat-resistant resin includes one or more of polypropylene, poly 1-butene, poly 1-pentene, poly 1-hexene, poly 4-methyl-1-pentene, poly 1-octene, polyvinyl acetate, polymethyl methacrylate, polystyrene, poly vinylidene fluoride, and polytetrafluoroethylene.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this implementation of this application, a test method for measuring the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise and the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise by using the differential scanning calorimeter is that the polyolefin-based porous separator is heated above a melting point of the polyethylene at a speed of 10&#xb0; C. per minute for the first time, and heat preservation is performed for three minutes, to obtain the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise of the polyethylene. Then the polyolefin-based porous separator is cooled to a temperature that is less than or equal to 40&#xb0; C. at the speed of 10&#xb0; C. per minute, and heat preservation is performed for three minutes. The polyolefin-based porous separator is again heated above the melting point of the polyethylene at the speed of 10&#xb0; C. per minute for the second time, to obtain the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise of the polyethylene. The crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise of the polyethylene is obtained by dividing polyethylene melting enthalpy that is measured in a process of the first-time temperature rise by standard polyethylene melting enthalpy. The crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise of the polyethylene is obtained by dividing the polyethylene melting enthalpy that is measured in a process of the second-time temperature rise by the standard polyethylene melting enthalpy.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this implementation of this application, in the polyolefin-based porous separator, a mass proportion of the polyethylene resin is greater than or equal to 70%.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this implementation of this application, the polyolefin-based porous separator is a single-layer structure or a multi-layer structure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this implementation of this application, a thickness of the polyolefin-based porous separator is 1 &#x3bc;m to 14 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this implementation of this application, porosity of the polyolefin-based porous separator is 20% to 60%.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this implementation of this application, an air permeability value of the polyolefin-based porous separator is greater than or equal to 50 sec/100 cc.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this implementation of this application, the battery separator further includes a separator coating layer that is disposed on a surface on one side or two sides of the polyolefin-based porous separator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this implementation of this application, the separator coating layer includes an organic coating layer, an inorganic coating layer, and/or an organic-inorganic composite coating layer.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this implementation of this application, the inorganic coating layer includes a ceramic coating layer, and a material of the ceramic coating layer is selected from one or more of aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, zinc oxide, barium oxide, magnesium oxide, beryllium oxide, calcium oxide, thorium oxide, aluminum nitride, titanium nitride, boehmite, apatite, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, barium sulfate, boron nitride, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, cubic boron nitride, hexagonal boron nitride, graphite, graphene, and mesoporous molecular sieves (for example, MCM-41 and SBA-15).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this implementation of this application, the organic coating layer is selected from one or more of an oily polyvinylidene fluoride coating layer, a vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene copolymer coating layer, a polystyrene coating layer, an aramid coating layer, a polyacrylate coating layer or a polyacrylate-modification coating layer, a polyester coating layer, a polyarylester coating layer, a polyacrylonitrile coating layer, an aromatic polyamide coating layer, a polyimide coating layer, a polyethersulfone coating layer, a polysulfone coating layer, a polyether ether ketone coating layer, a polyetherimide coating layer, and a polybenzimidazole coating layer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this implementation of this application, the thickness of the separator coating layer is 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this implementation of this application, the polyolefin-based porous separator is made by using a wet process.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A second aspect of embodiments of this application provides a preparation method for a battery separator, including:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">mixing a polyolefin resin raw material and solvent to obtain a mixed liquid, where the polyolefin resin raw material includes a polyethylene resin raw material, and crystallinity measured after the polyethylene resin raw material is mixed together is less than 55%;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">extruding the mixed liquid, and cooling and casting the mixed liquid into a sheet;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">forming a porous membrane after first-time stretching, extraction, and drying of the sheet;

Then the polyolefin-based porous separator is cooled to a temperature that is less than or equal to 40&#xb0; C. at the speed of 10&#xb0; C. per minute, and heat preservation is performed for three minutes. The polyolefin-based porous separator is again heated above the melting point of the polyethylene at the speed of 10&#xb0; C. per minute for the second time, to obtain the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise of the polyethylene. A temperature above the melting point of the polyethylene may be 200&#xb0; C. Specifically, the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise of the polyethylene is obtained by dividing polyethylene melting enthalpy that is measured in a process of the first-time temperature rise by standard polyethylene melting enthalpy. The crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise of the polyethylene is obtained by dividing the polyethylene melting enthalpy that is measured in a process of the second-time temperature rise by the standard polyethylene melting enthalpy. The standard polyethylene melting enthalpy is calculated at 293 J per gram. It should be noted that if the polyolefin resin further includes another resin with a higher melting point than a melting point of the polyethylene, only crystallinity of the polyethylene is calculated when crystallinity is calculated.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this implementation of this application, the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise of the polyethylene is crystallinity that is measured by performing a first-time temperature rise and melting on the polyolefin-based porous separator, and represents crystallinity of the base separator. The crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise of the polyethylene is crystallinity that is measured through a second-time temperature rise and melting after cooling, and represents crystallinity of the polyethylene resin in a separator raw material. If the base separator is made of a plurality of polyethylene resin raw materials, the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise is a test value for the plurality of polyethylene resin raw materials that are mixed. A difference between the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise and the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise is an increase in crystallinity from the polyethylene resin raw material to a finished polyolefin-based porous separator. An inventor of this application finds through an experiment that the increase in crystallinity from the polyethylene resin raw material to the finished base separator is controlled to be less than 18%, that is, the difference between the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise and the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise is controlled to be less than 18%, so that an elongation rate of the separator may be significantly improved. A lower increase in crystallinity indicates a more obvious effect in improving the elongation rate. In some implementations of this application, the increase in crystallinity is controlled to be less than or equal to 17%, that is, the difference between the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise and the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise is controlled to be less than or equal to 17%. In some other implementations, the increase in crystallinity may be alternatively controlled to be less than or equal to 16%, or the increase in crystallinity may be alternatively controlled to be less than or equal to 15%. In some implementations of this application, the increase in crystallinity is controlled to be less than or equal to 11%, that is, the difference between the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise and the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise is controlled to be less than or equal to 11%. In some other implementations of this application, the difference between the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise and the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise is less than or equal to 10%. Specifically, for example, the difference between the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise and the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise is controlled to be 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13% 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1%.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this implementation of this application, for the polyolefin-based porous separator, the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise of the polyethylene measured by using the differential scanning calorimeter may be less than 60%, and the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise of the polyethylene measured by using the differential scanning calorimeter is less than 50%. Specifically, in some implementations, for the polyolefin-based porous separator, the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise of the polyethylene measured by using the differential scanning calorimeter may be 20% to 60%, and the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise of the polyethylene measured by using the differential scanning calorimeter is 10% to 50%. Lower crystallinity helps obtain a higher elongation rate and a lower temperature of closing a pore.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the battery separator in this embodiment of this application, the crystallinity is controlled to be at a relatively low level, and it is ensured that the difference between the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise of the separator and the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise of the separator is less than 18%, that is, there is a small increment in crystallinity of the finished separator relative to the polyethylene resin raw material. The crystallinity represents a proportion of a crystallization region in a polymer. Low crystallinity indicates that the base separator has high amorphous regions. These amorphous regions have better ductility under an action of an external stress, that is, have a higher elongation rate in a property of the base separator. The property of the high elongation rate of the separator can reduce a risk of separator breaking when a battery cell is mechanically abused, and improve safety of the battery cell. In addition, the crystallinity of the polyethylene resin raw material is relatively low, and therefore the base separator can obtain a relatively low temperature of closing a pore, so that a separator pore can be closed in advance when the battery cell is in thermal abuse, to improve the safety of the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Specifically, the high elongation rate of the separator may improve a pass rate of the battery cell in mechanical abuse tests such as nail penetration and impact.

To be specific, the elongation rate is a percentage of an increment in the length when the separator is pulled to break relative to the initial length. A higher elongation rate indicates that it is more difficult to pull the separator to break, and indicates better ductility. In some implementations of this application, the elongation rate of the polyolefin-based porous separator in the MD direction is greater than or equal to 150%, and the elongation rate of the polyolefin-based porous separator in the TD direction may be greater than or equal to 150%.

Elongation rate test for the base separator: The base separator is cut out, in each of the MD direction and the TD direction, to obtain a small strip with a width of 15 mm and a length greater than 50 mm (for example, 100 mm). If an elongation rate in the MD direction is tested, the width of 15 mm refers to the TD direction of the base separator, and the length of 100 mm refers to the MD direction of the base separator. If an elongation rate in the TD direction is tested, the width of 15 mm refers to the MD direction of the base separator, and the length of 100 mm refers to the TD direction of the base separator. A tensile test is performed on the small strip by using a multi-functional tensile testing machine, and a test condition is that a width of a sample is 15 mm, a length of the base separator between an upper fixture and a lower fixture before the test is fixed at 50 mm, and is recorded as L0 (a length of a cut sample is greater than 50 mm, to help a fixture clamp the separator sample). A stretching speed of the tensile testing machine is set to 100 mm per minute. The sample starts to be stretched until the sample just breaks. In this case, a distance between the fixtures is recorded as L1 and the elongation rate is equal to (L1&#x2212;L0)/L0.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">2. Thickness test for the base separator: A ten-thousandths thickness gauge is used to test thicknesses of at least 10 points in the TD direction of the base separator, and an average of the thicknesses of the at least 10 points is used as the thickness of the base separator.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">3. Separator crystallinity test: The base separator sample is heated to 200&#xb0; C. by using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) at a speed of 10&#xb0; C. per minute in a nitrogen atmosphere (in this process, the base separator is melted and absorbs heat, and measured melting heat absorption is divided by standard melting heat absorption to obtain crystallinity at a first-time temperature rise). Heat preservation is performed on the sample at 200&#xb0; C. for three minutes (in this case, the base separator is completely melted into a polyethylene resin raw material, and a stress that is produced when the polyethylene resin is processed into the base separator is completely removed). Then, the sample is cooled to 40&#xb0; C. at the speed of 10&#xb0; C. per minute and heat preservation is performed for three minutes (in this process, the polyethylene resin raw material is crystallized without an action of an external stress). Then, the sample is heated to 200&#xb0; C. at the speed of 10&#xb0; C. per minute (in this process, the base separator sample is melted for the second time, to obtain crystallinity at a second-time temperature rise, which actually represents crystallinity of the polyethylene resin raw material). Therefore, a difference in crystallinity between two initially consecutive temperature rises of the base separator represents an increase in crystallinity caused by an external temperature and stress in a process in which the polyethylene resin raw material is processed into the base separator.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">4. Test of a temperature of closing a pore: The test is performed by using a temperature-rising internal resistance method. The separator is placed in a stainless steel fixture or another similar fixture, and an appropriate amount of electrolyte is injected into the fixture. The fixture is placed in an oven, and is heated at a specific speed. Resistance and a temperature of the fixture are monitored at the same time, and a temperature at which the resistance increases abruptly (by 50 times) is the temperature of closing a pore of the separator.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">5. Test of a temperature of breaking a separator: A test time is prolonged based on the test of the temperature of closing a pore, and a temperature at which the resistance decreases abruptly is the temperature of breaking the separator.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">6. Battery Safety Test</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">6.1 Nail penetration test: After the battery is fully charged in a standard charging mode, the test is performed within 24 hours. A battery cell is placed on a plane, and is pierced vertically by using a steel nail with a diameter of 3 mm at a speed of 150 mm per second. After the steel nail pierces the battery cell, this situation is kept for five minutes, or when the battery cell indicates that the temperature decreases to 50&#xb0; C., the test is stopped. If the battery cell does not ignite or explode, the battery cell passes the test.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">6.2 Impact test: After the battery is fully charged in a standard charging mode, the test is performed within 24 hours. The battery cell is placed on a plane, a steel column with a diameter of 15.8 mm&#xb1;0.1 mm is placed in the center of the battery, and a longitudinal axis of the steel column is parallel to the plane. The steel column may be fastened by using fixtures on both a left side and a right side, but an object with a cushioning function such as a sponge is not allowed to be used under the steel column for fastening. A heavy weight of 9.1 kg&#xb1;0.46 kg freely drops from a height of 610 mm&#xb1;25 mm above a tested battery cell to the battery cell. The drop height is a distance from a bottom side of the heavy weight for impact to a surface of the sample. If the battery cell does not ignite or explode, the battery cell passes the test.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">6.3 Heating test: After the battery is fully charged in a standard charging mode, the test is performed within 12 hours to 24 hours. A convection manner or a cycle hot air oven is used for heating at an initial temperature 25&#xb0; C.&#xb1;3&#xb0; C. With a temperature change rate of 5&#xb0; C.&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. per minute, the temperature rises to 140&#xb0; C.&#xb1;2&#xb0; C., which is kept for 30 minutes, and then the test is finished. If the battery cell does not ignite or explode, the battery cell passes the test.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">6.4 Overcharge test: The battery is tested and discharged, and then is put into an explosion-proof box. A thermocouple is well connected (a contact of the thermocouple is fastened to a center part of a surface of the battery cell), and a power supply is connected for charging. The battery is charged to 4.6 V at a <b>3</b>C steady current until a voltage reaches a maximum value. The test is stopped when any one of the following conditions is met: (a) A continuous charging time reaches 7 hours. (b) A temperature of the battery cell decreases to a value that is 20% lower than a peak value. If the battery cell does not ignite or explode, the battery cell passes the test.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The foregoing test results are listed in Table 1:</p><p id="p-0121" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Embodiment 1</entry><entry>Embodiment 2</entry><entry>Embodiment 3</entry><entry>Embodiment 4</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Resin raw</entry><entry>Polyethylene</entry><entry>Mw</entry><entry>600 thousand</entry><entry>600 thousand</entry><entry>600 thousand</entry><entry>600 thousand</entry></row><row><entry>material</entry><entry>resin A</entry><entry>Mass proportion</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>50</entry><entry>&#x2002;50</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Crystallinity</entry><entry>54%</entry><entry>54%</entry><entry>60%</entry><entry>60%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Polyethylene</entry><entry>Mw</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>200 thousand</entry><entry>200 thousand</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>resin B</entry><entry>Mass proportion</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>50</entry><entry>&#x2002;40</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Crystallinity</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>40%</entry><entry>40%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Heat-resistant</entry><entry>Resin type</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>PP</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>resin C</entry><entry>Mass proportion</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>10%</entry></row><row><entry>Base</entry><entry>Polyolefin</entry><entry>Mass proportion</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>28</entry><entry>&#x2002;30</entry></row><row><entry>separator</entry><entry>solution</entry></row><row><entry>manufacturing</entry><entry>concentration</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Extrusion</entry><entry>m/min</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>5.5</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>&#x2003;5</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>speed through</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>a die head</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Cooling speed</entry><entry>&#xb0;

In the comparative embodiment, the polyethylene resin raw material with crystallinity of 60% is used, the increase in crystallinity in a processing procedure is 15%, and first-time crystallinity of a finished separator is 75%. An elongation rate of the base separator in Embodiment 1 is 210% in the MD direction and 190% in the TD direction, which are significantly higher than 100% and 80% in the comparative embodiment, respectively. Therefore, in mechanical abuse tests such as the nail penetration test and the impact test, in Embodiment 1, there is a significant advantage with respective pass rates of 80%, whereas the respective pass rates in the comparative embodiment are only 40% and 30%.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">In Embodiment 2, increase levels of the first-time crystallinity and second-time crystallinity are further reduced on the basis of Embodiment 1, and reach 6%, and therefore the elongation rate of the base separator is further improved, and the pass rates of the nail penetration test and the impact test are increased to 90%. In addition, the temperature of closing a pore of the base separator is reduced to 139&#xb0; C., and therefore thermal abuse tests such as the heating test and the overcharge test are improved to some extent, and respective pass rates reach 30% and 40%.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">In Embodiment 3, the crystallinity is controlled in terms of a raw material and a part of the polyethylene resin raw material B with relatively low crystallinity (40%) is used. It can be learned from the crystallinity at the second-time temperature rise of the base separator, namely, the crystallinity of the raw material, that the crystallinity (combination) of the raw material in Embodiment 3 is 50%, which is lower than 60% in the comparative embodiment. In addition, in Embodiment 3, a relatively low stretching multiple is used in terms of the technology: The first-time stretching multiple in each of the MD and the TD is 4, and the second-time stretching multiple in the TD is 1.1, which are lower than 7 and 1.4 in the comparative embodiment, respectively. In this way, an increase in crystallinity of the polyethylene resin is controlled in the processing procedure, that is, the difference in the crystallinity in Embodiment 3 is controlled to be 8%, whereas the difference in the crystallinity in the comparative embodiments is 15%. In Embodiment 3, the crystallinity is controlled from two dimensions of the raw material and the technology, so that the crystallinity of the base separator is at a relatively low level. In Embodiment 3, the crystallinity at the first-time temperature rise of the base separator is 58%, which is significantly lower than 75% in the comparative embodiment. Low crystallinity enables the base separator to have better ductility. Specifically, in Embodiment 3, the elongation rates in the MD direction and the TD direction are respectively 220% and 200%, which are significantly higher than 100% and 80% in the comparative embodiment. The property of the high elongation rate of the base separator enables the battery cell to have a higher pass rate when the battery cell is mechanically abused. Therefore, in Embodiment 3, the pass rates in the nail penetration test and the impact test both reach 90%, whereas the pass rates in the comparative embodiment are only 40% and 30%, respectively. In addition, because the raw material B with the crystallinity that is less than 50% is used, the temperature of closing a pore of the base separator is reduced to 133&#xb0; C., which is significantly lower than 143&#xb0; C. in the comparative embodiment. Therefore, the battery cell prepared by using the base separator is significantly improved in the thermal abuse tests such as the heating test and the overcharge test.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">In Embodiment 4, a heat-resistant resin material of polypropylene (PP) is added on the basis of Embodiment 3, and an obtained base separator has a high elongation rate (an elongation rate 220% in the MD and an elongation rate 200% in the TD), a low temperature (136&#xb0; C.) of closing a pore, and a high temperature (160&#xb0; C.) of breaking the separator. Therefore, the pass rate of the battery cell prepared by using the separator in each of abuse tests such as the nail penetration test, the impact test, the heating test, and the overcharge test reaches 100%, thereby comprehensively improving the safety of the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">In Embodiment 5, the separator coating layer is replaced with the double-sided oily PVDF+Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>mixed coating layer on the basis of Embodiment 4. A heat-resistant ceramic layer is removed, so that heat resistance of the separator is reduced, and the pass rate of the separator in the battery cell abuse test is reduced, which, however, are still significantly better than those in the comparative embodiment.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">In Embodiment 6, only the single-sided heat-resistant ceramic coating layer is used on the basis of Embodiment 4. The heat resistance of the separator is reduced, and the pass rate of the separator in the battery cell abuse test is reduced, which, however, are still significantly better than those in the comparative embodiment.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">In embodiments of this application, the raw material and the technology for manufacturing the separator are optimized, so that the crystallinity of the base separator is controlled to achieve a purpose of the high elongation rate of the separator. No additional process or device is required, and an existing production line for a commercial separator may be fully used. Therefore, there are producibility and practicality.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
