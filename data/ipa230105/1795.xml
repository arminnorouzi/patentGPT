The voltage across the terminals of these storage devices may be high, for example between 60 V and 1000 V. When the input or the output of the electrical component is disconnected, the electrical energy remains stored in the storage device. Thus, if a person comes in contact with the storage device, for example during a maintenance operation of the automobile, the stored energy may be discharged to this person and injure them.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to avoid this, it is known to use an active discharge device designed to discharge the electrical energy storage device on command. Since a large amount of electrical energy must be discharged in a short time, the power dissipated by the active discharge device is high, which may lead to heating of its component parts, possibly to the extent of starting a fire. Protection against heating is therefore generally provided.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, the patent application published under the number US 2011/0057627 A1 describes a device for actively discharging an electrical energy storage device, of the type comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">a branch comprising:        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0007">first and second ends intended to be connected respectively to positive and negative terminals of the electrical energy storage device, and</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0008">between the two ends, a thermistor having a resistance that increases with a temperature of the thermistor and a switch designed to receive a control signal in order to change from an open state to a closed state, the thermistor and the switch being connected to one another so that, when the switch is closed, a discharge current enters through the first end, flows through the thermistor and the switch one after the other, and emerges through the second end; and</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">a device for controlling the switch.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0010">In this patent application, the switch is a field-effect transistor with a metal oxide gate (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFET), having: a current input drain, a current output source and a gate. For this switch, the control signal is the gate-source voltage. More precisely, the switch is open when the gate-source voltage is zero and closed when it is nonzero. In the latter case, the discharge current drawn by the switch increases with the gate-source voltage. Furthermore, the thermistor is connected to the source of the switch and the control device is arranged in order to provide a closure voltage of the switch between the thermistor and the gate of the switch. Because of the presence of a Zener diode at the output of the control device, the closure voltage is substantially constant. Thus, the gate-source voltage is equal to the difference between the closure voltage (constant) and the voltage across the terminals of the thermistor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0011">In the event of heating of the switch, the temperature of the thermistor rises because of the thermal coupling between the switch and the thermistor, which leads to an increase of the resistance and therefore of the voltage across its terminals. This results in a decrease of the gate-source voltage and therefore a decrease of the discharge current flowing through the switch, which limits its heating.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">One problem of the active discharge device proposed in the aforementioned patent is that most of the heat is necessarily dissipated in the switch, which may reduce its lifetime or even damage it.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">It may thus be desirable to provide an active discharge device which makes it possible to reduce the power dissipated by the switch.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">A device of the aforementioned type for actively discharging an electrical energy storage device is therefore proposed, characterized in that the control device is connected to the switch so as to provide the control signal independently of the resistance of the thermistor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">Specifically, in the patent application above, since the gate-source voltage depends on the resistance of the thermistor, the thermistor must necessarily have a low resistance so that the voltage across its terminals is not too high and does not negate the gate-source voltage at a very low discharge current.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">By virtue of the invention, the control device provides the thermistor with the control signal independently of the resistance. Thus, the thermistor may be selected with a very high resistance so that it dissipates most of the discharge current. The switch then needs to dissipate only a small part of the discharge power and presents no risk of heating and wear over time.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">Optionally, the active discharge device furthermore comprises at least one connection for providing the control signal, which connects the control device to the switch, and in which the thermistor is located outside each connection for providing the control signal. In other words, the connection between the control device and the switch for providing the control signal does not include said thermistor.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">Also optionally, the switch has an input terminal for the discharge current, an output terminal for the discharge current and a control terminal, the control signal is a control voltage between the control terminal and the output terminal, and the active discharge device comprises two connections for providing the control signal, which connect the control device respectively to the control terminal and to the output terminal.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">Also optionally, the thermistor is connected between the first end of the branch and the input terminal of the switch.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">Also optionally, the thermistor is connected between the output terminal of the switch and the second end of the branch.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">Also optionally, the connection for providing the control signal, which connects the control device to the output terminal, comprises a connection between the control device and a point of the branch that is located between the output terminal of the switch and the thermistor.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">Also optionally, the thermistor is thermally decoupled from the switch, for example by means of a thermal insulation barrier interposed between them.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">Also optionally, the thermistor is located at a distance of at least 1 cm from the switch.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">Also optionally, the resistance of the thermistor at 25&#xb0; C. is at least 10 times higher, preferably 100 times higher, more preferably 1000 times higher, than a resistance of the switch in the closed state.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">Also optionally, the thermistor is designed to perform one or more, preferably all three, of the following functions:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0026">dissipating more power than the switch;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0027">limiting the discharge current when the temperature of the thermistor rises;

In the closed state, the switch <b>212</b> drains the discharge current i<sub>D</sub>. In the latter case, it then has a low resistance r, generally between 1 m&#x3a9; and 100 m&#x3a9;. Thus, the resistance RT at 25&#xb0; C. is at least 10 times higher, and preferably 100 times higher, or even 1000 times higher, than the resistance r. In this way, during the discharge, most of the power is dissipated in the thermistor <b>210</b>. More precisely, the thermistor <b>210</b> dissipates the power RT&#xd7;i<sub>D</sub><sup>2</sup>, while the switch <b>212</b> dissipates the power r&#xd7;i<sub>D</sub><sup>2</sup>. Thus, when the resistance RT is 100 times higher than the resistance r, the thermistor <b>210</b> dissipates 100 times more energy than the switch <b>212</b>. Thus, the switch <b>212</b> is heated very little and has a very low risk of causing a fire to start.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0056">The thermistor <b>210</b> and the switch <b>212</b> preferably are thermally decoupled from one another so that the thermistor <b>210</b> does not heat the switch <b>212</b>. This may be obtained by separating them from one another by a distance of at least 1 cm and/or by using a thermal insulation barrier <b>213</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0057">The switch <b>212</b> has input and output terminals D and S for the discharge current i<sub>D</sub>, as well as a control terminal G. In the example described, the control signal is a control voltage V<sub>GS </sub>between the control terminal G and the output terminal S. Furthermore, the resistance r is the resistance between the input and output terminals D and S.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0058">In the example described, the switch <b>212</b> is a field-effect transistor with a metal oxide gate (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFET) having, as is known per se, a drain, a source and a gate, respectively forming the input terminal D, the output terminal S and the control terminal G.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0059">The switch <b>212</b> may also be a bipolar transistor, an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), a thyristor or any other controllable switch.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0060">The active discharge device <b>200</b> furthermore comprises a device <b>214</b> for controlling the switch <b>212</b>, which is connected to the switch <b>212</b> so as to provide it with the control signal V<sub>GS</sub>, independently of the resistance RT of the thermistor <b>210</b>, in response to the reception of a discharge command CMD coming for example from a computer <b>215</b> of the automobile <b>100</b>. The control device <b>214</b> is preferably supplied by the low voltage LV of the low-voltage battery <b>114</b>. The control device <b>214</b> may also be supplied indirectly by the high voltage HT of the high-voltage battery <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0061">In the example described, the active discharge device <b>200</b> comprises two connections <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> for providing the control signal V<sub>GS</sub>, which connect the control device <b>214</b> respectively to the control terminal G and to the output terminal S of the switch <b>212</b>. It will be appreciated that, since the thermistor <b>210</b> is connected between the first end <b>206</b> and the input terminal D, it is located outside each of these connections <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> for providing the control signal V<sub>GS</sub>. Thus, the connections <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> for providing the control signal V<sub>GS </sub>avoid or circumvent the thermistor <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0062">More precisely, the active discharge device <b>200</b> comprises a connection <b>220</b> between the control device <b>214</b> and a point P of the branch <b>204</b> that is located between the output terminal S and the second end <b>208</b>. Thus, the connection <b>218</b> for providing the control signal V<sub>GS</sub>, which connects the control device <b>214</b> to the output terminal <b>5</b>, comprises the connection <b>220</b> and the portion <b>222</b> of the branch <b>204</b> that extends between the point P and the output terminal S.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0063">Thus, the control signal V<sub>GS </sub>is defined by the control device <b>214</b> and is independent of the resistance RT of the thermistor <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0064">The control signal V<sub>GS </sub>provided by the control device <b>214</b> may have a substantially constant value (after a time of establishing the control signal V<sub>GS</sub>) or alternatively may vary during the discharge, depending on the type of control desired.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0065">In addition, the active discharge device <b>200</b> comprises a diagnostic module <b>224</b> designed to verify correct operation of the switch <b>212</b> (for example, the value of the voltage v<sub>DS</sub>) and, in case of detecting a malfunction of the switch <b>212</b>, to interrupt the active discharge command CMD in order to stop the active discharge.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0066">Furthermore, the active discharge device <b>200</b> comprises a verification module <b>226</b> designed to verify correct operation of the discharge. To this end, the verification module <b>226</b> is designed to monitor the current i<sub>D </sub>by measuring the voltage v<sub>RT </sub>across the terminals of the thermistor <b>210</b>. It is furthermore designed to compare the measured voltage with the voltage expected according to the command CMD. In case of divergence, the module <b>226</b> is designed to transmit an error message to the computer <b>215</b>. In order to measure the voltage v<sub>RT</sub>, the verification module <b>226</b> is connected to the terminals of the thermistor <b>210</b>, for example to the terminals <b>206</b> and D.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0067">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the capacitor C<b>1</b> has a voltage E equal to the sum of the voltage v<sub>RT </sub>across the terminals of the resistor and the voltage v<sub>DS </sub>across the terminals of the switch <b>212</b>. Thus, a rise in the temperature of the thermistor <b>210</b> leads to an increase of the voltage v<sub>RT</sub>, and therefore to a decrease of the voltage v<sub>DS</sub>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> represents a current i<sub>D</sub>&#x2212;voltage v<sub>DS </sub>characteristic of the switch <b>212</b> for various increasing values, respectively v<sub>GS0</sub>=0&#x3c;v<sub>GS1</sub>&#x3c;v<sub>GS2</sub>&#x3c;v<sub>GS3</sub>, of the voltage v<sub>GS</sub>. As may be seen, for all the values of v<sub>GS</sub>, the discharge current i<sub>D </sub>decreases when the voltage v<sub>DS </sub>decreases. The result of this is that the rise in the temperature of the thermistor <b>210</b> leads to the decrease of the discharge current i<sub>D</sub>, which reduces the heating of the thermistor <b>210</b>. Thus, the temperature of the thermistor <b>210</b> is regulated, which reduces the risk of excessive heating of the latter and therefore the risk of a &#x201c;hazardous thermal event&#x201d; (HTE).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an active discharge method <b>400</b> according to the invention will now be described.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0070">During an initial step <b>402</b>, the control device <b>214</b> keeps the switch <b>212</b> in the open state by not supplying it with a control voltage v<sub>GS </sub>(the voltage v<sub>GS </sub>is zero). The discharge current i<sub>D </sub>is thus zero. Furthermore, the thermistor <b>210</b> is at ambient temperature (for example around 85&#xb0; C.) and has the resistance RT associated with this temperature. The voltage v<sub>DS </sub>is equal to the voltage E of the capacitor C<b>1</b>, which is itself equal to the high voltage HT.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0071">During a step <b>404</b>, the control device <b>214</b> receives the discharge command CMD and, in response, provides the switch <b>212</b> with the control signal v<sub>GS</sub>, which in the example described is constant at a predefined value, for example at the value v<sub>GS3</sub>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0072">During a step <b>406</b>, in response to the control signal v<sub>GS</sub>, the switch <b>212</b> changes to the closed state and drains a discharge current i<sub>D</sub>, which enters through the first end <b>206</b>, flows through the thermistor <b>210</b> and the switch <b>212</b> one after the other, and emerges through the second end <b>208</b>. Because of the appearance of the discharge current i<sub>D</sub>, the voltage v<sub>RT </sub>across the terminals of the thermistor <b>210</b> takes the value RT&#xd7;i<sub>D</sub>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0073">During a step <b>408</b>, the control device <b>214</b> maintains the control signal v<sub>GS</sub>, for example at a constant value (such as the value v<sub>GS3</sub>), or alternatively following predefined variations provided by the control device <b>214</b> during a discharge time.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0074">During this discharge time, the thermistor <b>210</b> fulfills its first function of power dissipation by dissipating most of the power (at least 10 times more power than the switch <b>212</b>, as explained above). At the same time, the thermistor fulfills its second function of thermally protecting the discharge by being heated (for example up to 105&#xb0; C.) because of the flow of the discharge current i<sub>D</sub>, so that the resistance RT increases. As explained above, this has the effect of decreasing the voltage V<sub>DS </sub>of the switch <b>212</b> and therefore of decreasing the discharge current i<sub>D</sub>, which reduces the heating of the thermistor <b>210</b>. The temperature of the thermistor <b>210</b> is thus regulated.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0075">In parallel, the discharge current i<sub>D </sub>discharges the capacitor C<b>1</b> and causes the reduction of the voltage E to an acceptable threshold, for example less than 60 V, at the end of the discharge time.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0076">It will be appreciated that during the discharge time, by virtue of the fact that the control device <b>214</b> is connected to the switch <b>212</b> while avoiding the thermistor <b>210</b>, the control signal v<sub>GS </sub>is maintained independently of the variations in the resistance RT of the thermistor <b>214</b>. In other words, the control signal v<sub>GS </sub>is not affected by the variations in the resistance RT.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0077">When the control device <b>214</b> is designed to keep the control signal v<sub>GS </sub>constant, the control signal v<sub>GS </sub>remains constant, independently of the variations in the resistance RT.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0078">When the control device <b>214</b> is designed to vary the control signal v<sub>GS </sub>during the discharge, these variations are carried out as provided by the control device <b>214</b>, independently of the variations in the resistance RT. At the same time as the active discharge, the thermistor fulfills its third function of verification by allowing the verification module <b>226</b> to monitor the current i<sub>D </sub>by means of the voltage v<sub>RT</sub>. In case of divergence between the measured voltage and the voltage expected according to the command CMD, the verification module <b>226</b> sends an error message to the computer <b>215</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an active discharge device <b>500</b> of the automobile <b>100</b> according to a second embodiment of the invention will now be described.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0080">The active discharge device <b>500</b> is identical to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, except that the thermistor <b>210</b> and the switch <b>212</b> are interchanged.
