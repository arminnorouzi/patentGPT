A real concern for them is to not be accidentally exposed to a video content that can trigger an epileptic seizure. A video, graphical, etc. data files containing such triggering content may induce a violent seizure that can potentially be fatal. While photosensitive epilepsy is a known condition, few existing content creators actively ensure that their video, graphical, etc. content would not cause it to occur, or provide users with control over the content being served to them.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some implementations, the current subject matter may be configured to analyze a data file, e.g., a video, a graphical data file, etc., that may cause an adverse health reaction (e.g., a seizure, epilepsy, etc.) of a user. The data file may be received (e.g., uploaded, downloaded, etc.) and stored in a storage location (e.g., a database, a cloud storage location, a memory, a file system, a file sharing platform, a streaming system platform and/or device, etc.). The analysis of the data file may include checking the data file for presence of a triggering content. The triggering content may include one or more video, graphical, audio, etc. patterns, frequencies, and/or intensity. Non-limiting examples of such content may include at least one of the following: a luminance flash, a red flash, a high-contrast pattern, a repeated pattern, a high-contrast and repeated pattern, a color pattern, and/or any other triggering content and any combination thereof. The triggering content may be present in one or more portions of the data file, and/or the entire data file. For example, a 15-second long video file may include a high-contrast and repeated pattern of images between 4<sup>th </sup>and 8<sup>th </sup>seconds of the video. Upon detecting the triggering content, the current subject matter may be configured to tag the video file and insert one or more timestamps corresponding to the beginning and end of the location of the data file that has this content. Moreover, the triggering content may be blocked from view (e.g., by a blank screen, a warning, etc.), playback of the data file may be paused immediately prior to (e.g., corresponding to the first inserted timestamp) the displaying of the triggering content so that the user is not automatically exposed to the triggering content. The user may be presented with an option to skip the triggering content, in which case, the playback of the data file may resume after the second timestamp (corresponding to the end of the triggering content). Alternatively, or in addition to, the user may choose to view the triggering content. The user may also be presented with any other actions (e.g., deletion of the data file, modification of the data file, removal of the triggering content, addition of further warnings, etc.).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some implementations, the current subject matter system may be implemented in a scalable and extendable architecture (such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref>) that may be configured to execute various processes (e.g., anti-virus, search, etc.) in its storage location on files that may be stored therein (e.g., uploaded, downloaded, transmitted to, etc.). In some example implementations, the current subject matter system may be configured to be implemented as a plug-in for such architecture that may be configured to identify potentially problematic data files (e.g., video content, graphical content, etc.), mark it as triggering, and use various techniques to prevent the user from being accidentally exposed to it.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As stated above, an analysis on the data file (e.g., video, graphical file, etc.) may include checking the data file for one or more patterns/frequency/intensity/etc. that may trigger a reaction in a user. For example, the checking may include identifying whether luminance flash, red flash, and high-contrast-repeated-pattern based content is present in a video.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some implementations, in order to detect whether a data file includes a triggering content, the current subject matter system may be configured to determine whether the data file includes at least one of the following: a high contrast, high luminance flashing image(s, high contrast, repeated-pattern visuals, and/or any combination thereof. To determine whether the data file includes high contrast, high luminance flashing image(s), the current subject matter system may be configured to detect at least one of the following parameters: flash frequency, flash intensity, flash area, color, and any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To detect flash frequency, the current subject matter system may be configured to determine whether a video flash and/or a flicker occurs in the data file when there is a pair of opposing changes in the video luminance, e.g., an increase of luminance followed by a decrease in luminance, and/or a decrease in luminance followed by an increase in luminance. For example, while a small percentage of users may experience adverse health effects in response to a flash with frequency below 3 Hz, a larger percentage of users may experience adverse health effects when the flash frequency is greater than 3 Hz and less than 16 Hz or greater than 60 Hz.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Flash intensity may refer to a luminance of a display that the user may be using to view the data file, and the contrast between the increased and decreased states. For example, a contrast of more than 20% may be potentially be seizure inducing, and a contrast of 60% or more may likely induce symptoms in all users.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Flash area may be a surface area of a part of an image that may trigger a reaction in a user. This may range from 9% of users if 1/10<sup>th </sup>of a screen carries the screen luminance variation, all the way up to 100% if the full screen is flashing.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Color of the light emitted (or emanating from the screen showing the triggering image) may also be important. For example, a red light between 660 nm to 720 nm of the same luminosity as blue and/or white light may induce seizures.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, the current subject matter system may be configured to check the data file for presence of high contrast and/or repeated-pattern visuals. Up to 30% of users may be sensitive not just to flicker but also geometric patterns. In this case, the current subject matter system may be configured to consider a type of pattern that may trigger a reaction in a user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates examples of patterns <b>300</b> that may trigger an adverse reaction in a user. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the patterns may include a stripe pattern, a concentric circles pattern, a polka-dots pattern, a radial stripes pattern, a checkerboard pattern, a diagonal stripes pattern, and/or any other type of pattern. Additionally, one or more of the following factors may be assessed by the current subject matter system: a spatial frequency (i.e., how often the pattern repeats in the field of vision), a size of a pattern, pattern luminance (e.g., brightness), contrast, and/or any combination thereof. Moreover, any potentially harmful regular pattern that contains clearly discernible stripes when there are more than five light-dark pairs of stripes in any orientation may be determined as being triggering. The stripes may be parallel and/or radial, curved and/or straight, and may be formed by rows of repetitive elements such as polka dots. The system may determine that if the stripes change direction, oscillate, flash and/or reverse in contrast, they may be more likely to be harmful than if they are stationary.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some implementations, the current subject matter system may implement various existing software tools to perform frame-by-frame analysis to capture luminosity, color, pattern, area, etc. in order to gauge whether a content (e.g., video, image, graphics, etc.) of the data file would not trigger an adverse reaction in a user and would be within safe limits. The safe limits may be defined as follows. There are no more than three general flashes and no more than three red flashes within any one-second period. Alternatively, or in addition to, the combined area of flashes occurring concurrently may occupy, for example, no more than a total of one quarter of any 341&#xd7;256-pixel rectangle anywhere on the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 by 768 pixels.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some implementations, the current subject matter may be configured to perform analysis of the data files that have been uploaded/downloaded and/or stored in a storage location (e.g., a database, a cloud storage location, a memory, a file system, a file sharing platform, a streaming system platform and/or device, etc.), determine whether the data file (e.g., contain harmful content that may trigger a reaction in a user) may be harmful to a user, tag the data file as potentially harmful, insert one or more timestamps indicative of a location of the harmful content, and insert an element that may prevent the user from being accidentally exposed to the harmful content. The above process may be performed automatically upon detecting that a data file has been uploaded to the storage location. Alternatively, or in addition to, it may be performed and/or reviewed by an administrator. This process may provide users with an ability to skip harmful content rather than not view the entire video and/or offer users an overlay that may significantly diminish the risk of a harmful health reaction (e.g., seizure, etc.) by reducing the contrast (and/or any other factors) to within the safe limits.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a system <b>100</b> for performing data file content mitigation, according to some implementations of the current subject matter. As stated above, a data file may include a video file, an image file, a graphics file, and/or any other data file. Content mitigation may be configured to reduce and/or prevent an adverse health reaction in a user viewing the data file and/or portion thereof that may contain content that may be deemed harmful to the user. The system <b>100</b> may be configured to be implemented in one or more database, a cloud storage location, a memory, a file system, a file sharing platform, a streaming system platform and/or device, and/or in any other platform, device, system, etc., and/or any combination thereof. One or more components of the system <b>100</b> may be communicatively coupled using one or more communications networks. The communications networks can include at least one of the following: a wired network, a wireless network, a metropolitan area network (&#x201c;MAN&#x201d;), a local area network (&#x201c;LAN&#x201d;), a wide area network (&#x201c;WAN&#x201d;), a virtual local area network (&#x201c;VLAN&#x201d;), an internet, an extranet, an intranet, and/or any other type of network and/or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The components of the system <b>100</b> may include any combination of hardware and/or software. In some implementations, such components may be disposed on one or more computing devices, such as, server(s), database(s), personal computer(s), laptop(s), cellular telephone(s), smartphone(s), tablet computer(s), and/or any other computing devices and/or any combination thereof.

Thus, the system <b>100</b> may be configured to allow the users to consume the rest of the data file, where the video data file may be paused (e.g., immediately prior to, 2 seconds prior to, etc.) before the first timestamp (as inserted by the data file analysis component <b>124</b>) of the triggering content and generate, for example, an overlay that may warn the user of the risks that may be involved in viewing the triggering content. The system <b>100</b> may also allow the user to skip playback of the portion of the data file containing the triggering content. While the content is being skipped, an overlay may be generated on top of the triggering content for its duration. The overlay may nullify effects of the flash trigger by reducing contrast, while letting the user consume a modified version of the same content.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Moreover, when seeking a specific part of the video, the same tools, as discussed above, may be used to protect the user. In some example implementations, subtitles may be rendered on top of the overlay for convenience, either the ones that may be available, and/or via real-time subtitle generation.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The system <b>100</b> may also be configured to request the user to make a default selection for viewing future data files with triggering content.
