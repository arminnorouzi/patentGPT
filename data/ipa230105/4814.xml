In some examples, it may be beneficial to monitor glucose levels on a continuing basis (e.g., in a diabetic patient). Thus, glucose sensors have been developed for use in obtaining an indication of glucose levels in a diabetic patient. Such indications are useful in monitoring and/or adjusting a treatment regimen, which typically includes administration of insulin to the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A patient can measure their blood glucose (BG) using a BG measurement device (i.e., glucose meter), such as a test strip meter. A continuous glucose measurement system (or a continuous glucose monitor (CGM)) may be configured to determine interstitial glucose; although possible for CGM to determine blood glucose. A hospital hemacue may also be used to determine glucose level. CGMs may be beneficial for patients who desire to take more frequent glucose measurements. Some example CGM systems include subcutaneous (or short-term) sensors and implantable (or long-term) sensors. A CGM system may execute an initialization sequence when the CGM is inserted into a patient. The initialization sequence may speed up sensor equilibration and may allow a CGM system to provide reliable glucose measurements earlier.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, this disclosure describes techniques for calibrating glucose sensors (e.g., a continuous glucose monitor or &#x201c;CGM&#x201d;) based on one or more electrical parameters. More particularly, this disclosure describes techniques and devices for determining electrical parameters of a glucose sensor in vitro and/or in vivo and identifying a cluster for the glucose sensor that may be used for configuring the glucose sensor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A glucose sensor may comprise configuration information related to manufacturing the glucose sensor, which may be used to determine a glucose level of a patient. To set the configuration information, a process may comprise measuring the glucose level of a patient with the glucose sensor in vivo and measuring the glucose level of a patient with a pre-configured device. In this example, the configuration information may be set (e.g., by a clinician) based on a comparison of the glucose level measured by the glucose sensor and the glucose level measured by the pre-configured device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some examples, the glucose level measured by the glucose sensor may be an interstitial glucose level, and the glucose level measured by the pre-configured device may be blood glucose level. In such examples, a processor may be configured to convert the interstitial glucose level to a blood glucose level (e.g., such as by scaling and offsetting), and compare the blood glucose level determined from the interstitial glucose level to the blood glucose level measured by the pre-configured device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the techniques of the disclosure, configuration information of a glucose monitor may be set based on one or more electrical parameters measured in vitro. Electrical parameters may include, for example, a voltage, an electrical current (e.g., iSig), or an impedance. In general, the electrical current (iSig) flowing through the sensing (e.g., working) electrode of a glucose sensor is indicative of the glucose level in the patient's interstitial fluid. For example, processing circuitry may measure the one or more electrical parameters after the glucose monitor is manufactured and before the glucose monitor is implanted into a patient.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this example, the processing circuitry may identify a cluster for the glucose sensor based on the one or more electrical parameters. Each cluster of the plurality of clusters may identify respective configuration information. The configuration information may include a correction factor for improving an accuracy of the glucose sensor. The glucose sensor may be calibrated with configuration information (e.g., the correction factor) based on a cluster identified for the glucose sensor. For example, in response to identifying a particular cluster for the glucose device, the processing circuitry may calibrate the glucose sensor with a respective set of configuration information that are assigned to the particular cluster. In this way, a glucose sensor may be calibrated without relying on in vivo calibration techniques, which may improve an accuracy of the glucose device. Moreover, glucose sensors that are assigned to a cluster associated with inaccurate glucose sensors may be pruned, which may help to improve an accuracy and/or reliability of a resulting set of glucose monitors. A more optimal configuration of the glucose sensor may also improve the longevity of the glucose sensor.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one example, a method for calibrating a glucose sensor includes determining, by one or more processors, a set of electrical parameters for the glucose sensor and determining, by the one or more processors, a cluster for the glucose sensor from a plurality of clusters based on the set of electrical parameters. Each cluster of the plurality of clusters identifies respective configuration information. The method further includes configuring, by the one or more processors, the glucose sensor to determine a glucose level of a patient based on configuration information identified by the determined cluster.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another example, a device for calibrating a glucose sensor, the device includes a memory and one or more processors implemented in circuitry and in communication with the memory. The one or more processors are configured to determine a set of electrical parameters for the glucose sensor and determine a cluster for the glucose sensor from a plurality of clusters based on the set of electrical parameters. Each cluster of the plurality of clusters identifies respective configuration information. The one or more processors are further configured to configure the glucose sensor to determine a glucose level of a patient based on configuration information identified by the determined cluster.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one example, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon instructions that, when executed, configures a processor to determine a set of electrical parameters for a glucose sensor and determine a cluster for the glucose sensor from a plurality of clusters based on the set of electrical parameters. Each cluster of the plurality of clusters identifies respective configuration information. The instructions further configures the processor to configure the glucose sensor to determine a glucose level of a patient based on configuration information identified by the determined cluster.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The details of one or more examples are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

More particularly, this disclosure describes techniques and devices for identifying electrical parameters of a glucose sensor in vitro and identifying a cluster for the glucose sensor. In some examples, the glucose sensor may use the identified cluster to configure with configuration information associated with the identified cluster.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example glucose level management system in accordance with one or more examples described in this disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates system <b>110</b> that includes insulin pump <b>114</b>, tubing <b>116</b>, infusion set <b>118</b>, monitoring device <b>100</b> (e.g., a glucose level monitoring device comprising a glucose sensor), and patient device <b>124</b>. Insulin pump <b>114</b> may be described as a tethered pump, because tubing <b>116</b> tethers insulin pump <b>114</b> to infusion set <b>18</b>. In some examples, rather than utilizing a tethered pump system comprising insulin pump <b>114</b>, tubing <b>116</b>, infusion set <b>118</b>, and/or monitoring device <b>100</b>, patient <b>112</b> may utilize a patch pump. Instead of delivering insulin via tubing and an infusion set, a pump patch may deliver insulin via a cannula extending directly from an insulin pump. In some examples, a glucose sensor may also be integrated into such an insulin pump (e.g., a so-called &#x201c;all-in-one (AIO) insulin pump&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Patient <b>112</b> may be diabetic (e.g., Type 1 diabetic or Type 2 diabetic), and therefore, the glucose level in patient <b>112</b> may be controlled with delivery of supplemental insulin. For example, patient <b>112</b> may not produce sufficient insulin to control the glucose level or the amount of insulin that patient <b>112</b> produces may not be sufficient due to insulin resistance that patient <b>112</b> may have developed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">To receive the supplemental insulin, patient <b>112</b> may carry insulin pump <b>114</b> that couples to tubing <b>116</b> for delivery of insulin into patient <b>112</b>. Infusion set <b>118</b> may connect to the skin of patient <b>112</b> and include a cannula to deliver insulin into patient <b>112</b>. Monitoring device <b>100</b> may also be coupled to patient <b>112</b> to measure glucose level in patient <b>112</b>. Insulin pump <b>114</b>, tubing <b>116</b>, infusion set <b>118</b>, and monitoring device <b>100</b> may together form an insulin pump system. One example of the insulin pump system is the MINIMED&#x2122; 670G insulin pump system by MEDTRONIC MINIMED, INC. However, other examples of insulin pump systems may be used and the example techniques should not be considered limited to the MINIMED&#x2122; 670G insulin pump system. For example, the techniques described in this disclosure may be utilized with any insulin pump and/or glucose monitoring system that includes an in vivo glucose sensor (e.g., a continuous glucose monitor or other in vivo glucose sensor).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Monitoring device <b>100</b> may include a sensor that is inserted under the skin of patient <b>112</b> (e.g., in vivo), such as near the stomach of patient <b>112</b> or in the arm of patient <b>112</b> (e.g., subcutaneous connection). The sensor of monitoring device <b>100</b> may be configured to measure the interstitial glucose level, which is the glucose found in the fluid between the cells of patient <b>112</b>. Monitoring device <b>100</b> may be configured to continuously or periodically sample the glucose level and rate of change of the glucose level over time.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one or more examples, insulin pump <b>114</b>, monitoring device <b>100</b>, and/or the various components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, may together form a closed-loop therapy delivery system. For example, patient <b>112</b> may set a target glucose level, usually measured in units of milligrams per deciliter, on insulin pump <b>114</b>. Insulin pump <b>114</b> may receive the current glucose level from monitoring device <b>100</b> and, in response, may increase or decrease the amount of insulin delivered to patient <b>112</b>. For example, if the current glucose level is higher than the target glucose level, insulin pump <b>114</b> may increase the insulin. If the current glucose level is lower than the target glucose level, insulin pump <b>114</b> may temporarily cease delivery of the insulin. Insulin pump <b>114</b> may be considered as an example of an automated insulin delivery (AID) device. Other examples of AID devices may be possible, and the techniques described in this disclosure may be applicable to other AID devices.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Insulin pump <b>114</b> and monitoring device <b>100</b> may be configured to operate together to mimic some of the ways in which a healthy pancreas works. Insulin pump <b>114</b> may be configured to deliver basal dosages, which are small amounts of insulin released continuously throughout the day. There may be times when glucose levels increase, such as due to eating or some other activity that patient <b>112</b> undertakes. Insulin pump <b>114</b> may be configured to deliver bolus dosages on demand in association with food intake or to correct an undesirably high glucose level in the bloodstream. In one or more examples, if the glucose level rises above a target level, then insulin pump <b>114</b> may deliver a bolus dosage to address the increase in glucose level. Insulin pump <b>114</b> may be configured to compute basal and bolus dosages and deliver the basal and bolus dosages accordingly. For instance, insulin pump <b>114</b> may determine the amount of a basal dosage to deliver continuously and then determine the amount of a bolus dosage to deliver to reduce glucose level in response to an increase in glucose level due to eating or some other event.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, in some examples, monitoring device <b>100</b> may sample glucose levels for determining rate of change in glucose level over time. Monitoring device <b>100</b> may output the glucose level to insulin pump <b>114</b> (e.g., through a wireless link connection like Bluetooth). Insulin pump <b>114</b> may compare the glucose level to a target glucose level (e.g., as set by patient <b>112</b> or a clinician) and adjust the insulin dosage based on the comparison. In some examples, insulin pump <b>114</b> may adjust insulin delivery based on a predicted glucose level (e.g., where glucose level is expected to be in the next 30 minutes).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described above, patient <b>112</b> or a clinician may set one or more target glucose levels on insulin pump <b>114</b>. There may be various ways in which patient <b>112</b> or the clinician may set a target glucose level on insulin pump <b>114</b>. As one example, patient <b>112</b> or the clinician may utilize patient device <b>124</b> to communicate with insulin pump <b>114</b>.

Glucose sensor electrodes sensors <b>20</b> may generate a sensor signal indicative of a concentration of a physiological characteristic being measured. For example, the sensor signal may be indicative of a glucose reading. The sensor signal may be measured at a working electrode of glucose sensor electrodes sensors <b>20</b>. In an example of the disclosure, the sensor signal may be a current (e.g., iSig) measured at the working electrode. In another example of the disclosure, the sensor signal may be a voltage (e.g., Vcounter) measured at the working electrode of glucose sensor electrodes sensors <b>20</b>. Electrical parameters, such as voltage, electrical current, and impedance, may be measured in vitro and may be referred to herein as &#x201c;in vitro features.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">An example of an impedance parameter may include electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS may provide additional information in the form of sensor impedance and impedance-related parameters at different frequencies. Moreover, for certain ranges of frequencies, impedance and/or impedance-related data are substantially glucose independent. Such glucose independence enables the use of a variety of EIS-based markers or indicators for not only producing a robust, highly-reliable sensor glucose value (through fusion methodologies), but also assessing the condition, health, age, and efficiency of individual electrode(s) and of the overall sensor substantially independently of the glucose-dependent Isig.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, analysis of the glucose-independent impedance data provides information on the efficiency of a sensor of monitoring device <b>100</b> with respect to how quickly it hydrates and is ready for data acquisition using, e.g., values for 1 kHz real-impedance, 1 kHz imaginary impedance, and Nyquist Slope (to be described in more detail hereinbelow). Moreover, glucose-independent impedance data provides information on potential occlusion(s) that may exist on the sensor membrane surface, which occlusion(s) may temporarily block passage of glucose into the sensor and thus cause the signal to dip (using, e.g., values for 1 kHz real impedance). In addition, glucose-independent impedance data provides information on loss of sensor sensitivity during extended wear&#x2014;potentially due to local oxygen deficit at the insertion site&#x2014;using, e.g., values for phase angle and/or imaginary impedance at 1 kHz and higher frequencies.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Within the context of electrode redundancy and EIS, a fusion algorithm may be used to take the diagnostic information provided by EIS for each redundant electrode (e.g., in systems with multiple working electrodes) and assess the reliability of each electrode independently. Weights, which are a measure of reliability, may then be added for each independent signal, and a single fused signal may be calculated that can be used to generate sensor glucose values as seen by the patient/subject.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The combined use of redundancy, sensor diagnostics using EIS, and EIS-based fusion algorithms may allow for an overall CGM system that is more reliable than systems that do not use EIS. Redundancy is advantageous in at least two respects. First, redundancy removes the risk of a single point of failure by providing multiple signals. Second, providing multiple (working) electrodes where a single electrode may be sufficient allows the output of the redundant electrode to be used as a check against the primary electrode, thereby reducing, and perhaps eliminating, the need for frequent calibrations. In addition, EIS diagnostics may scrutinize the health of each electrode autonomously without the need for a reference glucose value (finger stick), thereby reducing the number of reference values required. However, the use of EIS technology and EIS diagnostic methods is not limited to redundant systems, e.g., those having more than one working electrode.
