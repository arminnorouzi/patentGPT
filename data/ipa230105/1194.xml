Often, when doing so, not all of the tumor cells are extracted. For example, for brain tumors, such as glioblastoma, a bulk of the tumor can be removed, but portions (often, finger-like roots) of the tumor can be interlaced with healthy cells. Thus, peripheral tumor cells cannot be resected without also removing or destroying a substantial quantity of healthy cells, which can be undesirable.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, after resection of the bulk of the tumor, a secondary treatment process can treat the remaining cells surrounding the resection cavity (e.g., within the peritumoral region). One such treatment includes tumor-treating electrical fields (TTFields). However, upon resection of the bulk of the tumor, the cavity is backfilled with fluid that is highly electrically conductive. Accordingly, a substantial portion of the TTFields pass directly through the fluid within the cavity, thereby reducing efficacy of the TTFields in treating the tumor cells surrounding the cavity.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Described herein, in various aspects, is a method that comprises positioning a nonconductive material within a resection cavity that is adjacent to a target region. At least one first electrode and at least one second electrode can be positioned relative to the tumor resection cavity so that electric fields between the at least one first electrode and the at least one second electrode travel through the target region. Tumor-treating electric fields can be generated between the at least one first electrode and the at least one second electrode.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another aspect, a system can comprise at least one first electrode, at least one second electrode, and a nonconductive material positioned between the at least one first electrode and the at least one second electrode. A signal generator can be in electrical communication with each one of the at least one first electrode and the at least one second electrode. The signal generator can be configured to generate electric fields between the at least one first electrode and the at least one second electrode.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, a nonconductive, biocompatible material can be configured for receipt into a resection cavity. The nonconductive material can define an inner passageway that is configured to fill with fluid to conduct electric fields therethrough.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additional advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

The apparatus <b>10</b> may comprise an electrical field generator <b>12</b> and one or more stimulation zones (shown in this exemplary configuration as transducer arrays <b>14</b>). The apparatus <b>10</b> may be configured to generate tumor treating fields (TTFields) (e.g., at 150 kHz) via the electrical field generator <b>12</b> and deliver the TTFields to an area of the body through the stimulation zones (e.g., one or more transducer arrays <b>14</b> or electrodes). The electrical field generator <b>12</b> may be powered by a battery and/or power supply.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, each transducer array <b>14</b> can comprise a plurality of electrodes or transducers <b>15</b>. As used herein, features described with respect to electrodes are also applicable to transducers, and vice versa, unless otherwise indicated. Accordingly, the terms electrode and transducer are used interchangeably herein. In exemplary aspects, the transducers <b>15</b> can capacitively couple an AC signal into a subject's body. In further aspects, the transducers <b>15</b> can comprise a layer of conductive material, such as a layer of at least one metal (e.g., stainless steel, gold, and/or copper). Additionally, or alternatively, it is contemplated that the transducers <b>15</b> can comprise one or more layers of conductive adhesive (e.g., hydrogel). Exemplary transducers <b>15</b> can further comprise dielectric material. Optionally, the transducers <b>15</b> can comprise ceramic discs, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,715,203, which is incorporated herein by reference. In additional or alternative aspects, it is contemplated that the transducers <b>15</b> can comprise polymer insulating layers and/or other insulating material.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The electrical field generator <b>12</b> may comprise a processor <b>16</b> in communication with a signal generator <b>18</b>.

The signal generator <b>18</b> may be configured to generate an alternating voltage waveform at frequencies in the range from about 50 KHz to about 1 MHz (preferably from about 50 KHz to about 500 KHz or from about 100 KHz to about 300 KHz) (e.g., the TTFields).

That is, at least a portion of a tumor can be resected (e.g., in a resection surgery or other surgical procedure) to form the resection cavity <b>52</b>. A nonconductive material <b>54</b> can be positioned within the resection cavity <b>52</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;nonconductive material&#x201d; refers to a material that is not electrically conductive and that does not conduct electric fields. Optionally, the nonconductive material <b>54</b> can be implanted in the resection cavity <b>52</b> during the surgery in which the resection is performed.

For example, a stent or port can provide access to the nonconductive material <b>54</b> to permit removal of the nonconductive material after a desired amount (e.g., duration) of treatment with the nonconductive material. In this example, it is contemplated that a stent or port can extend through or be in fluid communication with an opening through a portion of the body of a patient (e.g., a hole formed through the cranium of the patient, or an access port formed in the torso (e.g., abdomen or back) of the patient).
