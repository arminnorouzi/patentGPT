Some emerging technologies for outdoor air quality improvement have also been introduced. Such technologies can include 1) mechanical filters (e.g., fibrous, metallic, and ceramic filters) that mechanically trap airborne contaminants within the filter; 2) sorption filters (e.g., filters including activated carbon) that remove certain gaseous molecules or odors from the air by physically or chemically binding airborne molecules to the sorbent; 3) electrostatic filters that electrically charge airborne contaminants as they enter the filter, causing these contaminants to become attracted to and trapped within the filter; and 4) photocatalytic filters that are commonly used in combination with UV light to degrade airborne contaminants. In practice, all of these filters have various shortcomings. For example, HEPA filters, though they exhibit high efficiency as particle filters, are ineffective for treating volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Further, many traditional air purification systems have a tendency to release trapped contaminants or even generate hazardous by-products. Most applications require high maintenance time and frequent filter media replacements.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for improved air purification devices, which can be efficiently employed in a variety of environments, such as buildings, aircrafts, vehicles, outdoors, etc.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, an air purification system is disclosed, which includes a conduit extending from an inlet through which a flow of ambient air may be received to an outlet through which treated air can exit the conduit. In some embodiments, a device for facilitating air circulation, e.g., a fan, can be used to facilitate the flow of the air through the conduit. A filter is disposed within the conduit to treat the incoming air. In some embodiments, the filter has a primary porous filtration unit and a secondary porous structure that can modulate the filtration functionality of the primary porous filtration unit. The treated air exits the conduit via its outlet. A renewal unit, e.g., a heating element, can also be positioned in the conduit such that it can be intermittently activated, e.g., it can be activated according to a predefined schedule, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or otherwise, so as to treat contaminants captured, or otherwise treated, by the filter, thereby renewing the filter. For example, the renewal unit can renew the filter, via heat, light, magnetic field, infrared radiation, or any other suitable energy modality. In some embodiments, heat may be used to renew the filter. In these embodiments, heat may be transferred from the renewal unit to the filter conductively or convectively.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a related aspect, an air purification system is disclosed, which comprises a conduit having an air inlet conduit portion having an inlet for receiving ambient air, renewal loop in which a filter (e.g., a fibrous filter) is positioned, and an air outlet through which the treated air exits the conduit.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the air purification system can include a primary conduit, which extends from an inlet to an outlet and in which a filter is positioned, and a secondary conduit that is coupled to the primary conduit and is fluidly coupled at two fluid connections to the primary conduit, where one of the fluid connections (herein also referred to as the upstream connection) is positioned upstream of the filter and the other fluid connection (herein referred to as the downstream connection) is positioned downstream of the filter. A fluid connection allows a liquid or gas (e.g., air) to flow between the primary and secondary conduits. In some such embodiments, one valve (herein referred to as the upstream valve) is coupled to the upstream fluid connection and another valve (herein referred to as the downstream valve) is operably coupled to the downstream fluid connection with the filter positioned between the two valves. In some embodiments, a treatment unit is positioned within the secondary conduit. The treatment unit may have the same structure as the filter or a different structure.

In other words, a functionalized filter can treat at least some contaminants (e.g., pathogens such as viruses, particulate matter, or gaseous contaminants) in the air, without significantly restricting the passage of air through the system. In this regard, the back pressure of a functionalized filter for a desired range of air flow rate can remain within an acceptable range, e.g., within about 50&#xd7; of the back pressure of the uncoated filter. By way of example, the incremental back pressure can be within about 50&#xd7;, or about 40&#xd7;, or about 30&#xd7;, or about 20&#xd7;, or about 10&#xd7;, or about 5&#xd7;, or about 1&#xd7;, or about 0.5&#xd7;, or less or no change.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The air purification system can further include a renewal unit for at least intermittently treating a filter, e.g., so as to inactivate, at least partially decompose, or at least partially remove contaminants, such as pathogen particles, captured by the filter via, e.g., heating, exposure to light, magnetic field, electromagnetic field, ionization, etc. applied at certain time intervals or based on environmental triggering. By way of example, the environmental triggering for the initiation of filter renewal can be based on the detection of a sudden increase or an increase above a threshold value in the concentration of contaminants in the ambient air, in the back pressure across the filter, or room occupancy.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The renewal unit can be configured to apply heat and/or electromagnetic radiation (e.g., microwave radiation), visible light, UV (ultraviolet), infrared, or another type of energy (e.g., plasma) to the air passing through a filter (i.e., a filter used during operation of the air purification device to treat (filter) the incoming air) and/or directly to the filter itself so as to cause the release of at least a portion of the contaminants entrapped the filter. By way of another example, in some embodiments, a burst of pressurized air can be applied to the filter to dislodge at least a portion of contaminants captured by the filter. In this example, the burst of pressurized air is applied to the filter in a direction that is opposite to the direction of the flow of the air to be filtered.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A variety of energy sources (e.g., heat, light sources) can be employed within the renewal unit in practice of the present teachings. Some examples of suitable energy sources can include, without limitation, at least one of a bobbin heater, a heating coil, a heat tape, an inductive coil, a flame, or sources of electromagnetic emission, e.g., in the form of light (e.g., microwave radiation, infrared radiation or UV radiation), or magnetic field or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the thermal energy can be transferred from the renewal unit to the filter conductively or convectively. For example, the renewal unit can include a heat source in direct contact with the filter or a fluid medium (e.g., air) that transfers the energy from the heat source to the filter, respectively.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the energy source can be configured to raise the temperature of incoming air to a value in the range of about 20&#xb0; C. to about 750&#xb0; C., e.g., about 50&#xb0; C. to about 400&#xb0; C., or about 60&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the energy source can include a heat exchanger or other heat recovery device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some such embodiments, a renewal unit can be positioned within the primary or the secondary conduit, where the renewal unit can be activated intermittently, e.g., according to a predetermined schedule, to renew the filter or start, stop, or modulate treatment unit operations.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, a controller can control the renewal process, e.g., via activation and inactivation of a heater and/or adjusting the heating level provided by the heater, according to predefined criteria. By way of example, the controller can be programmed to activate the heater to heat the air flowing through the filter. A temperature sensor in communication with the controller may be used to monitor the temperature of the heated air as it is being heated by the heater. In response to signals from the temperature sensor, the controller can adjust the heater to ensure that the air temperature remains within an elevated range that is suitable for achieving renewal of the filter, e.g., in a range of about 50&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C. or to about 150&#xb0; C., or 200&#xb0; C., or 250&#xb0; C., or 300&#xb0; C. In some embodiments wherein the filter is tolerant to higher temperatures, e.g., high temperature HEPA filter, the temperature may be elevated to a range of about 450&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the system may be divided into multiple parts, such that each part is renewed in a different period of time. For example, the system may include multiple renewal units, such as multiple heaters, for renewing different sections of one or more of the filters. The controller may turn on the different renewal units at different times and therefore renew the different sections of the filter at different times. Such a division of the renewal time may be employed, for example, when a full renewal operation of the whole system requires many resources such as electricity that may not be available; or when a full renewal may take longer than acceptable for the system to halt its air purification operation. In the latter case, the multiple periods of renewal may be staggered among multiple periods of air purification operation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some cases, the upstream and the downstream valves can each be moved between a first position and a second position. In the first position, the valves allow air to only pass through the primary conduit. Stated another way, in the first position, the valves inhibit air from flowing into the secondary conduit. In the second position, the valves inhibit the flow of the air into and out of the section of the primary conduit that is positioned between the upstream and the downstream valves, and further open the upstream and the downstream fluidic connections such that the combination of a portion of the primary conduit that is positioned between the valves and the secondary conduit forms an air flow loop (herein also referred to as a &#x201c;renewal loop&#x201d;). Before or after the renewal loop is established, the renewal unit can be activated for renewing the filter so as to reduce, and preferably eliminate contaminants adsorbed, trapped or otherwise retained by the filter. Subsequently, the upstream and the downstream valves can be returned to a state (the first position) in which they allow the ingress of the ambient air into the primary conduit via its inlet to be treated by the filter and further allow the egress of the treated air out of the conduit through its outlet. In some embodiments, the valves may be moved to any number of positions between the first and second positions. These positions modulate an air flow within the primary and/or secondary conduit. In other embodiments, one of the downstream valves may be moved to the second position while the upstream valve is in the first position thereby allowing ambient air to enter the conduits during a renewal cycle.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another filter or a treatment unit positioned downstream or upstream of the filter can treat (e.g., deactivate, decompose, or otherwise eliminate) at least a portion of the contaminants released from the filter during a renewal period before releasing the air stream through the outlet to the external environment.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the air purification system can further include a fan disposed upstream or downstream of the air inlet for facilitating air flow through the system. In some embodiments, a conduit in which a filter is positioned can have a substantially linear configuration. Such a conduit, or any other conduit of an air purification device, can have a variety of different cross-sectional profiles, such as circular, square, rectangular, etc.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The system can further include one or more heat transfer elements that are positioned along a path of air flow to increase thermal contact with the flowing air and configured to improve heat dissipation and/or absorption efficiency.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, in some embodiments, the system can include multiple filters, e.g., connected in series or in parallel, or a combination of series and parallel connections.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The device can be used for air purification or in other applications involving filtration such as a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF), gas filtration membrane, and liquid filtration membrane.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>J</figref> are schematic representations of various double conduit air purification systems according to various exemplary embodiments;</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>K</figref> are schematic representations of various single conduit air purification systems according to various exemplary embodiments; and</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are a schematic representation of a functional/modified porous substrate of a filter in accordance with an exemplary embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further understanding of various aspects of the present teachings can be found in the following description in conjunction with the associated drawings, which are described briefly below.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The term &#x201c;filter,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a device that removes a contaminant from the air by retaining and/or eliminating the contaminant.

The nanoparticles can have size ranging from about 0.5 nm to about 500 nm in at least one dimension and in some cases all dimensions.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The present disclosure is directed to filters that can be used for filtration of a fluid. In some embodiments, such a filter can include a macroscopic porous structure and a reactive medium that is coupled to the macroscopic porous structure. While in some embodiments, the reactive medium is non-porous, in other embodiments it can be porous. In some embodiments, a secondary porous structure is coupled to the macroscopic porous structure. In some such embodiments, a reactive medium can be coupled to the secondary porous structure. The reactive medium and the secondary porous structure can modulate the filtration characteristics (e.g., filtration efficiency) of the macroscopic porous structure and/or modulate the ability to renew the filter, e.g., via application of heat and/or electromagnetic radiation to the fluid and/or directly to the filter.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A reactive medium may inactivate and decompose organic contaminants and gaseous contaminants within air flowing through the filter. In some embodiments, a reactive medium can include organic materials (e.g., enzymes) or inorganic materials (e.g., metals, metal oxides such as silver, copper oxide, manganese oxide). In other embodiments, a reactive medium can include sorption materials (e.g., activated carbon, zeolites, etc.), or catalytic particles.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The term &#x201c;contaminants&#x201d; and &#x201c;pollutants&#x201d; are herein used interchangeably to refer to a variety of inorganic, organic, and mixed inorganic and organic material structures, including naturally-occurring or artificial material structures, such as a variety of microorganisms (e.g., bacteria and/or viruses), smoke, or other types of particulates. Contaminants can encompass particulates of organic, inorganic and mixed origin, aerosols including bioaerosols, and gaseous contaminants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In general, contaminants may include different types of particulates, chemicals, or organisms that may accumulate in the filter during its use and deteriorate the performance of the filter. The deterioration may include a reduction in the rate at which the filter can treat the air, the quantity or type of the contaminants that the filter can capture in a unit of time, or the increase in backpressure of the filter that would render the overall system inefficient or inoperable for the intended use.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">By way of example, particulates can have a size of about 10 microns or below (e.g., &#x201c;PM10&#x201d;), or about 2.5 microns or below (e.g., &#x201c;PM2.5&#x201d;), or about 1 micron or below (e.g., &#x201c;PM1&#x201d;), or about 300 nm or below. The term &#x201c;ultrafine particulate,&#x201d; typically refers to a particle having a size of about 0.1 microns (&#x201c;PM0.1&#x201d;) or below.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Bioaerosols can include bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, dust mites, or others. In addition, biological materials such as pollen, endotoxins, proteins, and animal excreta form aerosols. Airborne pathogens are almost always embedded in droplets along with various levels and types of organic and inorganic materials. This heterogeneity represents a significant challenge and needs to be taken into account in the development and evaluation of air decontamination technologies.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The terms &#x201c;renew&#x201d; and &#x201c;regenerate&#x201d; and their derivatives are used herein interchangeably. In particular, renewal of a filter may mean the process of improving the functionality of the filter after the functionality has deteriorated due to being used for a period of time. The deterioration of the functionality may result, for example, from accumulation of contaminants in the filter. The renewal of the filter may include, for example, removing some or all of the accumulated contaminants from the filter. The renewal of the filter may include bringing the state of the filter substantially back to a state in which the filter is capable of performing its intended function. Air purification systems disclosed herein may renew or regenerate fibrous filters. As will be discussed in further detail, renewing a filter may include heating the filter to a threshold temperature. Applicants have surprisingly found that fibrous filters may be incorporated in air purification systems in which a regeneration system is utilized to regenerate/renew the fibrous filters. As such, air purification systems disclosed herein provide an improvement over existing air purification systems as the disclosed air purification systems are able to renew fibrous filters as well as non-fibrous filters. In some embodiments, the renewal process also aids in the effective inactivation of pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc.), trapped by the filter.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The terms &#x201c;treat&#x201d; and &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; are used herein to refer to oxidation, reduction, inactivation, degradation, filtration, entrapment, or sorption (e.g., removal, breakdown) (or a combination thereof) of a contaminant (e.g., gas, vapor, particulate matter, aerosol, bioaerosol, or pathogen) from a medium (e.g., a gas or liquid medium), including a flowing medium, e.g., in the form of a polluted stream.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The term &#x201c;entrapment,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a permanent or temporary capture (e.g., filtration, sorption, etc.) of a contaminant by a structure or chemical according to the present teachings.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The terms &#x201c;pore,&#x201d; &#x201c;passage,&#x201d; &#x201c;passageway,&#x201d; and &#x201c;channel&#x201d; are herein used interchangeably to refer to a material structure having at least one opening for receiving a flow of medium (e.g., an air flow). The pores can be of a spherical or non-spherical shape, e.g., linear, curvilinear, tortuous, bifurcating, or branched cavity that can provide an enclosure or a surface that is exposed to the flow.
