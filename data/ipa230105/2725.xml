Everyday millions of people use medications that are not therapeutically beneficial or are even harmful. &#x201c;Personalized medicine&#x201d; is the tailoring of medical treatment to a single person, shaping the response to a particular disease and individual being treated. Accordingly, personalized medicine aims to increase target interference, while maximizing benefit and minimizing harmful events.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several techniques are available for growing primary cell cultures from tumors. Immortalized cancer cell lines are readily available and provide an accessible, easily usable model of various cancer types which can be used to investigate cancer biology and the potential efficacy of anti-cancer therapeutics. In order to mimic the natural environment in which a cancer resides, several different methods have been implemented including the use of various culture matrices (like biomimetic scaffolds) and chemically defined media supplemented with essential nutrients for different tissues. However, these immortalized cell lines do not accurately represent the diversity, heterogeneity and drug-resistance of tumors typically occurring in patients. Furthermore, ex-vivo organ culture (EVOC) systems have been described which preserve the 3D structure, heterogeneity and complexity of the original tumor allowing tailoring of patient-specific therapies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Animal models are the cornerstone of cancer research. Nude mice and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been developed for research of various cancer types and for improvement of drug development. For example, PDX models are used for pre-clinical drug evaluation as they conserve the original tumor characteristics such as heterogeneity, complexity and molecular diversity. However, these methods are expensive, long in nature and agonizing to the model animals.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, another in vivo model for cancer research has been proposed: the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. In this model, tumor cells are inoculated on the chorionic epithelium of the chick egg early after hatching (e.g., around embryo development day 3-5), for highly visible proliferation and invasion (see Xiao et al., PLoS One. (2015) 10(6): e0130935, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The chick embryo is initially naturally immunodeficient as its immune system reaches physiological activity only around day 15 post-fertilization. Thus, the CAM model can tolerate the transplantation of human tumor cells until the development of the chick immune system. The CAM model has been proposed in cancer research of various cancer types including breast, bladder, prostate, ovarian, and head and neck cancers for estimating the dissemination and angiogenesis of cancer cells (Xiao et al., PLoS One. (2015) 10(6): e0130935). The CAM model has also been proposed for generation of human Burkitt lymphoma xenograft tumors, which were compared with known characteristics of the human disease (Klingenberg et al., BMC Cancer (2014) 14:339). International Patent Publication WO/2017/079646 and U.S. Patent Application 2013/0171680 both also disclose the CAM model and its use. This model however has not been used to test immunotherapies as there is initially no immune system present in the model, and indeed the developing immune system is not useful as a stand in for the mature human immune system. In summary, the CAM model has been proposed for studying the growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. However, its uses have been up until now somewhat limited, and superior forms of the CAM model, specifically ones designed for the testing of immunotherapies are greatly needed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides xenograft egg models comprising a fertilized non-mammalian egg comprising an ablated immune system, a first plurality of mammalian cells and a second plurality of mammalian cells, wherein the second plurality comprises immune cells are provided.

In short, on embryo development days 1-2 (EDD=1-2), the fertilized eggs were incubated in an incubator on a moving tray. On EDD=3, the embryo and vasculature were identified, and 2 ml of albumen was pulled from the bottom part of the egg using a syringe, this resulted in lowering of the embryo and separation of the CAM membrane from the eggshell. Next, a small window was created at the top part of the eggshell and resealed with adhesive tape, and eggs were returned to the incubator for chick embryo development. On EDD=5-6, the eggs were irradiated (2.5 Gy, rate of 15/sec). On EDD=6-7, the CAM was activated (at the site of transplantation) and cancer cells in suspension (mixed with matrigel, 1:1 by volume) or biopsy/tissue samples (mixed with 0.8% Hyaluronic acid), both mixed with a mixture of VEGF:bFGF, were engrafted at the top part of the CAM. On EDD=8-9, the human immune system was reconstructed by supplying an effective number of immune cells in close proximity to the tumor (following CAM activation). On EDD=9-10, the tested anticancer drugs were applied to the eggs by injection into the yolk sac or topically to the CAM (in close proximity to the tumor) following CAM activation.

Methods of producing the xenograft egg model as well as using the xenograft egg model for screening are also provided.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0089">Predicting the clinical response to anti-cancer therapies is of great importance in cancer treatment. The use of &#x201c;personalized medicine&#x201d; aims to increase target interference, while maximizing benefit and minimizing harmful events.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0090">The invention is based at least in part on the surprising generation of a xenograft egg model that is superior in its ability to test immunotherapies on patient specific samples. This allows for the personalized treatment selection of immunotherapies. This model utilizes a chick egg which is completely ablated of the chicken immune system and is manipulated to comprise disease cells along with immune cells from the same species, indeed from the same subject. This model enables the testing various cancer therapies, including immunotherapies, which require the immune system for their activity. The removal of the egg immune system ensures that all results are specifically caused by the therapeutic. Furthermore, the immune-ablated egg enables elongation of the window in which the egg model system can be used to beyond day 15 when normally the egg's immune system would be functional. This is of great importance when studying immunotherapies. The addition of immune cells from the subject requires an extra couple of days of culture and reduces the window in which the effects of the therapeutics can be monitored. In the complete absence of the chicken immune system the therapeutic effects can be monitored right up until hatching. This extended window is essential for testing immunotherapies and especially combined immunotherapies.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0091">By a first aspect, there is provided a xenograft egg model comprising:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0092">a. a fertilized egg;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0093">b. a first plurality of explant cells; and</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0094">c. a second plurality of explant cells, comprising immune cells.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0082" num="0095">By another aspect, there is provided a method of producing a xenograft egg model, the method comprising:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0096">a. providing a fertilized egg;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0097">b. irradiating the fertilized egg;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0098">c. placing a first plurality of explant cells in the egg; and</li>        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0099">d. placing a second plurality of explant cells comprising immune cells in the egg;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0083" num="0100">thereby producing a xenograft egg model.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0101">By another aspect, there is provided a xenograft egg model produced by a method of the invention.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0102">As used herein the term &#x201c;xenograft&#x201d; as used herein refers to a cell or tissue transplant from a species different from the recipient organism (i.e., egg).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0103">In some embodiments, the egg is a viable egg.

Fertilized eggs were incubated for 72 days in an incubator (at 37&#xb0; C., 75-90% humidity) on a moving tray, rotating the eggs 12 times a day. On embryo development day 3 (EDD=3), the embryo and vasculature were identified (using a flashlight in a dark room) and 2 ml of egg white (albumen) was pulled from the bottom part of the egg using a syringe, in order to lower the embryo, separate the CAM membrane from the eggshell, and generate space at the top part of the egg for introducing the cancer cells. Next, a small window was created at the top part of the eggshell and resealed with adhesive tape (in order to reduce dehydration and contamination), and eggs were returned to the incubator for chick embryo development.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0171">On EDD=5 or 6 (i.e. 1 or 2 days prior to implantation of cancer cells), the eggs were irradiated (2.5 Gy, rate of 15/sec) in order to prevent the development of the chicken immune system. On EDD=6 or 7, the CAM was activated (at the site of transplantation) by gently touching the membrane with a Q-tip, thus increasing the propensity of the membrane to generate new vascularization toward the site of activation. Next, and immediately prior to addition of the cancer cells, 5 &#x3bc;l of 0.05% trypsin/0.5 mM EDTA was added to the site of transplantation in order to enhance the efficiency of tumor formation.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0172">Next, cancer cells in suspension (3-5&#xd7;10{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}6 cells), mixed with matrix material (e.g. Matrigel) at a ratio of 1:1 by volume and a mixture of VEGF:basic FGF in a total volume of 30 &#x3bc;l, was engrafted at the top part of the CAM. Alternatively, biopsy/tissue samples were mixed with 0.8% Hyaluronic acid (HA) and a mixture of VEGF:basic FGF and engrafted at the top part of the CAM. Chick eggs were then resealed and returned to the incubator.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0173">On EDD=8 or 9, the human immune system was introduced by supplying an effective number of immune cells. Specifically, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood of healthy volunteers or from tested patients using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. PBMCs were mixed with matrix material (e.g. Matrigel) (at a ratio of 3:1 cells to Matrigel by volume) and a mixture of VEGF:basic FGF. The immune cell mixture was engrafted at the top part of the CAM (in close proximity to the tumor) following CAM activation (as discussed above).</p><p id="p-0154" num="0174">On EDD=9 or 10, the tested anti-cancer drugs were applied to the eggs by injection into the yolk sac or topically to the CAM (in close proximity to the tumor) following CAM activation (as discussed above). Evaluation of the responsiveness of the tumor to treatment, as compared to control untreated tissue, was performed on days 13-20.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0175">Cell Lines: Cell lines used in the present study include: HT29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), HCT116 (colon carcinoma), A549 (lung carcinoma), 1975 (lung carcinoma), DU145 (metastatic prostate cancer), PC3 (metastatic prostate cancer), BT549 (ductal carcinoma), 468 (triple negative breast cancer), MDA-MB-231(breast cancer), Nalm-6 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), L428 (Hodgkin lymphoma), Raji (Burkitt's lymphoma), Panc-1 (pancreatic cancer). These cell lines were maintained in DMEM or RPMI16, supplemented with 5-10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0176">Construction of GFP-encoding plasmid and establishment of stable cell line: The LV-GFP-Puro plasmid was constructed and used to generate lentiviruses that carry the GFP reporter gene. Briefly, 293T packaging cells were seeded in 10 cm tissue culture plates. On the next day, the different plasmids (GFP-puro, VSVG, Pol-gag) were co-transfected, cells were incubated overnight, and cell media was replaced. 72-96 hours later, viruses were harvested and filtered using 0.45 &#x3bc;m pore filter. The viruses were supplemented with 8 &#x3bc;g/ml polybrene and used to infect HT29 cells. Following selection with puromycin, resistant colonies were identified.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0177">Patient-derived tumor sample processing: Tumor biopsies were obtained, and primary tumor cells were isolated. Briefly, the representative material was harvested at the time of intervention. Small sections of maximally 1 mm{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}3 were obtained using a sterile scalpel and all calcified parts were removed. The tumor tissue was digested using collagenase 2 (500 U/ml RPMI 1640) and DNase solution (22 KU/ml RPMI 1640). The remaining suspension was filtered through a 150 &#x3bc;m cell strainer. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended with erythrocyte lysis buffer (ELB) and culture medium was added to stop the reaction. After resuspension, the number of live cells/ml was counted by means of an automatic cell counter.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0178">Cells were transplanted into the CAM model as described hereinabove and the resultant three-dimensional, vascularized organoid formed from primary culture was evaluated.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0179">Growth of tumor cells using different matrices: Different types of matrices were examined for tumor growth as follows: 1) 0.8% Hyaluronic acid (Sigma); 2) E-C-L Cell Attachment Matrix (entactin-collagen IV-laminin) (Mercury); 3) Matrigel [extracted from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma, containing laminin (a major component, i.e. 56%), collagen IV, heparin sulfate proteoglycans, entactin/nidogen, and growth factors (EGF, bFGF, NGF, PDGF, IGF-1, TGF-1)].</p><p id="p-0160" num="0180">Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&#x26;E) Staining and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Staining Assay: Tumors were removed (using scissors and tweezers) from the CAM and transferred into 4% formaldehyde (FA). The excised tumors were frozen or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4&#xb0; C., and then placed into embedding cassettes followed by transfer into a tissue embedding station with an increasing graded alcohol series (50%, 70%, 80%, 95% ethanol, xylol and paraffin). Sections of the paraffin embedded tissues (3 &#x3bc;m) were deparaffinized by a decreasing graded alcohol series to double-distilled water (xylol, 95%, 80%, 70%, 50% ethanol, double-distilled water) and then used for histopathological analyses with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x26;E) according to standard protocols.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0181">Monitoring of CAM tumors growth via In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS) device: The use of fluorescently labeled cells allows monitoring tumor growth and response to therapy over time. The IVIS was used for monitoring the labeled tumors that were developed on the CAM. The eggs were placed in the device and live imaging was carried out.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 1: Establishment of the Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) Model for Cell Lines</heading><p id="p-0162" num="0182">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, by pulling 2 ml of egg white (albumen) from the bottom part of the egg, a successful separation of the CAM membrane from the eggshell was possible. This generated space at the top part of the egg for introducing the cancer cells. Importantly, this step was carried out on day 3 of embryo development as the attachment of the CAM to the shell inner membrane occurs around day 4-5. Thus, opening fertilized eggs for cultivation after day 3 will cause rupture of the shell associated with rupture of the CAM.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0183">On day 7, the CAM was activated (at the site of transplantation) in order to increase the propensity of the membrane to generate new vascularization to the site of activation and cancer cells in suspension were transplanted at the top part of the CAM.

In specific, Matrigel, Hyaluronic acid (HA) and E-C-L (entactin-collagen IV-laminin) Cell Attachment Matrix were tested. HT29 cancer cells were implanted as described hereinabove with mixed (1:1 by volume) with HA, ECL matrix or Matrigel. Both HA alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) and ECL matrix (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>) did not produce detectable tumors in the CAM model. In contrast, Matrigel was found to enhance the tumorigenicity of human cell lines, producing readily detectable tumors from all cell lines tested (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, Table 1). Notably, when tumor specimens were engrafted with 0.8% HA supplemented with bFGF and VEGF this combination was also found to be effective.

When chemotherapeutics were tested, cells in certain eggs, but not in others were found to respond (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>) demonstrating the usefulness of the system in evaluating heterogeneity and potentially selecting combination therapies.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 6: Establishment of &#x201c;Humanized Egg&#x201d; Resembling the Mouse PDX Model</heading><p id="p-0174" num="0193">As chemotherapeutics do not require the presence of an intact immune system to kill cancer cells, they could be tested in this CAM model. However, in order to test immunotherapeutics a human immune system is required. To this end a &#x201c;humanized egg&#x201d; was created. Although the developing egg is initially immunodeficient, the chicken immune system does begin to form and by day 15 is at least partially functional. In a humanized CAM model, it would be essential 1) that the effect of the human immune cells is measured without contamination by chicken immune cells and 2) that the chicken immune cells not try and reject the human immune cell transplant. As such, it was necessary to first completely ablate the avian immune system. This was done by irradiating the egg on day 5 or 6 (EDD=5-6, which was theorized to completely kill all progenitor cells of the immune system. At 1 Gray (1.0 Gy, rate of 15/sec) of radiation the immune system was not substantially affected and CD45+ cells were still highly present (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>). When 2.5 Gy was used (2.5 Gy, rate of 15/sec), no chicken CD45+ cells were detected in irradiated eggs as compared to na&#xef;ve eggs at about EDD 18 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>). Next, the irradiated egg was administered patient-derived immune cells (e.g., PBMCs) at EDD 8-9. The presence of human immune cells was confirmed in blood taken from the chicken egg, based on FACS detection of human CD45+ cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C-D</figref>). Specifically, cells of the human immune system were detectable in the chicken egg as early as 2 days after immune-reconstitution, these cells were shown to be not just CD45+, but also CD8+(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0175" num="0194">Importantly, the irradiated egg was still transplantable with the various cancer types which had been explanted in the non-irradiated egg (see Example 1). Indeed, the loss of the forming immune system may have enhanced take of the cancer cells as in the irradiated egg model successful transplantation reached a rate of &#x2dc;90% which is superior to what is known in the literature.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 7: Immunotherapy Testing in the Humanized Egg</heading><p id="p-0176" num="0195">Antibody immunotherapy could now be tested as the model comprises human immune cells. Anti-CD24 antibody was IV administered by injection into the yolk sac and the effect on tumor weight was monitored. At the dose tested the antibody in conjunction with the immune cells produced a robust anti-tumor effect by day 3-4 after administration of the antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>). The effect of the antibody was similar to that reported in humanized mice.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0196">Next, cell therapy in the form of CAR-T cells was tested. Breast cancer cells were transplanted to the CAM after irradiation. CAR-T cells were generated with receptor specificity to a breast cancer antigen and added in close proximity to the cancer cells. The CAR-T cells produced a significant decrease in tumor weight after 3 days (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) across all the tested organoids (n=6) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0178" num="0197">Finally, the combination of immunotherapy and cell therapy was successfully tested. Keytruda, an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, was IV administered (by administration to the yolk sac) while CAR-T cells were applied topically onto the CAM, in close proximity to the tumor (as discussed hereinabove). Keytruda is known to be effective against microsatellite instability (MSI)-high colorectal tumors, but ineffective against MSI-low tumors. Primary cells of both tumor types from patients were transplanted (EDD=7) into the irradiated CAM model (irradiation at EDD=5). CAR-T cells were added (EDD=9) followed by Keytruda administration (EDD=10). The size of the tumors was monitored in vivo by luminescence and the tumors were weighed after excision. In order to allow time for the therapeutic effect to be observable and significant, it was necessary to extend growth of the CAM model well beyond when the chicken immune system would normally begin to be functional. However, as the eggs were irradiated the chicken immune system could not form and the therapeutic effect could be accurately measured at much later time points. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-D</figref>, colorectal MSI-high tumors (CRC-MSI-High) responded to Keytruda/CAR-T treatment and showed a significant decrease in tumor size in vivo (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>) and when weighed after excision (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>). In contrast, colorectal MSI-low tumors (CRC-MSI-Low) did not respond to treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C-D</figref>). These results demonstrate the usefulness of the CAM model in studying various forms of immunotherapy, including combination therapies. Further, they point to the essential need for ablation of the chick immune system. Besides the potential for the burgeoning immune system to interfere with data collection, the use of transplanted immune cells in combination with cancer therapeutics (immunotherapies) pushes the window for data collection well beyond when the chicken immune system is fully functional. To properly model the effects of immunotherapies on personal tumor samples, the old CAM model is not sufficient, and the irradiated model is greatly preferred.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0198">Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
