Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. The embodiments disclosed in the following may be combined or substituted with each other in an advantageous situation, and other embodiments may be added in an embodiment without further description or explanation. In the following description, details will be given. The specific details are set forth to enable the reader to fully understand the following embodiments. However, the embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced without the specific details.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Some embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail below, but the present disclosure is not limited to the scope of the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a flow chart of a method <b>100</b> for estimating chemical oxygen demand of water according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The method <b>100</b> includes step <b>110</b>, step <b>120</b>, step <b>130</b>, step <b>140</b>, step <b>150</b>, and step <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At step <b>110</b>, a water sample is provided. It is understood that the water sample may include water bodies in any environmental system, such as domestic wastewater, industrial wastewater, agriculture wastewater, livestock wastewater, river water, sea water, rainwater, and the like. In one embodiment, a sample volume of the water sample ranges from 0.5 ml to 10 ml, such as 1 ml, 1.5 ml, 3 ml, 5 ml, or 8 ml. In one embodiment, the water sample may be transported to a test tube after the water sample is drawn up by using a micropipette. In one embodiment, the water sample may be centrifuged to separate impurities in the water sample, such that the water sample may have a clear and transparent appearance.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">At step <b>120</b>, an oxidant is added to the water sample. Specifically, the chemical oxygen demand is an index for measuring the organic compounds content in water. Since most organic compounds are reducing agent, and thus the organic compounds can be oxidized by an oxidant and then decomposed into compounds of smaller molecular weights. In one embodiment, the oxidant includes potassium dichromate. Potassium dichromate is a strong oxidant which is capable to oxidize a number of reducing substances, and the hexavalent chromium is reduced to the trivalent chromium state. Therefore potassium dichromate may oxidize the organic compounds in a water sample, and the hexavalent chromium of potassium dichromate is reduced to trivalent chromium. On the other hand, if there is no organic compound in a water sample or the organic compounds in the water sample have been completely consumed by potassium dichromate, the excess hexavalent chromium of the potassium dichromate will remain in the water sample. In one embodiment, potassium dichromate is an excess reagent with a concentration ranges from 0.01 M to 0.05 M, such as 0.025 M. In one embodiment, a volume of potassium dichromate ranges from 0.25 ml to 5 ml, such as 0.5 ml, 0.75 ml, 1.5 ml, 2.5 ml, or 4 ml. In one embodiment, a strong acid is added to the water sample. The strong acid may be such as a concentrated sulfuric acid solution which provides an acidic environment and thereby enhancing the oxidizing ability of the oxidant to the organic compounds in the water sample. A volume of the concentrated sulfuric acid solution may range from 0.5 ml to 10 ml, such as 1 ml, 1.5 ml, 3 ml, 5 ml, or 8 ml. In one embodiment, a sulfuric acid solution containing mercury(II) sulfate may be optionally added to the water sample. The sulfuric acid solution containing mercury(II) sulfate may have a concentration of 0.05 M and a volume ranges from about 0.5 ml to 10 ml, such as 1 ml, 1.5 ml, 3 ml, 5 ml, or 8 ml. The sulfuric acid solution containing mercury(II) sulfate may diminish the background interference which arise from the oxidation of chloride ions by potassium dichromate in the water sample.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">At step <b>130</b>, the water sample is heated. In one embodiment, the water sample is heated to 90&#xb0; C. to 110&#xb0; C., such as 95&#xb0; C., 98&#xb0; C., 100&#xb0; C., 102&#xb0; C., 105&#xb0; C., or 108&#xb0; C. If the heating temperature is lower than 90&#xb0; C., the reaction rate of the redox reaction between the oxidant and the organic compounds in the water sample may be low. If the heating temperature is higher than 110&#xb0; C., the volatilization of volatile organic compounds in the water sample may be promoted, such that the volatile organic compounds may evaporate from the water sample, causing errors in COD estimation. In one embodiment, the water sample is heated for 8 minutes to 15 minutes, such as 9 minutes, 11 minutes, 13 minutes, or 14 minutes. If the heating time is less than 8 minutes, the organic compounds in the water sample cannot be completely oxidized by the oxidant. If the heating time is greater than 15 minutes, the duration will be too long. In one embodiment, the water sample may be heated by a portable heater.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At step <b>140</b>, a reductant is added to the water sample. In one embodiment, the reductant includes an ammonium iron(II) sulfate solution. In one embodiment, a concentration of the ammonium iron(II) sulfate solution may range from 0.02 M to 0.2 M, such as 0.025 M or 0.125 M. In one embodiment, a volume of a solution of ammonium iron(II) sulfate may range from 0.15 ml to 3 ml, such as 0.3 ml, 0.45 ml, 0.9 ml, 1.5 ml, or 2.4 ml.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At step <b>150</b>, an indicator is added to the water sample, such that the water sample develops a color. In one embodiment, the indicator includes a ferrion indicator. In one embodiment, the ferrion indicator may be prepared by mixing 1,10-phenanthroline and iron(II) sulfate. In one embodiment, a ratio of the reductant to the indicator ranges from 4:1 to 2:1, more preferably is 3:1, such that the water sample may develop a visible color. In one embodiment, a volume of the ferrion indicator may range from 0.05 ml to 1 ml, such as 0.1 ml, 0.15 ml, 0.3 ml, 0.5 ml, or 0.8 ml.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Specifically, after the indicator is added to the water sample, the water sample may develop different colors depending on the chemical oxygen demand content of the water sample. For example, after adding the indicator to a water sample with a chemical oxygen demand of 50 mg/L, the water sample may develop a blue color. Similarly, a water sample with a chemical oxygen demand 75 mg/L, 100 mg/L, 125 mg/L, 150 mg/L, or 200 mg/L may develop a dark blue color, an indigo color, a brown color, an umber color, or an orange color respectively after the indicator is added thereto. Further, the correspondence between the color of the water sample and the chemical oxygen demand content of the water sample as provided in the present disclosure is unprecedented.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At step <b>160</b>, the color of the water sample is matched with a plurality of color components of the color chart in order to estimate the chemical oxygen demand of the water sample. Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a schematic view of a color chart <b>200</b> according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The color components of the color chart <b>200</b> include a blue component <b>210</b>, a dark blue component <b>220</b>, an indigo component <b>230</b>, a brown component <b>240</b>, an umber component <b>250</b>, and an orange component <b>260</b>. In one embodiment, the blue component <b>210</b> is specified as PANTONE 2387C and corresponds to a numeric sign &#x201c;50&#x201d;. In one embodiment, the dark blue component <b>220</b> is specified as PANTONE 288C and corresponds to a numeric sign &#x201c;75&#x201d;.

In one embodiment, the orange component <b>260</b> is specified as PANTONE 1788XGC and corresponds to a numeric sign &#x201c;200&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the COD estimation of a water sample is conducted on site, an operator can estimate the COD of the water sample readily by matching the color of the water sample with the color components of the color chart <b>200</b> and then read out the corresponding numeric sign of the color component. Therefore, the operator can obtain the estimation result of chemical oxygen demand in a short time.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, the color components of the color chart <b>200</b> in the present disclosure may allow the operator to perform color matching without much difficulty. Specifically, regarding the color components of the color chart <b>200</b>, the blue component, the dark blue component and the indigo component are a cool color, while the brown component, the umber component, and the orange component are a warm color. Therefore the visual difference between the cool color and warm color may allow the operator to match the color readily with the naked eye.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is understood that the method <b>100</b> of the present disclosure is a rapid-screening method, and therefore the COD test result is an interval instead of an exact value.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present disclosure also provides a test kit of estimating chemical oxygen demand of water.
