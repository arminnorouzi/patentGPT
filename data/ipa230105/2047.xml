During flight, the position of the aircraft relative to the desired landing area aids in successfully landing the aircraft. Furthermore, understanding an approach vector during a landing attempt may further aid in safely landing the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While aircraft generally have a plurality of instrumentation available to aid pilots and operators of the aircraft to safely maneuver the aircraft during flight, there may be limited instrumentation to aid in landing in other scenarios. There may be limited aid from instrumentation when a position is unknown, there is decreased visibility from a control position of the aircraft, and/or other issues in determining a position of an aircraft are apparent. As an example, limited visibility may result in a pilot misidentifying a runway or landing area. Furthermore, limited visibility may result in an airport runway obstruction going unnoticed by a pilot or support crew. Moreover, other conditions may result in misidentification of a landing area or landing in dangerous conditions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current systems require complicated radar systems, global positioning systems (GPS), and communication methodologies in an attempt to avoid these and other potential issues. Many of these systems are dependent on resources external to the aircraft and communication with the aircraft, making them subject to loss of utility if communication with a pilot is lost. Additionally, many GPS-based systems will not provide any helpful information with regards to obstructions, unsafe landing conditions, or misidentification of a runway if a general position (based on GPS) is correct.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects and advantages of the disclosed technology will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one example embodiment, an aerial vehicle is provided.

Each example is provided by way of explanation of the disclosed technology, not limitation of the disclosed technology. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present disclosure without departing from the scope or spirit of the claims. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of example embodiments can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present disclosure covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The use of the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; in conjunction with a numerical value refers to within 25% of the stated amount.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In example aspects, a machine vision controller for an aerial vehicle or aircraft is provided. In some embodiments, the machine vision controller may execute computer-readable program instructions for: processing sensor data, identifying geographic identifiers in sensor data, comparing obtained sensor data to desired sensor data, identifying geographic location from sensor data, automatically maneuvering the aerial vehicle responsive to sensor data and other data, determining if an approach vector is safe for landing, reducing risk associated with instrumentation-only landings, and/or other program instructions. The machine vision controller may be integrated within an aerial vehicle or may be a remote controller configured to transmit calculated data to the aerial vehicle. Additionally, the machine vision controller may also be configured to provide warnings, both audial and visual, to operators of the aerial vehicle, to aid in a plurality of aircraft maneuvers. Hereinafter, a detailed description of several example embodiments of aerial vehicles and machine vision controllers are provided in detail.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the disclosed technology provide a number of technical benefits and advantages, particularly in the area of aircraft safety. As one example, the disclosed technology provides for safer landings by ensuring an aerial vehicle is approaching an appropriate runway or airport. The disclosed technology can also aid in automatic avoidance maneuvers through identifying geographic indicators. By identifying geographic indicators and matching geographic indicators to a map or model of an expected proximal area, the disclosed systems can avoid initiating a landing operation if an area is unexpected or if obstacles exist.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the disclosed technology additionally provide a number of technical benefits and advantages in the area of computing technology. For example, the disclosed system can obtain sensor data associated with performance data of an aerial vehicle and automatically determine whether performance of an aircraft is affecting a landing approach. A computing system implemented in accordance with the disclosed technology can therefore avoid costly landing maneuvers in adverse conditions or implement safer landing procedures through assuring an actual approach vector is correct for a particular aerial vehicle.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of an example landing area <b>2</b> for an aerial vehicle. Generally, the landing area <b>2</b> can be aligned with a runway <b>4</b>. The runway <b>4</b> may include several identifying markers painted thereon, including several indicia. For example, the runway <b>4</b> can include runway threshold markings <b>6</b>, runway designation markings <b>8</b>, runway aiming point markings <b>10</b>, runway touchdown zone markings <b>12</b>, runway centerline markings <b>14</b>, runway side stripe markings <b>16</b>, runway lighting <b>18</b>, taxiway markings including taxiway centerline <b>20</b>, taxiway edge marking <b>22</b>, taxiway lighting <b>24</b>, holding position markings <b>26</b>, holding position sign <b>28</b>, and holding position sign <b>30</b>. The identifying markers and indicia may be processed by the machine vision controllers described herein, to aid in both taxying an aerial vehicle prior to takeoff and safely landing an aerial vehicle during/subsequent to a landing approach.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some circumstances, for example during relatively poor weather or with limited visibility, an aerial vehicle may not have full visibility of some or all of the identifying markers outlined above. In these circumstances, it may be beneficial for an aerial vehicle to obtain sensor data, such as optical data, video data, photograph data, radar data, and/or Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data. The sensor data can subsequently be processed to determine if an aerial vehicle can safely land or if an avoidance maneuver is appropriate. Additionally, under some circumstances, the sensor data can be compared to a map or model of a proximal area near the aircraft. Upon comparing, geographic indicators including buildings, landmarks, topographical features, runways, runway markings, and other geographic indicators can be identified to determine that the aerial vehicle is operating or attempting to land in a safe or expected area. Hereinafter, scenarios involving an aerial vehicle approaching the runway <b>4</b> are described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic illustration of an aerial vehicle <b>200</b> approaching a portion <b>215</b> of the landing area of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, taxiway <b>40</b> and taxiway <b>42</b> with geographic position markings <b>44</b> including a direction sign <b>46</b> and a location sign <b>48</b> are presented on the portion <b>215</b>. Furthermore, the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> is approaching the portion <b>215</b> at approach vector <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">During the approach, the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> may obtain a variety of sensor data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a schematic illustration of example sensor data <b>210</b> obtained by the aerial vehicle <b>200</b>. As illustrated, the direct approach vector <b>202</b> allows the sensor data <b>210</b> to appear relatively undistorted. In this example, a machine vision controller associated with the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> can process the sensor data <b>210</b> to determine that a direction indicator <b>46</b> and position markings <b>44</b> are appropriately located relative to the aerial vehicle <b>200</b>. In some implementations, the machine vision controller may generate one or more displays for a pilot or other operator providing the direction indicator <b>46</b>, position markings <b>44</b>, and/or a representation of any other geographic indicator.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The machine vision controller may utilize various image processing and/or machine vision processing techniques to identify objects using image data. Physics-based modeling and/or machine learned models may be used for object detection. Objects may be detected and classified using various image and/or machine vision processing techniques.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> can safely continue its approach and complete landing maneuvers. However, if the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> and associated machine vision controller determine that the approach vector <b>202</b> is inappropriate or misaligned, the machine vision controller associated with the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> can provide warnings, indications, and other data to a pilot or operator to ensure the pilot is aware of the situational position and approach of the aerial vehicle <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Under some circumstances, the warnings may be used to determine that a landing cannot continue due to obstructions, misaligned vectors, incorrect geographical areas, or other misinformation. Accordingly, the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> may be equipped to efficiently correct the misinformation, alter a flight plan, and/or avoid a landing to ensure the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> lands at a correct geographic location, safely. Under other circumstances, typical machine vision processing of the sensor data <b>210</b> may be inappropriate due to a variety of issues, such as weather or approach vectors differing from the thrust vector of an aerial vehicle.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some implementations, aircraft performance data may be used to selectively trigger alerts or displays that are generated based on the sensor data such as image data. By way of example, the machine vision controller may obtain altitude and/or aircraft configuration data from the performance data and use this information to selectively generate geographic based alerts. By way of example, the machine vision controller may determine from the performance data whether the aircraft is below a certain altitude and/or whether the aircraft landing gear is down. If the performance data indicates that the aircraft is attempting a landing, displays may be generated based on the geographic indicators. For example, runway markers and other identifiers may be displayed if the performance data indicates that the aircraft is landing. If, however, the performance data indicates that the aircraft is not attempting a landing, alerts or displays that would otherwise be generated in response to geographic indicators may not be displayed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a schematic illustration of aerial vehicle <b>200</b> approaching the portion <b>215</b> of the landing area of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As illustrated, the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> has a thrust vector <b>302</b> in an attempt to correct for crosswind <b>306</b> that is flowing perpendicular to the portion <b>215</b> of the landing area of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Thus, while the thrust vector <b>302</b> is generally directed away from the landing area <b>215</b>, the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> is actually on an approach vector <b>304</b>. Due to the direction of the aerial vehicle being out of perfect alignment with the landing area <b>215</b>, sensor data obtained by the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> may be distorted or difficult to process.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a schematic illustration of example sensor data <b>310</b> obtained by the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> on thrust vector <b>302</b>. As shown, due to the thrust vector <b>302</b>, and therefore the axial alignment of the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> not aligning with the portion <b>215</b> of the landing area, the sensor data <b>310</b> appears to point towards a different landing area as compared to sensor data <b>210</b>. In this scenario, a machine vision controller associated with the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> can process the sensor data <b>310</b> to compensate for movement and/or performance data of the aerial vehicle <b>200</b>. For example, the machine vison controller can determine a crosswind value <b>306</b> and performance data including the thrust vector <b>302</b>. The machine vision controller can also estimate the approach vector <b>304</b> based on the crosswind value <b>306</b> and the performance data. Thereafter, the machine vision controller can translate the sensor data <b>310</b> into <b>320</b> based on the approach vector <b>304</b>. Therefore, the machine vision controller can correct the apparent misalignment or distortion based on the thrust vector <b>302</b>, approach vector <b>304</b>, and crosswind <b>306</b>, resulting in sensor data <b>320</b>. Sensor data <b>320</b> is sufficiently similar to sensor data <b>210</b> and allows for successful identification of the portion <b>215</b>, including all visual markers illustrated thereon. Additionally, under some circumstances, the sensor data <b>320</b> can be compared to a map or model of a proximal area near the aerial vehicle <b>200</b>. The map or model can include a two-dimensional mapping of information with associated height, depth, or other dimensional information, for example, of surrounding buildings and landmarks. Upon comparing, geographic indicators including buildings, landmarks, topographical features, runways, runway markings, and other geographic indicators can be identified to determine that the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> is operating or attempting to land in a safe or expected area.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As described above, aerial vehicle <b>200</b> may include a machine vision controller configured to process sensor data, identify geographic identifiers in sensor data, compare obtained sensor data to desired sensor data, identify geographic location from sensor data, automatically maneuver the aerial vehicle responsive to sensor data and other data, determine if an approach vector is safe for landing, and/or reduce risk associated with instrumentation-only landings. Furthermore, under some circumstances, the machine vision controller can predict a flight path of the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> based on processing the sensor data. Flight path prediction may include an estimated or predicted flight path based on any of a thrust vector, crosswind, axial alignment based on a ground plane reference, instrumentation values, and other aerial vehicle performance data. The machine vision controller may be integrated within the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> or may be a remote controller configured to transmit calculated data to the aerial vehicle. The machine vision controller may also be configured to provide warnings, both audial and visual, to operators of the aerial vehicle, to aid in a plurality of aircraft maneuvers.

It should be understood that the operations of the methods disclosed herein are not necessarily presented in any particular order and that performance of some or all of the operations in an alternative order(s) is possible and is contemplated. The operations have been presented in the demonstrated order for ease of description and illustration. Operations may be added, omitted, and/or performed simultaneously, without departing from the scope of the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, the operations of the methods <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> are described herein as being implemented, at least in part, by system components such as controller <b>402</b>, which can comprise a processor, control application, machine vision circuitry, machine vision components and/or machine vision applications. In some configurations, the system components include functionality produced by an application programing interface (API), a compiled program, an interpreted program, a network service, a script, or any other executable set of instructions.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although the following illustration refers to the components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, it can be appreciated that the operations of the methods <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> may be also implemented in many other ways. For example, the methods <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> may be implemented, at least in part, by a processor of a remote controller or a local circuit, including a remote pilot control center for controlling an unmanned aerial vehicle. In addition, one or more of the operations of the methods <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> may alternatively or additionally be implemented, at least in part, by a chipset working alone or in conjunction with software modules on board the aerial vehicle <b>200</b>. Any service, circuit, or application suitable for providing the techniques disclosed herein can be used in operations described herein, either remote to, onboard, or a combination thereof with respect to the aerial vehicle <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the method <b>500</b> includes obtaining sensor data from a sensor array <b>404</b> or <b>406</b>, at block <b>502</b>. The sensor data can include, for example, optical data or radar data obtained from at least one sensor of the sensor arrays <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>. Optical sensor data can also be obtained, and can include stereoscopic images, still images, or video recorded from an optical sensor of the sensor arrays <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>. Other sensor data can include altitude, distance from ground, and other suitable data.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The method <b>500</b> further includes obtaining performance data from avionics <b>412</b> and/or sensor array <b>404</b> or <b>406</b>, at block <b>504</b>. The performance data can include, for example, a calculated approach vector, a thrust vector, rate of ascent, rate of descent, angle relative to a ground plane, and other suitable performance data. In at least one example, the performance data is obtained from sensors and/or avionics system <b>412</b>. The performance data may be obtained directly from sensors and/or avionics system <b>412</b> or may be derived from sensor data obtained from the sensors. According to other examples, the performance data is input manually. Still according to other examples, the performance data may be based on positions of control surfaces and engine status provided by avionics <b>412</b> or other components of the aerial vehicle <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The method <b>500</b> further includes processing the sensor data based on the performance data, at block <b>506</b>. In some examples, block <b>506</b> may include processing the sensor data to compensate for the performance data. In some examples, the sensor data is processed with a machine vision controller using machine vision and/or image processing techniques. In some examples, the sensor data is processed to compensate for movement of the aerial vehicle as determined from the performance data. According to at least one example, the processing can include processing a distorted image using machine vision to create an image with reduced, minimized, or corrected distortion. The corrected image may include legible indicia and other corrections. The processing can also include processing to compensate for movement, such as by, for example, correcting perspectives of buildings, landmarks, and other features. Additionally, the processing can include isolating landmarks, indicia, geographic features, and other optical data for further identification in subsequent or parallel machine vision processing. For example, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the sensor data <b>310</b> can be processed to create corrected sensor data <b>320</b>. The machine vision controller <b>402</b> may process the sensor data <b>310</b> to correct apparent distortion, misalignments, and other issues using the performance data and any other available data.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The method <b>500</b> further includes identifying a geographic indicator in the processed sensor data, at block <b>508</b>. For example, the machine vision controller <b>402</b> can interpret the processed sensor data to identify visual indicators such as those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Other geographic indicators can include, for example, a number of buildings surrounding a landing area, height of buildings surrounding a landing area, surrounding higher elevation (such as mountains or natural features), surrounding lower elevation (such as crevasses or natural features), and other geographic indicators. Still further, geographic indicators can include GPS data, rivers, bodies of water, physical or virtual beacons, temporary structures such as towers/cones, and other indicators.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The method <b>500</b> further includes determining a geographic location of the aerial vehicle based on the identified geographic indicator, at block <b>510</b>. The machine vision controller <b>402</b> can compare the identified geographic indicators to a predetermined set of geographic indicators, such as expected geographic features or a map or model of expected features, to determine a location of the aerial vehicle <b>200</b>. For example, the machine vision controller <b>402</b> can determine if an expected control tower at an airport is detectable in the sensor data. The machine vision controller <b>402</b> can also determine if airport buildings are detectable in the sensor data. Thus, using all available sensor data, the machine vision controller <b>402</b> can compare the sensor data to expected data from a flight plan to determine the geographic location.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some example aspects, a model of expected features may include depth or height information. Accordingly, in some examples the machine vision controller <b>402</b> is configured to determine a height of geographic features in a proximal location to the aerial vehicle based on processing the sensor data. For example, the machine vision controller <b>402</b> can access one or more images obtained by one or more image sensors to identify one or more geographic features. A depth camera, radar/LIDAR, and/or other sensors may be used to determine three-dimensional or height information associated with the geographic features. The machine vision controller <b>402</b> can access a database of predetermined geographic indicators associated with a geographic location such as known landing locations. The database can include height or other depth information associated with the predetermined geographic indicators. The machine vision controller <b>402</b> can compare the database, including the height of geographic indicators, in order to identify geographic features based on the image data. The machine vision controller <b>402</b> can determine a corresponding geographic location to a geographic feature based on comparing the height of geographic features from the sensor data to height information in the database.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Utilizing the determined geographic location, a pilot or operator of the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> can decide whether to safely land the aerial vehicle, alter a flight plan, or otherwise control the aerial vehicle. It is contemplated that visual indicators such as warnings and audio indicators such as alarms can also be used. For example, an indicator such as a visual indicator that landing can be performed safely or not safely can be provided. In some implementations, the indicator may identify a runway or other feature with which the aerial vehicle is aligned for landing. In some implementations, an indicator may include a warning that the aerial vehicle is misaligned. For example, the system may compare the geographic indicator with flight plan data and provide a warning if the geographic indicator is not associated with the flight plan data. In some examples, a warning can be provided if geographic indicators include obstructions identified in machine vision processing. Furthermore, visual and audio indicators can include positive indications that a landing pattern is deemed safe by the machine vision controller <b>402</b> such that the pilot or operator can concentrate on other maneuvers to complete a safe landing.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally, the pilot or operator of the aerial vehicle <b>200</b> may be remote, and the aerial vehicle may be an unmanned aerial vehicle, such that alerts, indicators, and geographic location are provided to the pilot or operator in a remote location. In these circumstances, the identified geographic location may be used to automatically maneuver the aircraft, as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. It is noted, however, that a manned aircraft may be automatically maneuvered in accordance with embodiments of the disclosed technology. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow diagram of an additional method <b>600</b> of machine vision processing of sensor data of an aerial vehicle, according to example embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the method <b>600</b> includes obtaining sensor data from a sensor array <b>404</b> or <b>406</b>, at block <b>602</b>. The sensor data may be substantially similar to the sensor data described above. The method <b>600</b> further includes processing the obtained sensor data to identify geographic features in the area proximal to the aerial vehicle, at block <b>604</b>. The processing may include correcting distortion, compensating for movement, identifying obstacles, and/or matching flight plans to expected geographic features.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to at least one example, the processing can include processing a distorted image, or distorted sensor data, using machine vision to create a processed image or processed sensor data with reduced, minimized, or corrected distortion. The processed image may include legible indicia and other corrections. The processing can also include processing to compensate for movement, such as by, for example, correcting perspectives of buildings, landmarks, and other features. Additionally, the processing can include isolating landmarks, indicia, geographic features, and other optical data for further identification in subsequent or parallel machine vision processing.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some examples, processing the sensor data includes processing image data based on aircraft misalignment. For example, performance data such as crosswind and other information can be used to determine a misalignment of an aircraft approach vector with the image data obtained from one or more sensors. The performance data can be used to translate or otherwise determine modified sensor data to correct or compensate for the misalignment. For example, when approaching a landing area the image data may identify a first runway according to a first runway marker for example. However, the performance data may indicate that the aerial vehicle is landing in a strong crosswind. This and/or other performance data may indicate that the aerial vehicle is misaligned with its approach vector. This information may be used to modify the sensor data to indicate the appropriate information corresponding with the approach. As a result, the machine vision controller <b>402</b> may determine that the aircraft is actually approaching a second runway adjacent to the first runway. The determination may be made even though the image data corresponds to the first runway.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The method <b>600</b> further includes identifying a geographic indicator in the processed sensor data, at block <b>606</b>. The geographic indicator may include a desired indicator or an obstacle. For example, the geographic indicator may include a landmark, body of water, airport, particular runway at an airport, or other geographic indicator, including all geographic indicators described herein. Using machine vision processing and/or a machine vision algorithm, the geographic indicator can be identified in the processed sensor data. Additionally, the machine vision controller can identify obstacles at block <b>606</b>. For example, an obstacle can include any object or indicia that is not expected in a landing area. Obstacles can include temporary or permanent obstacles. Obstacles can further include indicia purposefully marked (e.g., such as an &#x2018;X&#x2019; or &#x2018;NOT SAFE FOR LANDING&#x2019;) to allow pilots and operators to identify that a landing area is not to be used for landings. In some examples, the machine vision controller <b>402</b> can immediately indicate the presence of an obstacle. In some examples, the machine vision controller <b>402</b> can delay an alert if an obstacle is a moving obstacle, such as a landing assist vehicle, that will be clear of an active landing area prior to landing by the aerial vehicle. Furthermore, the machine vision controller <b>402</b> can issues multiple forms of soft alerts and high alerts if moving obstacles are deemed hazardous or are not moving as expected, or are not following an expected pattern. Processing and identifying obstacles can be aided through use of radar/LIDAR information, and other suitable data available from sensors.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The method <b>600</b> further includes determining if the identified geographic indicator is in a flight plan associated with the aerial vehicle, at block <b>608</b>. For example, the machine vision controller <b>402</b> may process the sensor data and compare the same to expected sensor data of the flight plan. The expected sensor data may include maps, models, renderings, and/or other suitable data for machine vision processing and comparison to the processed sensor data. The expected sensor data can include, for example, a two-dimensional map having associated height or dimensional information. Machine vision processing can facilitate comparisons between the processed sensor data and this expected sensor data to determine if a match exists or if the geographic indicator exists within the flight plan.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The method <b>600</b> further includes automatically maneuvering the aerial vehicle, or providing visual indication, based on the determination, at block <b>610</b>. For example, the aerial vehicle, based on the determination, may be automatically maneuvered to avoid a landing or continue flying. Other automatic maneuvers including obstacle avoidance, fast touchdown and takeoff, and similar maneuvers based on geographical indicators are also applicable. The machine vision controller <b>402</b> can also provide video or audio indications, as described above.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">It should be appreciated that the operational blocks of method <b>500</b> and method <b>600</b> may not exhaustively describe all aspects of aerial vehicle control.
