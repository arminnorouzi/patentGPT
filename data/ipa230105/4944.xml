More specifically, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for facilitating generation of a carbon offset based on processing of a recyclable item.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recycling is an effective action to restrict greenhouse gas emissions by removing the requirement to bury or incinerate waste. This leads to a reduction in nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, recycling avoids energy-intensive manufacturing steps including processing of raw material and allowing processing of material for less energy.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Existing techniques for facilitating generation of a carbon offset based on processing of a recyclable item are deficient with regard to several aspects. For instance, current technologies do not allow for maintaining of a transparent ledger of accounting for recycling activity, utilizing sensors to gauge quality and quantity of the recyclable item, and aligning objectives of stakeholders like governments, hauling companies, Material Recovery Facilities, businesses, and individuals involved in the recycling process of the recyclable item. Further, current technologies do not allow for scanning of a product bar code of the recyclable item to derive product information of the recyclable item and writing it on to a distributed ledger.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need for improved systems and methods for facilitating generation of a carbon offset based on processing of a recyclable item that may overcome one or more of the above-mentioned problems and/or limitations.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form, that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

Further, the present disclosure may seek to record the carbon offset that may be generated by recycling a product and measuring the distance that a material/product has traveled, from a point of pickup to the point at which it is processed and recycled into a new raw material, and storing that value in a transaction that will be recorded on Blockchain.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, the present disclosure may involve:</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Calculating Distance: Further, the disclosed system may record the GPS coordinates and address, of each pickup that occurs. Further, the disclosed system may record multiple GPS coordinates of the vehicle used to transport the material as it travels between recorded pickup and drop off locations. Further, the system may calculate the distance of the path traveled to the destination drop off-site and also tracks the type of vehicle used to transport the material. Further, the system may calculate the amount of the carbon footprint or carbon generated during the transportation of the material. The values, all of which may be also written on the Blockchain. Further, the values may include weight, volume, material type, product type, vehicle type, fuel type, fuel efficiency (MpG), distance, pickup location, drop off location, topography, and climate. Further, the values may then be used to calculate the Net Carbon Value generated. Further, the Net Carbon Value may be netted against the carbon offset produced by recycling the material. If the Net value is negative, as in a surplus of carbon offset, then the system may determine that in the total activity of recycling the materials/product, a Carbon Offset is generated.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Recommending Optimal Route: Further, the disclosed system may include more Processors Facilities, MRFs (Material Recovery Facilities), and Manufacturer location. Further, the disclosed system may be able to preemptively recommend the shortest transportation path for materials to maximize Carbon Offset produced by reducing the distance traveled. By rewarding the stakeholders in recycling chain with tokens whose value represent their contribution to the carbon offset produced, the disclosed system may create an incentivization system that may encourage the actors in the recycling value chain to want to create the most direct recycling supply chains as this may increase the yield in carbon offset generated by recycling.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example: If a stakeholder scans a Barcode of a Coca-Cola Can or any other product, the system may immediately determine the weight of the product and the material that was used to make it (e.g. PET or aluminum). If the system were to have a database with a list of all product details (much like a supermarket has), then the system may use that database to figure out how much of a carbon footprint in terms of weight and material type the product has. By recycling the product the system may derive the net value of CO<sub>2</sub>e that is offset. (please refer to a table <b>1200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). By recycling the product using the most efficient supply chain (limited processing across a shorter distance of transportation), the offset will be less affected by the carbon value associated with the transportation and processing of that product.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of an online platform <b>100</b> consistent with various embodiments of the present disclosure.
