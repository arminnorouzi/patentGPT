Moreover, the present invention relates to a downhole completion system.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Annular barriers are used downhole for providing isolation of one zone from another in an annulus in a borehole of a well between a well tubular metal structure and the borehole wall or another well tubular metal structure. When the annular barrier has been set, e.g. when an expandable metal sleeve has been expanded, the temperature may vary. Thus, the well tubular metal structure with annular barriers will increase in length if the temperature increases, and likewise the length of the well tubular metal structure will decrease if the temperature decreases, e.g. the temperature will decrease during fracturing with sea water. During such length variations, the axial load on the expandable metal sleeve will vary, and tests have shown that the annular barriers cannot withstand a high axial load when the differential pressure across the expandable metal sleeve is low, i.e. when the pressure inside the annular barrier is low compared to the pressure in the annulus.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is an object of the present invention to wholly or partly overcome the above disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art. More specifically, it is an object to provide an improved annular barrier able to withstand a higher axial load than known annular barriers when the differential pressure across the expandable metal sleeve of the annular barrier is low.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above objects, together with numerous other objects, advantages and features, which will become evident from the below description, are accomplished by a solution in accordance with the present invention by an annular barrier for providing zonal isolation in an annulus downhole between a well tubular metal structure and another well tubular metal structure or a wall of a borehole, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">a tubular metal part configured to be mounted as part of the well tubular metal structure, the tubular metal part having an outer face, an opening and an axial extension along the well tubular metal structure, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">an expandable metal sleeve surrounding the tubular metal part, the first expandable metal sleeve having a circumferential groove, a first end and a second end, each end of the expandable metal sleeve being connected with the outer face of the tubular metal part,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0006" num="0007">wherein the annular barrier further comprises an anchoring element arranged in the circumferential groove, the anchoring element comprising a first anchoring part at least partly overlapping a second anchoring part in a radial direction perpendicular to the axial extension so that an inner face of the first anchoring part at least partly abuts an outer face of the second anchoring part.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0008">In addition, the anchoring element may be a circumferential anchoring element.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0009">Moreover, the inner face of the first anchoring part and the outer face of the second anchoring part may be inclined in relation to the axial extension.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">By having the inner face of the first anchoring part and the outer face of the second anchoring part inclined in relation to the axial extension, it is obtained that when at least part of the expandable metal sleeve moves in one direction along the axial direction, the first anchoring part moves in an opposite direction along the inclined outer face of the second anchoring part, and the first anchoring part is then forced radially outwards, anchoring the expandable metal sleeve even further to another well tubular metal structure or the wall of the borehole.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0011">Furthermore, the first anchoring part and the second anchoring part may be one monolithic whole.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">Additionally, the first anchoring part and the second anchoring part may be one monolithic whole, the first anchoring part and the second anchoring part forming a key ring where the first anchoring part is one end of the key ring, and the second anchoring part is the other end of the key ring.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">Also, the first anchoring part may form one monolithic whole, the second anchoring part forming a second monolithic whole.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">Further, the first anchoring part may be shaped as a first slit ring, the second anchoring part being shaped as a second slit ring. Thus, the first anchoring part may comprise slits.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">In addition, the anchoring element may further comprise a fixation unit being arranged in the groove of the first anchoring part.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">Furthermore, the fixation unit may comprise a ring-shaped part extending all the way around the expandable metal sleeve, each end of the ring-shaped part being connected with a breakable element.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">Additionally, the ring-shaped part may be a sealing element where each end of the sealing element is connected in at least one connection part.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">Moreover, the breakable element may be a pin extending through the at least one connection part and into the first anchoring part.</p><p id="p-0018"

part may comprise two grooves into which a sealing element is arranged in one of the grooves, and a fixation element is arranged in the other groove.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">Also, the first anchoring part may comprise at least one groove having a trapeze cross-sectional shape along the axial extension.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">Additionally, the groove may have a first length along the axial extension, and the first anchoring part may have a second length along the axial extension, where the first length is at least 10% of the second length, and preferably at least 20% of the second length.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">Moreover, the annular barrier may further comprise a connection element arranged between the tubular metal part and the expandable metal sleeve, and the connection element may be connected with the tubular metal part and the expandable metal sleeve.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024">In addition, the expandable metal sleeve may be divided into at least two parts, and each part may be connected to the connection element.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025">Further, the connection element may be arranged opposite the circumferential groove.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026">Moreover, the first anchoring part may further comprise an outer face, the second anchoring part comprising an inner face, and the outer face of the first anchoring part comprising friction-enhancing means and facing another well tubular metal structure or the wall of the borehole.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027">In addition, the friction-enhancing means may be spikes or grooves.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028">Also, the outer face of the first anchoring part may have at least one groove in which a spring element or a sealing element is arranged.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">Furthermore, the inner face of the second anchoring part may have at least one groove in which a spring element or a sealing element is arranged.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0030">Additionally, the inner face of the first anchoring part and the outer face of the second anchoring part may have lower friction between them than that between the inner face of the second anchoring part and the circumferential groove.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031">Moreover, the inner face of the second anchoring part may have at least one groove in which a spring element or a sealing element is arranged.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032">Also, the sealing element may be ring-shaped with a trapeze cross-sectional shape.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033">In addition, the anchoring element may comprise a third anchoring part having an outer face abutting a second inner face of the first anchoring part, so that the first anchoring part is arranged between the third anchoring part and the second anchoring part, and the inner face of the third anchoring part and the inner face of the second anchoring part face and abut the circumferential groove.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0034">Further, the outer face of the third anchoring part may be inclined in an opposite direction, i.e. a direction opposite to that of the outer face of the second anchoring part.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035">Also, the second inner face of the first anchoring part may be inclined, thus corresponding to the inclined outer face of the third anchoring part.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036">According to the present invention, the annular barrier may further comprise a second anchoring element comprising a first anchoring part at least partly overlapping a second anchoring part in a radial direction perpendicular to the axial extension so that an inner face of the first anchoring part at least partly abuts an outer face of the second anchoring part, the inner face of the first anchoring part and the outer face of the second anchoring part being inclined in relation to the axial extension in an opposite direction, i.e. a direction opposite to that of the first anchoring element.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037">Thus, the inner face of the first anchoring part of the first anchoring element may be inclined facing upwards towards the top of the well, the inner face of the first anchoring part of the second anchoring element being inclined facing downwards away from the top of the well. By having a first anchoring element with an inclined inner face of the first anchoring part in one direction and a second anchoring element with an inclined face of the first anchoring part in an opposite direction, the annular barrier can withstand axial loads in both directions along the axial extension as the first anchoring element is activated when the axial load is in one direction, and the second anchoring element is activated when the axial load pulls in the opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038">Furthermore, the first anchoring element and the second anchoring element may be arranged in the same circumferential groove.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039">Also, the expandable metal sleeve may have a second circumferential groove in which a sealing unit is arranged.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040">Additionally, the sealing unit may comprise a sealing element made of e.g. elastomer.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">Moreover, the sealing unit may further comprise a back-up ring-shaped element and a key ring element.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">Furthermore, the expandable metal sleeve may comprise at least two sealing units, the anchoring element being arranged between two sealing units.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">Finally, the present invention also relates to a downhole completion system comprising an annular barrier and a well tubular metal structure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p
