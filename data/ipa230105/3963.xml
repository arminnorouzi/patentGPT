Microscope objectives include arrangements of optical elements that focus light from a sample onto an image sensor to facilitate image acquisition. Optical elements of microscope objectives are carefully selected and manufactured to balance out optical aberrations that might otherwise cause distortion and/or blurring in captured images. However, microscope objectives are often used to image samples under various conditions, which can upset the balance of the optical elements of microscope objectives. For example, different specimens, immersion media, and/or cover glass used in microscopy can cause changes in refractive index, which may introduce distortions and/or blurring into captured images. For instance, light rays coming from the periphery of the objective aperture approach the focus at a larger angle than light rays coming from the center of the objective. Thus, light rays coming from the periphery of the objective aperture experience greater refraction than light rays coming from the center of the objective. This causes spherical aberration, in the central and peripheral light rays have different focus positions. Spherical aberrations can result in lower resolution and/or lower fluorescence intensity in microscope images.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some microscope objectives have emerged that attempt to compensate for spherical aberrations (and/or other types of aberrations) by including adjustable correction collars, which change the relative positioning of the optical elements of microscope objectives to realign the focus points of light rays (e.g., such adjustments may compensate for different substrate thicknesses and/or materials).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some correction collars are manually operated by users. However, manual correction collars are cumbersome to operate, particularly because the amount of aberration can change with focus depth. Thus, a user may need to readjust the correction collar as the focal point moves deeper into a sample.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some microscope objectives include automated correction collars. However, such correction collars are often bulky and include an electromechanical enclosure that surrounds the optical elements of the objective. Thus, conventional automated correction collars often transfer heat to the optical elements of the objective, which can cause focus drift that negatively affects imaging. Conventional automated correction collars also often prevent manual access to the lenses. Furthermore, under conventional approaches, each microscope objective that includes its own automated correction collar also includes its own motor, which results in inefficiency and high cost for manufacturers and consumers alike.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is an ongoing need and desire for improved motorized correction collar adjustment systems for microscope objectives.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above.

The disclosed embodiments may facilitate various advantages over conventional techniques for facilitating adjustment of objective lens correction collars. For example, implementations of the present disclosure provide a motor for adjusting an objective lens correction collar that that does not share an enclosure with the objective lens itself. Accordingly, techniques of the present disclosure substantially avoid significant heat transfer between the motor and the lens elements of the objective lens. Furthermore, implementations of the present disclosure provide an adjust mechanism for adjusting a correction collar that can be used to adjust multiple different objective lens correction collars, thereby facilitating gains in cost efficiency and operational efficiency over existing system. Still furthermore, by substantially eliminating the need for multiple correction collar adjustment motors in a microscope system that includes a set of multiple objective lenses, the number of wires extending toward a set of objective lenses may be reduced, thereby reducing clutter and reducing the number of points of system wear.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Attention will now be directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>10</b></figref>, which provide various supporting illustrations related to the disclosed embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Example Systems and Techniques for Motorized Adjustment of Objective Lens Correction Collars</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a top view of example components of a system for motorized adjustment of an objective lens correction collar.

As noted above, the correction collar <b>104</b> is adjustable (e.g., rotatable) to change the relative positioning of the optical elements of the objective lens <b>102</b>. However, manual adjustment of the correction collar <b>104</b> is cumbersome and inefficient, as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a gear ring <b>106</b> affixed to the objective lens <b>102</b> about the correction collar <b>104</b> thereof. The gear ring <b>106</b> is configured to interface with an adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> to facilitate motorized and/or automated adjustment of the gear ring <b>106</b>, thereby motorizing and/or automating adjustment of the correction collar <b>104</b> about which the gear ring <b>106</b> is fit. The adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> comprises a motor that is operably connected to a worm gear <b>112</b> that complements the teeth of the gear ring <b>106</b>. When the worm gear <b>112</b> is moved into engagement with the gear ring <b>106</b> (or when the objective lens <b>102</b> with the gear ring <b>106</b> is moved into engagement with the worm gear <b>112</b>), the motor <b>110</b> may rotate the worm gear <b>112</b>, thereby causing rotation of the gear ring <b>106</b> and the correction collar <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although the worm gear <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is depicted as a non-enveloping worm gear (e.g., with a slope of 2 mm/revolution), other types and/or configurations of worm gears may be utilized in accordance with the present disclosure (e.g., globoid worm gears). Indeed, although the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> of the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> comprises a worm drive that includes the worm gear <b>112</b>, other types of adjustment mechanisms that include elements that complement the gear ring <b>106</b> may be utilized in accordance with the present disclosure. For example, an adjustment mechanism for rotating a gear ring <b>106</b> may comprise an intermeshing gear that forms a gear train with the gear ring <b>106</b> when the intermeshing gear is moved into engagement with the gear ring <b>106</b>. For example, the intermeshing gear may comprise teeth that are sized, shaped, and angled to mate with teeth of the gear ring <b>106</b> to form an interlocking fit.

The Z drive <b>114</b> is operable to move the objective lens <b>102</b> in the z direction into a correction collar adjustment position, wherein the gear ring <b>106</b> engages the worm gear <b>112</b> such that actuation of the worm gear <b>112</b> causes rotation of the gear ring <b>106</b> and associated correction collar of the objective lens <b>102</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> illustrates that, in some implementations, the worm gear <b>112</b> of the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> is arranged (e.g., tilted or rotated by the slope of the worm thread) such that the gear teeth of the worm gear <b>112</b> and the gear teeth of the gear ring <b>106</b> are parallel to one another, which may allow for easier engagement of the worm gear <b>112</b> with the gear ring <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The functionality demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref> allows the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> to adjust the correction collar of the objective lens <b>102</b> in a manner that substantially avoids significant heat transfer between the motor of the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> and the optical elements of the objective lens <b>102</b>. For example, the motor <b>110</b> of the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> is not within the same enclosure as the optical elements of the objective lens <b>102</b>.

The objective lens slider <b>210</b> may facilitate translational movement of the various objective lenses <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, and <b>202</b>C to align selected objective lenses with various components of a microscope system. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> conceptually depicts an optical train <b>216</b>, which may include an arrangement of various optical elements (e.g., lenses, mirrors, beam splitters, filters, and/or others) for carrying out microscope imaging. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> conceptually represents the optical train(s) <b>216</b> as directing light toward image sensor(s) <b>218</b> for acquiring images of samples. The objective lens slider <b>210</b> may align the objective lens <b>202</b>A with the optical train <b>216</b> to facilitate imaging of samples visible through the objective lens <b>202</b>A, as conceptually represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates an example adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> including a motor <b>110</b> and worm gear <b>112</b>, as before.

Controller(s) <b>214</b> may comprise one or more processors, logic units, registers, control units, integrated circuits, and/or storage media usable to control operation of the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> and the objective lens slider <b>210</b> (separate components may be used to control the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> and the objective lens slider <b>210</b> separately).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> provides an x, y, z axis for reference. In some implementations, the controller(s) <b>214</b> are usable to cause objective lenses of the objective lens slider <b>210</b> to translate along the y-axis and the z-axis to allow gear rings <b>206</b>A, <b>206</b>B, and <b>206</b>C of the different objective lenses <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, and <b>202</b>C to align with the worm gear <b>112</b> to facilitate correction collar adjustment.

Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows the gear ring <b>206</b>A of objective lens <b>202</b>A arranged in alignment with the worm gear <b>112</b> but for a z-offset. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows a Z drive <b>220</b> of the objective lens slider <b>210</b> translating the objective lens <b>202</b>A in the z direction to bring the gear ring <b>206</b>A into engagement with the worm gear to facilitate correction collar adjustment for the objective lens <b>202</b>A.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, after operating the motor <b>110</b> to cause correction collar adjustment for objective lens <b>202</b>A, the controller(s) <b>214</b> may cause the objective lens slider <b>210</b> to cause the gear ring <b>206</b>B of objective lens <b>202</b>B to selectively engage the worm gear <b>112</b> to facilitate correction collar adjustment for objective lens <b>202</b>B. Such functionality may be performed for any number of objective lenses (e.g., objective lens <b>202</b>C).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some instances, to facilitate alignment of the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> with different gear rings <b>206</b>A, <b>206</b>B, or <b>206</b>C, the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> (or at least the worm gear <b>112</b> of the adjustment mechanism) is additionally or alternatively translatable along the y-axis and/or the z-axis.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some instances, objective lenses comprise different lens diameters.

In some instances, to allow the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> to accommodate objective lenses of different diameters, gear rings of different inner diameters may be placed on different objective lenses. The gear rings placed on the different objective lenses may have the same outer diameter, notwithstanding their different inner diameters, thus allowing the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> to more readily interface with different gear rings associated with different objective lenses of different diameters.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, gear ring <b>206</b>B of objective lens <b>202</b>B has a smaller inner diameter than gear ring <b>206</b>A of objective lens <b>202</b>A, while both gear ring <b>206</b>B and gear ring <b>206</b>A have the same outer diameter. The smaller inner diameter of gear ring <b>206</b>B allows the gear ring <b>206</b>B to fit about the correction collar of objective lens <b>202</b>B, while the larger inner diameter of gear ring <b>206</b>A allows the gear ring <b>206</b>A to fit about the correction collar of objective lens <b>202</b>A. The uniform outer diameter of gear rings <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B allows both gear rings <b>206</b>A and <b>206</b>B to interface with the worm gear <b>112</b> for adjustment.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some implementations, to accommodate objective lenses with different lens diameters, the objective lens slider <b>210</b> and/or the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> (e.g., the worm gear <b>112</b> of the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b>) are translatable along the x-axis to allow different objective lenses to interface with the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b>. This may be utilized, for example, where differently sized objective lenses have gear rings of similar thicknesses and thus the overall outer diameters are different.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, each objective lens <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, and <b>202</b>C is associated with a respective magnet <b>208</b>A, <b>208</b>B, and <b>208</b>C. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> also illustrates a hall effect sensor <b>212</b> associated with the system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. In some implementations, the hall effect sensor <b>212</b> and the magnets <b>208</b>A, <b>208</b>B, and <b>208</b>C operate in combination to determine the homing position of each of the correction collars of the objective lenses <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, and <b>202</b>C. In this regard, the magnets <b>208</b>A, <b>208</b>B, and <b>208</b>C may be used for calibrating the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> to carry out desired adjustment operations for the various objective lens correction collars.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some instances, the magnets <b>208</b>A, <b>208</b>B, and/or <b>208</b>C are affixed to the gear rings <b>206</b>A, <b>206</b>B, and/or <b>206</b>C, respectively. In some instances, the magnets <b>208</b>A, <b>208</b>B, and/or <b>208</b>C are affixed to the correction collars of the objective lenses <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, and/or <b>202</b>C separate from the gear rings <b>206</b>A, <b>206</b>B, and/or <b>206</b>C (e.g., on separate rings that are affixed to the correction collars). In some embodiments, the positions of the Hall effect sensor and the magnets are swapped. For example, each objective lens <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, <b>202</b>C and/or gear ring <b>206</b>A, <b>206</b>B, <b>206</b>C may incorporate a Hall effect sensor to enable positional reference to a reference magnet. In some implementations, other sensor mechanisms aside from a hall effect sensor and magnets are used to determine the home position for the various gear rings relative to the adjustment mechanism (e.g., optical sensors, limit switches, etc.)</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">One will appreciate, in view of the present disclosure, that the example systems discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> may include additional or alternative components not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>. For instance, a system may comprise any number of processors and/or hardware storage devices to carry out any of the disclosed functions (e.g., associated with the functioning of the controller(s) <b>214</b> and/or image sensor(s) <b>218</b>). Furthermore, in some instances, a system comprises an aberration detection component, such as a focal detection unit (FDU) and/or modules for optimizing focus position utilizing signal processing techniques (e.g., phase detection, contrast detection, etc.).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>, in some instances, a correction collar of an objective lens <b>202</b>A is adjusted prior to focusing the objective lens <b>202</b>A for imaging. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> may represent a start position for the objective lens after translating the objective lens <b>202</b>A in the y-direction via the objective lens slider <b>210</b> (e.g., using controller(s) <b>214</b>) in preparation for imaging. The Z drive <b>220</b> may then translate the objective lens <b>202</b>A in the z-direction to cause the gear ring <b>206</b>A of the objective lens <b>202</b>A to engage with the worm gear <b>112</b> of the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b>. The controller(s) <b>214</b> may then operate the motor <b>110</b> to rotate the worm gear <b>112</b> and the gear ring <b>206</b>A to carry out any desired adjustments to the correction collar of the objective lens <b>202</b>A. The adjustments may be made to accommodate the thickness of the vessel carrying the sample to be imaged (e.g., the bottom of the vessel for inverted microscopes). For example, vessel thicknesses may be stored in a data structure (e.g., a table) with corresponding correction collar settings optimized for each vessel thickness, and the correction collar may be adjusted based on the data structure (with possible interpolation). Subsequently, the controller(s) <b>214</b> may advance the objective lens <b>202</b>A further in the z-direction to a desired z height for imaging (or a plurality of z heights to obtain a z-stack). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> illustrates the objective lens <b>202</b>A driven beyond the worm gear <b>112</b> in the z-direction to a desired z height for imaging. In this way, external forces (e.g., forces from the worm gear <b>112</b>) on the objective lens <b>202</b>A may be avoided during imaging.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, however, at least a portion of the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> is configured to remain engaged (or nearly engaged) with the gear ring <b>206</b>A of the objective lens <b>202</b>A during imaging to allow for correction collar adjustments during an imaging protocol (e.g., a z-stack protocol). For example, in some instances, at least a portion of the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> is configured to translate in the z-direction with the objective lens <b>202</b>A (e.g., via a z-drive) to allow for correction collar adjustments during imaging. In some implementations, the height of the gear ring <b>206</b>A is selected to allow the gear ring <b>206</b>A to remain accessible to the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> (e.g., accessible to the worm gear <b>112</b> thereof) for a range of objective lens z-heights for imaging.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some implementations where the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> is configured for adjusting the correction collar of the objective lens <b>202</b>A during imaging, there is a risk that vibrational forces of the motor of the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> disturb the objective lens <b>202</b>A during imaging, thereby affecting image quality. Thus, to prevent vibrational forces of the motor from disturbing the objective lens during imaging, the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> may be configured or controlled to perform a reverse step after adjusting the gear ring <b>206</b>A to bring the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> out of contact with the gear ring <b>206</b>A.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, a system may cause the worm gear <b>112</b> to rotate in a first direction to cause the gear teeth of the worm gear <b>112</b> to contact the gear teeth of the gear ring <b>206</b>A. The system may cause the worm gear <b>112</b> to continue to rotate in the first direction to cause the gear ring <b>206</b>A to correspondingly rotate and facilitate an adjustment to the correction collar of the objective lens <b>202</b>A. After the adjustment, the system may perform a reverse step to cause the worm gear <b>112</b> to rotate in a second direction (opposite the first direction) to bring the gear teeth of the worm gear <b>112</b> out of contact with the gear teeth of the gear ring <b>206</b>A (capitalizing on the play between the gear teeth). When the gear teeth of the worm gear <b>112</b> and the gear ring <b>206</b>A are disengaged after a reverse step as described above, (i) vibrations from the motor of the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> may be prevented from reaching the gear ring <b>206</b>A of the objective lens, and (ii) the worm gear <b>112</b> may remain readily positioned relative to the gear ring <b>206</b>A to effectuate subsequent correction collar adjustments.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some instances, the controller(s) <b>214</b> controlling the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> operate in conjunction with a focus detection unit (FDU) (or other component(s) for detecting aberration) to automatically calculate a correction collar position/setting based on data provided via the FDU (e.g., physical information of the optical interfaces of the array detector of the FDU, such as fitted peak positions of the top and bottom reflex of the sample window). For example, the FDU may comprise a light source (e.g., a laser) that emits light (e.g., collimated light) toward a cover substrate (e.g., toward a bottom side of a glass coverslip) of a sample. The FDU may further comprise an array detector configured to detect light emitted by the light source and reflected by the cover substrate. The array detector may detect a first peak associated with light reflected from a first side of the cover substrate (e.g., the bottom of a coverslip) and a second peak associated with light reflected from a second side of the cover substrate (e.g., the top of a coverslip, after the light passes through the bottom side of the coverslip and transmits through the coverslip substrate). The offset between the first and second peaks may be used to detect a thickness of the cover substrate.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The detected thickness of the cover substrate may be used as an input (e.g., automatically) to cause the adjustment mechanism <b>108</b> to adjust the correction collar of an objective lens (e.g., via a gear ring) to compensate for aberrations associated with the detected thickness</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The principles described herein can be applied to substantially any type of microscope objective that includes a correction collar (e.g., in inverted microscopes or upright microscopes).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>A, and <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate example representations of objective lenses that include correction collars and gear rings.

Otherwise, the threads of the standard components may not lead to the desired, operable orientation when fully tightened. That is, because the gear ring (Part 2) needs to be oriented in a manner to appropriately interface with the adjustment mechanism, the ability to adjust the orientation provides for effective positioning without the need to modify or custom make the standard objectives and/or pot/cup components.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b></figref> illustrate example depictions of graphical user interfaces associated with operation of a system for motorized adjustment of an objective lens correction collar.

Still furthermore, in some instances, a degree by which the correction collar is adjusted is dependent on particular imaging parameters associated with the objective lens and/or a medium through which light passes along the imaging path.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Additional Computer System Details</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A system configured for implementing disclosed techniques may include various hardware elements, such as one or more processors and/or one or more hardware storage devices. A system may comprise any number of additional or alternative components and may take on various forms.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A processor may comprise one or more sets of electronic circuitries that include any number of logic units, registers, and/or control units to facilitate the execution of computer-readable instructions (e.g., instructions that form a computer program). Such computer-readable instructions may be stored within computer-readable storage (e.g., hardware storage). The storage may comprise physical system memory and may be volatile, non-volatile, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, storage may comprise local storage, remote storage (e.g., accessible via communication system(s) or otherwise), or some combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Processors may be configured to execute instructions stored within computer-readable storage to perform certain actions associated with facilitating rapid genome sequence analysis. The actions may rely at least in part on data stored on computer-readable storage in a volatile or non-volatile manner.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some instances, the actions may rely at least in part on one or more communication systems for receiving data and/or instructions from one or more remote systems, which may include, for example, separate systems or computing devices/nodes/clusters, sensors, and/or others. The communications system(s) may comprise any combination of software or hardware components that are operable to facilitate communication between on-system components/devices and/or with off-system components/devices. For example, the communications system(s) may comprise structures, ports, buses, or other connection apparatuses for communicating with other devices/components. Additionally, or alternatively, the communications system(s) may comprise systems/components operable to communicate wirelessly with external systems and/or devices through any suitable communication channel(s), such as, by way of non-limiting example, Bluetooth, ultra-wideband, Wi-Fi, WLAN, infrared communication, and/or others.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Disclosed embodiments may comprise or utilize a special purpose or general-purpose computer including computer hardware, as discussed in greater detail below. Disclosed embodiments also include physical and other computer-readable media for carrying or storing computer-executable instructions and/or data structures. Such computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general-purpose or special-purpose computer system. Computer-readable media that store computer-executable instructions in the form of data are one or more &#x201c;physical computer storage media&#x201d; or &#x201c;hardware storage device(s).&#x201d; Computer-readable media that merely carry computer-executable instructions without storing the computer-executable instructions are &#x201c;transmission media.&#x201d; Thus, by way of example and not limitation, the current embodiments can comprise at least two distinctly different kinds of computer-readable media: computer storage media and transmission media.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Computer storage media (aka &#x201c;hardware storage device&#x201d;) are computer-readable hardware storage devices, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM, solid state drives (&#x201c;SSD&#x201d;) that are based on RAM, Flash memory, phase-change memory (&#x201c;PCM&#x201d;), or other types of memory, or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to store desired program code means in hardware in the form of computer-executable instructions, data, or data structures and that can be accessed by a general-purpose or special-purpose computer.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A &#x201c;network&#x201d; is defined as one or more data links that enable the transport of electronic data between computer systems and/or modules and/or other electronic devices. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a transmission medium. Transmission media can include a network and/or data links which can be used to carry program code in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures, and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. Combinations of the above are also included within the scope of computer-readable media.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, upon reaching various computer system components, program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures can be transferred automatically from transmission computer-readable media to physical computer-readable storage media (or vice versa). For example, computer-executable instructions or data structures received over a network or data link can be buffered in RAM within a network interface module (e.g., a &#x201c;NIC&#x201d;), and then eventually transferred to computer system RAM and/or to less volatile computer-readable physical storage media at a computer system. Thus, computer-readable physical storage media can be included in computer system components that also (or even primarily) utilize transmission media.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Computer-executable instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data which cause a general-purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. The computer-executable instructions may be, for example, binaries, intermediate format instructions such as assembly language, or even source code.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Disclosed embodiments may comprise or utilize cloud computing. A cloud model can be composed of various characteristics (e.g., on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service, etc.), service models (e.g., Software as a Service (&#x201c;SaaS&#x201d;), Platform as a Service (&#x201c;PaaS&#x201d;), Infrastructure as a Service (&#x201c;IaaS&#x201d;), and deployment models (e.g., private cloud, community cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud, etc.).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the embodiments disclosed herein may be practiced in network computing environments with many types of computer system configurations, including, personal computers, desktop computers, laptop computers, message processors, hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, mobile telephones, PDAs, pagers, routers, switches, wearable devices, and the like. The embodiments disclosed herein may also be practiced in distributed system environments where multiple computer systems (e.g., local and remote systems), which are linked through a network (either by hardwired data links, wireless data links, or by a combination of hardwired and wireless data links), perform tasks.
