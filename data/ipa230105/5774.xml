The support unit includes a support and silicon wafers to be separated from the support. After degumming, the silicon wafers separated from the support can be taken out from the degumming mechanism by hand and put into an elastic clip, and the elastic clip can be put into an inserting mechanism for inserting silicon wafers. However, the silicon wafers are usually ultra-thin and has a high mechanical brittleness, thus the silicon wafers are extremely fragile. The conventional material frame cannot clamp the support and the silicon wafers, resulting in that the silicon wafers are prone to tilt and crack when the silicon wafers are separated from the support during a degumming process. In a related art, in order to carry out a subsequent inserting process, the separated silicon wafers need to be transported to an elastic clip, and the elastic clip need to be put into the inserting mechanism for inserting silicon wafers. But the elastic clip also cannot clamp the support and the silicon wafers, resulting in the silicon wafers tilting and squeezing against each other to crack during a transport process.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present disclosure provides a turnaround mechanism <b>100</b> of silicon wafers configured for turnaround of a support unit <b>500</b>.

The sliding block is capable of moving along the height direction of the material frame <b>10</b> to drive the second clamping component <b>30</b> to clamp or release the silicon wafers.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Specifically, in the present embodiment, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when the sliding block <b>42</b> moves toward the bottom of the material frame <b>10</b> along the height direction of the material frame <b>10</b>, and the two second clamping members <b>32</b> of the second clamping component <b>30</b> can move opposite to each other, and the second clamping member <b>32</b> can be in the released state. When the sliding block <b>42</b> moves away from the bottom of the material frame <b>10</b> along the height direction of the material frame <b>10</b>, the two second clamping members <b>32</b> of the second clamping component <b>30</b> can move toward each other, and the second clamping member <b>32</b> can be in a clamping state. In other embodiments, the relationship between the state of the second clamping component <b>30</b> and a moving direction of the sliding block <b>42</b> is not limited to the above. For example, when the sliding block <b>42</b> moves toward the bottom of the material frame <b>10</b>, the second clamping component <b>30</b> can be in the clamping state.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Alternatively, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the first driving component <b>40</b> can further include an elastic member <b>43</b>, one end of the elastic member <b>43</b> can be connected to the sliding block <b>42</b>, and the other end of the elastic member <b>43</b> can be connected to the bottom of the material frame <b>10</b>. When the sliding block <b>42</b> is pressed down to move toward the bottom of the material frame <b>10</b>, the second clamping component <b>30</b> can be in the released state. When the support <b>200</b> is loading, an external force applied to the sliding block <b>42</b> can be withdrawn, while the elastic member <b>43</b> can be reset due to elastic deformation, so as to drive the sliding block <b>42</b> to move away from the bottom of the material frame <b>10</b>. Therefore, the sliding block <b>42</b> can drive the second clamping component <b>30</b> to clamp the silicon wafers automatically. By arranging the elastic member <b>43</b>, the second clamping component <b>30</b> can be always in the clamping state when no external force is applied to the sliding block <b>42</b>, so as to ensure that the second clamping component <b>30</b> can always clamp the silicon wafers during processes of degumming and transporting of the turnaround mechanism <b>100</b> of silicon wafers, thus preventing the silicon wafers from tilting, and reducing the energy consumption of the turnaround mechanism <b>100</b> of silicon wafers.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the first driving component <b>40</b> can further include a first limiting component <b>44</b>, the first limiting component <b>44</b> can include two first limiting blocks <b>441</b>. The two first limiting blocks <b>441</b> can be located at two sides of the sliding groove <b>41</b> respectively. The sliding block <b>42</b> is capable of moving to abut against the first limiting block <b>441</b>, and the first limiting block <b>441</b> can be configured to limit a displacement of the sliding block <b>42</b> along the height direction of the material frame <b>10</b>. The first limiting component <b>44</b> can be disposed to prevent the second clamping component <b>30</b> from over-clamping the silicon wafers, thereby reducing a damage rate of the silicon wafers.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In summary, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a process of applying the turnaround mechanism <b>100</b> of silicon wafers can be shown hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Firstly, when the support unit <b>500</b> is not loading, the first clamping component <b>21</b> and the second clamping component <b>30</b> can be in a released state. Then, the support <b>200</b> can be slowly moved down along the height direction of the material frame <b>10</b>, so that the first clamping member <b>211</b> can gradually extend into the clamping groove <b>201</b> on the sides of the support <b>200</b>. At this time, in each of the at least one first clamping component <b>21</b>, the two first clamping members <b>211</b> disposed oppositely can move toward each other and clamp the clamping support <b>200</b>. When the first clamping member <b>211</b> abuts against the lower limiting block <b>232</b> or the inner limiting block <b>252</b>, the clamping of the support <b>200</b> can be realized. At the same time, in each of the second clamping components <b>30</b>, the two second clamping members <b>32</b> disposed oppositely can move toward each other and approach the unseparated silicon wafers on the support <b>200</b> until the second clamping member <b>32</b> abuts against the first limiting block <b>441</b> to clamp the silicon wafers <b>300</b>. Moreover, the support unit <b>500</b> in the material frame <b>10</b> of the turnaround mechanism <b>100</b> of silicon wafers can be transported into the degumming mechanism. After degumming, the support <b>200</b> and the silicon wafers <b>300</b> can be separated. At this time, the support <b>200</b> or the support <b>200</b> together with the upper material frame <b>11</b> can be taken out, and the remaining degummed silicon wafers <b>300</b> together with the lower material frame <b>12</b> can be transported to the accommodating area <b>403</b> of the mechanism <b>400</b> for conveying and dispersing silicon wafers. At this time, the conveying support component <b>401</b> can extend into the second through groove <b>17</b> to support the silicon wafers <b>300</b>, so that the bottom of the silicon wafers <b>300</b> can be separated from the bottom of the material tank <b>13</b>. The two conveying clamping members <b>4021</b> disposed on both sides of the material tank <b>13</b> can extend into the two first through grooves <b>16</b> respectively, and move toward each other to clamp the silicon wafers in the material tank <b>13</b>. At this time, the first driving component <b>40</b> of the turnaround mechanism <b>100</b> of silicon wafers can drive the second clamping member <b>32</b> to release the silicon wafers <b>300</b>, so that the turnaround mechanism <b>100</b> of silicon wafers cannot clamp and support the silicon wafers <b>300</b>. Then, the mechanism <b>400</b> for conveying and dispersing silicon wafers can be in operation, the conveying support component <b>401</b> and the conveying clamping component <b>402</b> can cyclically scroll, and transport the silicon wafers <b>300</b> located in the material tank <b>13</b> to the inserting mechanism via the discharge port <b>14</b> for inserting, thus finishing the transportation process of the silicon wafers <b>300</b>. In a production process of silicon wafers, the turnaround mechanism <b>100</b> of silicon wafers provided by the present disclosure can effectively realize the clamping of the silicon wafers and prevent the silicon wafer from tilting. Furthermore, the turnaround mechanism <b>100</b> of silicon wafers can be applied in combination with the degumming mechanism and the inserting mechanism. Therefore, in the production process of silicon wafers, the silicon wafers can be always supported, clamped and transported by the material frame <b>10</b> without the elastic clip, so that the silicon wafers do not need multiple handling, thus significantly reducing a damage rate of the silicon wafers.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In addition, it should be noted that the use of words such as &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d; to limit parts is only for the convenience of distinguishing corresponding parts.
