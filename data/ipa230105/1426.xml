to an air conditioner, and more particularly, to an air conditioner including a dust collecting filter assembly whose manufacturing process can be simplified and having an improved dust collection performance.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, an air conditioner is a device for lowering an indoor temperature or maintaining a comfortable state. Such an air conditioner is provided with an electric dust collector for filtering floating substances contained in the air.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The electric dust collector is a device that removes or collects particles of a solid or liquid suspended in a gas or liquid by an electrical method.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The electric dust collector uses the principle that the electric charges generated by corona discharge are attached to particles and become charged particles, which are attracted and moved to electrodes of opposite polarity by electrostatic force.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electric dust collector includes a discharge unit (ionization unit) and a dust collecting unit.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The discharge unit includes a discharge electrode to which a high voltage is applied and a ground electrode which is grounded, and e+ or e&#x2212; generated through the corona discharge generated when a high voltage is applied to the discharge electrode charges the foreign substances in the air.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, the dust collecting unit includes a plurality of dust collecting plates charged with positive (+) and minus (&#x2212;) polarities, and catches and collects the fine dust charged in the ionization unit through the dust collecting plate.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the electric dust collector, the discharge unit is installed before the dust collecting unit in an air flow direction, and the foreign substances in the air are ionized while passing through the discharge unit and then collected while passing through the dust collecting unit.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The dust collecting unit is disposed by spacing a plurality of dielectric films at a regular interval.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view schematically showing a method of manufacturing a conventional dust collecting unit.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in the conventional dust collecting part <b>10</b>, a plurality of fastening parts <b>12</b> is formed to protrude along the longitudinal direction on the inside of a casing <b>11</b>, and fastening grooves <b>13</b> are formed to insert and fasten dielectric films <b>14</b> to the fastening parts <b>12</b>. In addition, the fastening grooves <b>13</b> are formed to be spaced apart from each other by a predetermined interval to maintain the distance between the dielectric films <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, the conventional dust collecting unit <b>10</b> is manufactured by manually inserting the dielectric films <b>14</b> into the fastening grooves <b>13</b> formed in the fastening units <b>12</b> by an operator, so there is a problem that the work process is inconvenient and takes a lot of work time.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, since the fastening parts <b>12</b> and the fastening grooves <b>13</b> are molded through an injection process, the minimum distance between the dielectric films <b>14</b> that can be obtained through the injection process is 2 mm. Thus, even if the dust collection performance is improved when the distance between the dielectric films <b>14</b> is less than 2 mm, there is a problem that the distance between the dielectric films <b>14</b> cannot be reduced to less than 2 mm due to the molding limit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Japanese Patent Registration No. 4915073 (hereinafter referred to as Patent Document 1&#x2032;) discloses a dust collecting apparatus and an air conditioning apparatus. Patent Document 1 discloses that the distance between the dielectric films is maintained by forming protrusions on the dielectric film itself, rather than a configuration in which the distance between the dielectric films is maintained by inserting and fastening the dielectric film into an injection molded product.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, when the protrusions are formed on the dielectric film itself as in Patent Document 1, the process for forming the protrusions on the dielectric film is very difficult, and for this purpose, there is a problem that the manufacturing cost is somewhat required. In addition, there is a risk that the formation of projections on the dielectric film may adversely affect the dust collection performance.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention was devised to solve the above problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide an air conditioner equipped with a dust collecting filter assembly in which a separator film is stacked between dielectric films so that the distance between the dielectric films is uniformly spaced apart, and which can be manufactured with simplified process through simple stacking of the films.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to achieve the above object, an air conditioner according to a preferable embodiment of the present invention includes a main body provided with an inlet and an outlet;
