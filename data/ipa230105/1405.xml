In particular, a method and apparatus for collection and preservation of fluid samples in accordance with the present invention results in collection of semen samples having improved viability both at the time of collection and after storage. The disclosed methods and apparatuses support a wide variety of applications for containment of or contact with biological fluids related to human and veterinary medicine and medical devices including, but not limited to, human reproductive medicine and animal husbandry.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Assisted reproductive technologies were developed originally to treat individuals with obstructed ovarian tubes, but have matured to procedures which, according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control (2013), now accounts for up to 2% of the annual U.S. birth rate. Since the first human birth from in vitro fertilization in 1978, there have been significant improvements in stimulation protocols, fertilization and culture techniques, use of donor gametes and embryos, and patient selection. Further, the use of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis/pre-implantation genetic screening, an invasive harvesting of cells for genetic screening, has allowed improved selection of embryos to avoid aneuploidy and other genetic defects. These improvements resulted in constantly increasing pregnancy rates while allowing a steady decrease in the number of embryos transferred (Center for Disease Control, 25 2013).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,864,046, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses the use of a method for collecting the semen of an animal via a semen collection vessel having a semen extender solution capable of extending motility of collected semen. Such semen collection vessel is capable of extending the life of spermatozoa, and further improves conditions when utilized in connection with a semen extender solution, which may contain several ingredients including, but not limited to, nutrients to maintain its metabolic activity and to undergo the processes necessary for fertilization of the ova, proteins necessary for the sperm cells to grow and to mature into the spermatozoa, sugars to provide the sperm with energy, antimicrobial agents to reduce microbial contamination and prevent the spread of diseases that can be transported in the semen, and cryoprotectants to protect spermatozoa from damage due to ice crystal formation when frozen. This well-developed field has long-utilized semen extenders for improving the life of the collected samples. However, with the increase of cryopreservation, as well as the advancing state of the art in reproductive sciences, there remains a need for further enhancing the collection and storage of semen for improved semen quality and protection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to these traditional motivations, the recent pandemic has resulted in behavioral changes promoting a need for improved preservation of semen samples. It has been found that a shift for collection at clinic to at home for the population examined resulted in an increase in the time from collection to completed preparation. This has been shown to significantly effect the viability of useful sperm samples. Along with this there is the additional need for effective transportation or shipping of these collection and/or storage containers that provide for stability, containment, and security of the samples.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need for collection and/or storage containers that improve the viability of sperm, in collected semen and/or extend the time period for which such sperm remains viable.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, the present disclosure relates to apparatuses and methods for collection, processing, and/or storage of biological fluids susceptible to degradation by oxidation. In particular, apparatuses and methods for collection and/or storage of mammalian semen samples are disclosed herein. The invention is further directed to apparatus, collections device and other medical devices that control free oxygen radicals within a biological fluid, and where this biological fluid is sperm, the amount of time available before a sperm must be used to fertilize an egg is increased.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, an apparatus for collection of fluids comprises a first vessel. The first vessel includes an upper portion and a lower portion. The upper portion is a wall, which can be of any suitable profile. The lower portion is a reservoir having a predetermined capacity. The wall and reservoir are joined such that the inner surface of the reservoir and the inner surface of the wall form a continuous surface. A suitable profile for the wall is one that will be effective as a collection means to cause liquid entering the top of the first vessel to collect in the reservoir by gravity flow.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, an apparatus for collection of fluids comprises a first vessel and a second vessel. In these embodiments, the first vessel is as described above, but additionally the first and second vessels are of sizes and shapes to permit the first vessel to be inserted into the second vessel. When so inserted, the upper edges of the first and second vessels are proximate to one another and are substantially congruent. In some embodiments, the upper edges of the first and second vessels are connected or secured to one other by a threaded connection, a snap connection, or other common means.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, in addition to any or all of the above attributes, the apparatus comprises a reservoir seal means, wherein the reservoir has a first inner surface and the reservoir seal means has a bottom surface, such that when the reservoir seal means is installed, the first inner surface and the bottom surface circumscribe a sealed reservoir chamber</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, in addition to any or all of the above attributes, the first vessel, second vessel, and lid can comprise a polymer, preferably a thermoplastic.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter, which form the subject matter of the claims of the invention.

Air pressure is used to inflate soft plastic into a mold cavity. The three main types of blow molding are: extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, and injection stretch blow molding.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">&#x201c;Injection molding,&#x201d; as used herein, means a manufacturing process where material is fed into a heated barrel where it is also melted. When smooth enough, the material is injected through a nozzle under pressure (filling cycle) to fill a mold cavity and then cools off (cooling cycle). Thereafter, the mold opens, and the part ejects.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">&#x201c;Lower end,&#x201d; as used herein, with respect to the apparatus or component of the apparatus means the portion of apparatus or component of the apparatus, respectively, proximate to the bottom of the apparatus or component of the apparatus, respectively, when the apparatus is in the upright orientation resting on a horizontal surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref> each show embodiments of the apparatus in the upright orientation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">&#x201c;Mate,&#x201d; as used herein, with respect to the apparatus means to form a connection between two components of the apparatus, such as between a lid and an edge or between two edges. Examples of such connections include, but are not limited to, overlapping edges, threaded connections, and tongue and groove connections. Connections can be self-securing, such as threaded connections or overlapping edges with interference such that the edges snap together. Alternatively, connections can be such that the components fit together but require external means such as tape to secure the connection.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">&#x201c;Thermoplastic,&#x201d; as used herein, means any polymer including but not limited to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (&#x201c;ABS&#x201d;), polyamide (&#x201c;PA&#x201d;), polybutylene terephthalate (&#x201c;PBT&#x201d;), polycaprolactam, polycarbonate (&#x201c;PC&#x201d;), polyether ether ketone (&#x201c;PEEK&#x201d;), polyetherimide, polyethylene (&#x201c;PE&#x201d;; including ethylene homopolymers, such as, but not limited to, high density polyethylene and high-pressure, low density polyethylene; ethylene-alpha-olefin copolymers, such as, but not limited to, high density polyethylene, medium density polyethylene, and linear low density polyethylene; and copolymers of ethylene and polar comonomers, such as, but not limited to, ethylene-methyl-acrylate copolymer, ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer, ethylene-vinyl-acetate copolymer), polyethylene terephthalate (&#x201c;PETP&#x201d;), polymethyl methacrylate (&#x201c;PMMA&#x201d;), polyoxymethylene (&#x201c;POM&#x201d;), polyphenylene sulfide (&#x201c;PPS&#x201d;), polyphenylsulfone, polypropylene (&#x201c;PP&#x201d;), polystyrene (&#x201c;PS&#x201d;), polyvinylidene fluoride (&#x201c;PVDF&#x201d;), styrene acrylonitrile resin (&#x201c;SAN&#x201d;), thermoplastic elastomers (&#x201c;TPE&#x201d;), thermoplastic polyurethane (&#x201c;TPU&#x201d;), or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">&#x201c;Upper end,&#x201d; as used herein, with respect to the apparatus or component of the apparatus means the portion of apparatus or component of the apparatus, respectively, proximate to the bottom of the apparatus or component of the apparatus, respectively, when the apparatus is in the upright orientation resting on a horizontal surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref> show embodiments of the apparatus in the upright orientation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">&#x201c;Viability,&#x201d; as used herein, means a sperm sample that exceeds one or more lower reference limits for a semen sample of at least 1.5 ml: total sperm count greater than or equal to 39&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>; sperm concentration greater than or equal to 15&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>; total motility greater than or equal to 40%; progressive motility greater than or equal to 32%; vitality greater than or equal to 58%; and sperm morphology greater than or equal to 4%, (percent). &#x201c;Selected viability,&#x201d; as used herein, means a one or more of the foregoing parameter selected by a user for determination of viability.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Physical Configuration of Apparatus</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The apparatus comprises at least one vessel having a reservoir at the bottom of the vessel as the collection and storage of biological fluids, such as, but not limited to, mammalian semen. The apparatus further comprises a reservoir seal means, which encloses the reservoir after a fluid sample is collected. In some embodiments, the reservoir seal means comprises a seal element. In some embodiments, the reservoir seal means comprises a seal element connected to a positioning element. In some embodiments, the reservoir seal means comprises a seal element connected to a positioning element and the positioning element connected to a stabilizing element.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Without a reservoir seal, a first chamber is circumscribed by the inner surface of the reservoir, the inner surface of the collection means, and the inner surface of the lid. When the reservoir seal means is installed after collection of a fluid sample, a second chamber is formed, circumscribed by the inner surface of the reservoir and the bottom surface of the seal element. The second chamber has less volume than the first chamber and is circumscribed by less surface area than the first chamber.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the apparatus is moved and/or transported, it is subjected to changes in external forces and/or changes in the orientation of the apparatus. Such changes in orientation can be one or more of tipping of the apparatus, inverting the apparatus, or even dropping the apparatus. Without a reservoir seal means, the fluid sample is subject to movement, sometimes severe movement, within the entire volume of the first chamber. With the reservoir seal means installed, movement of the fluid sample is restricted to the volume of the second chamber. Therefore, application of the same external forces on an apparatus with a reservoir seal means and an apparatus without a reservoir seal means would result in less trauma to and/or agitation of a fluid sample, since the reduced volume of the second chamber limits the distance that the sample can travel even when the apparatus is subjected to severe external forces. It is believed, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, that less trauma to and/or agitation of a fluid sample, such as mammalian semen, helps to maintain the viability of such sample.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The reduced volume of the second chamber as compared to the first chamber also limits the amount of air to which a fluid sample is exposed during the time the sample is stored in the apparatus. It is believed, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, that limiting the oxygen to which a sample of mammalian semen is exposed helps to maintain the viability of such sample. This becomes increasingly important as the time of storage increases.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The reduced surface area circumscribing the second chamber as compared to the first chamber also limits the amount of chemical reaction that can occur between a fluid sample and any compounds present on the surface area to which the fluid sample, such as mammalian semen, contacts. It is believed, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, that limiting the surface area containing one or more compounds that are reactive with the fluid sample, such as mammalian, helps to maintain the viability of such sample.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the material from which the reservoir, the collection means, lid, and/or seal element are fabricated comprise one or more antioxidants that counteract oxidative deterioration of the fluid sample, such as mammalian semen, due to exposure to oxygen. It is believed, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, that the reduced size of the second chamber as compared to the first chamber promotes maintenance of a desired level of viability of a fluid sample such as mammalian semen by limiting reactants both in the vapor space and on the surface circumscribing the second chamber to which a fluid sample, such as mammalian semen, is exposed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The reduced volume of the second chamber as compared to the first chamber also limits the change in temperature to which a fluid sample is exposed during the time the sample is stored in the apparatus. It is believed, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, that restricting the movement of the fluid sample to a smaller volume provides more less variation in temperature of a fluid sample, such as mammalian semen, and helps to maintain the viability of such sample. This becomes increasingly important as the time of storage increases. This temperature stabilization effect is further enhanced when the first vessel is inserted into a second vessel as described elsewhere in this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the apparatus is a single vessel surrounded by one or more layers of insulation material.

The seal element has a sealing surface that engages with the first vessel proximate to the upper end of the reservoir and/or the lower end of the collection means. The inner surface of the reservoir and the inner surface of the collection means form a continuous inner surface of the first vessel. For purposes of this disclosure, the transition from the inner surface of the reservoir to the inner surface of the collection means is defined as the point at which the sealing surface of the seal element engages the continuous surface formed by the inner surface of the reservoir to the inner surface of the collection means.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">The engagement between the sealing surface of the seal element and the inner surface of the first vessel can be implemented by positioning, friction, pressure, suction, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments positioning of the sealing surface of the seal element relative to the inner surface of the first vessel is maintained by a reservoir means comprising a seal element, a positioning element, and a stabilizing element. The configuration of the stabilizing element is such that the stabilizing element is secured by engagement of the lid with the first vessel, such as, but not limited to, by a threaded connection between the lid and the first vessel securing the perimeter of a disc-shaped stabilizing element between the upper edge of the first vessel and the lid. In some embodiments, the stabilizing element can be only a portion of a disc, wherein two or more contact points are provided for engagement between the upper edge of the first vessel and the lid. When the stabilizing element is secured between the upper edge of the first vessel and the lid, the sealing surface of the seal element is positioned close to the inner surface of the first vessel by connection of the seal element to the positioning element and connection of the positioning element to the stabilizing element. The fitment between the sealing surface of the seal element and the inner surface of the first vessel is such that the gap between the sealing surface of the seal element and the inner surface of the first vessel is less than the distance where the surface tension of a liquid sample, such as sample of mammalian semen, would overcome the forces of gravity is the apparatus was inverted such that the liquid sample would be retained in the second chamber upon such inversion.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">In some embodiments, a frictional connection between the sealing surface of the seal element on the inner surface of the first vessel when a reservoir means, comprising a seal element and a positioning element, are engaged by manual application of force by a human or a machine through the positioning element connected to the seal element. Such force causes engagement between the sealing surface of the seal element and the inner surface of the first vessel by way of friction. Such engagement by friction is maintained by: a) taper of a frustoconical surface of the sealing surface of the seal element and/or taper of a frustoconical surface of the inner surface of the first vessel where the sealing surface of the seal element engages inner surface of the first vessel; b) texturing of the surface of a sealing surface of the seal element and/or a surface of the inner surface of the first vessel where the sealing surface of the seal element engages inner surface of the first vessel; c) pliability of the material from which the seal element and/or the first vessel are fabricated produce compressive forces in the seal element and/or the wall of the first vessel; or d) a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">In some embodiments, pressure between the sealing surface of the seal element and the inner surface of the first vessel is maintained by a reservoir means comprising a seal element, a positioning element, and a stabilizing element. The configuration of the reservoir means is such that one or more of the seal element, the positioning element, and the stabilizing element is fabricated from a flexible material. In some embodiments, the stabilizing element is secured by engagement of the lid with the first vessel, such as, but not limited to, by a threaded connection between the lid and the first vessel securing the perimeter of a disc-shaped stabilizing element between the upper edge of the first vessel and the lid. In some embodiments, the stabilizing element can be only a portion of a disc, wherein two or more contact points are provided for engagement between the upper edge of the first vessel and the lid. When the stabilizing element is secured between the upper edge of the first vessel and the lid, the one or more of the seal element, the positioning element, and the stabilizing element are of a size and shape that one or more of the seal element, the positioning element, and the stabilizing element are cause to flex when the lid is fully engages with the upper edge of the first vessel. Such flexing of one or more of the seal element, the positioning element, and the stabilizing element produce a pressure between the sealing surface of the seal element and the inner surface of the first vessel.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">In some embodiments, connection is maintained between the reservoir seal means and the first vessel by suction force. In such embodiments, the seal element is fabricated from a flexible material and configured such than when manual force by a human or a machine through the positioning element, the seal element is caused to flex and push a portion of the air in the second chamber to be removed by leakage between the interface of the sealing surface of the seal element and the inner surface of the first vessel. After such removal of a portion of the air from the second chamber, the air pressure outside the first chamber causes the seal element to remain flexed, thereby holding the reservoir means in place with an airtight connection at the interface of the sealing surface of the seal element and the inner surface of the first vessel.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0050">In some embodiments, the seal between the sealing surface of the seal element and the inner surface of the first vessel is enhanced by fabrication of the seal element and/or the first vessel from plastic impregnated fabric and/or lamination of one or more layers plastic impregnated fabric to the seal element and/or inner surface of the first vessel, such as, but not limited to Celastic&#x2122; sheeting (available from Atlas International, Calif., USA).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">In some embodiments, the configuration of the reservoir seal means is such that two or more of positioning, friction, pressure, and suction work in combination to maintain closure of the second chamber until the reservoir seal means is manually removed by a human or a machine from engagement with the inner surface of the first vessel by a human or a machine.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0052">In some embodiments, the apparatus comprises a second vessel.
