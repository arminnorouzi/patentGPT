One such derivative, hydroxylated proline, is a starting material for the synthesis of various therapeutic compounds, including carbapenem antibiotics (See e.g., Altamura et al., J. Med., Chem. 38(21):4244-56 [1995]), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, protease inhibitors (See e.g., Chen et al., J. Org. Chem., 67(8):2730-3 [2002]; Chen et al., 2006, J Med Chem. 49(3):995-1005), nucleic acid analogs (See e.g., Efimov et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 34(8):2247-2257 [2006]), isoprenyltransferase inhibitors (O'Connell et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 48(5):740-742 [2000]), and drug library construction (Vergnon et al., J. Comb. Chem., 6(1):91-8 [2004]; and Remuzon, Tetrahedron 52:13803-13835 [1996]).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hydroxyproline can be obtained from natural sources, such as plant materials and hydrolyzates of collagen. Hydroxyproline can also be chemically synthesized, such as from starting materials allyl bromide and diethylacetamidomalonic acid (Kyun Lee et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 46:2924 [1973]), D-glutamic acid (Eguchi et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 47:1704-08 [1974]), glyoxal and oxaloacetic acid (Ramaswamy et al., J. Org. Chem., 42(21):3440-3443 [1977]), and &#x3b1;-alanine (Sinha et al., Proc. ECSOC-4, The Fourth International Electronic Conference on Synthetic Organic Chemistry, ISBN 3-906980-05-7 [2000]).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Isolation from natural sources is limited by the availability of raw materials, requires purification from a significant amount of background contaminants, and lacks certain desired diastereomers. Chemical synthetic methods can require complex steps, be difficult to scale up to industrial scale levels, and require additional purification steps due to formation of multiple hydroxylated products.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another approach for preparing hydroxylated proline uses proline hydroxylases, which are 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, utilizing 2-oxoglutarate (&#x3b1;-ketoglutarate) and O<sub>2 </sub>as co-substrates and ferrous ion as a cofactor (See e.g., Klein et al., Adv. Synth. Catal., 353:1375-1383 [2011]; U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,775; and Shibasaki et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 65(9):4028-4031 [1999]). Unlike prolyl hydroxylases that specifically recognize peptidyl proline in procollagen and related peptides, proline hydroxylases are capable of converting free proline to hydroxyproline. Several microbial enzymes that produce cis-3-, cis-4- or trans-4-hydroxyproline are known in the art (See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,962,292, 5,963,254, and 5,854,040; WO2009139365; and EP2290065), and an enzyme that produces trans-3-hydroxyproline has been identified in extracts of the fungus. Many of the proline hydroxylases are found in bacteria and fungi, where they are associated with the biosynthesis of peptide antibiotics.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A natural proline hydroxylase that is selective for trans-3-hydroxyproline is not known in the art. The fungal proline hydroxylase from <i>Glarea lozoyensis</i>, GloF, produces trans-3-hydroxyproline as the minor isomer together with the major isomer trans-4-hydroxyproline (Petersen et al., Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003, 62, 263; Houwaart et al., ChemBioChem 2014, 15, 2365). Another fungal proline hydroxylase from <i>Emericella rugulosa </i>NRRL 11440, HtyE, sharing approximately 64% sequence of identity with GloF, was reported as part of an echinocandin B biosynthetic gene cluster (Cacho et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 16781). HtyE was also found to produce trans-3-hydroxyproline as the minor isomer together with the major isomer trans-4-hydroxyproline. Recently, a gene cluster that includes three hydroxylase genes was identified in fungal sp.11243 (Matsui et al., J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2017, February; 123(2): 147-153), and one gene was subsequently identified as having homology to HtyE.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">While recombinant whole cells expressing cloned proline hydroxylases are better suited for large scale industrial processes, the use of whole cells limits variations in reaction conditions, such as high substrate concentrations; restricts the types of substrates that can be used to those that are permeable to the cells; and results in undesirable by-products that must be separated from the final product. In addition, in vivo systems may require defined growth media that are not optimal or cost effective because the use of rich growth media prepared from protein hydrolyzates contain free proline, which can be a competitive inhibitor when substrates other than proline are being targeted. Alternative methods for synthesizing hydroxylated forms of proline and proline analogs, as well as other chemical compounds, that can be readily scaled up and result in substantially pure isomeric product are necessary.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides engineered proline hydroxylase biocatalysts, polynucleotides encoding the biocatalysts, methods of their preparation, and processes for preparing hydroxylated compounds using these engineered biocatalysts.

In some embodiments, the cell, nucleic acid or polypeptide is identical a naturally occuring cell, nucleic acid or polypeptide, but is produced or derived from synthetic materials and/or by manipulation using recombinant techniques. Non-limiting examples include, among others, recombinant cells expressing genes that are not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise expressed at a different level.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0052">The term &#x201c;percent (%) sequence identity&#x201d; is used herein to refer to comparisons among polynucleotides or polypeptides, and are determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage may be calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Alternatively, the percentage may be calculated by determining the number of positions at which either the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences or a nucleic acid base or amino acid residue is aligned with a gap to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Those of skill in the art appreciate that there are many established algorithms available to align two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted by any suitable method, including, but not limited to the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math., 2:482 [1981]), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol., 48:443 [1970]), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444 [1988]), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (e.g., GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the GCG Wisconsin Software Package), or by visual inspection, as known in the art. Examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity include, but are not limited to the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described by Altschul et al. (See Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 215: 403-410 [1990]; and Altschul et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 3389-3402 [1977], respectively). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as, the neighborhood word score threshold (See, Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always &#x3e;0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always &#x3c;0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=&#x2212;4, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (See, Henikoff and Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 [1989]). Exemplary determination of sequence alignment and % sequence identity can employ the BESTFIT or GAP programs in the GCG Wisconsin Software package (Accelrys, Madison Wis.), using default parameters provided.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0053">&#x201c;Reference sequence&#x201d; refers to a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence and/or activity comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, a segment of a full-length gene or polypeptide sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least 20 nucleotide or amino acid residues in length, at least 25 residues in length, at least 50 residues in length, at least 100 residues in length or the full length of the nucleic acid or polypeptide. Since two polynucleotides or polypeptides may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete sequence) that is similar between the two sequences, and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two sequences, sequence comparisons between two (or more) polynucleotides or polypeptides are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two polynucleotides or polypeptides over a &#x201c;comparison window&#x201d; to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. In some embodiments, a &#x201c;reference sequence&#x201d; can be based on a primary amino acid sequence, where the reference sequence is a sequence that can have one or more changes in the primary sequence.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0054">As used herein, &#x201c;comparison window&#x201d; refers to a conceptual segment of at least about 20 contiguous nucleotide positions or amino acid residues wherein a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of at least 20 contiguous nucleotides or amino acids and wherein the portion of the sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison window can be longer than 20 contiguous residues, and includes, optionally 30, 40, 50, 100, or longer windows.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0055">&#x201c;Corresponding to&#x201d;, &#x201c;reference to&#x201d; or &#x201c;relative to&#x201d; when used in the context of the numbering of a given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence refers to the numbering of the residues of a specified reference sequence when the given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence is compared to the reference sequence. In other words, the residue number or residue position of a given polymer is designated with respect to the reference sequence rather than by the actual numerical position of the residue within the given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence. For example, a given amino acid sequence, such as that of an engineered proline hydroxylase, can be aligned to a reference sequence by introducing gaps to optimize residue matches between the two sequences. In these cases, although the gaps are present, the numbering of the residue in the given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence is made with respect to the reference sequence to which it has been aligned.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0056">&#x201c;Substantial identity&#x201d; refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence that has at least 80 percent sequence identity, at least 85 percent identity, at least between 89 to 95 percent sequence identity, or more usually, at least 99 percent sequence identity as compared to a reference sequence over a comparison window of at least 20 residue positions, frequently over a window of at least 30-50 residues, wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to a sequence that includes deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the window of comparison. In some specific embodiments applied to polypeptides, the term &#x201c;substantial identity&#x201d; means that two polypeptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 89 percent sequence identity, or at least 95 percent sequence identity or more (e.g., 99 percent sequence identity). In some embodiments, residue positions that are not identical in sequences being compared differ by conservative amino acid substitutions.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0057">As used herein, &#x201c;amino acid difference&#x201d; and &#x201c;residue difference&#x201d; refer to a difference in the amino acid residue at a position of a polypeptide sequence relative to the amino acid residue at a corresponding position in a reference sequence. The positions of amino acid differences generally are referred to herein as &#x201c;Xn,&#x201d; where n refers to the corresponding position in the reference sequence upon which the residue difference is based. For example, a &#x201c;residue difference at position X93 as compared to SEQ ID NO:4&#x201d; refers to a difference in the amino acid residue at the polypeptide position corresponding to position 93 of SEQ ID NO:4. Thus, if the reference polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4 has a serine at position 93, then a &#x201c;residue difference at position X93 as compared to SEQ ID NO:4&#x201d; refers to an amino acid substitution of any residue other than serine at the position of the polypeptide corresponding to position 93 of SEQ ID NO:4. In most instances herein, the specific amino acid residue difference at a position is indicated as &#x201c;XnY&#x201d; where &#x201c;Xn&#x201d; specified the corresponding position as described above, and &#x201c;Y&#x201d; is the single letter identifier of the amino acid found in the engineered polypeptide (i.e., the different residue than that in the reference polypeptide). In some instances (e.g., in Tables 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.1, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.1, 8.2, 9.1, 9.2, 10.1, 10.2, 11.1, 11.2, and/or 12.1), the present invention also provides specific amino acid differences denoted by the conventional notation &#x201c;AnB&#x201d;, where A is the single letter identifier of the residue in the reference sequence, &#x201c;n&#x201d; is the number of the residue position in the reference sequence, and B is the single letter identifier of the residue substitution in the sequence of the engineered polypeptide. In some instances, a polypeptide of the present invention comprises one or more amino acid residue differences relative to a reference sequence, which is indicated by a list of the specified positions where residue differences are present relative to the reference sequence. In some embodiments, where more than one amino acid can be used in a specific residue position of a polypeptide, the various amino acid residues that can be used are separated by a &#x201c;/&#x201d; (e.g., X307H/X307P or X307H/P). The slash may also be used to indicate multiple substitutions within a given variant (i.e., there is more than one substitution present in a given sequence, such as in a combinatorial variant). In some embodiments, the present invention includes engineered polypeptide sequences comprising one or more amino acid differences comprising conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions. In some additional embodiments, the present invention provides engineered polypeptide sequences comprising both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0058">As used herein, &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; refers to a substitution of a residue with a different residue having a similar side chain, and thus typically involves substitution of the amino acid in the polypeptide with amino acids within the same or similar defined class of amino acids. By way of example and not limitation, in some embodiments, an amino acid with an aliphatic side chain is substituted with another aliphatic amino acid (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine); an amino acid with hydroxyl side chain is substituted with another amino acid with a hydroxyl side chain (e.g., serine and threonine); an amino acids having aromatic side chains is substituted with another amino acid having an aromatic side chain (e.g., phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and histidine); an amino acid with a basic side chain is substituted with another amino acid with a basis side chain (e.g., lysine and arginine); an amino acid with an acidic side chain is substituted with another amino acid with an acidic side chain (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid); and/or a hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acid is replaced with another hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acid, respectively.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0059">As used herein, &#x201c;non-conservative substitution&#x201d; refers to substitution of an amino acid in the polypeptide with an amino acid with significantly differing side chain properties. Non-conservative substitutions may use amino acids between, rather than within, the defined groups and affects (a) the structure of the peptide backbone in the area of the substitution (e.g., proline for glycine) (b) the charge or hydrophobicity, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. By way of example and not limitation, an exemplary non-conservative substitution can be an acidic amino acid substituted with a basic or aliphatic amino acid; an aromatic amino acid substituted with a small amino acid; and a hydrophilic amino acid substituted with a hydrophobic amino acid.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0060">As used herein, &#x201c;deletion&#x201d; refers to modification to the polypeptide by removal of one or more amino acids from the reference polypeptide. Deletions can comprise removal of 1 or more amino acids, 2 or more amino acids, 5 or more amino acids, 10 or more amino acids, 15 or more amino acids, or 20 or more amino acids, up to 10% of the total number of amino acids, or up to 20% of the total number of amino acids making up the reference enzyme while retaining enzymatic activity and/or retaining the improved properties of an engineered proline hydroxylase enzyme. Deletions can be directed to the internal portions and/or terminal portions of the polypeptide. In various embodiments, the deletion can comprise a continuous segment or can be discontinuous.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061">As used herein, &#x201c;insertion&#x201d; refers to modification to the polypeptide by addition of one or more amino acids from the reference polypeptide. Insertions can be in the internal portions of the polypeptide, or to the carboxy or amino terminus. Insertions as used herein include fusion proteins as is known in the art. The insertion can be a contiguous segment of amino acids or separated by one or more of the amino acids in the naturally occurring polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0062">A &#x201c;functional fragment&#x201d; or a &#x201c;biologically active fragment&#x201d; used interchangeably herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion(s) and/or internal deletions, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the sequence to which it is being compared (e.g., a full-length engineered proline hydroxylase of the present invention) and that retains substantially all of the activity of the full-length polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0063">As used herein, &#x201c;isolated polypeptide&#x201d; refers to a polypeptide which is substantially separated from other contaminants that naturally accompany it (e.g., protein, lipids, and polynucleotides). The term embraces polypeptides which have been removed or purified from their naturally-occurring environment or expression system (e.g., within a host cell or via in vitro synthesis). The recombinant proline hydroxylase polypeptides may be present within a cell, present in the cellular medium, or prepared in various forms, such as lysates or isolated preparations.

In some embodiments, the present invention provides engineered proline hydroxylase polypeptides that exhibit an improvement in any enzyme property as compared to a reference proline hydroxylase polypeptide, and/or a wild-type proline hydroxylase polypeptide and/or another engineered proline hydroxylase polypeptide. Thus, the level of &#x201c;improvement&#x201d; can be determined and compared between various proline hydroxylase enzymes, including wild-type, as well as engineered proline hydroxylases. Improved properties include, but are not limited, to such properties as increased protein expression, increased thermoactivity, increased thermostability, increased pH activity, increased stability, increased enzymatic activity, increased substrate specificity or affinity, increased specific activity, increased resistance to substrate or end-product inhibition, increased chemical stability, improved chemoselectivity, improved solvent stability, increased tolerance to acidic pH, increased tolerance to basic pH, increased tolerance to proteolytic activity (i.e., reduced sensitivity to proteolysis), reduced aggregation, increased solubility, and altered temperature profile.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0066">As used herein, &#x201c;increased enzymatic activity&#x201d; and &#x201c;enhanced catalytic activity&#x201d; refer to an improved property of the engineered proline hydroxylase polypeptides, which can be represented by an increase in specific activity (e.g., product produced/time/weight protein) or an increase in percent conversion of the substrate to the product (e.g., percent conversion of starting amount of substrate to product in a specified time period using a specified amount of proline hydroxylase) as compared to the reference proline hydroxylase enzyme. Exemplary methods to determine enzyme activity are provided in the Examples. Any property relating to enzyme activity may be affected, including the classical enzyme properties of K<sub>m</sub>, V<sub>max </sub>or k<sub>cat</sub>, changes of which can lead to increased enzymatic activity.

As known to those of skill in the art, the stability of hybrids is reflected in the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) of the hybrids. In general, the stability of a hybrid is a function of ion strength, temperature, G/C content, and the presence of chaotropic agents. The T<sub>m </sub>values for polynucleotides can be calculated using known methods for predicting melting temperatures (See e.g., Baldino et al., Meth. Enzymol., 168:761-777 [1989]; Bolton et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:1390 [1962]; Bresslauer et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:8893-8897 [1986]; Freier et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:9373-9377 [1986]; Kierzek et al., Biochem., 25:7840-7846 [1986]; Rychlik et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 18:6409-6412 [1990] (erratum, Nucl.

[1981]; and Wetmur, Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 26:227-259 [1991]). In some embodiments, the polynucleotide encodes the polypeptide disclosed herein and hybridizes under defined conditions, such as moderately stringent or highly stringent conditions, to the complement of a sequence encoding an engineered proline hydroxylase enzyme of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0070">&#x201c;Hybridization stringency&#x201d; relates to hybridization conditions, such as washing conditions, in the hybridization of nucleic acids. Generally, hybridization reactions are performed under conditions of lower stringency, followed by washes of varying but higher stringency. The term &#x201c;moderately stringent hybridization&#x201d; refers to conditions that permit target-DNA to bind a complementary nucleic acid that has about 60% identity, preferably about 75% identity, about 85% identity to the target DNA, with greater than about 90% identity to target-polynucleotide. Exemplary moderately stringent conditions are conditions equivalent to hybridization in 50% formamide, 5&#xd7;Denhart's solution, 5&#xd7;SSPE, 0.2% SDS at 42&#xb0; C., followed by washing in 0.2&#xd7;SSPE, 0.2% SDS, at 42&#xb0; C. &#x201c;High stringency hybridization&#x201d; refers generally to conditions that are about 10&#xb0; C. or less from the thermal melting temperature T<sub>m </sub>as determined under the solution condition for a defined polynucleotide sequence. In some embodiments, a high stringency condition refers to conditions that permit hybridization of only those nucleic acid sequences that form stable hybrids in 0.018M NaCl at 65&#xb0; C. (i.e., if a hybrid is not stable in 0.018M NaCl at 65&#xb0; C., it will not be stable under high stringency conditions, as contemplated herein). High stringency conditions can be provided, for example, by hybridization in conditions equivalent to 50% formamide, 5&#xd7;Denhart's solution, 5&#xd7;SSPE, 0.2% SDS at 42&#xb0; C., followed by washing in 0.1&#xd7;SSPE, and 0.1% SDS at 65&#xb0; C. Another high stringency condition is hybridizing in conditions equivalent to hybridizing in 5&#xd7;SSC containing 0.1% (w:v) SDS at 65&#xb0; C. and washing in 0.1&#xd7;SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65&#xb0; C. Other high stringency hybridization conditions, as well as moderately stringent conditions, are described in the references cited above.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0071">&#x201c;Codon optimized&#x201d; refers to changes in the codons of the polynucleotide encoding a protein to those preferentially used in a particular organism such that the encoded protein is efficiently expressed in the organism of interest. Although the genetic code is degenerate in that most amino acids are represented by several codons, called &#x201c;synonyms&#x201d; or &#x201c;synonymous&#x201d; codons, it is well known that codon usage by particular organisms is nonrandom and biased towards particular codon triplets. This codon usage bias may be higher in reference to a given gene, genes of common function or ancestral origin, highly expressed proteins versus low copy number proteins, and the aggregate protein coding regions of an organism's genome. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides encoding the proline hydroxylase enzymes may be codon optimized for optimal production in the host organism selected for expression.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0072">&#x201c;Preferred, optimal, high codon usage bias codons&#x201d; refers interchangeably to codons that are used at higher frequency in the protein coding regions than other codons that code for the same amino acid. The preferred codons may be determined in relation to codon usage in a single gene, a set of genes of common function or origin, highly expressed genes, the codon frequency in the aggregate protein coding regions of the whole organism, codon frequency in the aggregate protein coding regions of related organisms, or combinations thereof. Codons whose frequency increases with the level of gene expression are typically optimal codons for expression. A variety of methods are known for determining the codon frequency (e.g., codon usage, relative synonymous codon usage) and codon preference in specific organisms, including multivariate analysis, for example, using cluster analysis or correspondence analysis, and the effective number of codons used in a gene (See e.g., GCG CodonPreference, Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Package; CodonW, Peden, University of Nottingham; McInerney, Bioinform., 14:372-73 [1998]; Stenico et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 222437-46 [1994]; Wright, Gene 87:23-29 [1990]). Codon usage tables are available for many different organisms (See e.g., Wada et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 20:2111-2118 [1992]; Nakamura et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 28:292 [2000]; Duret, et al., supra; Henaut and Danchin, in <i>Escherichia coli </i>and <i>Salmonella</i>, Neidhardt, et al. (eds.), ASM Press, Washington D.C., p. 2047-2066 [1996]). The data source for obtaining codon usage may rely on any available nucleotide sequence capable of coding for a protein. These data sets include nucleic acid sequences actually known to encode expressed proteins (e.g., complete protein coding sequences-CDS), expressed sequence tags (ESTS), or predicted coding regions of genomic sequences (See e.g., Mount, <i>Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis</i>, Chapter 8, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.

Thus, having knowledge of a particular amino acid sequence, those skilled in the art could make any number of different nucleic acids by simply modifying the sequence of one or more codons in a way which does not change the amino acid sequence of the protein.

The 5&#x2032; end of the coding sequence of the nucleic acid sequence may inherently contain a signal peptide coding region naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding region that encodes the secreted polypeptide. Alternatively, the 5&#x2032; end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding region that is foreign to the coding sequence. Any signal peptide coding region that directs the expressed polypeptide into the secretory pathway of a host cell of choice finds use for expression of the engineered proline hydroxylase polypeptides provided herein. Effective signal peptide coding regions for bacterial host cells include, but are not limited to the signal peptide coding regions obtained from the genes for <i>Bacillus </i>NC1B 11837 maltogenic amylase, <i>Bacillus stearothermophilus </i>alpha-amylase, <i>Bacillus licheniformis </i>subtilisin, <i>Bacillus licheniformis </i>beta-lactamase, <i>Bacillus stearothermophilus </i>neutral proteases (nprT, nprS, nprM), and <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>prsA. Further signal peptides are known in the art (See e.g., Simonen and Palva, Microbiol. Rev., 57:109-137 [1993]). Effective signal peptide coding regions for filamentous fungal host cells include, but are not limited to the signal peptide coding regions obtained from the genes for <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>TAKA amylase, <i>Aspergillus niger </i>neutral amylase, <i>Aspergillus niger </i>glucoamylase, <i>Rhizomucor miehei </i>aspartic proteinase, <i>Humicola insolens </i>cellulase, and <i>Humicola lanuginosa </i>lipase. Useful signal peptides for yeast host cells include, but are not limited to those from the genes for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>alpha-factor and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>invertase.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0220">In some embodiments, the control sequence is a propeptide coding region that codes for an amino acid sequence positioned at the amino terminus of a polypeptide. The resultant polypeptide is referred to as a &#x201c;proenzyme,&#x201d; &#x201c;propolypeptide,&#x201d; or &#x201c;zymogen,&#x201d; in some cases). A propolypeptide can be converted to a mature active polypeptide by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide from the propolypeptide. The propeptide coding region includes, but is not limited to the genes for <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>alkaline protease (aprE), <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>neutral protease (nprT), <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>alpha-factor, <i>Rhizomucor miehei </i>aspartic proteinase, and <i>Myceliophthora thermophila </i>lactase (See e.g., WO 95/33836). Where both signal peptide and propeptide regions are present at the amino terminus of a polypeptide, the propeptide region is positioned next to the amino terminus of a polypeptide and the signal peptide region is positioned next to the amino terminus of the propeptide region.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0221">In some embodiments, regulatory sequences are also utilized. These sequences facilitate the regulation of the expression of the polypeptide relative to the growth of the host cell. Examples of regulatory systems are those which cause the expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. In prokaryotic host cells, suitable regulatory sequences include, but are not limited to the lac, tac, and trp operator systems. In yeast host cells, suitable regulatory systems include, but are not limited to the ADH2 system or GAL1 system. In filamentous fungi, suitable regulatory sequences include, but are not limited to the TAKA alpha-amylase promoter, <i>Aspergillus niger </i>glucoamylase promoter, and <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>glucoamylase promoter.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0222">In another aspect, the present invention also provides a recombinant expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding an engineered proline hydroxylase polypeptide, and one or more expression regulating regions such as a promoter and a terminator, a replication origin, etc., depending on the type of hosts into which they are to be introduced. In some embodiments, the various nucleic acid and control sequences described above are combined together to produce a recombinant expression vector which includes one or more convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the variant proline hydroxylase polypeptide at such sites. Alternatively, the polynucleotide sequence(s) of the present invention are expressed by inserting the polynucleotide sequence or a nucleic acid construct comprising the polynucleotide sequence into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0223">The recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus), that can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can result in the expression of the variant proline hydroxylase polynucleotide sequence. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vectors may be linear or closed circular plasmids.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0224">In some embodiments, the expression vector is an autonomously replicating vector (i.e., a vector that exists as an extra-chromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, such as a plasmid, an extra-chromosomal element, a minichromosome, or an artificial chromosome). The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. In some alternative embodiments, the vector may be one which, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids which together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposon may be used.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0225">In some embodiments, the expression vector preferably contains one or more selectable markers, which permit easy selection of transformed cells. A &#x201c;selectable marker&#x201d; is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototrophy to auxotrophs, and the like. Examples of bacterial selectable markers include, but are not limited to the dal genes from <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>or <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i>, or markers, which confer antibiotic resistance such as ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol or tetracycline resistance. Suitable markers for yeast host cells include, but are not limited to ADE2, HIS3, LEU2, LYS2, MET3, TRP1, and URA3.

Further suitable reaction conditions for carrying out the process for biocatalytic conversion of substrate compounds to product compounds using an engineered proline hydroxylase polypeptide described herein can be readily optimized in view of the guidance provided herein by routine experimentation that includes, but is not limited to, contacting the engineered proline hydroxylase polypeptide and substrate compound under experimental reaction conditions of concentration, pH, temperature, and solvent conditions, and detecting the product compound.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0259">Suitable reaction conditions using the engineered proline hydroxylase polypeptides typically comprise a co-substrate, which is used stoichiometrically in the hydroxylation reaction. Generally, the co-substrate for proline hydroxylases is &#x3b1;-ketoglutarate, also referred to as &#x3b1;-ketoglutaric acid and 2-oxoglutaric acid. Other analogs of &#x3b1;-ketoglutarate that are capable of serving as co-substrates for proline hydroxylases can be used. An exemplary analog that may serve as a co-substrate is &#x3b1;-oxoadipate.

Generally, the divalent transition metal co-factor is ferrous ion (i.e., Fe<sup>+2</sup>). The ferrous ion may be provided in various forms, such as ferrous sulfate (FeSO<sub>4</sub>), ferrous chloride (FeCl<sub>2</sub>), ferrous carbonate (FeCO<sub>3</sub>), and the salts of organic acids such as citrates, lactates and fumarates. An exemplary source of ferrous sulfate is Mohr's salt, which is ferrous ammonium sulfate (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Fe(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>and is available in anhydrous and hydrated (i.e., hexahydrate) forms. While ferrous ion is the transition metal co-factor found in the naturally occurring proline hydroxylase and functions efficiently in the engineered enzymes, it is to be understood that other divalent transition metals capable of acting as a co-factor can be used in the processes.

In some embodiments, the reductant comprises ascorbic acid, typically L-ascorbic acid. While ascorbic acid is not required for the hydroxylation reaction, enzymatic activity is enhanced in its presence. Without being bound by theory, the ascorbate is believed to maintain or regenerate the enzyme-Fe<sup>+2 </sup>form, which is the active form mediating the hydroxylation reaction. Generally, the reaction conditions can comprise an ascorbic acid concentration that corresponds proportionately to the substrate loading. In some embodiments, the ascorbic acid is present in at least about 0.1 fold, 0.2 fold 0.3 fold, 0.5 fold, 0.75 fold, 1 fold, 1.5 fold, or at least 2 fold the molar amount of substrate.

The 02 may be present naturally in the reaction solution, or introduced and/or supplemented into the reaction artificially. In some embodiments, the reaction conditions can comprise forced aeration (e.g., sparging) with air, 02 gas, or other 02-containing gases. In some embodiments, the 02 in the reaction can be increased by increasing the pressure of the reaction with 02 or an 02-containing gas.

Suitable solvents include water, aqueous buffer solutions, organic solvents, polymeric solvents, and/or co-solvent systems, which generally comprise aqueous solvents, organic solvents and/or polymeric solvents. The aqueous solvent (water or aqueous co-solvent system) may be pH-buffered or unbuffered.

In some embodiments, the co-solvent can be a polar solvent, such as a polyol, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or lower alcohol. The non-aqueous co-solvent component of an aqueous co-solvent system may be miscible with the aqueous component, providing a single liquid phase, or may be partly miscible or immiscible with the aqueous component, providing two liquid phases. Exemplary aqueous co-solvent systems can comprise water and one or more co-solvents selected from an organic solvent, polar solvent, and polyol solvent. In general, the co-solvent component of an aqueous co-solvent system is chosen such that it does not adversely inactivate the proline hydroxylase enzyme under the reaction conditions. Appropriate co-solvent systems can be readily identified by measuring the enzymatic activity of the specified engineered proline hydroxylase enzyme with a defined substrate of interest in the candidate solvent system, utilizing an enzyme activity assay, such as those described herein.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0272">In some embodiments of the process, the suitable reaction conditions comprise an aqueous co-solvent, where the co-solvent comprises DMSO at about 1% to about 50% (v/v), about 1 to about 40% (v/v), about 2% to about 40% (v/v), about 5% to about 30% (v/v), about 10% to about 30% (v/v), or about 10% to about 20% (v/v).

Thus, according to these suitable reaction conditions, polypeptide is added to a solution having an initial substrate loading of at least about 20 g/L, 30 g/L, or 40 g/L. This addition of polypeptide is then followed by continuous addition of further substrate to the solution at a rate of about 2 g/L/h, 4 g/L/h, or 6 g/L/h until a much higher final substrate loading of at least about 30 g/L, 40 g/L, 50 g/L, 60 g/L, 70 g/L, 100 g/L, 150 g/L, 200 g/L or more, is reached.
