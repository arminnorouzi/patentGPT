No. 17/157,631, filed Jan. 25, 2021, which application claims the benefit of French Application No. 2000761, filed on Jan. 27, 2020, all of which applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the invention relate to integrated circuits and methods, in particular those including memory devices such as non-volatile static random access memory devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Non-volatile static random access memories &#x201c;NVSRAMs&#x201d; are memories which combine, in a single memory point storing a binary datum, Static Random Access Memory &#x201c;SRAM&#x201d; cells, and non-volatile memory, for example of the electrically erasable and programmable type such as Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory &#x201c;EEPROM.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">NVSRAM memories have the advantages of both technologies, that is to say, they do not lose information from the binary data when the circuit is off, and have unlimited write endurance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Indeed, the write operations of the memory during operation are done on the volatile cells, while the write operations in the non-volatile cells are only done at the time of a shutdown of the integrated circuit, to save the data present in the volatile memory cells.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, the almost only disadvantage of non-volatile static random access memories NVSRAM is the surface occupied by the memory points.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Indeed, in the conventional technologies, a dozen transistors are used in each memory point, with for example a typical SRAM cell with six transistors, assembled with a differential pair of non-volatile cells, for example of the flash memory type, typically including three transistors each.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another disadvantage is the presence of a capacitor to supply energy for non-volatile storage operations when the memory is powered off. Its value is typically of the order of a hundred microFarads &#x201c;&#x3bc;F,&#x201d; which negatively affects the congestion and the cost of these memories.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, it is desirable to benefit from more compact non-volatile static random access memories.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, according to one aspect, an integrated circuit is proposed, comprising a memory device including at least one memory point having a volatile memory cell and a single non-volatile memory cell coupled together to a common node, and a single selection transistor coupled between the common node and a single bit line, a first output of the volatile memory cell being coupled to the common node, while a second output of the volatile memory cell, complementary to the first output, is not connected to any node outside the volatile memory cell.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other words, one of the two outputs of the volatile memory cell is coupled to the single non-volatile memory cell, while the other of the two outputs of the volatile memory cell is not coupled to a non-volatile memory cell, nor even to any node not belonging to the volatile memory cell as such.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is thus proposed to use a single non-volatile memory cell per memory point, unlike conventional differential approaches wherein two non-volatile cells storing reverse data are each coupled to one of the two outputs of a volatile memory cell.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, instead of a pair of bit lines conventionally used in the differential approaches, a single bit line is coupled to the memory point for accessing it in particular in read and write.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The number of transistors in each NVSRAM memory point is thus reduced, and the size of the memory device is reduced.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to one embodiment, the volatile memory cell comprises a bi-stable latch including two inverters mounted antiparallel, and the non-volatile memory cell comprises a state transistor having a command gate and a floating gate and an access transistor coupled in series between the common node and the state transistor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Non-volatile memory cells corresponding to an EEPROM-type technology are thus proposed, which is in particular advantageously in terms of energy consumption in read and write.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The memory point can thus advantageously include a number of transistors equal to 7.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one embodiment, the at least one memory point further comprises an isolation transistor coupled in series between the common node and the volatile memory cell, for example to facilitate read operations in the non-volatile memory cell.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The memory point can thus advantageously include a number of transistors equal to 8.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to an advantageous embodiment, the memory device comprises a memory plane including a plurality of the memory points arranged in at least one memory word, and one local decoder per memory word comprising power lines coupled to power terminals of the volatile memory cells of the respective memory word, and configured to store a power status in a status register, a first value of the power status being representative of a non-operating state of the volatile memory cells of the respective memory word, a second value of the power status being representative of an operating state of the volatile memory cells of the respective memory word.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The power status allows for example conditioning the activation of the volatile or non-volatile memory cells of the respective memory word, and the power lines of the local decoder allow providing power voltages to the volatile memory cells of the corresponding memory word.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In embodiments defined hereinafter, sets of power voltages, each comprising a high level power voltage and a low level power voltage, are provided on the power lines of the decoder. These power voltages can be generated specifically for read or write operations in the corresponding memory word, for example in particular according to the power status.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to one embodiment, the local decoder is configured to maintain a first set of power voltages on the power lines, adapted for a functional powering of the volatile memory cells, as long as the power status has the second value.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, the volatile memory cells are powered in groups arranged in memory words, only if necessary, that is to say if the memory word has been written or modified, according to the power status. The volatile memory cells of the other memory words, in the non-operating state, are not powered.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one embodiment, the memory device further includes read means configured to generate first read signals adapted for timing read operations in the non-volatile memory cells of a selected memory word if the respective power status has the first value, and to generate second read signals adapted for timing read operations in the volatile memory cells of the selected memory word if the respective power status has the second value.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The read means are thus capable of reading directly from a non-volatile memory cell, as well as of reading directly from a volatile memory cell.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">And, as long as there is no data written in the volatile memory cells, the data are read in the non-volatile memory cells, the volatile memory cells not being otherwise powered; and, as soon as data are written in the volatile memory cells, the data are read in the volatile memory cells.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to one embodiment, the read means are configured to generate, among the first read signals, a second set of power voltages on the power lines of the selected memory word, adapted to impose a high impedance floating potential on the output coupled to the common node of the volatile memory cells.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The volatile memory cell is thus placed in a high impedance state on the positive output, in order to avoid interfering with a signal on the common access node originating from the volatile memory cell, during the reading of the non-volatile memory cell.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to one embodiment, the read means comprise a read amplifier configured to generate, among the first and second read signals, a pre-charge voltage on the bit line of a memory point which is read, and to detect a variation in current or voltage on the bit line, during a read operation in the non-volatile memory cell and during a read operation in the volatile memory cell.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In other words, the volatile memory cell is read in the same way as the non-volatile memory cell, by means of a read amplifier advantageously allowing reliable and controlled readings.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, the pre-charge voltage can advantageously be selected to avoid causing parasitic switching of the datum stored in the volatile memory cell.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to one embodiment, the memory device further comprises write means configured to generate first write signals adapted for timing write operations in the volatile memory cells of a selected memory word independently of the value of the power status, the local decoder of the respective memory word being configured to provide the power status with the second value, after a write operation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, all the writes, during normal operation of the integrated circuit, are made in the volatile memory cells, which are moreover permanently powered from the first write. The non-volatile memory cells are not used to store the data at each modification, which limits their wear.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to one embodiment, the write means are configured to generate, among the first write signals, a third set of power voltages on the power lines of the selected memory word adapted to cease the function of the volatile memory cells, then a datum signal to be stored on the common node imposed via the bit line of the memory points of the selected memory word, and then a first set of power voltages on the power lines, adapted for a functional powering of the volatile memory cells.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">This write operation allows writing data in volatile memory cells with a single asymmetric bit line, without differential writing on the complementary output, in a reliable manner and without electrical conflict between the power lines and the volatile memory cell outputs.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to one embodiment, the write means are configured to generate, among the first write signals, a fourth set of power voltages on the power lines of the selected memory word, adapted for discharging the polarizations of internal nodes of the volatile memory cells of the selected memory word, before generating the third set of power voltages.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to one embodiment, the write means are configured to generate second write signals adapted for timing a write operation of the non-volatile memory cells with a datum recorded in the volatile memory cell of the corresponding memory point, in all the memory words whose respective power status has the second value, in the case of shutdown of the memory device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The non-volatile memory cells are thus automatically written with the present datum stored in the respective volatile memory cell, when implementing non-volatile writing.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, a shutdown of the integrated memory circuit can come from a stop command, or from an unexpected loss of power, for example in the event of a failure or disconnection of a power source.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The non-volatile writing can optionally be simultaneous with all the memory words of the memory plane whose respective status is representative of an operating state of the volatile memory cells.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The write operation of the non-volatile memory cells can comprise an erase cycle followed by a programming cycle each comprising charge injections into the floating gate of the state transistor by Fowler-Nordheim effect.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus, according to one embodiment, the write means are configured to generate, among the second write signals, an erase voltage on the command gate of the state transistor, and a first programming voltage on the command gate of the state transistor as well as a fifth set of power voltages on the power lines of the volatile memory cells adapted to bring the common node to a second programming voltage, in the memory words whose respective power status has the second value.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In other words, the erase voltage applied to the command gate of the state transistor alone allows the erasure by Fowler-Nordheim effect to be implemented.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The programming voltage is in turn configured on two components, according to a technique known as shared voltage technique, one being applied to the command gate of the state transistor, the other component being applied to the drain of the state transistor from the positive output of the volatile memory cell. The two components are selected so that a high level datum on the positive output causes programming by Fowler-Nordheim effect, and that a low level datum on the positive output does not generate a Fowler-Nordheim effect regarding the first component.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to one embodiment, the integrated circuit further comprises a power device comprising a main power stage intended to supply a first power voltage adapted for the operation of the memory device, and a secondary power stage intended to supply a second power voltage adapted for powering the write operation of the non-volatile memory cells in the case of shutdown of the memory device.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Advantageously, the secondary power stage includes a capacitor intended to be charged at the second power voltage, and a first charge pump circuit configured to generate the second power voltage from the first power voltage, at a level higher than the level of the first power voltage.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Increasing the level of the second power voltage to charge the capacitor allows reducing the capacitive value allowing a sufficient amount of energy to be stored, and therefore reducing the size and cost of the capacitor.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The power device may further comprise at least one high voltage generator incorporated into the write means of the memory device, for generating the second write signals adapted for timing the write operation of the non-volatile memory cells, and, the high voltage generator advantageously comprises a plurality of elementary charge pump stages, the stages being adapted to be coupled in series so as to accumulate respective amplifications of the second power voltage, and a command means configured to measure the present value of the second power voltage and to command successive couplings of elementary charge pump stages in the series, following a decrease in the present value of the second power voltage.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The high-voltage generator including such a charge pump device with variable number of stages allows not only adapting a possible faster drop in the second power voltage coming from a smaller capacitor, but also optimally using the available energy supplied by the capacitor. Optimising the use of energy limits energy losses, and allows further reducing the size of the capacitor.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to another aspect, a method for commanding a memory device as defined above is proposed, the memory device comprising a memory plane including a plurality of the memory points arranged in at least one memory word. The method comprises storing a power status for each memory word, a first value of the power status being representative of a non-operating state of the volatile memory cells of the respective memory word, a second value of the power status being representative of an operating state of the volatile memory cells of the respective memory word.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to one embodiment, the method comprises maintaining a first set of power voltages powering in an operational state the volatile memory cells of the memory words whose power status has the second value.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to one embodiment, the method further comprises generating first read signals timing read operations in the non-volatile memory cells of a selected memory word if the respective power status has the first value, and generating second read signals timing read operations in the volatile memory cells of the selected memory word if the respective power status has the second value.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to one embodiment, the method comprises generating, among the first read signals, a second set of power voltages imposing a high impedance floating potential on the output coupled to the common node, in the volatile memory cells of the selected memory word.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to one embodiment, the method comprises generating, among the first and second read signals, a pre-charge voltage on the bit line of a memory point, and detecting a variation in current or voltage on the bit line, during a read operation in the volatile memory cell and during a read operation in the non-volatile memory cell.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to one embodiment, the method further comprises generating first write signals timing write operations in the volatile memory cells of a selected memory word independently of the value of the power status, and providing the respective power status with the second value, after a write operation.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to one embodiment, the method comprises generating, among the first write signals, a third set of power voltages powering the volatile memory cells of the selected memory word, so as to cease the function of the volatile memory cells, then a datum signal to be stored on the common node imposed via the bit line of the memory points of the selected memory word, and then a first set of power voltages powering the volatile memory cells of the selected memory word in an operational state.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to one embodiment, the method further comprises generating, among the first write signals, a fourth set of power voltages powering the volatile memory cells of the selected memory word so as to discharge the polarizations of internal nodes of the volatile memory cells of the selected memory word, before each generation of the third set of power voltages.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to one embodiment, the method further comprises generating second write signals timing a write operation of the non-volatile memory cells with a datum recorded in the volatile memory cell of the corresponding memory point, in all the memory words whose respective power status has the second value, in the case of shutdown of the memory device.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to one embodiment, the method comprises generating, among the second write signals, an erase voltage on the command gate of the state transistor, and a first programming voltage on the command gate of the state transistor as well as a fifth set of power voltages powering the volatile memory cells so as to bring the common node to a second programming voltage, in the memory words whose respective power status has the second value.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Some features mentioned above for an NVSRAM-type memory device, in particular the write and read operations in the volatile memory cells, can also be applied to an SRAM type memory device as such having a &#x201c;mono bit line&#x201d; structure, that is to say configured to access in read and write in a memory cell by a single bit line.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Also, according to another aspect, an integrated circuit is proposed, comprising a static volatile memory device including at least one memory point having a static volatile memory cell coupled to a single bit line, the static volatile memory cell comprising a first output and a second output complementary to the first output, and a single selection transistor coupled between the first output and a single bit line, the second output of the static volatile memory cell not being connected to any node outside the static volatile memory cell.</p><p id="p-0064"
