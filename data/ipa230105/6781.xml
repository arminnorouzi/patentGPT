The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and can be practiced using one or more other implementations. In one or more implementations, structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Wireless communications use frequency bands allocated from the radio spectrum to transfer data between electronic devices. The frequency bands may be divided into channels that are modulated with data to be transmitted between the electronic devices. Modulation schemes such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) may divide a channel into multiple orthogonal sub-carriers or tones. The sub-carriers or tones may be equally spaced across the channel with an equal allocation of bandwidth to each sub-carrier or tone. The sequence of sub-carriers or tones positioned at each instance of a regular interval across the channel represents a contiguous range of sub-carriers or tones. A data stream may be divided into multiple sub-streams that are used to modulate respective sub-carriers or tones that are transmitted in parallel between electronic devices. For purposes of this description, the terms &#x201c;sub-carrier&#x201d; and &#x201c;tone&#x201d; are synonymous and may be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Under an OFDMA modulation scheme, the tones of a channel may be allocated or divided into resource units. A resource unit may be a set of multiple tones that are assignable as a unit to an electronic device for communications with that electronic device. The size of a resource unit may refer to the number of tones allocated to that resource unit and may vary. A channel may have more than one resource unit of a given size and a particular tone may be allocated to multiple resource units having different respective sizes. For example, a 20 MHz channel (e.g., 5150 MHz to 5170 MHz in a 5 GHz frequency band) may be divided into 256 tones each having a bandwidth of 78.125 kHz, with 242 of the tones being available for transmission. The tones of the 20 MHz channel may be allocated across nine resource units with 26 tones per resource unit (RU26), across four resource units with 52 tones per resource unit (RU52), across two resource units with 106 tones per resource unit (RU106), and/or to a single resource unit having 242 tones (RU242). This allocation of tones is presented as an example and is not intended to limit the scope of the subject technology.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A tone plan may identify the different resource units available in a channel and the tones allocated to each resource unit. The tone plan may be stored as a data structure that is referenced by an electronic device, such as an access point or base station, when managing wireless communication links with other electronic devices. For example, an electronic device may select a resource unit from the tone plan and assign that resource unit for communications with another electronic device. Communications between the two electronic devices are facilitated by modulating the tones allocated to the selected resource unit with data being transferred between the electronic devices. The size of the resource unit selected may vary depending on the bandwidth needs and/or the priority of data traffic between the electronic devices. In addition, more than one resource unit of the same size or of different sizes may be selected and assigned for communications between a pair of electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Frequency bands allocated for wireless communications may have regulatory limitations placed on their use. For example, transmissions using a particular frequency band may have a maximum allowable power spectral density (e.g., &#x2212;1 dBm/MHz). Limiting the power spectral density limits the operational range of a system using that frequency band. The subject technology proposes to spread out the tones allocated to a resource unit across a wider bandwidth relative to the bandwidth that would be covered if contiguous tones were allocated. In this manner, transmission power and range can be increased using the spread-out tones compared to the contiguous tones while still complying with power spectral density limitations. Furthermore, the subject technology proposes to regularly space the tones allocated from the contiguous range of tones of a given channel in order to reduce the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) compared to an allocation of tones that are irregularly spaced. Reducing the PAPR may increase the efficiency of power amplifiers used in transmission circuits. These and other advantages will be apparent based on the further description below.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example network environment in which wireless communications may be implemented in accordance with aspects of the subject technology.

The subject technology is not limited to these components both in number and type, and may be implemented using more components or fewer components than are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to aspects of the subject technology, communication module <b>250</b> comprises a computer program having one or more sequences of instructions or code together with associated data and settings. Upon processor <b>210</b> executing the instructions or code, one or more processes are initiated, for example, to establish and maintain wireless communication links with other electronic devices via wireless network interface <b>220</b>, select resource units from tone plan <b>260</b> for the wireless communication links, and to facilitate communication of packets, frames, symbols, etc. between electronic device <b>200</b> and one or more other electronic devices via wireless network interface <b>220</b> using the tones allocated to the selected resource units. The size and number of resource units selected for communications with another electronic device may be selected based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, type of data (e.g., media stream, messaging, data storage, monitoring, etc.), expected data rate, quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees, and/or communication capabilities of the other electronic device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to aspects of the subject technology, tone plan <b>260</b> may be a data structure that includes data values identifying the different resource units available in a channel and the tones allocated to each resource unit. Tone plan <b>260</b> may include tone plans for multiple channels of different bandwidths. For example, tone plan <b>260</b> may include a tone plan for a 20 MHz channel, a 40 MHz channel, and/or an 80 MHz channel. The subject technology is not limited to this number of channels or these bandwidths and may be implemented for more or fewer channels having the same or different bandwidths.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a diagram illustrating a distributed tone plan for a 20 MHz channel according to aspects of the subject technology. Tone plan <b>300</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> includes three tone sub-plans for different-sized resource units, respectively. The first tone sub-plan is for resource units each allocated 26 tones (RU26). The second tone sub-plan is for resource units each allocated 52 tones (RU52). The third tone sub-plan is for resource units each allocated 106 tones (RU106).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning to the first tone sub-plan for RU26, tones from a contiguous range of tones are distributed across the different RU26 resource units. Rather than allocating contiguous groups of tones to each resource unit, the subject technology allocates tones that are spaced apart from each other in the contiguous range of tones. For example, RU26<sub>1 </sub>is allocated every ninth tone indexed in the contiguous range of tones starting at &#x2212;119 to &#x2212;11 and starting again at 7 to 115. Similarly, RU26<sub>2 </sub>is allocated every ninth tone indexed in the contiguous range of tones starting at &#x2212;115 to &#x2212;7 and starting again at 11 to 119. This allocation pattern results in the tones allocated to each resource unit having a spacing in the contiguous range of tones of an integer multiple of a factor of nine. Specifically, the allocated tones have a spacing of nine apart from each other with the exception of the tones on either side of DC, which have a spacing of 18 (i.e., two times the factor of nine). The RU26<sub>3 </sub>to RU26<sub>9 </sub>resource units are allocated tones having the spacing of an integer multiple of the factor of nine but starting and ending at different index points.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The factor of nine used in this example is equal to the number of the RU26 resource units in the tone sub-plan. Using this factor maximizes the spread of the tones allocated to each resource unit across the 20 MHz channel, which allows transmission power to be boosted relative to tone plans that allocated contiguous tones to each resource unit while remaining within allowable PSD limits. For example, this allocation of tones across the RU26 resource units results in an average of 2 tones/MHz, which allows for a boost of 8.1 dB compared to conventional tone plans while still remining with allowable PSD limits. The regular spacing of integer multiples of the factor of nine reduces the PAPR, which helps with the efficiency of the power amplifiers used to transmit the tones.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As indicated in the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the second tone sub-plan allocates the tones from two of the RU26 resource units to each of the RU52 resource units.

Similarly, the third tone plan allocates the tones from two of the RU52 resource units, plus two additional tones, to each of the RU106 resource units.

The allocation of tones for the second and third tone sub-plans may be designed to minimize the number of tones per a sliding 1 MHz window.
