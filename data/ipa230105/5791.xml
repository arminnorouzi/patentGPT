id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing chips with laminated die-attach layers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">According to semiconductor device fabrication processes, a semiconductor wafer with a plurality of devices formed thereon is divided into a plurality of semiconductor devices.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Dicing apparatuses that use a cutting blade or a laser beam have been in widespread use for dividing wafers. Processes using plasma etching have also been customary to divide wafers. There has also been proposed a process for processing wafers with laminated die-attach films by way of plasma etching (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2009-18797).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In case die-attach layers are used in mounting devices on boards, a die-attach layer is formed on a wafer before the wafer is fragmented into device chips, and the wafer is divided together with the die-attach layer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fluorine-based gases that are widely used in plasma etching processes for dividing wafers are unable to process die-attach layers laminated on the wafers. Therefore, it has been common to divide a wafer with a laminated die-attach layer by processing the wafer by way of plasma etching and then processing the laminated die-attach layer with another dicing apparatus. Since this common practice involves an increased number of working steps, it is tedious and time-consuming and leaves much to be improved.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing chips with laminated die-attach layers while avoiding an increase in the number of working steps thereof.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing chips with laminated die-attach layers, including a preparing step of preparing a wafer unit in which a wafer having a plurality of devices formed in respective areas demarcated on a face side thereof by a plurality of intersecting projected dicing lines established thereon is affixed to a tape with a die-attach layer being interposed therebetween, the die-attach layer including fillers, the tape is mounted on an annular frame, the devices are protected by a protective member, and the face side of the wafer is exposed along the projected dicing lines; a wafer processing step of supplying a first gas to the wafer unit and performing plasma etching on the wafer from the face side thereof to divide the wafer and expose the die-attach layer along the projected dicing lines; after the wafer processing step, a die-attach layer processing step of supplying a second gas to the wafer unit and performing plasma etching on the die-attach layer from the face side of the wafer; and after the die-attach layer processing step, a cleaning step of ejecting a fluid to the face side of the wafer to remove filler residuals that have remained along the projected dicing lines in the die-attach layer processing step from the wafer unit.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the cleaning step includes the step of ejecting the fluid to the face side of the wafer along the projected dicing lines. Preferably, the cleaning step includes the step of ejecting the fluid to the face side of the wafer while the face side of the wafer is facing downwardly.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, the method of manufacturing chips is advantageous in that the number of working steps required to manufacture the chips each with the laminated die-attach layer is prevented from increasing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention and the manner of realizing them will become more apparent, and the invention itself will best be understood from a study of the following description and appended claims with reference to the attached drawings showing some preferred embodiments of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"
