The firearm barrel with non-metal outer sleeve preferably includes a firearm barrel, a first non-metal tube, a second non-metal tube, a sleeve nut and a coupler bushing. The firearm barrel includes an elongated tube. A barrel inner diameter is formed through a length of the elongated tube. A lead-in bore is formed concentric with the barrel inner diameter at an entrance end of the elongated tube. A threaded tap is preferably formed in the entrance end of the elongated tube to threadably receive an extension barrel. Suitable twist rifling is then applied to the barrel inner diameter. Material is preferably removed from the elongated tube to form an end flange, a reduced outer diameter, a first raised sleeve support section and a raised coupler section. The end flange is formed on an entrance end of the elongated tube. The first sleeve support is formed near the end flange. The raised coupler section is formed in substantially a middle of the elongated tube. A gas escape hole is formed through the raised coupler section to the barrel inner diameter. A sleeve thread is formed on an exit end of the elongated tube. The firearm barrel is preferably fabricated from any suitable steel, but other materials may also be used.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The coupler bushing includes a bushing inner diameter, a first reduced diameter and a second reduced diameter. The first reduced diameter is formed on a first end of the coupler bushing and the second reduced diameter end formed on a second end thereof. A combination gas escape and fastener hole is formed through the coupler bushing. The bushing inner diameter is sized to slidably receive an outer diameter of the raised coupler section. The coupler bushing is preferably fabricated from any suitable metal, such as steel. The first non-metal tube includes a first tube inner diameter and a plurality of first openings are formed through a wall of the first non-metal tube. The plurality of first openings may have any suitable spacing, size and shape. The first tube inner diameter is sized to slidably receive an outer diameter of the first raised sleeve support section and the first reduced diameter. The first non-metal tube is preferably fabricated from carbon fiber, but other non-metal materials could also be used.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The sleeve nut preferably includes a tube end and a rotation flange. The rotation flange is formed on an end of the tube end. A threaded bore is formed through a length of the sleeve nut to threadably receive the sleeve thread of the elongated tube. A plurality of holes are preferably formed in the rotation flange to receive pins of a spanner wrench. However, wrench flats could be formed on an outer perimeter of the rotation flange. The second non-metal tube includes a second tube inner diameter and a plurality of second openings are formed through a wall of the second non-metal tube. The plurality of second openings may have any suitable spacing, size and shape. The second tube inner diameter is sized to slidably receive an outer diameter of the second reduced diameter and the tube end of the sleeve nut. The second non-metal tube is preferably fabricated from carbon fiber, but other non-metal materials could also be used.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The firearm barrel with non-metal outer sleeve is preferably assembled in the following manner. The first non-metal tube is slid over the exit end of the elongated tube on to the first raised sleeve support section. The coupler bushing is slid over the exit end of the elongated tube and on to the raised coupler section. The first reduced diameter of the coupler bushing is slid into the first tube inner diameter of the first non-metal tube. The combination gas escape and fastener hole of the bushing sleeve is aligned with the gas escape hole of the elongated barrel. A gas block is slid over the bushing sleeve. A threaded fastener is inserted through a hole in the gas block and the combination gas escape and fastener hole and threaded into a threaded tap in one end of the combination gas escape and fastener hole. The second non-metal tube is slid over the exit end of the elongated tube and on to the second reduced diameter of the coupler bushing. The sleeve nut is threaded onto the sleeve thread to retain the first and second non-metal tubes on the elongated tube.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A second embodiment of a firearm barrel with non-metal outer sleeve preferably includes a second firearm barrel, a non-metal tube and the sleeve nut. The second firearm barrel includes a second elongated tube. A second barrel inner diameter is formed through a length of the second elongated tube. Suitable twist rifling is applied to the second barrel inner diameter. Material is preferably removed from the second elongated tube to form an end taper, a reduced outer diameter and a raised sleeve support section. The end taper is formed near an entrance of the second elongated tube. The raised sleeve support section is formed adjacent the end taper. The raised sleeve preferably includes a straight knurled portion disposed in front of the raised sleeve support section. A sleeve thread is formed on an exit end of the second elongated tube. The firearm barrel is preferably fabricated from any suitable steel, but other materials may also be used.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The non-metal tube includes a tube inner diameter and a plurality of openings formed through a wall of the non-metal tube. The plurality of openings may have any suitable spacing, size and shape. The tube inner diameter is sized to slidably receive an outer diameter of the raised sleeve support section and the first reduced diameter. The non-metal tube is preferably fabricated from carbon fiber, but other non-metal materials could also be used.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The second embodiment of the firearm barrel with non-metal outer sleeve is preferably assembled in the following manner.
