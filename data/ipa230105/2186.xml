However, neither of the descriptions should be taking as limiting the present disclosure in any way. For any single technical feature described or implied in the embodiments mentioned herein or any single technical feature shown or implied in individual drawings, the present disclosure still allows for any combination or deletion of these technical features (or equivalents thereof) without any technical obstacle. Therefore, it should be considered that these more embodiments according to the present disclosure are also within the scope recorded in this document.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this document, technical terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, and &#x201c;third&#x201d; are only used for the purpose of distinguishing expressions and are not intended to indicate their order and relative importance. The technical term &#x201c;movable device&#x201d; broadly refers to devices such as robots and detection terminals that can be used in an elevator system and can move in an active or passive manner (such as being carried by people). The technical term &#x201c;robot&#x201d; broadly refers to all machine devices that can perform tasks automatically, which may be used to replace or assist humans in many types of affairs, such as sending and receiving objects (such as documents, packages, food, etc.), guiding or accompanying users in taking the elevator, assisting users in calling the elevator, performing equipment inspections, and performing firefighting tasks, etc. The technical term &#x201c;communication network&#x201d; includes various forms of networks constructed using wireless method, wired method, or a combination of wireless and wired methods.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>5</b></figref>, these drawings schematically illustrate specific scenes when several embodiments of the communication network switching system according to the present disclosure are used for communication network switching. Although a robot is used as an example, it should be understood that the present disclosure is also applicable to any possible movable device such as a space positioning terminal that can be carried and used by the staff during elevator system maintenance. Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in detail through the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">First, a typical building application scene according to the solution of the present disclosure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in which a single-floor space <b>10</b> in the building where the elevator system is located is shown, and a floor area <b>1011</b> and an elevator car area <b>1012</b> passing through/parking in the floor area <b>1011</b> during the lifting/lowering movement are shown. A wireless communication network can be arranged through one or more transmitters <b>1031</b> located in the floor area <b>1011</b> so as to at least partially cover the floor area <b>1011</b>, so that the wireless communication network can be used to provide a corresponding communication link for the device such as robot in the floor area <b>1011</b>. In addition, another wireless communication network can be arranged through one or more transmitters <b>1032</b> located in the elevator car area <b>1012</b> so as to at least partially cover the elevator car area <b>1012</b>, so that this wireless communication network can be used to provide a corresponding communication link for the device such as robot in the elevator car area <b>1012</b>. It should be understood that the wireless signal coverages of the above two wireless communication networks may or may not have overlapping parts.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It should be pointed out that the present disclosure does not impose any restrictions on the communication protocol (such as WI-FI, ZIGBEE, etc.), operating frequency, and transmission power of the above two wireless communication networks respectively, as long as they can provide a physical link for the movable device such as the robot to communicate with the outside such as the elevator system, a robot management system, other robots, and a cloud.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Through the above arrangement, two different communication networks can exist in different areas of the building and the elevator system. For example, the above-mentioned floor area (a fixed area) and elevator car area (a movable area) are completely or partly covered by two wireless communication networks, thereby providing basic conditions for the device such as robot to choose a more suitable communication link therefrom. This is completely impossible in all existing elevator systems. The industry has long been accustomed to setting up a single communication network in these existing elevator systems, and making the single communication network cover most areas of the building and elevator system as much as possible. People in the industry has always been accustomed to providing stronger wireless signals and larger network coverage for the single communication network by increasing the transmission power of wireless devices or increasing the number of transmission devices. This will cause undesired situations such as communication signal interruption, network communication delay, unstable working performance, and battery power consumption to the device such as robot when such a communication network is always searching for the wireless network signal with the strongest signal strength.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the solution of the present disclosure, when the movable device such as a robot is working in the elevator system environment, its current movement characteristics (such as a spatial location, a movement speed, a movement direction, and any other characteristic related to the movement state) can be obtained. Then, a judgment is made based on the obtained current movement characteristics, so that the movable device such as the robot can be switched between the two wireless communication networks mentioned above when necessary, so as to select a more suitable communication link therefrom to communicate with the outside, thereby effectively alleviating or eliminating the problems of network communication delay, communication signal interruption and unstable working performance.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As an example, after the current spatial location of the movable device is obtained, it can be determined whether it is located in the fixed area (such as the floor area <b>1011</b>) or the movable area (such as the elevator car area <b>1012</b>) at this time, so that the wireless communication network corresponding to the area can be selected for the communication link. For example, once it is judged that the movable device has moved from the fixed area to the movable area according to the obtained current spatial location, it can be switched from the originally used communication network in the fixed area to the communication network in the current movable area, and vice versa. The above switching operation for the communication network may optionally be performed after a door of the elevator car is opened.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For another example, if it is found after detection that the movement speed of the movable device has changed, such as exceeding a first threshold (which may be set according to different applications; for example, it may be set to 5 m/s, 8 m/s, 10 m/s, etc.), it usually indicates in this case that the movable device has entered the elevator car area that is moving at a relatively high speed from the floor area that was originally moving at a relatively low speed, so that the movable device can be switched from the originally used communication network in the fixed area to the current communication network in the elevator car area. Similarly, if it is found that the movement speed of the movable device has decreased from a previous higher speed to be smaller than a second threshold (which may be set according to different applications; for example, it may be set to 6 m/s, 5 m/s, 2 m/s, etc.; the second threshold and the above-mentioned first threshold may be the same or different from each other), then it can indicate that the movable device has entered the floor area moving at a relatively low speed from the elevator car area that was originally moving at a relatively high speed. Therefore, the movable device can be switched from the originally used communication network in the movable area to the current communication network in the fixed area.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It can be understood that since the movement direction of the movable device moving in the fixed area such as the floor area <b>1011</b> may basically maintain a substantially horizontal direction, and when it enters the elevator car, it will follow the up-and-down lifting/lowering movement of the elevator car; at this time, its movement direction will be obviously different from the substantially horizontal movement direction when it was previously in the fixed area. For example, the two directions usually form an angle difference of about 90&#xb0;. By detecting the movement direction of the movable device, it can be judged whether the movable device is currently in the fixed area or the movable area, or it has moved from the fixed area to the movable area, or it has moved from the movable area to the fixed area, etc. Therefore, the communication network corresponding to the newly entered area can be selected to complete the switching operation of the communication link.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be noted that in the present disclosure, many feasible ways are allowed to obtain the current movement characteristics of the movable device such as the robot, and different types of movement characteristics may be used alone or in combination to judge whether the movable device needs to the network switching operation.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, the spatial location data (such as coordinate data, image data, etc.) of the movable device can be obtained by one or more detection devices arranged in the movable device, the elevator system and/or the building. Such detection devices may include, but are not limited to, for example, height sensors and/or scanning devices installed on the movable device, wireless beacons installed in the building and/or the elevator system, and camera devices installed in the movable device, the building and/or the elevator system, etc. For another example, a movement detection device (such as a displacement sensor, a gyroscope, a lidar, etc.) may be used to obtain the movement speed data and/or movement direction data of the movable device. Such movement detection devices may be installed in the movable device, the elevator system and/or the building according to specific application requirements.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a robot <b>102</b> may be configured to detect its own current location in the space <b>10</b>; for example, it can accurately determine its current location (such as reaching the centimeter level, etc.). If it is determined that it is currently in the elevator car area <b>1012</b>, then it is connected to the wireless communication network constructed by the transmitter <b>1032</b>; otherwise, if it is determined that it is currently in the floor area <b>1011</b>, then it is connected to the wireless communication network constructed by the transmitter <b>1031</b>. However, in some embodiments, the robot <b>102</b> may not need to accurately identify its current location; for example, it may only have to determine whether it is currently in the elevator car area <b>1012</b> or the floor area <b>1011</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a feasible solution in which there is no need to specifically identify the location of the robot <b>102</b>, but to identify the area where it is located. An information characteristic <b>1034</b> (such as a two-dimensional code, etc.) configured to indicate the location may be posted in the elevator car area <b>1012</b>, and an information characteristic <b>1033</b> (such as a two-dimensional code, etc.) configured to indicate the location may also be posted in the floor area <b>1011</b>. If the robot <b>102</b> scans and identifies the information of the information characteristic <b>1033</b> through the scanning device installed on it, it can be judged that the robot <b>102</b> is in the floor area <b>1011</b>; on the contrary, if the information of the information characteristic <b>1034</b> is identified, it can be judged that the robot <b>102</b> is in the elevator car area <b>1012</b>. According to different applications, the information characteristic <b>1033</b> and the information characteristic <b>1034</b> configured to indicate the location information may be posted at any suitable location; for example, they may be arranged at a boundary between the elevator car area <b>1012</b> and the floor area <b>1011</b>, so that the robot <b>102</b> can identify the conversion of the spatial area at the first time.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For another example, in some embodiments, image data associated with the area where the movable device is located may be pre-stored in the movable device, the elevator system, and/or the cloud, etc., such as images of at least a part of the floors in the building (such as floor number and other distinguishable signs, etc.), images of some devices or apparatuses in the elevator system, maps of an internal environment of the building, etc.; then one or more detection devices arranged in the movable device, the elevator system, and/or the building are used to obtain the image data of the current environment in which the movable device is located. By analyzing and judging the obtained image data and the pre-stored image data, the current location of the movable device can be determined; for example, it can be judged whether it is currently in the floor area of the building or in the elevator car area.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, these drawings respectively show the determination of the current location of the robot based on several different spatial location data processing methods in an exemplary manner. As described above, spatial location data (such as image data, etc.) related to the building and/or the elevator system may be pre-stored in a storage part <b>30</b> (<b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) on the robot <b>302</b> (<b>402</b>, <b>502</b>), so that the robot <b>302</b> (<b>402</b>) <b>502</b>) can determine its own location based on these pre-stored spatial location data and the spatial location data in the current environment that can be collected in real time. In some other embodiments, the robot <b>102</b> may also obtain pre-stored spatial location data related to at least a part of the space <b>10</b> from the elevator system, the cloud, etc., so as to determine the current location of the robot <b>102</b> in the space <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Specifically, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the robot <b>302</b> may obtain the spatial location data based on an inertial device (such as a gyroscope, a collision sensor, etc.), and then perform matching analysis processing with pre-stored map data to determine the location. For example, the robot <b>302</b> can use the aforementioned inertial device to measure in the space <b>30</b> to form a trajectory <b>31</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>; then, the trajectory <b>31</b> and the map data stored in the robot <b>302</b> are subjected to coordinate matching analysis processing to determine the current location of the robot <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, in the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the robot <b>402</b> and the robot <b>502</b> can be respectively used to obtain image information (such as including distance information, etc.) in the space <b>40</b> and the space <b>50</b> based on a visual device (such as a camera, etc.) and a laser device (such as a lidar, etc.). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> schematically show characteristics <b>41</b> and <b>51</b> that can be extracted from the above image information respectively; then the above characteristics and the pre-stored map data are subjected to matching analysis processing so that the current locations of the robot <b>402</b> and the robot <b>502</b> can be determined.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the above, a single floor in a building is used as an example, and the principles of some examples in the solutions of the present disclosure have been described in detail. It should be understood that the floor area of the building may include multiple floors, the first communication network may be arranged in some or all of the floors, and the second communication network may be correspondingly arranged in the elevator system at the same time. As an example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a space <b>20</b> can be divided into floor areas <b>211</b>-<b>214</b>, a hoistway <b>22</b>, as well as an elevator car area <b>221</b> and a machine room <b>23</b> in the hoistway <b>22</b>, and wireless communication networks are arranged in each of the floor areas <b>211</b>-<b>214</b>. The wireless communication networks that can be emitted by multiple APs (Access Point, at least one AP may be set on each floor) belong to the same network for the movable device such as the robot, so the above networks can be used without changing any configuration. For example, the wireless communication networks in the floor areas <b>211</b>-<b>214</b> may have the same network identification, authentication information, etc., and these wireless communication networks and their possibly existing subordinate nodes may establish a connection with the machine room <b>23</b>. When the movable device such as the robot is working under the same network constructed by multiple APs, which AP to connect can be specifically selected according to the strength of the wireless signal.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Similarly, several relay points can be optionally arranged as needed in the hoistway <b>22</b> for wireless relay, so as to better realize the connection of the wireless communication networks in the elevator car area <b>221</b> and the possibly existing subordinate nodes to the machine room <b>23</b>. In specific applications, the above-mentioned first communication network and second communication network can be constructed to form a mesh network.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an example of an elevator machine room is schematically shown in this figure. As shown in the figure, a router <b>61</b>, an elevator controller <b>62</b> and the like may be arranged in a machine room <b>60</b>. LAN ports (LAN1-LAN3) of the router <b>61</b> can be respectively connected to the two communication networks described above and the elevator controller <b>62</b> (specifically connected to a connection circuit board <b>621</b>). As an optional situation, a WAN port of the router <b>61</b> can be connected to an external network <b>63</b>, so that the devices under the LAN ports have the Internet access function. The elevator controller <b>62</b> may include a connection circuit board <b>621</b>, and a GECB control board (Global Elevator Control Board) <b>622</b>. According to this configuration, the movable device such as the robot, for which a communication link is established via the first communication network or the second communication network, can communicate with the GECB control board <b>622</b> so as to perform functions such as elevator calling and equipment detection.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It should be noted that two wireless communication networks have been used as an exemplary description in the above. However, in actual applications, the above communication networks are all allowed to be a wired communication network. For example, a wired network interface may be arranged in the elevator car area to provide the communication link. Once the movable device such as the robot enters the elevator car, it can be inserted into such a wired network interface, so that it can be switched and connected to the communication network at this time for communication link. In addition, it should also be understood that the present disclosure allows one, two or more additional communication networks to be arranged in addition to the two communication networks. For example, they may be arranged in a part of the fixed area and/or a part of the movable area, so that the communication link of the movable device such as the robot can be switched between any two of the above multiple communication networks as needed, so as to select a more suitable and stable communication link to communicate with the outside. For the above communication networks, different network identifiers may be set.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> again, an example of a communication network switching method for an elevator system according to the present disclosure is roughly shown.

Specifically, the elevator system can be equipped with the communication network switching system designed and provided according to the present disclosure, which can effectively alleviate or solve the problems that may exist in existing elevator systems, such as communication signal interruption, network communication delay and unstable working performance during the use of the movable device such as the robot and detection terminal, which helps improve the working performance of such movable devices, enhances the overall service level of the system, improves people's experience of taking the elevator, and realizes the above described technical advantages of the present disclosure that are obviously superior to the prior art.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The elevator brake performance detection method, the elevator brake performance detection device and the elevator brake according to the present disclosure have been elaborated above in detail by way of example only.
