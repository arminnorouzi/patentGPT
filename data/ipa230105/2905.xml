Indeed, the present disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. As used herein, terms such as &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;rear,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; etc. are used for explanatory purposes in the examples provided below to describe the relative position of certain components or portions of components. Furthermore, as would be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the present disclosure, the terms &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; and &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; indicate that the referenced element or associated description is accurate to within applicable engineering tolerances.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an industrial process that uses chemical reactions to deposit a thin film of a desired material onto a substrate for use in a variety of technical applications. In many conventional CVD systems, a substrate may be placed inside a reactive chamber of the CVD system. Once the substrate is inside the reactive chamber, the pressure in the reactive chamber may be adjusted to ensure that the pressure is at substantially vacuum pressure, and the temperature in the reactive chamber is increased to a necessary reactive temperature. Then, deposition gases are introduced into the reactive chamber causing a reaction to occur that deposits a thin film of the desired material onto the substrate. After enough of the desired material has been deposited onto the substrate, the deposition gases are removed from the reactive chamber, the temperature is reduced to a safe handling temperature, and the pressure in the reactive chamber may be adjusted to allow for the substrate to be discharged, or removed, from the reactive chamber.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Producing the desired material using the conventional CVD system described above limits the amount of the desired material that can be produced within a time frame because the conventional CVD system suffers from long periods of pressure and temperature adjustment in which a CVD process is not being performed on the substrate. In particular, each time a new substrate is placed inside the reactive chamber, there is a waiting period while the reactive chamber is brought to substantially vacuum pressure and the necessary reactive temperature. Then, after the deposition of the desired material on the substrate is complete, there is another waiting period while the deposition gases are evacuated from the reactive chamber, the temperature is reduced to the safe handling temperature, and the pressure is increased to substantially atmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, conventional CVD systems and methods as described above are unable to produce high-quality large sheets of the desired material. In order to produce high-quality material using CVD, the region around the substrate in the reactive chamber must have a substantially uniform and a substantially stable temperature. However, reactive chambers of conventional CVD systems are only capable of providing the necessary temperature uniformity and stability over a small region. As such, conventional CVD systems are only able to produce either low-quality large sheets of the desired material or high-quality small sheets of the desired material.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Thus, to address the above identified issues of conventional CVD systems and methods, a continuous-feed CVD system for the mass production of high-quality large sheets of a desired material is disclosed herein. The system includes three independent chambers, each of which is capable of processing substrates simultaneously. In particular, the system includes an input chamber, a process chamber downstream from the input chamber and connected to the input chamber via a first gate valve, and an output chamber downstream from the process chamber and connected to the process chamber via a second gate valve. In some embodiments, the continuous-feed CVD system may include a substrate carrier and associated mechanisms for moving the substrate through the CVD system, such as the substrate carrier and associated mechanisms described in the application title CVD SYSTEM WITH SUBSTRATE CARRIER AND ASSOCIATED MECHANISMS FOR MOVING SUBSTRATE THERETHROUGH, Ser. No. ______, filed concurrently with the present application and the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Further, in some embodiments, the continuous-feed CVD system may include components configured for facilitating uniform and laminar flow, such as the components described in the application titled CVD SYSTEM WITH FLANGE ASSEMBLY FOR FACILITATING UNIFORM AND LAMINAR FLOW, Ser. No. ______, filed concurrently with the present application and the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Further, in some embodiments, the continuous-feed CVD system may be used to perform several types of processes, such as the processes described in the applications titled PROCESS FOR LAMINATING GRAPHENE-COATED PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS, Ser. No. ______; PROCESS FOR LAMINATING CONDUCTIVE-LUBRICANT COATED METALS FOR PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS, Ser. No. ______; PROCESS FOR LOCALIZED REPAIR OF GRAPHENE-COATED LAMINATION STACKS AND PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS, Ser. No. ______; PROCESS FOR APPLYING A TWO-DIMENSIONAL MATERIAL TO A TARGET SUBSTRATE POST-LAMINATION, Ser. No. ______; each of which is filed concurrently with the present application. The contents of each of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to embodiments of the invention and as described in greater detail below, while the continuous-feed CVD system is in use, the process chamber is configured to continuously operate at substantially vacuum pressure and substantially at the necessary reactive temperature. The process chamber is further configured to, during an operational state, perform a chemical vapor deposition process on a substrate received from the input chamber. While the process chamber is in the operational state, the input chamber is configured to receive a subsequent substrate into the continuous-feed CVD system and, after receiving the subsequent substrate, reduce the pressure in the input chamber to substantially vacuum pressure in preparation for entry into the process chamber. Moreover, while the process chamber is in the operational state, the output chamber is configured to cool down a previous substrate that was received from the process chamber, increase the pressure in the output chamber to substantially atmospheric pressure, and discharge, or allow for the removal of, the previous substrate from the system. As a result, embodiments of the continuous-feed CVD system disclosed herein eliminate the long periods of pressure and temperature adjustment associated with many present systems and methods of CVD, thus enabling the mass production of the desired material in a cost-effective and timely manner.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, embodiments of the invention and as described in greater detail below, enable the production of high-quality large sheets of the desired material. The process chamber, according to some embodiments, includes a unique heating enclosure that ensures temperature uniformity and stability throughout the heating enclosure. In particular, the heating enclosure comprises a cylindrical body that is surrounded by multiple heating elements. Some of the heating elements may extend the entire length of the cylindrical body (or even to a length greater than the entire length of the cylindrical body) while others may extend from the end of the cylindrical body to a distance that is shorter than the distance to the center of the cylindrical body. The heating elements can be independently controlled based on measurements taken by a plurality of temperature sensors, such that temperature uniformity and stability may be maintained throughout the heating enclosure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">While embodiments of the invention and as described in greater detail below may be applied to CVD processes for depositing a variety of materials, embodiments of the invention described herein may be advantageous in the production of large sheets of high-quality graphene. Graphene is a two-dimensional allotrope of carbon that comprises a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice. Graphene possess a unique combination of electromagnetic, thermal, and structural properties, such that graphene has the potential to revolutionize a variety of technologies, including electronic devices, optoelectronic devices, light emitting diodes, touch screens, electrical contacts, flexible electrodes, transparent electrodes, supercapacitors, batteries, Q-bit computing, optical sensors, chemical sensors, etc. However, successful implementation of graphene in such technologies has been severely limited by the inability of conventional CVD systems and methods to produce large sheets of high-quality graphene. Embodiments of the invention disclosed herein and described in greater detail below enable the production of large sheets of high-quality graphene.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Continuous-Feed Chemical Vapor Deposition System</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, a continuous-feed CVD system <b>100</b> is illustrated.
