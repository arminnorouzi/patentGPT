In one example, a multiband antenna having small physical volume achieves excellent radiation characteristics in a compact volume by aperture tuning both legs of the antenna and utilizing different dielectric loading to accomplish multiple band resonances. The antenna has a first leg and a second leg, wherein the first leg includes at least a portion of a battery, such as a case of the battery. An antenna feed is coupled to the dipole antenna between the second leg and the battery. The second leg may comprise a flexible printed circuit (FPC), and the second leg is an active leg. The second leg has a first portion and a second portion. The first portion and the second portion may have the same physical length. The first portion may be dielectrically loaded with a high permittivity loaded material, and the second portion may be dielectrically loaded with a low permittivity loaded material.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the examples will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following and the accompanying drawings or may be learned by production or operation of the examples. The objects and advantages of the present subject matter may be realized and attained by means of the methodologies, instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth by way of examples in order to provide a thorough understanding of the relevant teachings. However, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present teachings may be practiced without such details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and circuitry have been described at a relatively high-level, without detail, in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the present teachings.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; as used herein refers to any logical, optical, physical, or electrical connection, link, or the like by which signals or light produced or supplied by one system element are imparted to another coupled element. Unless described otherwise, coupled elements or devices are not necessarily directly connected to one another and may be separated by intermediate components, elements or communication media that may modify, manipulate, or carry the light or signals.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The orientations of the eyewear device, associated components and any complete devices incorporating an eye scanner and camera such as shown in any of the drawings, are given by way of example only, for illustration and discussion purposes. In operation for a particular variable optical processing application, the eyewear device may be oriented in any other direction suitable to the particular application of the eyewear device, for example up, down, sideways, or any other orientation. Also, to the extent used herein, any directional term, such as front, rear, inwards, outwards, towards, left, right, lateral, longitudinal, up, down, upper, lower, top, bottom and side, are used by way of example only, and are not limiting as to direction or orientation of any optic or component of an optic constructed as otherwise described herein.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Reference now is made in detail to the examples illustrated in the accompanying drawings and discussed below.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a side view of an example hardware configuration of an eyewear device <b>100</b>, which includes a right optical assembly <b>180</b>B with an image display <b>180</b>D (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Eyewear device <b>100</b> includes multiple visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) that form a stereo camera, of which the right visible light camera <b>114</b>B is located on a right temple <b>110</b>B.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The left and right visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B have an image sensor that is sensitive to the visible light range wavelength. Each of the visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B have a different frontward facing angle of coverage, for example, visible light camera <b>114</b>B has the depicted angle of coverage <b>111</b>B. The angle of coverage is an angle range which the image sensor of the visible light camera <b>114</b>A-B picks up electromagnetic radiation and generates images. Examples of such visible lights camera <b>114</b>A-B include a high-resolution complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor and a video graphic array (VGA) camera, such as 640p (e.g., 640&#xd7;480 pixels for a total of 0.3 megapixels), 720p, or 1080p. Image sensor data from the visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B are captured along with geolocation data, digitized by an image processor, and stored in a memory.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">To provide stereoscopic vision, visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B may be coupled to an image processor (element <b>912</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) for digital processing along with a timestamp in which the image of the scene is captured. Image processor <b>912</b> includes circuitry to receive signals from the visible light camera <b>114</b>A-B and process those signals from the visible light cameras <b>114</b>A-B into a format suitable for storage in the memory (element <b>934</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).

An inertial measurement unit is an electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes, sometimes also magnetometers. The inertial measurement unit works by detecting linear acceleration using one or more accelerometers and rotational rate using one or more gyroscopes. Typical configurations of inertial measurement units contain one accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer per axis for each of the three axes: horizontal axis for left-right movement (X), vertical axis (Y) for top-bottom movement, and depth or distance axis for up-down movement (Z). The accelerometer detects the gravity vector. The magnetometer defines the rotation in the magnetic field (e.g., facing south, north, etc.) like a compass which generates a heading reference.

A highly efficient radiator provides significantly enhanced communication range and reduces the overall energy consumption. The multiband antenna enables data transmission over multiple frequencies, which in turn enables increased data throughput. In consumer electronic devices, including eyewear <b>100</b>, however, the antenna design is compromised in favor of fashion and style and typically provided with electrically very small volume. As such, antenna engineering reuses existing metal in the device to avoid poor efficiency and complicated RF front ends to meet radiation specs.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Frequently, descendants of one of the two fundamental antenna types are employed in consumer electronic devices, loop antennas or dipole/monopole antennas. A dipole antenna <b>800</b>, which is the most common, is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> in its ideal form. It is important to note that the dipole antennas are called &#x201c;electric type&#x201d; antennas since their main radiating mode is TM<sub>10</sub>, which means that the dipole antenna <b>800</b> generates electric fields that are orthogonal to the direction of propagation. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the sum of l<sub>1 </sub>and l<sub>2 </sub>(i.e., total length) determines the first resonant frequency of the dipole antenna <b>800</b> where it supports the TM<sub>10 </sub>mode. The ratio of l<sub>1 </sub>to l<sub>2 </sub>determines the input impedance of the dipole antenna <b>800</b> at that resonant frequency. As a way of example, a self-resonant, TM<sub>10 </sub>supporting dipole antenna <b>800</b> in air designed for 1.575 GHz Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) operation would need l<sub>1</sub>=l<sub>2</sub>=&#x2dc;4.56 cm. This length is too long in a wearable consumer electronics device such as eyewear <b>100</b> to be just dedicated to the antenna element itself.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, a dipole antenna <b>810</b> is incorporated into eyewear <b>100</b> as shown. The first antenna leg l<sub>1 </sub>is widened and reuses the existing main PCB <b>140</b> in the eyewear <b>100</b>. The second antenna leg l<sub>2 </sub>is bent to save space while keeping the leg length the same. One or both legs can be encapsulated in low loss dielectric material to further reduce the length needed for the dipole antenna <b>810</b> to operate, a technique called dielectric loading.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Augmented reality wearable devices including eyewear <b>100</b> are different in their mechanical construction than most consumer electronics devices in the market. Typically, a bucket approach is used in assembling the majority of the smart electronic devices available for consumers today. This includes devices such as phones, watches, speakers, even thermostats. In most cases, a plastic or metal housing forms the bucket, then the battery and main PCB go inside this bucket, and the bucket is capped off with a display. The architecture of dipole antenna <b>810</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> with such a mechanical architecture relies on the main PCB for efficient radiation and placing the bent antenna leg on one of the opposing edges.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">However, for augmented reality wearable devices including eyewear <b>100</b>, this mechanical architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is not necessarily feasible. The displays need to be optically transparent and need to be in front of the wearer's eyes. As such, batteries and PCBs cannot be stacked with the display. As these devices are also fashion accessories, the battery and the main PCBs cannot be easily co-located, as the space needed for that would be too wide, or too thick. Typically, the main PCB with critical components such as silicon on chip (SOC) or wireless RF front end reside on narrow but longer PCBs in the temples <b>110</b>. An ideal place for the battery <b>142</b> is the tip of the temple <b>110</b> at the back as it helps balance the weight of the optical systems at the front of the eyewear <b>100</b>. This architecture is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">For the mechanical architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, the dipole antenna implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is reconfigured to maximize antenna radiation efficiency shown as dipole antenna <b>820</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref>. Leg #1 of the dipole antenna <b>820</b> is a casing <b>830</b> of the battery <b>142</b>, such as a metallic shield on the battery casing, or it could be the longer electrical length established by the electrically connected battery casing, a flexible printed circuit (FPC) <b>840</b> and the main PCB <b>140</b>. In any of these scenarios, the dipole antenna <b>820</b> uses the battery <b>142</b> as one (or at least part) of the antenna leg #1. As such, it is wise to ensure in the RF band, the terminals of the battery <b>142</b> are both connected to each other, essentially RF shorted but DC separated.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Achieving multi-band radiation is critical for an antenna system to be deployed for augmented reality wearables, including eyewear <b>100</b>. Dipole antenna <b>820</b> has a resonant response at frequencies f<sub>1 </sub>and f<sub>2 </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">One method of achieving this dual band radiation from the architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref> is to ensure that dipole antenna leg #1 and leg #2 present the appropriate electrical length to an antenna feed <b>850</b> at frequencies f<sub>1 </sub>and f<sub>2</sub>, as shown in dipole antenna <b>870</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>, using aperture tuning. Focusing on leg #1, the electrical length is controlled with the introduction of a low pass filter <b>860</b> in series between the battery <b>142</b> and the FPC <b>840</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>. The battery DC energy and the RF signals at frequency f<sub>1 </sub>can still flow all the way from the battery <b>142</b> through the series low pass filter <b>860</b> to the main PCB <b>140</b> as the low pass filter <b>860</b> allows them through. As seen, l<sub>f1,1 </sub>is the length of the leg #1 at f<sub>1</sub>. However, for the higher f<sub>2 </sub>frequency, the metal ends where the battery casing <b>830</b> ends, so the length of the dipole antenna <b>870</b> leg #1 is only l<sub>f2,1</sub>. As a result, the temple <b>110</b> supports dual band operation with each band operating in the fundamental TM<sub>10 </sub>mode. This antenna design can be extended and cascaded to create multiple different electrical lengths throughout the temple <b>110</b>, by ensuring the correct placement and value selection of the low pass filter <b>860</b> accordingly.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The dipole antenna second leg #2 is referred to as the active leg. In order to support multiband operation, the active leg #2 provides different electrical lengths to the antenna feed. The low pass filter <b>860</b> is used in the active leg #2 as well, such that l<sub>f1,2 </sub>and l<sub>f2,2 </sub>have different electrical lengths. This dipole antenna design can be extended and cascaded along the active leg #2 to create multiple different electrical lengths throughout the antenna element by ensuring the correct placement and value selection of the low pass filter <b>860</b> accordingly.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As mentioned previously, it is desirable to have the lengths of the respective legs equal, i.e., l<sub>f1,1</sub>=l<sub>f1,2 </sub>and l<sub>f2,1</sub>=l<sub>f2,2</sub>. Unfortunately, in eyewear devices, it is not usually possible to have the physical length of the active arm (leg #2) to be equal to the length of the leg #1, which in this example is in the temple <b>110</b>. As seen, leg #1 is co-located with other functional parts of the eyewear <b>100</b> such as the battery <b>142</b>, FPC <b>840</b>, and the main PCB <b>140</b>, however, leg #2 is solely dedicated for the dipole antenna and hence there is a desire to minimize its size as much as possible. This design tendency throws off the ratio of l<sub>1 </sub>to l<sub>2 </sub>and increases the input impedance of the dipole antenna substantially, limiting its bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Fortunately, the antenna legs #1 and #2 only have to be electrically equal, not necessarily in physical length. This is achieved by dielectric loading of the leg #2 and changing the effective permittivity around it. There is an inverse square root relationship between the effective permittivity and reduction that can be achieved in length. For example, if the effective relative dielectric constant around the leg #2 can be raised to 4 by dielectric loading, the physical length of leg #2 can be half the length of leg #1 and they would still be electrically equivalent in length. However, the trade-off to dielectric loading is that it introduces losses that are associated with the material and if the loading is high (e.g., relative permittivity is more than 4), then the RF energy would want to stay inside the loading material and not radiate out. The immediate implication of these are reduced radiation bandwidth and radiation efficiency. Hence, the loading should be kept to a minimum whenever possible.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Since the physical length available for the active antenna leg #2 is fixed and limited, this disclosure uses different dielectric loading for each frequency band the dipole antenna supports to maximize performance that can be extracted from the physical length available. As seen in the dual-band example shown in previous figures, one example of a dipole antenna <b>880</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>H</figref>. In this example, the leg #2 has two parallel portions as shown, leg #2 for f<sub>1 </sub>and leg #2 for f<sub>2 </sub>and each portion has the same physical length. However, one portion of leg #2 is loaded with high dielectric permittivity material <b>882</b>, such as a ceramic, and the other portion of leg #2 is loaded with low dielectric permittivity material <b>884</b>, such as the material of PCB <b>140</b> shown supporting both portions of leg #2. For example, the effective permittivity seen by leg #2 at f<sub>1 </sub>is 36 and effective permittivity seen by leg #2 at f<sub>2 </sub>is 4. This means that leg #2 for f<sub>1 </sub>is three times (sqrt(36/4)=3) electrically longer and that leg allows for a resonance at f<sub>1 </sub>which is &#x2153;rd of f<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The low pass filter <b>860</b> (such as a simple inductor) feeding the first portion of leg #2 and a high pass filter <b>886</b> (could be a simple capacitor) feeding the second portion of leg #2 isolate the two portions of the leg #2, as they are both fed from the same common feed line <b>888</b> attached to the antenna excitation. These filters <b>860</b> and <b>886</b> are essentially responsible for aperture tuning of the individual lengths of these legs. As discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref> and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b></figref> for this specific example, leg #1 lengths also need to correspond to the ratio of f<sub>1 </sub>to f<sub>2</sub>. It is possible to increase the number of the bands supported by increasing the antenna legs as described in this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a high-level functional block diagram including example electronic components disposed in eyewear <b>100</b>/<b>200</b>.
