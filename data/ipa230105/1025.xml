More specifically, the invention relates to pharmaceutical packaging units and methods of diagnosis of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic disorders.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Movement disorders are common among adults and have significant personal, financial, and societal impact. Varying degrees of tremor are often manifested, with severe tremor causing difficulty or the inability to perform routine activities. Many of these disorders are progressive and may proceed rapidly (Zesiewicz et al. (2005) <i>Neurol. </i>64(12): 2008-20; Stone (1991) <i>Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. </i>39(2): 345-9; Stone (1995) <i>J. Neurol. Sci. </i>132(2):129-32.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Movement disorders are usually or initially diagnosed clinically and may be based on questionnaires, non-motor symptoms such as REM sleep disorders, constipation, and observation of voluntary and involuntary movement. For example, in the case of the most common movement disorder, non-parkinsonian tremor (also called Essential tremor, benign tremor, familial tremor, or idiopathic tremor), diagnosis is usually established by observing an action tremor (i.e., a tremor which intensifies when one tries to use the affected muscles of hands, arms, and/or fingers) or postural tremor (i.e., present with sustained muscle tone), rather than the tremor exhibited at rest (resting tremor), which is manifested in Parkinson's Disease. When a limb is at rest, no tremor is observed, but moving or extending the limb results in a shaking. This is in contrast to resting tremor which is manifested in Parkinson's disease.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unfortunately, clinical diagnoses of movement disorders are at best speculative many disorders display similar physical symptoms which can also be confused with other tremor disorders.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Definitive diagnosis of a movement disorder is possible only during autopsy when histological examination of regions of the brain, e.g., the basal ganglia, particularly the substantia nigra (SN), is performed. This is because the dopaminergic pathway from the SN to the striatum is known to play an integral part in motor function and is involved in many movement disorders (&#x201c;dopaminergic&#x201d; disorders). However, not all tremor disorders involve this pathway. For example, there are movement disorders that, in the earlier stages, may manifest as Parkinson's Disease clinically, but there is no evidence of dopamine deficiency in the striatum, thus suggesting the movement disorder etiology is a type of non-parkinsonian syndrome (such as essential tremor, a &#x201c;non-dopaminergic movement disorder) which requires a different clinical treatment protocol. Therefore, without information to rule out the involvement of the SN to striatum dopamine pathway, clinical diagnoses of movement disorders are at best speculative.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">More recently, the SN to striatum pathway of a live patient has become assessible by viewing images of the striatum obtained by various noninvasive imaging techniques. Such non-invasive methods use single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) assessment measuring the uptake/binding of a radiolabeled imagining agent that binds to dopamine transporters (DAT) in the striatum. Currently, the only SPECT radiopharmaceutical approved for use in the United States, the European Union, and Canada is DaTSCAN&#xae; (N-&#x3c9;-fluoropropyl-2&#x3b2;-carbomethoxy-3&#x3b2;-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane), which is radiolabeled with <sup>123</sup>I. After injection of DaTSCAN, the patient must wait 3 hr for its uptake into systemic circulation, and transition through the blood brain barrier into the parenchyma of the brain tissue until it reaches stable binding to DAT. At that point, radioactivity (counts) can be collected and quantified, and a visual image can be acquired via SPECT. The visual image is compiled for reading by experts who then determine if there is evidence of DAT density loss in the striatum. In the case of a patient with Parkinson's disease, an asymmetrical pattern of binding in the striatum is observed in the image, whereas in the non-parkinsonian tremor patient, the pattern is visible as bilateral and symmetrical (i.e., &#x201c;normal) (Lewis et al. (2012) <i>Practitioner </i>1748: 21-24). This information is used by treating physicians in determining diagnosis and subsequent treatment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Unfortunately, DaTSCAN is also highly selective for serotonin (SERT) transporters (for every two to three DAT sites DaTSCAN binds to one SERT site) in the lungs and other tissues (DaTscan&#x2122; Ioflupane <sup>123</sup>I Injection (package insert), Arlington Heights, Ill.: GE Healthcare, Medi-Physics, Inc.; 2015). Due to DaTscan's selectivity for SERT and the slow transition time of the compound to the neurons in the SN, imaging cannot take place until 3 to 6 hr after injection, at which time its binding to striatal DAT becomes stable. The patient is then placed in the SPECT camera until 1.5 million counts are obtained (approximately 45 min). The binding of DaTSCAN to transporters other than DAT leaves only about 7% of DaTSCAN available for DAT transporter binding in the brain tissue (DaTscan&#x2122; Ioflupane <sup>123</sup>I Injection (package insert), ibid.). Thus, a significant disadvantage of the only currently approved imaging agent used with this technology is that an undetermined but significant amount of DaTSCAN is being bound and captured by serotonin transporters throughout the body and, therefore, is not available for specific binding to neuronal DAT in the striatum.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">DAT is also found outside the brain in nephrons, kidney, pancreas, lungs, and the cardio-pulmonary system including many blood vessels outside the CNS. Dysfunctions of DAT outside the brain are known.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is thus a need for a more accurate and rapid way to diagnose movement disorders which can distinguish non-dopaminergic disorders from dopaminergic disorders, so that efficacious therapeutic treatment specific for the disorder can be administered more quickly. There is additionally a need for ways to diagnose DAT-related disorders outside of the brain.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It has been discovered that the imaging agent [<sup>123</sup>I]-E-2&#x3b2;-carbomethoxy-3&#x3b2;-(4-fluorophenyl)-N-(3-iodo-E-allyl) nortropane (DaT2020) has a binding selectivity of at least 28-fold for DAT than it does for SERT. This greater binding selectivity enables an increase in the availability of tracer which can penetrate more deeply into brain tissues, and can bind more quickly to DAT than other known radiolabeled tropane imaging agents.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">These discoveries have been exploited to provide the present pharmaceutical packaging units and methods useful to quickly and accurately determine if a patient afflicted with a movement disorder has a malfunction of the dopaminergic system or has a non-dopaminergic movement disorder or other disorder that is difficult to diagnose through clinical observations alone.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one aspect, the disclosure provides a pharmaceutical packaging unit comprising a first radiotracer and a second radiotracer, wherein the first radiotracer and the second radiotracer have different binding affinities for the dopamine transporter (DAT).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the binding affinity of the first radiotracer for DAT is between about 2fold- to about 50-fold greater than the binding affinity of the second radiotracer for DAT.

Such methods include parenteral administration, e.g., intravenously. The intravenous route represents the most efficient way to deliver an in vivo imaging agent throughout the body of the subject and therefore into contact with one or more defined biological markers expressed in said subject.

The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is suitably an injectable carrier liquid such as sterile, pyrogen-free water for injection; an aqueous solution such as saline (which may advantageously be balanced so that the final product for injection is either isotonic or not hypotonic); an aqueous solution of one or more tonicity-adjusting substances (e.g. salts of plasma cations with biocompatible counterions), sugars (e.g. glucose or sucrose), sugar alcohols (e.g. sorbitol or mannitol), glycols (e.g. glycerol), or other non-ionic polyol materials (e.g. polyethyleneglycols, propylene glycols and the like). The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may also comprise biocompatible organic solvents such as ethanol. Such organic solvents are useful to solubilize more lipophilic compounds or formulations.

DaT2020 is highly advantageous as it is more selective for, and binds more quickly to, DAT than other commercially available imaging agents. The present disclosure provides also, at least in part, pharmaceutical packaging units comprising at least DaT2020, or derivatives thereof, and another different radiolabeled imaging agent that has an affinity for DAT different from the affinity of DaT2020 for DAT.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The imaging agent used in the present pharmaceutical packaging unit is the tropane, DaT2020, and derivatives thereof (collectively, &#x201c;DaT2020&#x201d;). These imaging agents have a higher binding selectivity for DAT over SERT (28:1 or 28-fold), bind more DAT quickly, and penetrate brain tissue and other regions of interest more deeply than other known DAT tropane tracers currently used (e.g., DaTSCAN) (DaTSCAN Ioflupane <sup>123</sup>I Injection [package insert] (2015) Arlington Heights, Ill.: GE Healthcare, Medi-Physics, Inc.).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Dat2020 travels in the blood stream and into the brain more quickly and binds more specifically to DAT than DaTSCAN. Because of the favorable pharmacokinetic profile of DaT2020 stable binding occurs 15 min after administration allowing scanning to begin and resulting in sufficient data for an image to be collected over 30 min. In contrast, the scanning procedure with DaTSCAN cannot begin until at least 180 min after administration and usually the scan lasts about 45 min.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Non-limiting examples of DaT2020 derivatives include 2&#x3b2; carbomethoxy-3&#x3b2;-(4-iodophenyl) tropane (beta-CIT); 2&#x3b2;-carbomethoxy-3&#x3b2;-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl) nortropane (FP-CIT); and TRODAT-1.

For example, to prepare DaT2020, one may allow a reaction between a haloallyl Sn precursor (pre-DaT2020) and a radionuclide under oxidative conditions. Other standard methods of radiolabeling can be used as well. For radiolabeling, DaT2020 in lyophilized form is useful, however, it can also be in aqueous form.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The radiolabel bound to the tropane is one that is detectable via SPECT (as shown above), including <sup>123</sup>I, <sup>124</sup>I, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>99</sup>mTc, or <sup>117m</sup>Sn or PET (as shown above), including <sup>18</sup>F or <sup>11</sup>C. The location of the radioisotope on the agent can be varied. For example, the isotope can be located at any position on pre-DaT2020 or a derivative thereof and can be directly linked or indirectly linked via a linker (see, U.S. Pat. No. 8,574,545). One suitable position is the free terminus of the haloallyl moiety.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Non-limiting examples of useful SPECT-readable tracers for DAT detection according to the disclosure include [<sup>123</sup>I]-E-2&#x3b2;-carbomethoxy-3&#x3b2;-(4-fluorophenyl)-N-(3-iodo-E-allyl) nortropane (DaT2020), [<sup>123</sup>I]-2&#x3b2; carbomethoxy-3&#x3b2;-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([<sup>123</sup>I]-beta-CIT); [<sup>123</sup>I]-2&#x3b2;-carbomethoxy-3&#x3b2;-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)nortropane ([<sup>123</sup>I]-FP-CIT); [<sup>123</sup>I]-altropane; and [<sup>99</sup>mTc]-TRODAT-1.

The movement, and binding, of radiolabeled DaT2020 to DAT can also be performed using other methods of monitoring radioactive compounds used, e.g., by radioactivity sensors located on the head of the patient adjacent to the region of interest (ROI), or on other regions of the body where DATs are located and are being monitored for DaT2020 binding.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The use of the pharmaceutical packaging units disclosed herein can distinguish non-dopaminergic conditions, such as, but not limited to, non-parkinsonian or essential tremor and non-Alzheimer dementia, as well as multiple sclerosis, chronic kidney disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, drug or alcohol use, hypoglycemia, lack of sleep, lack of vitamins, increased stress, magnesium and/or thiamine deficiencies, liver failure, mercury poisoning, and drug or alcohol addiction or withdrawal, from a dopaminergic disorder displaying similar clinical manifestations. Such dopaminergic disorders include, but are not limited to, parkinsonian syndromes including idiopathic Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and vascular parkinsonism (VaP), among other rarer causes of parkinsonism), and Lewy body dementia, ADHD, clinical depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, obesity, sexual dysfunction, schizophrenia, pheochromocytoma, binge eating disorder, and diabetes and other disorders resulting from DAT dysfunction outside of the CNS.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The radiolabeled DaT2020 can be formulated into pharmaceutical packaging units for intravenous (IV) systemic or direct local administration in a carrier or physiological buffer that does not inhibit its binding to DAT.

The formulation to be administered as a bolus injection has been shown in sponsored clinical trials to be safe containing a dose of up to about 8 mCi to 10 mCi of radiolabeled DaT2020 and delivered in a total volume of about 2.5 mL to about 5 mL.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The radioactivity of the dose of radiolabeled DaT2020 or of its radiolabeled derivatives, can be determined by one with skill in the art, e.g. by a nuclear medicine imaging technician. In addition, the total radioactivity of the actual administered dose is of relevance and not the volume administered to achieve this dose. The exact radioactive dose of the tracer administered is determined by calculating the difference between the radioactivity in the syringe and delivery system before and after injection. After the dose is delivered, the syringe is filled with a volume of saline equal to the administered dose volume. The syringe content is recounted under the same conditions as used to determine the dose; separately. Useful dose ranges from about 0.25 mCi to about 1 mCi, from about 1 mCi to about 10 mCi, from about 2 mCi to about 10 mCi, from about 3 mCi to about 7 mCi, from about 5 mCi to about 8 mCi, or about 2 mCi, about 3 mCi, about 4 mCi, about 5 mCi, about 6 mCi, about 7 mCi, about 8 mCi, about 9 mCi, or about 10 mCi. Dose can alternatively be described as effective dose (for 5 mCi of radiolabeled DaT2020) of approximately 4.3 mSv. Injected dose values outside the above stated range, i.e., values lower than about 0.25 mCi or higher than about 10 mCi are considered as potential sources of variation.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">DaT2020 or derivatives formulated as described above for IV delivery are administered in a single (bolus) dose via a syringe (e.g., a peripheral 18 to 22-gauge venous catheter inserted for the radiopharmaceutical/tracer infusion). After injection, the tracer passes through the blood-brain barrier and quickly binds to DAT if it is available. Other methods of administration can also be utilized, for example, the direct injection of suitable amounts into the brain arteries via a syringe or catheters following established procedures in neuroradiology, or arteries contiguous to the striatum or other ROI.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In common medical practice, a radiotracer for brain imaging and other imaging applications is administered as one instance of a radiotracer that fulfills a specific purpose. For example, a radiotracer like ioflupane (DaTSCAN) would be administered in patients needing verification of dopaminergic deficit to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of essential tremor or Parkinson's Disease. The kinetics and receptor binding profile (SERT:DAT) of ioflupane would then achieve a readable SPECT image of the Region of Interest (ROI) in the brain after a certain time.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For DaT2020, the high specificity for DAT receptors vs. SERT (serotonin) receptors would yield a different kinetic and receptor binding which will ultimately result in a faster and more specific SPECT image for the ROI.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Because the pharmacokinetics and the low specificity for DAT of ioflupane vs. the high specificity of DaT2020 for DAT distinguishes both compounds not only in their kinetics and SPECT image availability after i.v. injection time (45-60 post i.v. injection for DaT2020, 180-240 minutes for ioflupane post i.v. injection), but also in their binding duration to dopaminergic neurons in a ROI (for example the substantia nigra of the putamen, a basal ganglion of the brain responsible for coordination of motor neurons). DaT2020 is attached and then washed out quickly from DAT receptors located in dopaminergic neurons (within 60 minutes post i.v. injection), ioflupane is attached to and then washed out more slowly from DAT receptors located in dopaminergic neurons (within 180-240 or more minutes post i.v. injection).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Utilizing differences in kinetics and receptor binding profile, two suitable radiotracers can be administered concomitantly or in close timely proximity, each at reduced doses compared to single dose administration of the single instance of each tracer, to visualize the following characteristics of a ROI. Using the example of Parkinson's Disease (PD), the following functional and anatomical parameters of the ROI can be imaged: Timing of visualization of dopaminergic deficits, distinguishing between different underlying pathogenesis of PD. Timing of decay visualization of filling defects or lack of filling defects. Anatomical structures of a ROI visualized differentially by high vs. low receptor binding.

These methods are also useful for monitoring the effectiveness of treatments for and progression of DAT dysfunction over time.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Dysfunctions of DAT resulting in dopaminergic disorders are known in the brain and CNS, as well as outside of the CNS, including pancreas, kidney, and cardiovascular system.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some cases, prevention of thyroid uptake of the iodine isotope is warranted. This can be accomplished by orally administering to the subject a Lugol solution, potassium iodide solution, or potassium perchlorate solution. In some cases, other preliminary steps are performed before the administration of radiolabeled DaT2020. For example, for SPECT detection and imaging of DAT binding, steps that counter serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, amphetamines, and sympathomimetics can be employed. The discontinuance of any medications that might interfere with the binding of DaT2020 to DAT may also be required. Such potentially interfering molecules include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and CNS stimulants. The thyroid blocker is administered per label instructions to ensure effective blocking before the scheduled administration of the agent.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">To determine if a patient is afflicted with a non-dopaminergic or dopaminergic disorder, the patient is injected with a diagnostically effective amount of radiolabeled DaT2020.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Before agent administration, the subject is positioned in a SPECT or PET camera. Alternatively, sensors are placed adjacent to the ROI on the body which can collect radioactivity and which interfaces with a reader that communicates data to a computer.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">SPECT and PET are procedures in which the isotope bound to DaT2020 or derivatives thereof is measured once the agent has been administered and has reached stable binding in the ROI. Once entering the blood stream, it travels throughout the body (e.g., brain, liver, kidney, heart, lungs, and the peripheral vascular system) and binds to DAT in various regions of the body including the striatum. The time it takes to reach stable binding (to eliminate background noise to form a clearer image) depends on the ROI and the depth of the tissue penetrated by the agent.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The camera captures energy produced by the radioactive decay of the radiolabeled DaT2020 or derivatives thereof (&#x201c;tracer&#x201d;). The radiolabel used for SPECT imaging emits energy in the form of individual photons or gamma rays, while the radiolabel used for PET imaging emits energy in the form of positrons. These positrons almost immediately collide with an electron and the energy produced becomes 2 photons emitted at roughly 180 degrees (2 photons moving in opposite directions).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In SPECT, the single emitted photon passes into the camera and strikes a scintillation crystal which, in turn, is viewed by a large number of photomultiplier tubes. The output voltages generated by the photomultiplier tubes are fed to a position circuit which produces four output signals. These signals contain information about the position and intensity of where the photon struck the crystal (scintillations). These signals (which &#x201c;unblank&#x201d; or &#x201c;light up&#x201d; the receiver, e.g., a cathode ray oscilloscope) for each photon are then fed into the memory circuitry of a computer and stored. The storage of these signals (the position and intensity of each photon becomes a count) allows their recall for digital processing from distinct time points or periods as well as the distinguishing counts from the components that make up the ROI that was scanned. Therefore, one can obtain counts and process them for quantitation at any single moment or over varying periods of time during a single scan session. In order to construct an image, a scan session must collect millions of counts over time in order to produce enough detail for a human reader to evaluate.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In PET, the collector mechanism and scintillation crystal are able to obtain position and intensity information from both photons and feed the information into the memory circuitry of a computer for storage and for later retrieval and processing.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Collection of counts is initiated at about 10 to 15 min after administration of the agent and is carried out for about 1 min to about 15 min.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">To obtain an image, counts are collected beginning 15 min after administration of the radiolabeled agent and collection continues for 30 min (or 15-45 min after administration).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">SPECT acquisition is performed on a SPECT/CT or stand-alone SPECT with at least two imaging heads fitted with collimators (parallel-beam and fan beam collimators with manufacturer specified (or measured according to NEMA standards) planar system resolution of &#x3c;8 mm FWHM (in &#x2018;air&#x2019; at 10 cm distance). Raw projection data (or counts) are acquired as described in Djang et al. (2013) <i>Nuclear Med. Mol. Imaging </i>47(2):73-80), step-and-shoot mode with angle increments of 3&#xb0; can be used. Alternatively, continuous rotation may be used. Full 3600 coverage of the area surrounding the ROI (e.g., when ROI is the striatum, the &#x201c;area surrounding the ROI&#x201d; would be the head) is required (i.e., 180&#xb0; for each head of a dual-head camera).

Filtering includes either a 2-dimensional pre-filtering of the projection data or a 3-dimensional post-filtering of the reconstructed data.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Images are reformatted into slices in at least three planes depending on the ROI (axial, coronal, and sagittal). Transverse slices are parallel to a standard and reproducible anatomic orientation, such as the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line as used for brain MRI. This can be approximated by orientating the brain such that the inferior surface of the frontal lobe is level with the inferior surface of the occipital lobe. The canthomeatal plane, as routinely used for CT, is also acceptable. Activity in the striatum and the parotid glands, and the contours of the brain and the head, can usually be seen and can be used to assist realignment. A simultaneously acquired CT scan may allow precise realignment of the head.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Interobserver (expert image reader) variability is reduced by rigorously standardizing realignment and using predefined ROIs that are at least twice the full width at half maximum. Typically, this results in a smallest ROI dimension of 5 pixels to 7 pixels. In addition, three consecutive slices in the target region are used&#x2014;those with the highest activity.

During the scan, counts are continuously collected by the camera at preset coordinates focusing on the organ of interest and then digitized, stored, and then processed in near real time. The scan continues until a predefined condition is met.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">One example of the condition is a predetermined threshold reached. This threshold may be determined by the number or density of counts (a SCORE) that a person without a dopaminergic disorder would be expected to have as demonstrated by comparison to a database of counts from these persons (or to a striatal phantom). If this condition is met, (evidence there is normal DAT density) there is an indication that the patient does not have a dopaminergic disorder. Once this condition is met, the processor analyzing the counts may output a signal to stop the camera.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Another example of the condition is the determination that the amount of energy being captured has stabilized. This condition may be met when the number of counts quantified by the processor is similar over a predetermined time period (e.g., every 30 sec). In the case of radiolabeled DaT2020, the energy stabilizes typically between 14 to 18 min. If the energy stabilizes, and the above first condition (e.g., the number, threshold, range, of counts) is not met, then this is an indication that the patient may have a dopaminergic disorder. In such instance, the processor outputs a signal to continue scanning the patient in order to collect enough data to create an image. The captured data is then processed by computer algorithms (computed tomography) to create a visual image representation of the ROI showing bright white where the Tracer has bound to DAT against a dark background.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The signals output by the processor (e.g., to stop the camera or to continue scanning the patient in order to collect enough data to create an image) may be a signal automatically controlling operation of the camera, or it may be a signal (e.g., an audio, visual, or tactile signal) to the operator of the camera.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Semiquantification is defined as the ratio of activity in a structure of interest (ROI) to activity in a reference region (Djang et al. (2012) ibid).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">To date, the method used to limit human error in visually assessing images is to calculate a ratio of the counts from the ROI:counts from an area near the ROI that naturally has fewer dopamine transporters. It is this ratio [ROI-background/background] that provides a measure that is comparable regardless of tracer or camera used.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">For example, if the goal is to determine if a movement disorder is parkinsonian (loss of DAT density) or non-parkinsonian the specific binding ratio (SBR, also referred to as the striatal binding ratio). SBRs are calculated after an image has been created by isolating (manually or through automation) the activity in the striatum and comparing it with activity in a low DAT density background area using the following formula:</p><p id="p-0097" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>Striatal</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>   </mtext>   <mi>binding</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>   </mtext>   <mi>ratio</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>   </mtext>   <mrow>    <mo>(</mo>    <mi>SBR</mi>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <mtable>    <mtr>     <mtd>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>mean</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mtext>   </mtext>        <mi>counts</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mtext>   </mtext>        <mi>of</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mtext>   </mtext>        <mi>striatal</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mtext>   </mtext>        <mi>ROI</mi>       </mrow>       <mo>-</mo>      </mrow>     </mtd>    </mtr>    <mtr>     <mtd>      <mrow>       <mi>mean</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mtext>   </mtext>       <mi>counts</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mtext>   </mtext>       <mi>of</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mtext>   </mtext>       <mi>background</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mtext>   </mtext>       <mi>ROI</mi>      </mrow>     </mtd>    </mtr>   </mtable>   <mrow>    <mi>mean</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mi>counts</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mi>of</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mi>background</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mi>ROI</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">For both manual and automated semiquantification, SBRs for the left and right striatum are quantified separately, and the caudate and putamen are quantified separately; known anatomic lesions may influence the location of the striatal or background ROIs.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">Techniques roughly fall into four categories: classic manual ROIs, manual volumes of interest (VOIs), more advanced automated systems using VOIs, and voxel-based mathematic systems (DatQUANT (Ge Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK)</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">The classic and most widely used method applies ROI templates manually to one or more slices with the highest striatal activity. Manual VOI strategies stress accurate characterization of the putamen as the most sensitive region for distinguishing normal findings from Parkinsonian syndromes.

It also uses the patient as their own control.
