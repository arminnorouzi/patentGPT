In addition, the conventional mixing device involves a problem in that since pressure is applied to the rotary shaft by a strong rotational force thereof while the mixture is vortexed in the stirring container, the rotary shaft of the motor is deformed. In general, since the rotary shaft of the mixing device is arranged long in the stirring container along the longitudinal direction of the stirring container, it has a structure that can be easily bent and deformed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This leads to subsequent problems in that the liquid mixture is not uniformly stirred since the rotary shaft rotates without having the same rotational center while shaken left and right due to vibration by a motor, and in that the rotary shaft is seriously separated from the mixing device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, recently, a mixing device employing a magnetic property has been widely used. In other words, a magnetic mixing apparatus used currently has a structure in which a rotor including a magnet is mounted on one end of the output shaft of the motor, and an impeller having a magnet is seatedly mounted on an upper portion of the rotor to fix and rotate the impeller by a magnetic force.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, since the conventional magnetic mixing apparatus encounters a drawback in that it employs a magnet having a strong magnetic force to fixedly mount the impeller on the rotor, a bearing may be damaged or loosened when the magnet is separated from the impeller by a change in the magnetic force due to continuous use, and the rotation of the impeller may not be measured.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, the present invention has been made in order to solve the above-described problems occurring in the prior art, and it is an object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic mixing apparatus which prevents damage to the magnetic mixing apparatus and is easily maintained and repaired even when the magnetic force of the magnet is changed to cause the separation of the magnet.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a magnetic mixing apparatus including: a shaft rotatably coupled to a drive motor unit in such a manner as to penetrate through the drive motor unit; a first housing provided on an outer side a stirring container in such a manner as to be coupled to one side of the drive motor unit so as to accommodate an upper portion of the shaft (<b>110</b><i>a</i>); a rotary rotor coupled to a distal end of the shaft at the stirring container side during a normal operation thereof and including a first permanent magnet; and an impeller unit disposed on an inner side of the stirring container and including a second permanent magnet magnetically coupled to the first permanent magnet during a normal operation thereof. The first housing includes a magnetically separated rotary rotor support unit formed to protrude inwardly from the first housing so as to support, from the downward direction, the rotary rotor, which is downward driven to move downward from the shaft, when there occurs magnetic separation in which a magnetic coupling between the first permanent magnet and the second permanent magnet is released by magnetic deformation of at least one of the first permanent magnet and the second permanent magnet.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the magnetic mixing apparatus, the rotary rotor may include a retaining support unit configured to be retainingly coupled at one side thereof to the magnetically separated rotary rotor support unit and to support the first permanent magnet at the other side thereof when there occurs the magnetic separation in which the magnetic coupling between the first permanent magnet and the second permanent magnet is released by magnetic deformation of the first permanent magnet and the second permanent magnet.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The magnetic mixing apparatus may further include a second housing disposed opposite to one side of the drive motor unit, to which the first housing is coupled with the drive motor unit interposed therebetween so as to accommodate a lower portion of the shaft.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The magnetic mixing apparatus may further include a handle unit connected to the shaft in such a manner as to penetrate through the second housing so that the handle unit can be rotated manually.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The magnetic mixing apparatus may further include a welding unit coupled to the stirring container in a state of having accommodated the rotary rotor rotatably during the magnetic coupling between the first permanent magnet and the second permanent magnet.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The magnetic mixing apparatus may further include a bearing unit disposed between the impeller unit and the welding unit and configured to guide the rotation of the impeller unit.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The magnetic mixing apparatus according to the present invention has effects in that it is prevented from being damaged and is easily maintained and repaired even when the magnetic force of the magnet is changed to cause the separation of the magnet, and stability is improved during the stirring process.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description

Thus, there is an advantage in that the impeller unit <b>150</b> and the bearing unit <b>160</b> are not damaged, and the bearing unit <b>160</b> is not loosened or the fastener is not damaged even during the magnetic separation.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The rotary rotor <b>130</b> is coupled to the distal end of the shaft <b>110</b><i>a </i>at the stirring container <b>5</b> side during a normal operation thereof and is automatically driven downward by gravity when occurs the magnetic separation so that the impeller unit <b>150</b> continues to be rotated in a state in which magnetic deformation has occurred, thereby preventing damage due to abnormal rotation such as twisting.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">That is, according to this embodiment, the rotary rotor <b>130</b> includes a retaining support unit <b>131</b> that is retainingly coupled to the magnetically separated rotary rotor support unit <b>121</b> when there occurs magnetic separation in which a magnetic coupling between the first permanent magnet M<b>1</b> and the second permanent magnet M<b>2</b> is released by magnetic deformation of the first permanent magnet M<b>1</b> and the second permanent magnet M<b>2</b>. Thus, even if the rotary rotor <b>130</b> is automatically driven downward by gravity, it is not excessively separated to secure stability.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, according to this embodiment, the retaining support unit <b>131</b> has a structure in which it is retainingly coupled at one side thereof to the magnetically separated rotary rotor support unit <b>121</b> and to support the first permanent magnet M<b>1</b> at the other side thereof, Thus, since the distance between the first permanent magnet M<b>1</b> and the second permanent magnet M<b>2</b> is close during the normal operation of the rotary rotor <b>130</b>, sensitivity of the magnetic separation occurring between the first permanent magnet M<b>1</b> and the second permanent magnet M<b>2</b> is improved. As such, the improvement of the sensitivity of the magnetic separation can efficiently cope with the occurrence of the magnetic separation, thereby preventing damage to each element.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Meanwhile, the rotary rotor <b>130</b> may include the first permanent magnet M<b>1</b> as described above.
