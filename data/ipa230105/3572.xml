As one of the kitchen supplies, an electronic kitchen scale is a good helper for family life, especially suitable for using in and decorating a modern kitchen. The electronic kitchen scale may help people to accurately weigh the food and is more and more popular with many modern families, especially in developed countries, such as European countries and the United States.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, the storage way of the kitchen scale on the market is to hang the kitchen scale on the wall with a hook, or is that consumers themselves put the scale in a storage cabinet. The way of hanging the kitchen scale on the wall at a fixed position is not flexible, and requires a corresponding hook to cooperate. Furthermore, some hooks are not quite flexible in a process of picking up a hung object, and the hung object must be moved in a specific direction, otherwise it may be hooked by the hooks. When the object is to be put back after use, it is necessary to carefully align the hanging position of the objects with the hooks. Storing the kitchen scale in the cabinet causes it inconvenient to access the kitchen scale, and the kitchen scale occupies valuable storage space.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the current kitchen scales on the market can be used for weighing only, and only have a relatively single weighing function. Moreover, some consumers have the habits of listening to some audio programs while working in the kitchen. If a special radio is used, the special radio or a mobile phone is needed to make audio programs play. Whether the audio programs are played with a special radio or a mobile phone, because there is often oil or water stains on many countertops in the kitchen, the placement of the radio or the mobile phone becomes a problem. What's more, people often get oily or dirty hands when working in the kitchen, which causes it inconvenient to operate on a radio or a mobile phone with relatively sophisticated structures and small buttons.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Based on this, it is necessary to provide a new kitchen scale. In addition to providing the weighing function, the kitchen scale also provides a function of playing audio programs, and it is also convenient to place it. The kitchen scale is unnecessarily to be placed on any countertop or does not need to occupy storage space, and it is not easily polluted by oil or water stains.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A kitchen scale, includes a scale body, a magnetic attraction part arranged in the scale body, a radio module arranged in the scale body, at least one button arranged on a surface of the scale body, and a speaker arranged in the scale body.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The details of one or more embodiments of the present application are set forth in the following drawings and description.

For the details, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an embodiment of a kitchen scale, including the scale body <b>100</b>. In this embodiment, the scale body is in a shape of a flat plate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The kitchen scale further includes the magnetic attraction part <b>1</b> arranged in the scale body <b>100</b> and configured to enable the scale body to be adsorbed on a metal surface, such as a surface of a refrigerator. Compared with a hook arranged on the scale body <b>100</b> or a structure configured to match the hook, the magnetic attraction part <b>1</b> makes it much more convenient and freer to use the kitchen scale, and sufficient safety and reliability may always be achieved. In particular, the magnetically fixing method enables the kitchen scale to be adhered to a surface of an object, which may avoid swings and reduce vibration effects, so that a user can easily operate the kitchen scale with one hand. A magnet or a magnetic block in the magnetic attraction part <b>1</b> may be selected to fit or match a shape of the scale body <b>100</b>, so that the arrangement of the magnetic block will not affect the structure and appearance of the scale body <b>100</b>. The magnetic attraction solution has obvious convenience in use. If the kitchen scale will be used to weigh objects, it may be taken off from a refrigerator and any other appliances conveniently, without paying attention to the move direction of the kitchen scale. After being used, the kitchen scale may be just put away, without taking care to align the hanging part of the kitchen scale with the hook.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The radio module <b>2</b> is arranged inside the scale body <b>100</b>, and specifically may be arranged at a position close to the edge of the scale body <b>100</b>, which makes it convenient to receive broadcast signals.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As an embodiment, the radio module <b>2</b> may include an antenna (not shown), a high frequency amplifier (not shown), a mixer (not shown), an intermediate frequency amplifier (not shown), and a power amplifier (not shown) and a speaker (not shown). The antenna, the high-frequency amplifier, the mixer, the intermediate frequency amplifier, the power amplifier, and the speaker are connected in sequence. A digital phase-locked loop circuit (not shown) may also be provided in the scale body <b>100</b>. The data output end of the phase-locked loop circuit is connected to the control terminal of the oscillator in the mixer, and a stereo indicator terminal of the mixer, which outputs intermediate frequency and amplitude, is connected to a data input end of the phase-locked loop circuit in the scale body <b>100</b>. A clock signal line and a chip select signal line are also connected between the scale body <b>100</b> and the mixer. In the present embodiment, the kitchen scale with radio function of the present disclosure is implemented through system integration based on two technical solutions, one of which is the technical solution of a scale, and the other of which is the technical solution of a wireless digital tuning radio. In the wireless digital tuning radio, the signals received by the antenna is high-amplified, mixed, mid-amplified, and power-amplified, and finally the audio signals are outputted through the speaker, and the scale body <b>100</b> may be configured to realize a selection and a control of received bands of the wireless digital tuning radio.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an embodiment, the mixer may function as a combination component of the scale body <b>100</b> and the wireless digital tuning radio. The mixer may achieve an output of a fixed difference frequency, i.e., an intermediate frequency of 10.7 MHz, by adjusting frequency of the oscillator thereof, and then the signals processed by the intermediate frequency amplification and the power amplification are outputted to the speaker (or earphone). The present disclosure may realize a control of band selection (channel selection) by configuring and using a scale body, and control the value of the digital phase-locked loop circuit (PLL) by means of software, so that the difference frequency reaches 10.7 MHz. For a channel selection performed by an automatic search, the scale body controls the value of the PLL according to the output signal fed back by the mixer by means of the internal software, to change the oscillation frequency of the voltage-controlled oscillator in the mixer, so that the intermediate frequency output maintains 10.7 MHz stably.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The kitchen scale also includes at least one button arranged on the surface of the scale body <b>100</b>. In this embodiment, the at least one button are two buttons, namely a first scroll button <b>3</b> and a second scroll button <b>4</b> in the figure, which are arranged at the sides of the scale body <b>100</b>. For the details, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view of the kitchen scale of this embodiment. The scroll buttons are arranged at the side of the scale body <b>100</b> to allow the user to conveniently adjust the scroll buttons when the kitchen scale is placed, for example, on a refrigerator. In another embodiment, the at least one button may be a touch button, and the number of the touch buttons may also be two. The position where the touch buttons are arranged may also be the upper surface or the side of the scale body, and it is not limited herein.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the kitchen scale further includes a speaker <b>5</b> arranged in the scale body <b>100</b>. When the upper surface of the scale body <b>100</b> is adhered to, such as a surface of a refrigerator, the bottom of the scale body <b>100</b> is in an unobstructed state, so that the sound waves from the speaker <b>5</b> may be well transmitted. Even if the bottom surface of the scale body <b>100</b> is adhered to, such as a surface of a refrigerator, since the scale body <b>100</b> generally has several supporting feet (not shown), a certain gap will be left between the scale body <b>100</b> and the surface on which the scale body is adhered to, therefore the sound of the speaker <b>5</b> will not be affected.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional view of the kitchen scale along the line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which shows the magnetic attraction portion <b>1</b> fixed in the scale body <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, the magnetic attraction part <b>1</b> may be fixed in the scale body <b>100</b> by double-sided adhesive bonding.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment, the magnetic attraction part <b>1</b> may be fixed in the scale body <b>100</b> by screws.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an embodiment, the magnetic attraction part <b>1</b> may be fixed in the scale body <b>100</b> by welding.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment, the first scroll button <b>3</b> is a switch and volume adjustment button of the radio module <b>2</b>.
