invention relates to the use of a refractory coating composition for production of cores for diecasting, to a kit for production of cores for diecasting, to a method of producing cores for diecasting, to cores suitable for use in diecasting, and to the use of such cores in diecasting, especially in the diecasting of lightweight metals. Further details of the invention will be apparent from the appended claims, and from the description that follows and the working examples.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the metal casting of workpieces that are to have cavities, undercuts or the like, cores are inserted into the casting mold in order to keep the corresponding regions of the mold free of the metal melt.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Diecasting is understood to mean an industrial casting method in which, for series and mass production of castings, a metal melt is introduced under high pressure (10 MPa to 200 MPa) and with a high mold fill rate (up to 12 m/s) into a two- or multipart permanent mold, where it solidifies. Especially suitable for diecasting are low-melting metals, for example aluminum and magnesium, and alloys containing aluminum and/or magnesium.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In cores that are inserted into the mold in the diecasting of workpieces from metal, in order to keep the cavities envisaged in the workpieces clear in the course of filling of the molds with the melt, high demands are made with regard to dimensional stability thereof under mechanical and thermal stress during the casting operation and with regard to easy demoldability from the cavities after the casting operation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2011/151420 A1 discloses cores based on salt (e.g. sodium chloride) that are producible by shaping and compacting a core material mixture consisting of at least one salt, at least one binder (e.g. waterglass) and optionally auxiliaries such as additives, wetting agents and catalysts, wherein the salt, the binder and any auxiliaries used are inorganic, these core materials are soluble with water as solvent, the parts are shaped and compacted by core shooting or pressing, and the compacted cores are stabilized by an infiltrate. The cores may additionally be provided with a refractory coating. However, the production of salt cores is relatively complex, and the use thereof is associated with some drawbacks, such as high weight, brittleness, and low storage stability on account of the hygroscopicity of water-soluble salts. The demolding of the casting by dissolution of the salt cores results in a solution which has to be dried in order to recover the salt, or which has to be disposed of.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">US 2018/0318912 A1 discloses a core for use in the diecasting of aluminum, wherein the core comprises a combination of a synthetic ceramic mold base material, a sodium silicate-containing inorganic binder and an additive containing particulate amorphous silicon dioxide. The core may have a refractory coating; this is intended to prevent penetration of aluminum that has melted during the diecasting from penetrating through the surface into the core. Suitable refractories specified for the refractory coating are zirconium oxide and aluminum oxide, which are to be used in the form of fine powders.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">WO 2013/044904 A1 discloses a refractory coating composition comprising<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">(A) at least the following clays:    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">(A1) 1 to 10 parts by weight of palygorskite,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">(A2) 1 to 10 parts by weight of hectorite and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">(A3) 1 to 20 parts by weight of sodium bentonite, based on the ratio of components (A1), (A2) and (A3) relative to one another, and</li>    </ul>    </li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0012">(B) a carrier liquid containing water which is fully evaporable at up to 160&#xb0; C. and 1013 mbar, and (C) refractories other than (A).</li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0013">The total clay content A1, A2 and A3 of the refractory coating is preferably 0.1 by weight to 4.0% by weight in total, based on the solids content of the refractory coating composition. The refractories (C) are preferably quartz, aluminum oxide, zirconium dioxide, aluminum silicates, zirconium sands, zirconium silicates, olivine, talc, mica, graphite, coke, feldspar, diatomite, kaolins, calcined kaolins, kaolinite, metakaolinite, iron oxide, bauxite and/or mixtures thereof. If the refractory coating composition is used as a concentrate, the proportion of the refractory (C) in the refractory coating composition is greater than 70% by weight, preferably greater than 80% by weight, based in each case on the solids content of the refractory coating composition.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0014">DE 10 2005 041 863 A1 discloses a molding compound for the production of casting molds for the foundry industry, at least comprising a refractory molding material, a binder for curing of the molding compound, and a proportion of a borosilicate glass.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0015">DE 10 2014 004 914 A1 discloses a casting mold and a casting mold core made of molding sand for metal casting, wherein a first layer is disposed on the surface of molding sand grains of the molding sand, wherein the first layer has been cured and consists of waterglass and/or phosphate glass.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">WO 2013/044904 A1, DE 10 2005 041 863 A1 and DE 10 2014 004 914 A1 do not relate to the technical field of diecasting.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0017">There is a constant need in the foundry industry for cores suitable for diecasting, and for suitable starting materials and methods for the production of cores suitable for use in diecasting.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">A first aspect of the invention relates to a kit for production of cores for use in diecasting.

Component (D) of the kit of the invention is a refractory coating composition or a concentrate for production of a refractory coating composition. The refractory coating composition is a coating composition and serves for production of a coating (refractory coating) on the main body which extends at least over the entire surface of the core which comes into contact with a metal melt in the casting operation. The refractory coating preferably extends over the entire surface of the core.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0035">It has been found that, surprisingly, when cores of the invention are used in diecasting, in spite of the high pressure of the metal melt, penetration of the core surface by the metal melt is largely prevented. This is achieved by the refractory coating of the core of the invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0036">Component (A) of the kit of the invention constitutes the mold base material of the molding material mixture to be produced from components (A), (B) and (C) of the kit.

The noninventive coating composition corresponds to customary commercially available refractory coating compositions.

Light Microscopy Analysis</p><p id="p-0172" num="0291">Pieces were sawn out of an inventive core (production and composition as described in point 1, coating composition as specified in table 1 above) and a noninventive core (production and composition as described in point 1, coating composition as specified in table 1 above) and embedded by means of a two-component epoxy resin under reduced pressure. This was followed by preparation by means of a Struers Tegramin 20 grinding and polishing machine. This involved first grinding the samples by means of diamond disks and subsequently polishing with diamond suspensions until the final stage, resulting in what is called a polished section. Thereafter, the polished sections produced were microscopically examined by means of a Zeiss Axioscope 5 light microscope with Axiocam 305 color (D) microscopy camera.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0292">On comparison of the dried cores (inventive vs. noninventive), a distinct difference in surface characteristics was apparent. In the case of noninventive cores, the refractory coating has penetrated very deep into the main body and has barely any surface-sealing action, such that the mold base material (A) is clearly apparent through the coating by the naked eye. Inventive cores, by contrast, feature a smooth surface seal, meaning that a coherent top layer virtually free of macroscopic pores has been deposited above the main body such that it is not apparent which mold base material (A) is present beneath the coating.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0293"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a polished section of the noninventive core; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a polished section of the inventive core. The section in each case extends over a near-surface region of the main body and the coating disposed on the surface thereof. In the main body, the relatively large particles of the mold base material (H32 quartz sand, see above) are clearly apparent (at the lower edge of the image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at the upper edge of the image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The coating adjoins the surfaces of the outer particles of the main body.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0294"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows that the grainy particles of the noninventive coating composition have been deposited entirely randomly, i.e. without any particular alignment, on the surface of the core. Although the grainy particles penetrate into pores between the particles of the mold base material, these are not covered and sealed. Therefore, the surface formed by the coating is not smooth and flat, but at least partly reproduces the contours of the surface of the main body, meaning that the coating has unevenness and depressions that to a certain degree reflect the irregularities of the surface of the main body.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0295"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows that the platelet-shaped particles of the coating composition of the invention are aligned with their longest dimension parallel to the core surface, and hence bridge and cover the unevenness and depressions filled by the grainy particles on the surface of the main body, such that the irregularities of the surface of the main body barely affect the surface of the coating. Therefore, the coating has a relatively flat and smooth surface.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0296">3. Casting Tests</p><p id="p-0178" num="0297">Casting tests with aluminum were conducted in a cold-chamber diecasting machine. It was possible here with cores of the invention to successfully produce castings with a gate speed of 15 m/s to 20 m/s without penetration defects (penetration of the melt into the core) or core fracture. In the case of casting with noninventive cores under the same conditions, by contrast, penetration defects were always found. After casting, the cast parts are quenched in a water bath.
