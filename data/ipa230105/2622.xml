Such autothrottles provide the ability to realize truly automated, hands-off control of the aircraft, thus providing increased aircraft operating efficiencies, reducing cost in, for example, the consumption of fuel, and vastly decreasing pilot workload and thereby notably increasing flight safety. Autothrottles are ubiquitous on large or sophisticated high-end aircraft, such as airline passenger jets, advanced regional and general aviation jets, and advanced turbine-propeller airplanes, which generally incorporate an autothrottle as part of a comprehensive flight management system (FMS). The FMS also provides autopilot control with lateral navigation (LNAV) and vertical navigation (VNAV), which may control the aircraft along its flight plan and maintain its operation within a safety envelope. FMS's are comprehensive systems that are fundamentally integrated into the aircraft by the aircraft's manufacturer, and comprise a variety of sensors and actuators throughout the aircraft to assess the aircraft's configuration, position, orientation, speed, altitude, and performance, among other monitored parameters.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to the complexity and cost of FMS's, such systems have traditionally been considered impractical for smaller aircraft, such as those used for general aviation. Small aircraft may include aircraft with single or multiple engines using pistons or turbines (e.g., light aircraft or very light jet (VU)), and which generally accommodate 10 or fewer passengers. Typically small aircraft have a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of under 15,000 pounds (6,800 kg). Although small aircraft may include disparate systems such as an autopilot, GPS-based navigation, and others, such systems tend to be offered as options by aircraft manufacturers, or retrofitted to an existing aircraft, and hence are generally not integrated into a complete FMS. Also, certain sensors used by an FMS, such as a radar-based altimeter, redundant airspeed sensors, and the like, are typically absent from small aircraft, further complicating the addition of an FMS.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Likewise, autothrottle systems have traditionally been implemented in only large or technologically-advanced aircraft (e.g., which have FMS's) because traditional autothrottle systems generally require physical, spatial, and other accommodations are not available on small aircraft. In most aircraft, the throttle(s)&#x2014;which are selectively adjustable to cause the engine(s) to generate a predetermined amount of power or thrust&#x2014;are adjusted by pilot-controlled manual override displacement of one or more graspable handles on levers that are commonly mounted in the aircraft cockpit or flight control deck and movable along a linear or an arcuate path. These levers are operatively coupled to the engines or engine controller(s).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In almost any aircraft, not insignificant forces must be applied to the throttle levers-whether manually by a pilot or by an operating motor of an autothrottle system&#x2014;to vary or adjust the positions of the levers. The motors of the system, therefore, must be fairly robust, both in size and weight (to provide sufficient torque and operating forces applied to the power control lever(s) (PCL)) and in construction (to assure continued reliability through tens of thousands of activations and operations). As a consequence, only aircraft specifically designed and constructed with sufficient clearances and space to accommodate such motors and associated elements at, in, or alongside the throttles within the cockpit, and capable of accepting the significant additional weight associated with these systems and their component parts, are able to incorporate such autothrottles into and with their flight controls. Traditionally, there has been no ability to retrofit or add autothrottle capabilities into existing aircraft that have not already been specially designed and constructed to accommodate the associated operating components of an autothrottle system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 11,027,854 to Hedrick, entitled &#x201c;Precision Operator for an Aircraft Autothrottle or Autopilot System with Engine Performance Adjust,&#x201d; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, describes an autothrottle system that is compact, lightweight, reliable and readily installable in an aircraft, even in small aircraft without any special accommodation for adding or providing conventional autopilot/autothrottle capabilities. The autothrottle system includes a motor that is mechanically coupled to the aircraft's PCL via a clutchless interconnect that allows the motor to move the PCL in response to commands issued by an autothrottle controller when the autothrottle system is engaged, while also allowing the pilot to manually overpower the motor-driven motion of the PCL without first disengaging the autothrottle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although the technology described in the Hedrick patent, or in other such technology relating to autothrottle systems for small aircraft, may provide important and practical solutions to a number of challenges previously encountered in implementing autothrottles, there remains a need to further improve the pilot interface with the autothrottle system to make its operation more intuitive, simple, and safe. This need becomes increasingly pressing considering the ongoing advancements in the functionality of autothrottle systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of this disclosure is directed to a system for controlling an autothrottle of an aircraft that includes, a power-control input (PCL) manually movable by a pilot along a travel path to effect a throttle setting that controls engine power of the aircraft. The system includes an autothrottle controller including processing circuitry, memory, and input/output facilities, with the autothrottle controller being operative to execute instructions including a user-interface process and an autothrottle control program. An autothrottle actuator is mechanically coupled to the PCL and is operative to set and dynamically adjust the PCL in response to an output of the autothrottle controller. The autothrottle control program, when executed, causes the autothrottle controller to determine a control-target setting and to command the autothrottle actuator to set and dynamically adjust the PCL according to the control-target setting when the system is in an engaged state for autothrottle control. The user-interface process, when executed, causes the autothrottle controller to set and dynamically adjust a virtual detent, the virtual detent being located at a position along the travel path of the PCL corresponding to the control-target setting. The virtual detent is operative, at least when the system is in a disengaged state for autothrottle control, to indicate the control-target setting to the pilot via a haptic effect that applies a detent force opposing motion of the PCL in response to the PCL achieving the position of the virtual detent.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect is directed to a system for controlling an autothrottle of an aircraft, the system comprising an autothrottle controller that is operative to execute instructions including a user-interface process and an autothrottle control program. An autothrottle actuator sets and dynamically adjusts a throttle setting that controls engine power of the aircraft in response to an output of the autothrottle controller. An autothrottle activation input device, an autothrottle mode input device, and a display device are all operatively coupled to the autothrottle controller. The autothrottle control program, when executed, causes the autothrottle controller to determine a control-target setting and to command the autothrottle actuator to set and dynamically adjust the throttle setting according to the control-target setting when the system is in an engaged state for autothrottle control. The user-interface process, when executed, causes the autothrottle controller to respond to actuation of the autothrottle activation input device by toggling between the engaged and the disengaged states; respond to actuation of the autothrottle mode input device by switching between different ones of a plurality of autothrottle control modes; and display information indicative of a selected one of the plurality of autothrottle control modes on the display device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further aspect is directed to an autothrottle system with an autothrottle controller operative to execute instructions including an autothrottle control program, and an autothrottle actuator to set and dynamically adjust a throttle setting that controls engine power of the aircraft in response to an output of the autothrottle controller. The autothrottle control program, when executed, causes the autothrottle controller to command the autothrottle actuator to set and dynamically adjust the throttle setting according to different ones of a plurality of autothrottle control modes, where each of the autothrottle control modes defines a corresponding control-target setting. Further, the program causes the autothrottle to autonomously transition from one of the autothrottle control modes to another one of the autothrottle control modes in response to a determination by the autothrottle controller that mode-transition criteria has been met.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A method according to a related aspect of this disclosure is for controlling an autothrottle of an aircraft that includes, a PCL. The method includes: determining, by an autothrottle controller a control-target setting for a throttle of the aircraft; dynamically adjusting the throttle according to the control-target setting, including moving the PCL to achieve the control-target setting when the autothrottle is in an engaged state for autothrottle control; and setting and dynamically adjusting a virtual detent, the virtual detent being located at a position along a travel path of the PCL corresponding to the control-target setting, wherein the virtual detent is operative, at least when the autothrottle is in a disengaged state for autothrottle control, to indicate the control-target setting to the pilot via a haptic effect that applies a detent force opposing motion of the PCL in response to the PCL achieving the position of the virtual detent.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another method as described herein, an autothrottle controller performs the following operations: determining a control-target setting for a throttle of the aircraft; dynamically adjusting the throttle according to the control-target setting when the autothrottle is in an engaged state for autothrottle control; and reading input from an autothrottle activation input device; reading input from an autothrottle mode input device; responding to actuation of the autothrottle activation input device by toggling between the engaged and the disengaged states; and responding to actuation of the autothrottle mode input device by switching between different ones of a plurality of autothrottle control modes.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A further method for controlling an autothrottle of an aircraft includes: autonomously, dynamically adjusting a throttle setting according to different ones of a plurality of autothrottle control modes, where each of the autothrottle control modes defines a corresponding control-target setting;

Aircraft <b>100</b> generates lift <b>102</b> from its forward motion by directing air downward using primarily the shape and orientation of the body of aircraft <b>100</b> (e.g., its wings, fuselage, and control surfaces). Lift also depends on the density of the air, the square of the velocity, the air's viscosity and compressibility, the surface area over which the air flows. The dependence on body shape of aircraft <b>100</b> is complex and difficult to model mathematically. The effect of inclination of aircraft <b>100</b>, air viscosity (e.g., due to air temperature, humidity, and altitude), and compressibility on the lift is variable and also difficult to derive for a given operating condition.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Drag <b>104</b> is a force that resists the forward motion of aircraft <b>100</b>. Drag <b>104</b> has a number of components, such as aerodynamic friction between the air and the surface of aircraft <b>100</b> (skin friction), aerodynamic resistance to the motion of the aircraft <b>100</b> through the air (form drag), and drag caused by lift (induced drag), among others, which are likewise difficult to account for in order to compute drag predictively. Like lift <b>102</b>, drag <b>104</b> depends on a number of complex factors, including the size, shape, and weight of aircraft <b>100</b>, the surface properties of aircraft <b>100</b>, fluid characteristics of the air, and other parameters. Notably, different parameters of drag <b>104</b> prevail at different airspeeds. At low airspeeds, a primary component of drag <b>104</b> is the induced drag. As aircraft <b>100</b> increases its airspeed, lift <b>102</b> is generated more easily, and the induced drag actually reduces. However, with increasing airspeed, the other drag components, collectively referred to as parasitic drag, increase.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Thrust <b>106</b> is the propulsion force generated by aircraft <b>100</b> to overcome drag <b>104</b>. Generation of thrust requires consumption of fuel or other onboard energy source (e.g., electrical charge in the case of battery-powered aircraft). The magnitude of the thrust depends on a number of parameters relating to the propulsion system of aircraft <b>100</b>, such as the type and quantity of engines, and the throttle setting(s). Weight <b>108</b> is a combination of gravity and the mass of aircraft <b>100</b>, including the mass of the airframe, plus the mass of the fuel (which is a time-varying quantity in the case of fuel-consuming aircraft), plus any payload on board aircraft <b>100</b> (people, freight, etc., which may also be dynamically-varying as in the case of air-dropping operations). The dynamic variability of weight <b>108</b> means that the amounts of lift <b>102</b> and drag <b>104</b> also vary over time during the flight of aircraft <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The performance of aircraft <b>100</b> is limited by various physical constraints. For instance, the airspeed is practically limited by the aerodynamics and structural strength of the airframe of aircraft <b>100</b>, as well as by the available thrust. Also, there are limits to the power, thrust, or torque that the engine(s), shaft(s), propellers, and other associated components can withstand. Likewise, the engine(s) are limited by the temperature at which the engine components or fluids may be operated. Such various constraints and are typically represented as maximum ratings provided by the engine manufacturer.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">During the operation of aircraft <b>100</b>, different constraints dominate the aircraft's performance limitations depending on the phase of flight, air density and temperature, and other parameters. For instance, during takeoff and climb, the performance of aircraft <b>100</b> tends to be limited primarily by the maximum engine power, thrust, or torque, whereas during cruise, the performance of aircraft <b>100</b> tends to be limited by engine temperature.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Because of the complexity and variability of the forces of both, lift <b>102</b> and drag <b>104</b>, it is difficult for the pilot of aircraft <b>100</b> to maintain the optimal throttle setting, accounting for the current altitude, weight, and conditions of the air, in order to take off, climb, or cruise at the desired operating point, which may be, for example:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0034">the point of maximum power, thrust, or torque in takeoff or climb phases;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0035">the point of maximum temperature during cruise; or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0036">the point of maximum efficiency for maximum-endurance flight.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">According to some embodiments, an autothrottle control system is employed in an aircraft to dynamically determine a suitable PCL setting, which may correspond to a set operating point for the current phase of flight. The operating point may be set and varied by the pilot using an interface of the autothrottle system that includes the PCL. Also, the operating point may be automatically adjusted by the autothrottle system to maintain a safe flight envelope.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">In a related aspect, the interface of the autothrottle system utilizes certain specialized controlled behaviors of the PCL to effect a haptic indication. For instance, a virtual detent, or stopping point, of the PCL, as described in detail below, is implemented by the autothrottle system to indicate a PCL set point to the pilot.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">In another related aspect, a simple set of input devices, such as switches, pushbuttons, or the like, accompany the PCL to facilitate pilot control of the autothrottle, including an input to set the autothrottle control mode, and an input to set or change the virtual detent position.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">In some implementations, aspects of this disclosure may be implemented in conjunction with an autothrottle arrangement such as one shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 11,027,854, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, may be utilized. In other implementations, other suitable autothrottle arrangements may be used to implement aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a cockpit or flight deck <b>200</b> (these terms may be used interchangeably in the present context) of an aircraft, such as aircraft <b>100</b>, in which autothrottle pilot-interface controls are implemented in accordance with some embodiments of this disclosure. Cockpit <b>200</b> includes PCL <b>202</b> which, in this example, is pivotably mounted in the center console, and movable in the forward and aft directions along an arcuate travel path.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0042">PCL <b>202</b> may be a single lever, as shown in the example illustrated, or it may comprise multiple levers (not shown) in the case of a multi-engine aircraft. For simplicity, this description will refer to one or more power-control levers simply as the &#x201c;PCL,&#x201d; unless specific reference to multiple levers is intended. In a more general embodiment, rather than a lever, a power-control input may be provided in a different form. For example, a power control input may be implemented as at least one slider, knob, wheel, pedal, or other pilot-actuatable mechanism (or set of mechanisms). Here, too, for the sake of brevity, the power-control input (in whichever form it may be) is referred to simply as a &#x201c;PCL.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0043">PCL <b>202</b> is coupled, via a suitable operative coupling arrangement, to the respective engine(s) and fuel-delivery system(s) of aircraft <b>100</b>. For example, the operative coupling arrangement may be a mechanical system that regulates the engine power based on the positioning of the respective power-control lever(s). The engine power may be varied by varying the flow of fuel or combustion air to the engine(s). In another example, as in the case of a fly-by-wire arrangement, the operative coupling may include an electrical system that carries command signaling from the PCL to an actuator that regulates the engine power (e.g., flow of fuel or combustion air or, in the case of electric aircraft, the delivery of electrical power to the engine(s)) based on the settings provided into the PCL.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0044">PCL <b>202</b> is also coupled to an autothrottle actuator (not shown). The autothrottle actuator, and its coupling to PCL <b>202</b> may be implemented as described in U.S. Pat. No. 11,027,854, or they may be implemented in other suitable ways. Notably, the autothrottle actuator is arranged to move PCL <b>202</b> in accordance with the autothrottle control when the autothrottle system is engaged, while also permitting the pilot to move PCL <b>202</b> while the autothrottle system is engaged. The autothrottle system is further arranged to detect and monitor the position of PCL <b>202</b>, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 11,027,854, or by other suitable sensing means. Therefore, PCL <b>202</b> serves as a portion of the autothrottle pilot-interface controls.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0045">The example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates additional autothrottle pilot-interface controls, namely, autothrottle activation control <b>204</b>, takeoff/go around control <b>206</b>, and autothrottle mode selector <b>208</b>. These controls <b>204</b>-<b>208</b> are implemented as momentary pushbutton switches according to the embodiment depicted. However, in other embodiments, controls <b>204</b>-<b>208</b> may be implemented using other types of input mechanisms, such as selector knob(s), rocker switches, multi-position selector switch(es), toggle switch(es), push-on/push-off switch(es), soft-key controls (e.g., via touchscreen), or the like.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0046">In addition, autothrottle mode display <b>210</b> is provided. Autothrottle mode display <b>210</b> may include LED or LCD segments, a matrix of LED or LCD devices, or other suitable display technology, along with display-decoder or driver circuitry, which interfaces the display device with an autothrottle controller (described below). In the example depicted, autothrottle mode display <b>210</b> is integral with autothrottle mode selector <b>208</b> such that information is displayed on the pilot-facing surface of autothrottle mode selector <b>208</b>. In other embodiments, autothrottle mode display <b>210</b> is separate from autothrottle mode selector <b>208</b>, and may be placed elsewhere in the control panel of cockpit <b>200</b>. In still other embodiments, autothrottle mode display <b>210</b> is implemented using a general-purpose information display present in cockpit <b>200</b>, such as an instrument display or navigation display screen, or as part of the information displayed on a heads-up display.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an autothrottle control system <b>300</b> according to some embodiments. As depicted, system <b>300</b> includes manual throttle input <b>302</b>, which may take the form of a PCL, such as PCL <b>202</b>, or other type.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0048">Autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> is a parallel subsystem to manual throttle input <b>302</b>. Autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> automatically regulates the engine power based on command signaling <b>305</b> that is generated by autothrottle controller <b>310</b>. In one example, autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> comprises a motor and motor controller, such as a servo motor system, with the rotor of the motor mechanically coupled to manual throttle input <b>302</b>. In another example, autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> is an actuator coupled to the engine(s) or fuel system of aircraft <b>100</b>, and may include one or more valves for controlling a flow rate of fuel of combustion air to the engine(s). In another example, autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> includes one or more switches, transmission gates, or signal amplifiers interfaced with an engine control system of aircraft <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0049">Manual throttle input <b>302</b> and the output of autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> combine to produce throttle setting <b>306</b>, which is provided as the engine-power input to the engine(s) and fuel system as applicable. The combination of manual throttle input <b>302</b> and the output of autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> may be achieved mechanically, electromechanically, or electronically, according to various implementations.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0050">In some embodiments, when autothrottle is engaged, autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> controls throttle setting <b>306</b> in the absence of manual throttle input <b>302</b>; however, manual throttle input <b>302</b>, when present, overrides autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> to control throttle setting <b>306</b>. In other embodiments, throttle setting <b>306</b> may implement a different combination of manual throttle <b>302</b> and autothrottle <b>304</b> when both inputs are supplied simultaneously. For instance, autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> may be provided to throttle setting <b>306</b> as a relatively lower-weighted input, whereas manual throttle input <b>302</b> may be provided as a relatively higher-weighted input. In related implementations, a sufficient force is needed at manual throttle input <b>302</b> to override autothrottle actuator <b>304</b>. In other related implementations, throttle setting <b>306</b> provides a mechanical force or electronic signal as feedback <b>307</b> to manual throttle input <b>302</b>, such that the effect of autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> may be felt or otherwise observed by the pilot at manual throttle input <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0051">Throttle setting sensor <b>308</b> is arranged to detect the state of throttle setting <b>306</b>, and provide signal <b>309</b> representing that detected state to autothrottle controller <b>310</b>. Notably, signal <b>309</b> represents the effect of manual throttle input <b>302</b> on throttle setting <b>306</b> when manual throttle input <b>302</b> is asserted. In some embodiments, throttle setting sensor <b>308</b> is not necessary and may be omitted, for instance, when throttle setting <b>306</b> is output as an electronic signal (in which case throttle setting <b>306</b> may be fed directly to autothrottle controller <b>310</b>). Throttle setting sensor <b>308</b> may be utilized in embodiments where throttle setting <b>306</b> is realized as a mechanical force or motion (such as movement or positioning of a power-control lever, or movement or positioning of a throttle-control cable or associated linkage).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0052">Autothrottle controller <b>310</b> produces command signaling <b>305</b> for the control of autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> based on a plurality of inputs. Autothrottle mode input <b>312</b> is provided by the pilot of aircraft <b>100</b> via autothrottle mode selector <b>208</b>, and includes such parameters as engagement/disengagement of autothrottle controller <b>310</b>, and selection from one or more available autothrottle programs that define the behavior or operational objective of the autothrottle.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0053">Other inputs to autothrottle controller <b>310</b> may include autothrottle activation input <b>314</b>, and autothrottle TO-GA command input <b>316</b>. Autothrottle activation input <b>314</b> is provided via autothrottle activation control <b>204</b>, and is operable by the pilot in various patterns (e.g., short press/long press) to select between engaged and armed states of the autothrottle control, as well as to completely disengage the autothrottle to a disarmed state. Autothrottle takeoff/go around (TO-GA) input is provided via takeoff/go around control <b>206</b>, and is operable by the pilot to place the autothrottle in a takeoff autothrottle program when aircraft <b>100</b> is on the ground, or to place the autothrottle in a climb (go-around) program when aircraft <b>100</b> is in the air. Additional functions may be assigned to inputs <b>312</b>-<b>316</b>, which may be actuated individually, or in combination with throttle input <b>302</b> via PCL <b>202</b>. For instance, autothrottle activation input <b>314</b> may be further activated in a certain pattern (e.g., double-press) by the pilot to toggle between coarse or fine speed adjustment of the autothrottle. Likewise, actuation of autothrottle activation input <b>314</b> in conjunction with positioning of PCL <b>202</b> may be used by the pilot to set or re-set an autothrottle control-target setting.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0054">Autothrottle controller <b>310</b> may also receive various inputs from sensors, such as engine temperature sensor <b>320</b>, engine torque sensor <b>322</b>, and airspeed sensor <b>324</b>, along with other available sensors on aircraft <b>100</b>, such as altimeter, fuel-consumption-rate sensor, etc.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a simplified block diagram illustrating components of autothrottle controller <b>310</b> according to an example implementation.

Input/output (I/O) controller <b>418</b> includes interfaces to the various inputs and command signaling output <b>305</b> described above. In some implementations, I/O controller <b>418</b> may include a universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) for serial communications, a parallel port, analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, or a digital-to-analog converter (D/A).

Each process or program comprises a set of instructions executable by autothrottle controller <b>310</b> for operating autothrottle control system <b>300</b>. In general, each of programs <b>510</b>-<b>518</b> is executed individually (although one program may automatically transition to another program).

If the autothrottle system is in the armed-disengaged state <b>604</b> and the mode is set to Takeoff (TO) mode, activating the takeoff/go around control <b>206</b> button on the throttle handle will activate TO mode and PCL <b>202</b> will automatically advance to the maximum continuous thrust setting. When aircraft <b>100</b> is in the air, pressing the takeoff/go around control <b>206</b> button while the autothrottle is in either armed state <b>612</b>, <b>614</b> will activate Go-Around (GO) mode and the PCL will automatically advance to maximum continuous thrust under the control of the autothrottle.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0067">In some embodiments, behavior of the PCL is controlled in a specific manner by user-interface process <b>502</b> to set one or more variably-positionable virtual detents along the travel path of PCL <b>202</b>. The virtual detents are thus implemented by autothrottle controller <b>310</b> and autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> to indicate an autothrottle control-target setting to the pilot through a haptic effect using PCL <b>202</b>. A virtual detent may be effected by application of a force by autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> that opposes manual throttle input <b>302</b> at a set location along the travel path of PCL <b>202</b>. The position of the virtual detent along the travel path of PCL <b>202</b> is variable by autothrottle controller <b>310</b>. Likewise, the detent force may be variable by autothrottle controller <b>310</b>. Multiple virtual detents of the same, or different, detent forces may be implemented at a given time along the travel path of PCL <b>202</b>. As described in greater detail below, the virtual detents may be automatically varied by other processes, such as flight-safety oversight process <b>504</b>, engine-thrust program <b>512</b>, and others, to account for changes in operating conditions of aircraft <b>100</b>. When a virtual detent position is autonomously moved by autothrottle controller <b>310</b> while the PCL is set at the virtual detent, the PCL <b>202</b> is moved to the revised detent position.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating examples of virtual detent force at various positions along the travel path of the PCL. As depicted, a first virtual detent <b>702</b> is implemented as a force applied by the autothrottle system to oppose the motion of the PCL when the PCL is positioned at a portion along its travel path. A second virtual detent <b>704</b> is similarly implemented at another position. Notably, second virtual detent <b>704</b> has a higher detent force than virtual detent <b>702</b>, and is applied over a greater (wider) range of the travel path. First virtual detent <b>702</b> may represent a virtual detent associated with a particular engine thrust setting, whereas second detent <b>704</b> may represent a safety-based limit of engine thrust.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref> illustrate another example of a virtual detent <b>800</b>A, <b>800</b>B which is composed of a combination of oppositely-directed forces applied by the autothrottle system to provide the haptic sensation of the PCL &#x201c;falling into&#x201d; a detent. Virtual detent <b>800</b>A, <b>800</b>B is implemented by autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> under the control of autothrottle controller <b>310</b>, which also monitors the PCL position via throttle setting sensor <b>308</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, virtual detent <b>800</b>A is composed of two opposite detent forces that are applied sequentially as the PCL is moved in first direction <b>802</b>A along its travel path. Non-opposing detent force <b>804</b>A is oriented in the direction of travel (i.e., assisting the movement of the PCL along direction <b>802</b>A), whereas detent force <b>806</b> opposes any movement of the PCL. This combination of forces simulates the haptic sensation of a mechanical detent into which the PCL would be drawn. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> illustrates the virtual detent <b>800</b>B, which achieves the same PCL setting as virtual detent <b>800</b>A, except that virtual detent <b>800</b>B is implemented as the PCL moves toward its location in the opposite direction, <b>802</b>B. As the PCL approaches the location of virtual detent <b>800</b>B, non-opposing detent force <b>804</b>B is applied along the direction of travel <b>802</b>B, and then detent force <b>806</b> opposes the direction of travel. This example demonstrates that a virtual detent may be responsive to the direction of manual movement of the PCL.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0070">User-interface process <b>502</b> facilitates various pilot interactions with the virtual detent(s). For instance, momentary actuation of autothrottle activation control <b>204</b> while the autothrottle is in the armed-engaged state <b>612</b> releases the virtual detent while transitioning the state to the armed-disengaged state <b>614</b>, thus allowing movement of PCL <b>202</b> to a different position (which may or may not itself be another virtual detent). In a related embodiment, manual placement of PCL <b>202</b> at a position of a virtual detent (while autothrottle system <b>300</b> is in the armed-disengaged state <b>614</b>) will cause the autothrottle to re-engage into armed-engaged state <b>612</b> (provided that the selected mode accommodates such engagement). As another provision by user-interface process <b>502</b>, the pilot of aircraft <b>100</b> may set a new virtual detent by holding the autothrottle activation control <b>204</b> button while moving the PCL to a position that achieves the desired setting for torque, indicated air speed (IAS) or Mach number.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0071">Turning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, flight-safety oversight process <b>504</b> is operative to monitor the aircraft's sensors (e.g., engine temperature sensor <b>320</b>, engine torque sensor <b>322</b>, airspeed sensor <b>324</b>, altimeter, etc.) and compare the present state of operation or performance, or the condition, of aircraft <b>100</b> to the predefined constraints of aircraft <b>100</b> and its engine(s), to ensure that the aircraft is being operated within its safe flight envelope. For instance, overspeed/underspeed at the present altitude, temperature limit, torque limit, differential torque in multi-engine aircraft, and the like, may be monitored, and the autothrottle system's controls may be overridden to adjust the PCL setting so that the aircraft remains within safe operating conditions.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0072">In related embodiments, flight-safety oversight process <b>504</b> may set or vary the position(s) of one or more virtual detents according to variations in altitude, engine temperature, or other measured conditions. For instance, if an engine temperature limit is being approached by the current measured temperature, a virtual detent may be added or moved to indicate a limit to the pilot when the autopilot system <b>300</b> is in the armed-disengaged state. In a related example, the virtual detent associated with a safety limit has a higher detent force (i.e., the force opposing pilot movement of the PCL) than a non-safety-related detent.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0073">Airspeed program <b>510</b> causes the autothrottle to implement a basic fixed-airspeed control (set-speed control mode). Program <b>510</b> accepts pilot input to set a particular airspeed, which may be set via manual throttle input <b>302</b>. Thereafter, airspeed program <b>510</b> operates autothrottle actuator <b>304</b> to increase engine power if the indicated airspeed drops below the set point, and to decrease engine power if the indicated airspeed rises above the set point. When the autothrottle is engaged in a set-speed control mode, the pilot may press the autothrottle activation control <b>204</b> button to release the autothrottle into armed-disengaged state <b>614</b> and move the throttle lever to select a new target speed (which may be displayed in white on display <b>210</b>). After the target speed is selected, pressing the autothrottle activation control <b>204</b> button again re-activates the autothrottle to maintain the selected airspeed. In the armed-disengaged state <b>614</b>, while in set-speed control mode, movements of the throttle lever may be translated to target speed changes rounded to 5-knot increments. Double-clicking the autothrottle activation control <b>204</b> button allows the target speed to be adjusted in (fine) 1-knot increments.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0074">Engine-thrust program <b>512</b> executes the thrust hold mode (THR) to maintain the current engine torque. Program <b>512</b> may automatically reduce the torque to enforce the applicable power and temperature limits based on the current rate-of-climb. While the autothrottle is in the armed-engaged state <b>612</b> in THR mode, the pilot may press the autothrottle activation control <b>204</b> button to temporarily release the autothrottle into the armed-disengaged state <b>614</b>, and manually move PCL <b>202</b> to select a new thrust setting. In armed-disengaged state <b>614</b>, the PCL will move freely unless it engages to enforce safety limits (overtemp/overspeed/undertorque/underspeed) as per flight-safety oversight process <b>504</b>. After adjusting torque, the autothrottle can be re-engaged by pressing the autothrottle activation control <b>204</b> button again to maintain the new torque.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0075">In a related embodiment, while in the armed state, the autothrottle also sets a virtual detent at the maximum continuous thrust (MCT) setting. Additional virtual detents at other thrust settings may likewise be established. Such virtual detents make common torque settings easier to select by the pilot by stopping the PCL when the defined torque setting is reached. When virtual detents are set, the PCL will move freely until the detent is reached, at which point the PCL motion is opposed by a counteracting force associated with that virtual detent.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0076">As discussed above, a virtual detent associated with a thrust setting in THR mode may be automatically moved in response to changing operational conditions. For instance, the torque limit may be adjusted as a function of density altitude.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0077">Maximize endurance program <b>512</b> implements a dynamic airspeed control algorithm for determining and maintaining an efficient operating point for aircraft <b>100</b> such that the aircraft operates at or near its maximum lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio under the prevailing conditions, such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/359,019, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0078">Maximize airspeed program <b>516</b> implements a dynamic control algorithm of autothrottle system <b>300</b> for cruise operation that monitors the engine temperature (e.g., via engine temperature sensor <b>320</b>) and adjusts the PCL setpoint to produce the maximum speed while maintaining the engine temperature at or near the applicable max-operating-temperature limit. Program <b>516</b> may set and adjust the position of a virtual detent at the dynamic PCL setpoint, allowing the pilot to vary the PCL position as desired, and to conveniently return the PCL to the temperature-limited maximum-speed control point.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0079">Takeoff/go-around program <b>518</b> implements takeoff mode (TO), climb mode (CLB), cruise mode (CRZ), and go-around mode (GA), as well as the automatic transitions between these modes. TO is initiated while aircraft <b>100</b> is on the ground. According to takeoff program <b>518</b>, autothrottle <b>300</b> advances the PCL to maintain maximum continuous torque (MCT). TO is armed by pressing the mode selector <b>208</b> button (while on the ground). Pressing the mode selector <b>208</b> button again will disarm TO.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0080">With TO armed, the pilot may initiate the autothrottle takeoff by pressing the takeoff/go around control <b>206</b> button on the PCL handle, as described above. This causes the autothrottle <b>300</b> to engage and smoothly increase power to MCT, where a virtual detent is set. Alternately, the pilot may opt to manually advance the PCL until the autothrottle reaches the virtual-detent point and engages autothrottle control to maintain MCT. Under such control, the thrust will be maintained at MCT until it is manually or automatically reduced to climb power.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0081">In accordance with takeoff/go-around program <b>518</b>, TO transitions to climb mode (CLB) upon meeting the predefined mode-transition criteria. In one implementation, the mode-transition criteria includes a predefined time duration at MCT (e.g., 2-5 minutes). In another implementation, the mode-transition criteria for entering CLB is an altitude gain, which is measurable by an available barometric altimeter in aircraft <b>100</b> (e.g., an altitude increase of 400 feet from the altitude at which the TO was initiated). This approach uses readily-available altimetry data, rather than relying on a radar-based altimeter or other expensive instrumentation, which is not commonly found on many small aircraft.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0082">In a related embodiment, the transition criteria for entering CLB includes manual reduction of PCL <b>202</b> by the pilot during TO (e.g., by actuating the autothrottle activation control <b>204</b> button to transition the autothrottle state to armed-disengaged state <b>614</b>, reducing power by manually repositioning PCL <b>202</b>, and then re-engaging the autothrottle to engaged state <b>612</b> by once again actuating activation control <b>204</b> button).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0083">In climb mode (CLB), the autothrottle maintains MCT, but will reduce power automatically to enforce engine temperature limits. If the takeoff or climb is paused by levelling off (automatically detectable as a low rate of climb such as less than 200 feet per minute by monitoring the available altimeter), the autothrottle will transition to cruise mode (CRZ) and reduce power to the maximum cruise power setpoint, at which PCL location a virtual detent is set and adjusted as needed). If the climb is resumed while the autothrottle is still engaged in CRZ, climb power can be re-selected by the pilot by pressing the activation control <b>204</b> button to disengage the autothrottle into the armed-disengaged state <b>614</b> so that the PCL may be manually advanced in order to increase power until the virtual detent associated with MCT engages, thereby re-establishing CLB control.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0084">In cruise mode (CRZ), the autothrottle controls the PCL to produce maximum cruise torque while enforcing engine temperature limits. A virtual detent is set (and adjusted as needed) at the corresponding PCL position.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0085">Go-around mode (GA) is similar to TO, except that GA is activated while the autothrottle is either in the armed-engaged state <b>612</b>, or armed-disengaged state <b>614</b>, and when aircraft <b>100</b> is in the air. Under such conditions, GA is activated upon actuation of the takeoff/go around control <b>206</b> button by the pilot. Once activated, GA functions essentially in the same manner as TO, i.e., the autothrottle sets the PCL for MCT, sets a virtual detent accordingly, and maintains this setting until a condition is met to transition to climb mode (CLB) or cruise mode (CRZ).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">ADDITIONAL NOTES AND EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0086" num="0086">Example 1 is a system for controlling an autothrottle of an aircraft that includes, a power-control input (PCL) manually movable by a pilot along a travel path to effect a throttle setting that controls engine power of the aircraft, the system comprising: an autothrottle controller including processing circuitry, memory, and input/output facilities, the autothrottle controller operative to execute instructions including a user-interface process and an autothrottle control program;
