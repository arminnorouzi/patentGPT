In specific examples, the present invention relates to electrodes for use in batteries, for example lithium-ion batteries, i.e., lithium-ion cells, and methods of fabricating electrodes and batteries. More particularly, example embodiments relate to lithium-ion batteries, anodes for lithium-ion batteries, methods of fabricating anodes and lithium-ion batteries, and/or methods of preparing components or materials for use in anodes and lithium-ion batteries.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lithium-ion based battery cells are an attractive energy source for various applications, due in part to their ability to provide relatively high energies and long cycle life. Performance characteristics of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), for example the total energy capacity, depend on the type of anode and cathode used in the LIBs. In the field of anode materials for use in lithium-ion batteries, with a theoretical capacity of up to 4200 mAh/g, silicon has been considered as a promising anode material for next generation LIB s, for example to replace graphite. However, silicon generally suffers from enormous volume change (in the order of 300%) during the lithiation and de-lithiation processes, causing cracking and pulverisation of active materials, followed by disintegration of the anode and leading to rapid degradation of capacity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some approaches involving nano-structured silicon (nano-silicon) can alleviate the volume expansion of silicon to some extent, nevertheless, the known synthesis processes involving nano-silicon are relatively complicated, expensive, and difficult to be industrialised.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve improved performance in silicon based anodes in LIBs, particularly high-energy LIBs, important issues to be addressed may include: (a) homogeneous distribution of silicon particles in a conductive matrix; (b) ability for mass production of silicon secondary particles to achieve both high gravimetric and high volumetric energy densities with high initial Coulombic efficiency; and (c) excellent mechanical properties of the anode.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Chinese patent application CN 108807861 A, to Amprius Nanjing Company Limited, discloses a method of fabricating an anode for a lithium-ion battery, comprising the steps of milling a mixture of nano-silicon, one or more carbonaceous materials (paragraph [0028]) and one or more solvents, wherein the mixture is retained as a wet slurry during milling; carbonising the mixture at a carbonisation temperature to produce a silicon coated with carbon (Si@C) material; milling a second mixture of the Si@C material, one or more second carbonaceous materials and one or more second solvents, wherein the second mixture is retained as a second wet slurry during milling; carbonising the second mixture at a second carbonisation temperature to produce a Si@C/carbon material; and forming the anode from the Si@C/carbon material. Although CN'861 describes the silicon as being &#x201c;nano-silicon&#x201d;, the silicon used is in the order of 3-4</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> of CN'<b>861</b> shows a silicon carbon composite material formed of irregularly-shaped secondary particles obtained from the process described in CN'861. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a particle that is surrounded by a continuous amorphous carbon protective layer, inside of which is a plurality of secondary particles composed of a silicon material. Also contained in the particle is a conductive additive, such as carbon nanotubes, dispersed uniformly throughout the mixture. The silicon material and conductive filler are each surrounded by amorphous carbon filler, which is then in turn surrounded by the continuous amorphous carbon protective layer. Accordingly, CN'861 teaches that a uniform, relatively thin coating of nano-silicon is difficult to achieve. A uniform, relatively thin nano-silicon coating is expected to give rise to increased cycle life in the resulting battery.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Zhou, et al. (&#x201c;Preparation and characterisation of core-shell structure Si/C composite with multiple carbon phases as anode materials for lithium ion batteries&#x201d;, 2016, <i>J. Alloys and Compounds, </i>vol. 658, pp. 91-97) discloses a lithium ion battery anode comprising modified spherical graphite/silicon/flake graphite/disordered carbon. The active material is prepared by mixing nano-silicon, flake graphite and citric acid then carbonising to obtain Si@CFG, adding modified spherical graphite comprising a layer of coal tar pitch (i.e., graphite and a second carbonaceous material) and performing a second carbonisation step, thereby producing a Si@CFG/spherical graphite/carbon material. Zhou, et al., notably fails to teach that the second mixing step comprises milling. Anode constitution and integrity is relatively crude as a consequence. Thou, et al., further teaches silicon particles not directly coated with carbon, which render them susceptible to expansion and side reactions, which in turn result in lower conductivity.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an object of an especially preferred form of the present invention to provide for new or improved lithium-ion batteries, anodes for lithium-ion batteries, methods of fabricating anodes and/or lithium-ion batteries, and/or methods of preparing components or materials for use in anodes and/or lithium-ion batteries.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words &#x201c;comprise&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of &#x201c;including, but not limited to&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Although the invention will be described with reference to specific examples it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below.

In the Figures, incorporated to illustrate features of an example embodiment, like reference numerals are used to identify like parts throughout the Figures.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">In one example a silicon/carbon/graphite (i.e., Si@C/G/C or Si/C/G) material is fabricated or formed for use as an anode in a lithium-ion battery (LIB) (i.e., a lithium-ion cell). The silicon/carbon/graphite material can be formed by using silicon and one or more carbonaceous materials and graphite. In various example methods of fabricating an anode the silicon content and distribution in the composite material forming the anode significantly affects the overall properties of the anode. For example, there can be a trade-off between the capacity of the anode and the stability of the anode. Therefore, selection of the type and content ratio of carbonaceous raw materials (i.e., one or more carbonaceous materials), selection of the type and content ratio of silicon, selection of the content ratio of graphite, the coating process, the mixing process, and other processes utilised, can be important aspects in achieving improved performance of an anode for application in commercial LIBs.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">To achieve a high performance anode, such as an anode formed of silicon/carbon/graphite materials, for example to replace known graphite anodes in LIBs, the inventors have addressed problems associated with: (a) achieving homogeneous distribution of silicon particles in a conductive matrix, such as graphite and carbon; (b) mass production of silicon secondary particles to achieve both high gravimetric and high volumetric energy densities with high initial Coulombic efficiency; and/or (c) excellent mechanical properties of the anode, in a particular example by utilising a cohesive, elastic, conductive and self-healing polymer binder to achieve a long cycle life of the anode.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">In example embodiments, anodes formed of different silicon/carbon/graphite materials are synthesised (i.e., fabricated) using novel methods. For example, an anode formed of a &#x201c;double carbon coated&#x201d; silicon/carbon/graphite (i.e., Si@C/G/C) material is fabricated using novel methods.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">References to Si/C/G and Si@C/G/C are intended to refer to a &#x201c;silicon/carbon/graphite&#x201d; material that is formed of or based on components of silicon (Si), carbon (C), and graphite (G). References to Si@C are intended to refer to carbon-covered silicon particles (i.e., silicon coated or covered with carbon material).
