Particularly important are electric-powered vehicles because they curtail the number of gasoline-powered cars that emit CO<sub>2 </sub>at the tailpipe and contribute to global warming. Putting more electric vehicles on the road, in combination with renewable electricity production, is a key step to a sustainable future because they release zero carbon emissions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Greater adoption of electric-powered vehicles is necessary before they will significantly lead to reduced carbon emission. Battery performance and cost are critical factors in promoting the use of electric vehicles. Lithium batteries have considerable potential for electric vehicles because of their high energy and power density. The battery electrolyte determines energy density, stability, and safety. Organic carbonate electrolytes in conventional lithium-ion batteries pose safety concerns because of non-uniform lithium deposition (lithium dendrite). The formation of lithium dendrite causes reduced energy density and cycle performance and potential fire and explosion. Ideally, we want batteries that (1) have a high energy density (&#x3e;350 kWh/kg) to power electric vehicles and (2) sustain the energy density for many cycles (&#x3e;1,000 cycles), so we do not lose performance over time that necessitates frequent replacement.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the safety concerns of conventional batteries are the main driver in the development of safer and high energy density electrolytes. Batteries are currently used everywhere, on the ships in the ocean to power generators, on airplanes to power electronic devices, on the road to power cars, and on NASA's space station. We do not want a fire in the ocean, on the road, in the air, or in outer space. The ability to develop safe, high energy-density, and long-lasting electrolytes for lithium batteries will enable their commercialization and applications in electric vehicles, portable electronic devices, and power grid.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Described herein is the development of biomass-derived gel electrolytes from polyols. The polyol-based gel electrolytes are non-flammable and have high ionic conductivity. Also described is the development of the biomass-based solvents as electrolytes and encapsulation of the liquid/solid/gel electrolytes immobilize the anion mobility in the electrolytes, enhancing the ionic conductivity.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This Summary lists several embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, and in many cases lists variations and permutations of these embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter.

Thus, for example, the phrase &#x201c;A, B, C, and/or D&#x201d; includes A, B, C, and D individually, but also includes any and all combinations and subcombinations of A, B, C, and D.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, which is synonymous with &#x201c;including&#x201d; &#x201c;containing&#x201d;, or &#x201c;characterized by&#x201d;, is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements and/or method steps. &#x201c;Comprising&#x201d; is a term of art that means that the named elements and/or steps are present, but that other elements and/or steps can be added and still fall within the scope of the relevant subject matter.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specifically recited. For example, when the phrase &#x201c;consists of&#x201d; appears in a clause of the body of a claim, rather than immediately following the preamble, it limits only the element set forth in that clause; other elements are not excluded from the claim as a whole.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; limits the scope of the related disclosure or claim to the specified materials and/or steps, plus those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the disclosed and/or claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, a method of the presently disclosed subject matter can &#x201c;consist essentially of&#x201d; one or more enumerated steps as set forth herein, which means that the one or more enumerated steps produce most or substantially all of the intended result to be produced by the claimed method.

Exemplary Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The dependence of ionic conductivity of liquid electrolytes on the Li salt concentration and viscosity form a foundation for the presently disclosed gel electrolyte systems. Typically, the viscosity of liquid electrolytes is inversely proportional to their ionic conductivities. Viscosity depends on the Li salt concentration and the nature of electrolytes themselves. In some embodiments, biomass-derived glycerate solvents can be prepared from glycerol. Typically, the &#x2014;OH groups in glycerol make glycerol reactive with metals and cell components, resulting in capacity fade (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>). However, reacting these &#x2014;OH groups with metal hydroxide (LiOH) at room temperature simply resulted in the formation of a stable viscous gel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As preliminary work for the glycerate gel electrolyte, its ionic conductivity and chemical/stability with the cell components were investigated. The ionic conductivity of the gel was &#x2dc;4.5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>S/cm (&#x2dc;0.8M LiTFSI; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>) and stable even after 37 cycles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>). The gel did not react with the Li-metal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>). Moreover, it was non-flammable and thermally stable (up to 150&#xb0; C.; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), suggesting its potential use at an extreme environment. The gel had high thermal stability, non-flammability, and solubility of lithium salts. These attributes are important to overcome the limitations of conventional electrolytes for batteries. However, its physical and chemical characteristics, affecting their ionic conductivity and stable cycling performance are not well understood.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus, in some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter relates to polyol-based gel electrolytes with high ionic conductivity (see Table 1). The polyols themselves have low ionic conductivities (&#x3c;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>S/cm). By reacting these polyols with Li metal and/or LiOH and forming the gel electrolytes, the ionic conductivity of these gel electrolytes has been enhanced 1000-fold and reached 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>S/cm.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Ionic Conductivity of Polyol and Polyol-derived Gel Electrolytes</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Ionic conductivity (S/cm)</entry><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Solvent</entry><entry>Polyol</entry><entry>Gel</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Ethylene glycol</entry><entry>3.77 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup></entry><entry>2.25 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Propanediol</entry><entry>2.00 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup></entry><entry>2.79 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Butanediol</entry><entry>1.87 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup></entry><entry>3.65 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Pentanediol</entry><entry>2.98 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup></entry><entry>1.32 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Diethylene glycol</entry><entry>8.68 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup></entry><entry>1.22 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Glycerol</entry><entry>2.00 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup></entry><entry>2.33 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">As such, these results established the feasibility of synthesizing gel electrolytes by a simple method and demonstrated that they were not flammable and had high ionic conductivity at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">Gel electrolytes were synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction between glycerol (or polyols) and LiOH at 25-60&#xb0; C. for 16 hours to ensure that the reaction was complete (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>).

These results suggested that ChCl/ethylene glycol DESs could operate and maintain its ionic conductivity when the operating temperature fluctuated.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0067">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter also relates to uses of solid composite electrolytes by incorporation of liquids, gels, and ionic liquids into porous materials. Solid electrolytes are promising solutions to suppress the lithium dendrite formation because the formation of lithium dendrite results in safety concerns from short-circuiting and fire/explosion.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0068">Current solid electrolytes can be categorized into two classes of materials: (1) polymers (poly(acrylonitrile), poly(vinylidene fluoride), and poly(methyl methacrylate); and (2) inorganic ceramics (perovskite-type, sodium superconductor (NASICON)-type, garnet-type, and sulfide-type materials. Although solid electrolytes suppress Li dendrite formation, two important challenges remain: (1) low ionic conductivity and (2) instability of the solid-solid electrolyte interface (SEI). As set forth herein, the presently disclosed subject matter overcomes the safety concerns of liquid electrolytes by creating a non-flammable polyol-based gel electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and stable cycling performance.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0069">Selected porous solid materials, including zeolites, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and metal oxides, contain Lewis acid sites. Lewis acid sites of these solids (MOFs) immobilize the anions in the electrolytes, enhancing the homogenous Li-ion flux and suppressing the Li dendrite formation. The density of Lewis acid sites can be increased by (1) adding a modulator during MOFs synthesis; and (2) increasing the number of atoms with high electronegativity in organic linkers. Increasing the concentration of modulators increases the density of Lewis acid sites.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0070">The results presented herein demonstrated that acetic acid worked as a modulator during the synthesis of UiO-66 (Zr<sub>6</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>(BDC)<sub>6</sub>; Zr-MOFs). The added acetic acid competed with organic linkers during MOF synthesis, resulting in an increase in Lewis acid sites. It was determined that the UiO-66 with the 50 equivalents of acetic acid (to organic linker content) had 30% higher catalytic activity of the esterification of levulinic acid and methanol than the non-modulated UiO-66. These results suggested that adding modulators increased Lewis acid site density.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0071">There are two main synthetic routes to gels incorporated in metal-organic frameworks: ionothermal and direct impregnation. Ionothermal synthesis works by directly synthesizing MOFs and gels simultaneously. However, this method requires that the MOF synthesis precursors are compatible with the polymers. This synthesis method has been employed to encapsulate ionic liquids in MOFs and found that the cationic and anionic components were separated by the MOF structure.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0072">Compared with ionothermal syntheses, direct impregnation methods have the advantages of being simple and being post-synthetic incorporation methods. Wet impregnation and capillary action impregnation are both based on contacting the separately synthesized MOFs and ILs, either with a solvent or neat, whereas in-situ polymer synthesis involves producing the polymers from neutral components after they have been loaded into the MOF structure.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0073">In previous studies, 1M LiTFSI was doped in the ionic liquid (IL), [PYR<sub>14</sub><sup>+</sup>][FSI<sup>&#x2212;</sup>], forming the IL electrolyte. The IL electrolyte was then encapsulated in the UiO-66 MOFs (IL@MOFs) at the 100 wt. % IL electrolyte loading. The produced IL@MOFs were assembled into the CR2032 coin cell (LiFePO<sub>4</sub>/IL@MOF/Li) and analyzed for the charge-discharge tests (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0074">The use of DESs enables an increase in Li salt loading. The cycling performance of the selected DES revealed a good cycling capability up to 50 cycles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0075">The presently disclosed solid IL@MOFs composite electrolyte showed promising results with over 97% coulombic efficiency for this preliminary stage solid-state battery. The high Coulombic efficiency was achieved because the MOFs' channels trap the bulky TFSI anions in the porous structure, enhancing the mobility of Li ions. MOFs with a high Lewis acid site density enhance the salt dissociation and Li-ion transport. Moreover, the high density of Lewis acid sites of MOFs can immobilize the small and strong coordinating anions (e.g., Cl), providing uniform Li deposition and fast Li-ion transport. In sum, this presently disclosed subject matter established the feasibility of creating solid MOF electrolytes with a high density of Lewis acid sites.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0076">The increasing demand for consumer electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), and power grids has spurred the development of rechargeable batteries. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and Lithium-metal batteries (LMBs) have great potential in these markets. Current electrolytes in LIBs and LMBs are organic carbonates. The decomposition of these electrolytes, leading to severe capacity fading, Li dendrite formation, and fire hazards. Disclosed herein are plant biomass-based gel electrolytes (glycolate and glycerate gels) for LIBs and LMBs with a high ionic conductivity of &#x3e;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>S/cm. These gels were non-volatile, stable, and rechargeable.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0077">Solid electrolytes were produced by processing wood, sawdust, and wood chips, forming a solid electrolyte (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). These solid electrolytes were non-flammable and fire-retardant, minimizing the fire hazards from the conventional electrolytes. They had low ionic conductivity of 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>-10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>S/cm.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0078">These gels were also encapsulated in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, silica-alumina, and other porous solid materials, creating various types of gel-based solid composite electrolytes.

In some embodiments, plastic wastes (including but not limited to wastes containing polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, polyethylene, and/or polystyrene) can be disintegrated into a monomeric soup or soups, which is/are thereafter used to synthesize porous solids</p><p id="p-0084" num="0079">These results suggested that gel-based composite electrolytes combine the advantages of (1) high conductivity of gels; and (2) high mechanical stability and suppression of Li dendrite formation from porous solid materials, including plant biomass/wood (polymers) and ceramics.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0080">Accordingly, the presently disclosed subject matter relates in some embodiments to gel electrolytes.

Selenium was loaded into the activated carbon by facial melt diffusion method to form Se@AC (Li et al., 2014). In short, dry activated carbon and selenium at 2:3 by weight was ball-milled at 300 rpm in acetone for 1 hour. After ball milling, the selenium and activated carbon mixture was dried at 80&#xb0; C. for 6 hours to remove acetone. Dry selenium-activated carbon mixture was heated under N<sub>2 </sub>at 10&#xb0; C/min and held isothermally to 260&#xb0; C. for 20 hours. Finally, the resulting sample was heated to 350&#xb0; C. for 3 hours to remove physiosorbed selenium and cooled down to room temperature.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0115">Fabrication of MOF separators. The PCN-250 MOF was dried at 150&#xb0; C. under 70 cc/min N<sub>2 </sub>flow over night prior to use to remove moisture. The PCN-250 separators were fabricated by a layering process. In short, &#x2dc;0.03 mg dry PCN-250 (0.1 wt. %) was dispersed in ethanol and sonicated for one hour to disperse PCN. The PCN solution (10 mL) was filtered through a conventional Celgard 2400 membrane. Then the pump was turned off to allow the PCN to distribute on the Celgard membrane. Then the 0.5 mL poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP, MW 455000 Da) in acetone (5 wt. %) was filtered on top of the PCN layer to secure the PCN particles. The PCN and PVDF-HFP solutions was filtered alternately for three times to ensure the evenly distributed PCN-250 particles on the Celgard membrane. The resulting PCN separator was peeling off from the Celgard 2400 filter membrane. The obtained MOF separators were dried at 80&#xb0; C. for 12 h in a vacuum oven prior to use.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0116">Li&#x2014;Se coin cells assembly. The cathode materials were prepared by making a slurry of Se@AC: water soluble binder (Teflon): carbon black (Super P) at 80:10:10 by weight. The mass loading of selenium was &#x2dc;1-1.5 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. The obtained slurry was coated onto the current collector and dried at 120&#xb0; C. for 1 h in a vacuum oven to form the working electrode. Common 2032-type coin cells were assembled in an argon filled glove box with moisture and oxygen contents below 1 ppm. The electrolyte contained 1M LiTFSI in 1:1 (v/v) 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL). The 1 wt. % LiNO<sub>3 </sub>was used as an additive. The anode was prepared by directly pressing lithium metal foils onto 12 mm diameter stainless steel disc. The MOF separator were cut into 16 mm disc and placed in the cells. The conventional Celgard separator was used as a control.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0117">Cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed by Autolab&#xae; using lithium metal foil as reference and counter electrodes and Se@AC as working electrode. The 10<sup>th </sup>cycle was presented throughout to compare voltammogram after the stable cycle was achieved. Cyclic voltammogram of the Se AC were conducted between 0.5-3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0118">Li-ion transference number (t<sub>Li+</sub>). A CR2032 type coin cell using two lithium metal electrodes (Li/electrolyte/Li) was assembled in an argon-filled glovebox and used for measurement. The cells were left under open circuit voltage (OCV) for at least 12 h prior to measurement. The combination of EIS and direct current DC polarization measurements, as described by Bruce and Vincent (Bruce &#x26; Vincent, 1987), was used to measure t<sub>Li+</sub>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0119">Electrochemical performance. To determine the cycling stability of the cells, galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed at 0.2 C for 100 cycles using an Arbin battery testing unit (College Station, Tex., USA) at various current densities at a cut-off voltage of 1.0-3.0 V versus Li/Li<sup>+</sup>. The current density was calculated based on the weight of selenium (1 C=&#x2dc;675 mAh/g). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured in the frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 10 mHz with a voltage amplitude of 5 mV. Before cyclic voltammetry, cycling stability, and C-rate, the cells were treated with 10 cycles of galvanostatic charge/discharge at a low rate of 0.2 C for activation.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Production of MOF Separators</heading><p id="p-0127" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows the resulting flexible MOF separator. To examine the physiochemical properties of the MOF, we characterized PCN-250 by FTIR, XRD, and N<sub>2</sub>-adsorption/desorption. PCN-250 had a high surface area of 1251 m<sup>2</sup>/g and pore volume of 0.56 cc/g (0.51 cc/g micro-pore volume), consistent with the previously reported values (Fang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018).

The Li<sup>+ </sup>transference number of conventional cells using the Celgard separator is usually &#x2dc;0.20 to 0.45 (Evans et al., 1987; Zhao et al., 2008; Li et al., 2019). Here, the Li<sup>+ </sup>transference number of cells using MOF separator was 0.7 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>), much higher than that of Celgard separator (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>). The significant increase in Li<sup>+ </sup>transference number using MOF separator suggested Lewis acidic PCN can effectively immobilize anions (Lewis base) of the salt and permit Li<sup>+ </sup>to transport.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Electrochemical Impedance Determinations</heading><p id="p-0129" num="0122">To evaluate the formation of the solid electrolyte interface and resistivity of the cell, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was conducted after Li<sup>+ </sup>transference number measurements (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>C and <b>11</b>D</figref>). The cells using MOF and Celgard separators demonstrated an increase in resistance, suggesting the formation of stable solid electrolyte interface.

In a contrast, the cell with PCN separator demonstrated the OCV of 2.9 after 48 hours. The retention of the OCV suggested that the PCN separator effectively suppressed the lithium polyselenide shuttling owing to the strong interactions between Lewis acidic Fe(II) center and the polyselenide base.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">EXAMPLE 3</heading><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Redox Behavior Determinations</heading><p id="p-0131" num="0124">To investigate the redox behavior of lithium polyselenides in the electrolyte, we performed cyclic voltammetry using MOF separator. The control experiment using Celgard-2400 showed one oxidation peak at 2.3 V and a fuzzy reaction region (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>). These results suggested that the formed lithium poly-selenides diffused to the anode and formed inactive insoluble lithium selenides. The MOF separator showed one oxidation peak at 2.3V and two pronounced reduction peaks at 1.9 and 2.2 V (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>), corresponding to the conversion of soluble lithium polyselenides (Li<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>x</sub>, 4&#x2264;x&#x2264;8) and insoluble lithium polyselenides (Li<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>2 </sub>and Li<sub>2</sub>Se).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0125">Initial activation cycles are necessary in lithium-selenium batteries because of a large interfacial contact area between carbon carrier and selenium. Our results demonstrated initial activation cycles that leads to a reversible and stable electrochemical performance. The cell with a PCN separator was measured at C/5 over 200 cycles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>). The initial discharge capacity was 1073 mAh/g, followed by a drop to &#x2dc;500 mAh/g at 12<sup>th </sup>cycle. This capacity remained relatively constant with a high coulombic efficiency, exhibiting a high capacity retention (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>D</figref>). These results are consistent with the CV measurement.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0126">The capacity of the cell using Celgard separator progressively decreased to 260 mAh/g after 50<sup>th </sup>cycle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>E</figref>). In contrast, the cell with MOF separator demonstrated the initial capacity drop is because of the activation of the cell. Thereafter the cycling performance was stable and retained the capacity of &#x2dc;500 mAh/g after 100 cycles. These results suggested a better efficiency and kinetics of the cell using PCN separator compared to that of Celgard.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0127">Coulombic efficiency is the key indicator for long-term cycling capability. The coulombic efficiency of cell using MOF separator remained relatively constant at &#x3e;97% over 100 cycles at 0.2 C.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0128">To better understand the redox behavior of the cell at different charge/discharge rates, we measured the electrochemical performance at different C-rates using MOF separators. As a control, the cell with conventional Celgard separator suffered from dramatic capacity decay. Whereas the cell with PCN separator demonstrated a much better performance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>). After an initial discharge capacity of 1073 mAh/g at C/5, the capacity reached 495 mAh/g. When cycling at different C-rates, the capacities remained relatively constant at &#x2dc;490 mAh/g for C/5, 350 mAh/g for C/2, 195 mAh/g for 2 C. Then the capacity returned to 450 mAh/g at C/5. Coulombic efficiency is the key indicator for long-term cycling capability. The coulombic efficiency of cell using PCN-250 separator remained relatively constant at &#x3e;97% over 200 cycles at 0.2 and 1 C.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">Discussion of the Examples</heading><p id="p-0136" num="0129">In summary, the MOF separator was fabricated to improve the performance of Li&#x2014;Se batteries. The Li&#x2014;Se battery cell using the MOF separator and selenium encapsulated activated carbon as the cathode demonstrated high cycle stability with a discharge capacity of 500 mAh/g at a current density of 0.2 C. The ionic sieving capacity of MOF separator is promising for rechargeable batteries because (1) the pore size of MOFs can be tuned for different lithium-based battery systems (Li&#x2014;S, Na&#x2014;S, Li-ion, Li&#x2014;Se, Li&#x2014;Te, Na&#x2014;Se), and (2) the proposed fabrication technique of the MOF separator is unique and simple, compared to self-assembly counterpart. The simplicity of this fabrication technique can be used to create separator using other MOF structures. The use of MOF-based separator to prevent side reaction of soluble organic redox intermediates will lead to the development of rechargeable organic batteries with high energy density and long cycling life.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0137" num="0130">All references cited in the instant disclosure, including but not limited to all patents, patent applications and publications thereof, scientific journal articles, and database entries are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties to the extent that they supplement, explain, provide a background for, or teach methodology, techniques, and/or compositions employed herein.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0131">Bruce &#x26; Vincent (1987) J Electroanal Chem Interfacial Electrochem 225(1):1-17.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0132">Evans et al.
