Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Magnetoresistance (MR) effect has been known as a kind of effect caused by altering the resistance of a material through variation of outside magnetic field. The physical definition of such effect is defined as a variation in resistance obtained by dividing a difference in resistance under no magnetic interference by the original resistance. Currently, MR effect has been successfully utilized in production of hard disks thereby having important commercial values. Moreover, the characterization of utilizing GMR materials to generate different resistance under different magnetized states could also be used to fabricate MRAM devices, which typically has the advantage of keeping stored data even when the device is not connected to an electrical source.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The aforementioned MR effect has also been used in magnetic field sensor areas including but not limited to for example electronic compass components used in global positioning system (GPS) of cellular phones for providing information regarding moving location to users. Currently, various magnetic field sensor technologies such as anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) sensors, GMR sensors, magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) sensors have been widely developed in the market. Nevertheless, most of these products still pose numerous shortcomings such as high chip area, high cost, high power consumption, limited sensibility, and easily affected by temperature variation and how to come up with an improved device to resolve these issues has become an important task in this field.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a semiconductor device includes a sense amplifier, a first magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) connected to the sense amplifier at a first distance, a second MTJ connected to the sense amplifier at a second distance, and a third MTJ connected to the sense amplifier at a third distance.

Typically, the sense amplifier serves to convert data stored in storage capacitor into voltages corresponding to logic 1 or 0 and display the results onto bit lines. In the meantime as a read operation is completed, electrical potentials in the storage capacitor are refreshed to original state through the bit lines.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this embodiment, each of the first MTJ <b>14</b>, the second MTJ <b>16</b>, and the third MTJ <b>18</b> could include a bottom electrode, a pinned layer, a barrier layer, a free layer, and a top electrode.

For instance, MTJs having smaller critical dimension often induces an increase in MTJ resistance while MTJs having larger critical dimension lowers their resistance. In the meantime, a strong correlation is also observed between the sense amplifier and parasitic resistance of adjacent metal interconnections or metal wirings. For instance, lower parasitic resistance is typically found with metal interconnection closer toward the sense amplifier while higher parasitic resistance is found with metal interconnection farther away from the sense amplifier.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To compensate the difference between high and low parasitic resistances generated by metal routings around sense amplifier, the present invention preferably adjusts the critical dimension of each MTJ depending on the distance between the MTJs and the sense amplifier so that more stable read voltage could be obtained. For instance, it would be desirable to dispose an MTJ with smaller critical dimension closer to the sense amplifier while placing an MTJ with larger critical dimension farther away from the sense amplifier, in which the distance between the sense amplifier and MTJs could include the length of metal interconnection or metal routing physically or directly contacting the sense amplifier and the MTJ while the critical dimension of the MTJ could include any measurement parameters including lengths, widths, long axes, short axes, diameters, radii, and/or even circumferences of the MTJs depending on the shape of the MTJs under top view perspective.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to experimental data, when the critical dimension or distance between MTJs is decreased by one nanometer an increase of 200 ohms in parasitic resistance is observed and to compensate this difference in parasitic resistance, the present invention preferably controls the critical dimension difference between the MTJ (such as the third MTJ) farthest from the sense amplifier and the MTJ (such as the first MTJ) closest to the sense amplifier to be between 3 nm to 6 nm or most preferably at 4 nm so that most stable read voltage could be obtained when a read operation is conducted on the sense amplifier.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention.
