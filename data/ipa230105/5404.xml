The inventive concept may be applied to bendable display apparatuses, foldable display apparatuses, rollable display apparatuses, flexible display apparatuses, etc. Hereinafter, an organic light emitting display apparatus will be described for example, but the inventive concept is not limited to the organic light emitting display apparatus. Also, the inventive concept is not limited to the terms of elements described in claims. Various terms &#x201c;circuit&#x201d; described in claims is not limited to hardware and may denote &#x201c;logic&#x201d; performing a corresponding function.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the display apparatus according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a display panel PNL, a timing controller TCON, a source integrated circuit (IC) SDIC, and a gate driver GDRV. The timing controller TCON and the source IC SDIC may be connected to each other through an embedded panel interface (EPI) device.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The display panel PNL may include a pixel array which displays an input image. The pixel array may include a plurality of pixels which are arranged as a matrix type based on an overlapping structure of a plurality of data lines DL and a plurality of gate lines GL. Each of the plurality of pixels may include a red (R) pixel, a green (G) pixel, and a blue (B) pixel, for implementing colors, and moreover, may further include a white (W) pixel.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each of the subpixels may include a light emitting device, a driving element, a switching element, and a storage element. Internal compensation technology and external compensation technology may be applied for compensating for a driving characteristic deviation between subpixels in association with the light emitting device and/or the driving element. The internal compensation technology may compensate for a driving current flowing in the light emitting device by using a compensation circuit included in each subpixel, regardless of a characteristic variation of the driving element. In the external compensation technology, a sensing circuit disposed outside the display panel PNL may sense a driving characteristic variation of the light emitting device and/or the driving element of each subpixel, and a compensation circuit may correct image data which is to be applied to each subpixel, in order to compensate for the sensed driving characteristic variation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The pixel array may further include a plurality of touch sensors, for implementing a touch user interface (UI). The touch sensors may each be implemented as a capacitive touch sensor which senses a touch input based on a variation of a capacitance before and after a touch is applied thereto, but are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The timing controller TCON may receive digital image data and a timing signal, including a vertical synchronization signal, a horizontal synchronization signal, and a data enable signal, from a host system. The timing controller TCON may generate timing control signals for controlling an operation timing of the source driver SDIC and an operation timing of the gate driver GDRV based on the timing signal. The timing control signals may include a source timing control signal for controlling the operation timing of the source driver SDIC and a gate timing control signal for controlling the operation timing of the gate driver GDRV. The source timing control signal may include a source output enable signal (see SOE of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) and a latch control signal (see LbR and DLYLR of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The timing controller TCON may be connected to the source driver SDIC through a clock-embedded interface device based on a coding scheme based on a point-to-point scheme and may transfer a data transfer packet including R, G, B, and W image data DATA to the source driver SDIC. In the clock-embedded interface device, because the R, G, B, and W image data DATA and a clock are included in the data transfer packet and are transferred through one transfer line, a separate clock transfer line may be omitted in a high-resolution and large-size display apparatus and the number of transfer lines may be easily reduced. In the data transfer packet, the clock may not be synchronized with the R, G, B, and W image data DATA and may have only transition information so as to be recovered by a reception circuit, and thus, a clock-embedded type may be better than a clock-split type in terms of a transfer limitation. A clock-embedded interface device may include a transfer circuit, a transfer line, and a reception circuit, the transfer circuit may be embedded into the timing controller TCON, and the reception circuit may be embedded into the source driver SDIC.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The transfer circuit may encode scrambled clock-embedded image data and clock-embedded blank data and may transfer a data transfer packet encoded in a serial data format to the reception circuit through a plurality of transfer lines. The clock-embedded blank data may include a clock training pattern (CTP) corresponding to a blank period.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, a <b>1</b> data transfer packet transferred to the reception circuit by the transfer circuit may further include control packet data CTR. The control packet data CTR may be allocated to the blank period. The blank period may be a logic low period of a data enable signal DE. The logic low period of the data enable signal DE may be an active period to which the clock-embedded image data is allocated.

As described above, even when the case <b>2</b> is applied, the present embodiment may prevent a latch error.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the present embodiment, even when the amount of data transferred between a timing controller and a source IC increases, a bandwidth of transferred data may decrease without a latch error, and thus, EMI and power consumption may be reduced or minimized.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The present embodiment may realize the following effects.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the present embodiment, a sequential performance direction of a first latch operation performed on image data may match a sequential performance direction of a second latch operation performed on the image data, with respect to a plurality of channels. Here, with respect to the same channel, the first latch operation may be earlier by a certain time difference than the second latch operation. Therefore, even when a horizontal blank period is shortened, a first latch timing and a second latch timing of first image data to be applied to the same horizontal line may not overlap with respect to the same channel, and thus, a normal latch operation may be performed without a latch error. When the horizontal blank period is shortened, a bandwidth of data transferred between a timing controller and a source IC may be reduced. As a result, in the present embodiment, even when the amount of data transferred between the timing controller and the source IC increases, a bandwidth of transferred data may decrease without a latch error, and thus, EMI and power consumption may be reduced or minimized.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, a sequential performance direction of a first latch operation and a sequential performance direction of a second latch operation performed on image data may match a direction in which an output delay amount of the source IC increases, and thus, a data charging deviation at each panel position may be reduced or minimized.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Moreover, in the present embodiment, with respect to a plurality of channels, a second latch operation may be sequentially performed based on a time split scheme, and thus, EMI peak noise may decrease.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The effects according to the present disclosure are not limited to the above examples, and other various effects may be included in the specification.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">While the present disclosure has been particularly shown and described with reference to example embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The various embodiments described above can be combined to provide further embodiments.
