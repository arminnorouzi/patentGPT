id="p-0002" num="0001">This application relates to maxillary and mandibular devices, more particularly, to such devices that provide anterior to posterior advancement and cranial to caudal advancements to the mandible while preventing disengagement between the maxillary and mandible pieces during such advancements.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many individuals suffer from disordered breathing while asleep and many others have a smallest concentric airway size while awake. Some example disorders include obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), snoring, snore arousals, sleep-related hypoxia, and other conditions dependent on and caused by snoring or OSA. OSA is a condition in which sleep is repeatedly interrupted by an inability to breathe, which is typically a results of intermittent obstruction of the airway by the tongue and a general relaxation of the muscles which stabilize the upper airway segment, which can cause a lack of oxygen, snoring, cardiovascular and neurological complications, such as sleep-induced hypertension, heart attacks, cardiac arrythmias, strokes, Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, sleep-induced hypertension, diabetes, weight gain, and depression.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The smallest concentric airway cross-sectional area (SMCA) of a normal adult, on average, is about 149 mm<sup>2</sup>. This is the narrowest point in an adult human airway. Many humans have much smaller airways as shown by cone CT scans of the airway. It has been seen that OSA patients have an SMCA on average of about 40 mm<sup>2</sup>-67 mm<sup>2</sup>. In OSA, the mandible lowers to a greater degree than in normal sleep due to activation of the upper airway muscles (due to lack of oxygen) allowing traction on hyoid bone and mouth opening to facilitate mouth breathing However, this lowering of the mandible comes at a price of reducing the antero-posterior diameter of the airway due to posterior movement of the mandible and tongue in the second half of the lowering process (the second 13&#xb0;). Anterior (sagittal) repositioning of the mandible alone does not counteract this part of physiology. Studies have shown that vertical (caudal) repositioning of the mandible has a greater influence on increasing the transverse diameter of the SMCA than anterior repositioning. Moreover, it is believed that simultaneously advancing the mandible sagittally while advancing it caudally can mitigate airway narrowing that occurs during voluntary mouth opening in OSA. Both such repositionings increase the AP diameter and transverse diameter of the SMCA simultaneously. These simultaneous increase in AP and transverse diameters effectively incrementally increases the SMCA.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Mandibular repositioning devices have been FDA-approved and used as a treatment for sleep apnea when treatment by a CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machine has been ineffective for the particular patient, or when a patient is unable to tolerate a PAP (Positive Airway Pressure) device. Most oral appliances on the market have only been able to control approximately 50% of sleep apnea events. There are a large number of patients that are intolerant to PAP devices, some due to the PAP device or the mask but most due to excessive high air pressure that may be medically recommended for keeping an open airway. Repeated adjustments have to be performed in attempts to make intolerant patients tolerate a PAP device, most of which require manual adjustments by a professional or require repeated sleep studies after a sleep study. Since a large number of patients with OSA have thus remained untreated due to various reasons, there is a serious need for a new method of treatment that can maintain an open airway during sleep using a combination of jaw stabilization and simultaneous vertical (caudal) and anterior (sagittal) advancement of the jaw and tongue, i.e., a dynamic mandibular and lingual repositioning device as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a need for improvement in mandibular repositioning devices to maintain contact between the mandibular piece and maxillary piece, i.e., prevent disengagement thereof, during anterior-posterior repositioning and cranial-caudal repositioning, especially when both types of repositioning occur simultaneously. In particular, the improvements disclosed herein may be useful for users that are capable of opening their mouth wider than the length of the protrusive flange on the mandibular piece. .</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The features introduced herein to prevent disengagement of the protrusive flange from the driver flange are accomplished without restricting the degrees of mouth opening and jaw advancement of the user. By providing mandibular repositioning devices that enable both anterior-posterior adjustment and cranial caudal adjustment, a greater range in flexibility to treat severe OSA results while allowing the user the ability to open their mouth is an unrestricted manner. Moreover, the AVMLRD device takes advantage of the correlation between mandible movements and apnea/hypopnea events by providing increasing sagittal and vertical mandibular adjustment as the jaw opens. This means that as an apnea/hypopnea event begins and the jaw opens, the AVMLRD will advance the mandible further, increasing pharyngeal space, increasing airflow, and reducing the likelihood of an apnea/hypopnea event or waking event. The combination of these two design features in the AVMLRD intraoral device provide a novel method of treating severe OSA which is not currently available on the market.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In all aspects, mandibular repositioning devices are disclosed that have a maxillary piece having a tooth covering with a driver flange protruding laterally outward on a right side proximate a backmost teeth mold and/or on a left side proximate a backmost teeth mold, and a mandibular piece having a tooth covering with a protrusive flange extending cranially therefrom positioned to have a posterior side engaged with the anterior side of each driver flange. Each driver flange has an anterior side with a convex curvature. Each protrusive flange has a posterior side having a concave-to-convex curvature from its base toward its most cranial point. The convex portion of the concave-to convex curvature engages the convex curvature of the driver flange in an rest position. Here, a plateau of a preselected height is present between the base of the protrusive flange and the tooth covering. The preselected height of the plateau prevents disconnect between each protrusive flange and its respective driver flange relative to a fully open mouth measurement between incisors of the user. The mandibular repositioning devices provide both downward movement and forward movement of the mandible of the user.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In all aspects, the convex portion of the curvature of the protrusive flange engages with the convex curvature of the driver flange at a point that is two thirds of the height of the driver flange. The protrusive flange and the driver flange are positioned to place an engagement point of the convex portion of the concave-to convex curvature with the convex curvature of the driver flange at a midpoint length that is at half the lineal distance from a vertical axis at the front of the incisors (incisor vertical axis) to a point on a parallel vertical axis aligned with the temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) at rest (TMJ vertical axis). The majority of the convex curvature of the driver flange is defined by an arc having a center at a point on the TMJ vertical axis that is one third of the height of the driver flange measured from the horizontal dental axis and has a radius length equal to the midpoint length. A convex curvature of the convex portion of the protrusive flange is defined by an arc having a center at a point on the incisor vertical axis that is at two thirds the height of driver flange measured from the horizontal dental axis and has a radius length equal to the midpoint length.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In all embodiments, the plateau can extend across the full width of the tooth covering. In one embodiment, the plateau is wedge-shaped, has a first height at the anterior base of the protrusive flange, a second height at the posterior base of the protrusive flange, and the first height is greater than the second height; and wherein the protrusive flange and driver flange are inclined equivalently to the plateau to maintain the engaged convex portion to convex curvature thereof In some embodiments, the wedge-shaped plateau extends posteriorly to a posterior terminus of the tooth covering and terminates with a third height that is smaller than the first height and the second height, and in other embodiments, terminates posteriorly at the posterior base of the protrusive flange and the driver flange extends caudally with its anterior side extending the convex curvature thereof past the posterior base of the protrusive flange into a gap defined by the plateau between the maxillary piece and the mandibular piece or extends caudally on the buccal side of the mandibular piece beyond the plateau of the mandibular piece. In all embodiments, the protrusive flange has a flange of or less than 20 mm.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In all embodiments, the protrusive flange can be removably replaceably attached to the mandibular piece. The protrusive flange slides into the tooth covering of the mandibular piece from a rear surface and engagingly saddles the dental crown against cranial movement. The dental crown defines a keyway having opposed elongate grooves, one each open in the buccal and lingual directions, and defining a tongue above the opposed elongate grooves, and wherein the protrusive flange has a keyed slider configured to slidingly mate to the keyway of the dental crown.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Likewise, in all embodiments, the driver flange is removably replaceably attached to the maxillary piece. The driver flange has a posteriorly extending post receivable in a slot having an anterior opening and being buccally juxtaposed to the backmost teeth mold of the maxillary piece.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, the maxillary piece has a housing proximate one or both of a left molar portion and a right molar portion, wherein each housing encloses a power source electrically connected to a motor and to a microprocessor and has a driver operatively connected to a means for moving the driver flange for anterior-posterior movement and cranial-caudal movement or the mandibular piece has a housing proximate one or both of a left molar portion and a right molar portion, wherein each housing encloses a power source electrically connected to a motor and to a microprocessor and has a driver operatively connected to a means for moving the protrusive flange for anterior-posterior movement, angular movement, and cranial-caudal movement. The means for moving the driver flange comprises a piezo-electric motor and an internal robotic armature positioned for repositioning of the piezo-electric motor as the cranial-caudal movement, or robotic arms connected to integrated plates in the driver flange, or robotic arms connected to separate plates for the independent cranial-caudal movement and anterior-posterior movement of the driver flange. The cranial-caudal movement of the means for moving the drive flange is synergistic to the cranial-caudal movement of the protrusive flange. The devices can also have one or more sensors positioned in the user's oral cavity in operative communication with the microprocessor within each housing of the maxillary piece. The microprocessor has nontransitory memory having stored therein a first algorithm controlling the cranial-caudal movement of the piezo-electric motor relative to data from the one or more sensors. The one or more sensors measure airway cross-sectional area, airflow volume, airflow velocity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, electrical activity of the heart, oxygen level, and combinations thereof In one embodiment, the microprocessor has a quantum microchiplet and/or a photonic integrated circuit. The devices can also include position sensors measuring a first distance for cranial-caudal movement and a second distance for anterior-posterior movement of the driver flange. The microprocessor can include a second algorithm for anterior-posterior movement under the influence of medication, sedation, anesthesia, or alcohol.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, mandibular repositioning device kits are disclosed. The kit includes a maxillary tooth covering having an elongate slot in a buccally adjacent portion of the tooth covering most proximate both a right and a left backmost teeth mold and a left and right driver flange pair that each have a post slidingly receivable in one of the elongate slots of the maxillary tooth covering and having an anterior side with a convex curvature. Each driver flange is removably replaceable. The kit also includes a mandibular tooth covering having an elongate keyway extending anteriorly from each rear surface most proximate a right and a left backmost teeth mold and a left and right protrusive flange pair each slidably mountable to one of the elongate keyways of the mandibular piece. Each protrusive flange, once slidably mounted to the mandibular piece, extends cranially from the mandibular piece and has a posterior side engageable with the anterior side of a respective one of the driver flanges. The posterior side of each protrusive flange has a concave-to-convex curvature from its base toward its most cranial point and a convex portion of the concave-to convex curvature engages the convex curvature of the driver flange in a rest position. In use, downward movement of the mandibular piece moves the convex portion of the posterior side of the protrusive flange along the convex curvature of the driver flange, thereby moving a user's mandible forward while opening the user's mouth.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The kit can include plurality of left and right protrusive flange pairs, where at least one of the left and right protrusive flange pairs each have a plateau of a preselected height between a base of each protrusive flange and a keyed slider extending caudally from the protrusive flange. The preselected height of the plateau prevents disconnect between each protrusive flange and its respective driver flange relative to a fully open mouth measurement between incisors of the user. Each protrusive flange engagingly saddles either a left backmost teeth mold or a right backmost teeth mold of the mandibular piece against cranial movement, and each elongate keyway has opposed elongate grooves, one each open in buccal and lingual directions, and defining a tongue above the opposed elongate grooves. The protrusive flange has a keyed slider configured to slidingly mate to the keyway of the dental crown.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The kit can include a plurality of left and right protrusive flange pairs differing in protrusive flange height, angle, posterior side distance from the rear surface, and combinations thereof. The kit can also include a plurality of left and right driver flange pairs differing in width, convex curvature of the anterior side, posterior lean, and combinations thereof.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Many aspects of the disclosure can be better understood with reference to the following drawings.

of which are additionally illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, a mandibular lingual repositioning device (MLRD) that is dynamic in its movement of the jaw(s) and tongue is represented collectively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> by reference number <b>100</b>. The MLRD <b>100</b> has a maxillary piece <b>102</b> seated on a mandibular piece <b>104</b> for operative communication of drivers built therein.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the mandibular piece <b>104</b> is shown, which has a first teeth covering <b>106</b> and has a housing <b>108</b> proximate each of a left molar portion <b>110</b> and a right molar portion <b>112</b>. A protrusive flange <b>114</b> extends cranially from each housing <b>108</b>, and a stimulator <b>116</b> extends from each housing <b>108</b> toward the tongue at a position to lie under the tongue in contact with lingual muscles, in particular the Genioglossus (GG), the Geniohyoid (GH), sub-mentalis (SM), and Glossopharyngeal (GP) muscles. The stimulator protrusion <b>116</b> of each housing <b>108</b> should be fitted to the user/custom made for the user to ensure proper contact with the lingual muscles. Each stimulator portion <b>116</b> while appearing somewhat boxy-looking in the drawings, is more preferably molded of moldable material suitable for use in a human oral cavity and has smooth transitions to its shape and is shaped to match the shape of the user's mouth, especially to sit under the tongue in contact with the base of the tongue and the floor of the mouth as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The moldable material may be any of those commercially available or hereinafter developed for use in a human oral cavity. The moldable material can be shaped and sized to fit the entire tongue like a glove or sock. It may also retain the tongue in its awake position thereby preventing it from falling back passively into the airway while asleep whilst still allowing voluntary movements of the tongue such as involved in speech and swallowing. The moldable material could also extend from the molar left side all the way to the front and then to the right side, thus fitting like a horse-shoe around the base of the tongue so as to evenly electrify all components of the muscles it comes in contact with when an electrical stimulator is present.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring now to the transverse cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, each housing <b>108</b> encloses, in a fluid-tight manner, a power source <b>120</b> electrically connected to a motor <b>122</b>, to a circuit board <b>124</b>, and to the stimulator <b>116</b>. A first driver <b>130</b> is operatively connected to each motor <b>122</b> for cranial to caudal adjustments of the device <b>100</b>.

In all embodiments, while the teeth coverings <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> are shown as full coverings for all teeth in the mandible and all teeth in the maxilla, the teeth coverings are not limited thereto. Instead, each teeth covering may be a partial cover for one or more teeth, as such, the mandibular piece <b>104</b> may be a two-part configuration having a left and a right portion each with a housing <b>108</b> and the maxillary piece <b>102</b> may be a two-part configuration having a left and a right portion each with a housing <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In all embodiments herein, each housing <b>108</b>, <b>109</b> is described herein as positioned proximate a molar portion of a teeth covering, but is not limited to any particular size, i.e., the number of teeth to which it is associated.

A releasably, removably attachable protrusive flange <b>114</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> to accommodate an interchangeability of protrusive flanges <b>114</b> of different shapes and sizes to provide the best fit for the user's mouth. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the protrusive flanges <b>114</b> are generally an elongate linear flange protruding cranially from each of the housing <b>108</b>. The protrusive flange <b>114</b> may be a housing containing within an antenna, a receiver-transmitter for two-way communication, an infrared homing or signaling device, a unique signature emitting device, an encoder or a multi-polarity magnetic clasp that facilitates coordinated movements with the second driver <b>132</b> with which the protrusive flange <b>114</b> articulates.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the protrusive flange <b>114</b>&#x2032; is releasably attachable to the housing <b>108</b> of the mandibular piece <b>104</b>.

The new feature in this embodiment is that the posterior side <b>145</b> of the protrusive flange <b>114</b>&#x2032; is arcuately shaped as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> as a concave surface, which mates with a driver <b>132</b> having a convex surface shaped to match the concavity of the posterior side <b>145</b>. The protrusive flange <b>114</b> or <b>114</b>&#x2032; and its post <b>144</b> may lean posteriorly at any angle that may suit the need of a particular user. The midpoint <b>147</b>, relative to being the middle or halfway point between the free end <b>142</b> and the opposing end <b>143</b>, of the arcuately shaped posterior side <b>145</b> defines an arc of a circle having its center at the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in this illustration and the free end <b>142</b> has a width that is smaller than a width of the opposing end <b>143</b> of the flange. The arc of the circle is one that defines &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>as being any angle with the range of 12 degrees to 15 degrees in increments of whole degrees, half degree, or 0.2 degree increments. The angle of the arc &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>defines the amount of protrusion of the mandible with each degree of mouth opening. The larger this angle &#x3b8;<sub>1</sub>, the greater the protrusion with mouth opening. The larger the angle of mouth opening, the larger the protrusion of the mandible. Furthermore, a strong correlation between mandible movement and Apnea/Hypopnea events has been shown in the literature. Increased respiratory effort (due to OSA) is associated with increased mandibular movements and mouth opening. Data shows 98% (n=33) of open mouthing and large mandibular movement of 99.6% (n=33) were observed in OSA patients (children) who were confirmed to have OSA by polysomnography. &#x201c;Mandibular movements were predominantly a change in position during increased upper airway resistance during the respiratory cycle as exhibited by mandibular lowering and jaw opening&#x201d;. Mandibular Movements Identify Respiratory Effort in Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea (aasm.org). &#x201c;The mandible is the anchor for upper airway muscles that dilate and elongate the pharynx and its position determines mouth opening. In OSA, the mandible lowers to a greater degree than in normal sleep due to activation of the upper airway muscles allowing traction on hyoid bone and mouth opening to facilitate mouth breathing&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The arcuate surface is customizable to provide a curvature that provides the best forward movement of the mandible for the user in relation to the individual user's mouth shape and size. Depending upon the shape and size of the user's mouth and jaws, the radius defining the point of the arc may be offset by moving this point up or down relative to the midpoint <b>147</b>, which may change the widths of the free end <b>142</b> and the opposing end <b>143</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The advantage to the arcuately shaped side <b>145</b> of the protrusive flange <b>114</b>&#x2032; is that it will help protrude the mandible forward as the Temporo-Mandibular joint (TMJ) relaxes and the mouth falls open during sleep, wake or any other transitional state of the human mind (such as various Parasomnia create) thus allowing gradual smooth arcuate incremental forward mandibular movement to occur as concave surface <b>145</b> of protrusive flange <b>114</b>&#x2032; smoothly glides against convex surface <b>136</b> of driver <b>132</b>&#x2032;. The maximum protrusive distance (MPD) for anterior movement of the mandible is in a range of 0 mm to 15mm, more typically 6 mm to 10 mm. Typically, the first 13 degrees of rotation of the mandible about the TMJ during natural, un-aided spontaneous mouth opening does not move the mandible anteriorly, i.e., this rotation does not change or open the airway. Drivers <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> will actively coordinate simultaneous desired amount of vertical and protrusive movements of the mandible (controlled by controller) during this first 13 degrees of mouth opening while the arcuate opposing gliding movements of concave surface <b>145</b> of protrusive flange <b>114</b>&#x2032; smoothly against convex surface <b>136</b> of driver <b>132</b>&#x2032;surfaces will passively create mild forward movement of the mandible and tongue away from the airway, thus increasing the size of the airway. Driver <b>132</b> will ensure constant contact between surfaces <b>145</b> and <b>136</b> while driver <b>130</b> will adjust height of oral cavity through its own cranial movements that translate caudal mandibular advancement, facilitating mouth opening and thus increase oral cavity volume in order to create room for the advancing tongue while simultaneously stiffening the soft palate and Uvula (through the muscles palatoglossus, palatopharyngeus and tensor palatini). This entire process will work in synergy (keeping the person's sleep undisturbed) to increase cross-sectional area of upper airway and increase the cubic volume of the oral cavity which in turn allows <b>150</b>L/R (through the controller) in <b>116</b> to appropriately incrementally protrude the base of tongue forward into the increased oral cavity volume utilizing electric stimulation of the tongue nerves and muscles (details described elsewhere in this document), further increasing the cross-sectional area of the upper airway (the tongue forms the anterior wall of the upper airway).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the natural state, the mandible must rotate beyond this initial 13 degrees, typically through another 7 to 13 degrees to have an effect on the airway size. This natural movement comes at the price of reducing the antero-posterior (AP) diameter of the airway, thus constricting the airway. In an example, where the arcuately shaped side <b>145</b> is based on a 15 degrees jaw rotation (end to end) curvature, i.e., q<sub>1 </sub>and q<sub>2 </sub>are 15 degrees each or they may be any combination of two different angles that add up to 30 degrees. The approximate midpoint <b>147</b> of the arc <b>145</b> is the point at which transition between angle of q<sub>2 </sub>and q<sub>1 </sub>occurs and is approximately the point at which the mandible (mouth) is expected to have opened or rotated to the first 13 degrees (12 to 15 degree range). Total theta at the point of transition 147=180&#x2212;(q<sub>2</sub>+q<sub>2</sub>). Surface <b>136</b> of driver <b>132</b> should align with the lower part of surface <b>145</b> closer to <b>143</b> when the mouth is completely closed (Centric Occlusion CO with a Centric Relation CR between mandibular and maxillary incisor teeth). Angle of q<sub>2 </sub>can be different from angle of q<sub>1</sub>, i.e. the arc may or may not be one fixed radius from TMJ. Each of the q<sub>1 </sub>and q<sub>2 </sub>should remain between the ranges of 12-15 degrees each although both q<sub>1 </sub>or q<sub>2 </sub>or both could be zero degrees each (0-15 degrees each). These angles could exceed 15 degrees each based on individual needs of the user/patient. Total of (q<sub>1</sub>+q<sub>2</sub>) will ordinarily be between 24-30 degrees but could be 0-30 degrees or greater. Theta at point of transition <b>147</b> is (180&#x2212;(q<sub>1</sub>+q<sub>2</sub>))=150 to 180 degrees unless angles of q<sub>1 </sub>and or q<sub>2 </sub>exceeded 15 degrees. A q of 0 degrees will essentially create a straight vertical posterior surface <b>145</b> and would require a similar angle for surface<b>136</b>. An angle of <b>180</b> would produce incremental forward protrusive movement of the mandible throughout the entire range of mandibular rotation (CR/CO to MMO) during mouth opening The congruent relationship of surfaces <b>145</b> and <b>136</b> may create a posterior lean in the vertical axes of both surfaces such that their superior (cranial) edges may be posterior in relationship to their inferior (caudal) edges, thereby facilitating an anterior mandibular advancement as surface <b>145</b> slides down surface <b>136</b> with mouth opening (caudal mandibular advancement).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">q<sub>2 </sub>is primarily useful to control neutral mandibular protrusion during the initial 13 degrees of mandibular rotation (although protrusive flange can protrude the mandible when using MRD with motorized protrusive flange option) but can be adjusted to produce protrusive movement (the more q<sub>2 </sub>is, the less the radius of mandibular incisor to TMJ, the less protrusion of the mandible during early rotation or mouth opening and the less q<sub>2 </sub>is the more protrusion with each degree of mandibular rotation). On the other hand, q<sub>1 </sub>is used to create the majority of the forward mandibular protrusion during the remainder of the mandibular rotation or mouth opening all the way to MMO (Maximum mouth opening). Resistance to mouth opening will also occur during this part of mandibular rotation due to the resistance from stretching the muscles of the TMJ as the mandible incrementally protrudes with every additional degree of mandibular rotation. Increasing q<sub>1 </sub>will cause even more protrusion of mandible and thus also cause incremental resistance to mouth opening created by forward jaw movement. Essentially, if the desired outcome is to keep the mouth closed or barely open (CR/CO position), one could use only q<sub>1 </sub>and remove q<sub>2 </sub>altogether. This would require an arcuate or non-arcuate straight posterior surface <b>145</b> with q<sub>1 </sub>of 0-15 degrees from the vertical axis starting at base <b>143</b> all the way up to <b>142</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> with a corresponding surface <b>136</b> that is straight non-arcuate surface with a corresponding angle <b>90</b>+q<sub>1 </sub>or a corresponding arcuate surface that leans back as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> or combination of arcuate and non-arcuate surfaces such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Under these circumstances, greater the q<sub>1 </sub>greater the protrusion of the mandible with the least amount of mandibular rotation or mouth opening (mm of protrusion for each degree of mandibular rotation) and thus also ensure the highest resistance to mandibular rotation and mouth opening to match the needs of the user/patient. In an example, where the arcuately shaped side <b>145</b> is customized with q<sub>1 </sub>and q<sub>2 </sub>of 15 degrees each as well (total theta=180&#x2212;30=150) for the sake of simplicity of driving home the point, a mandibular rotation or mouth opening of about 20 degrees will protrude the jaw anteriorly about 5 mm and a mandibular rotation of about 24 degrees will protrude the jaw anteriorly about 11 mm. Since the MPD (Maximum Protrusive Distance with range of 6-10 mm) typically has an absolute maximum of 10 mm, 11 mm is nearly impossible for most people and thus the mechanics of the device create the environment where the mouth will not open to MMO (Maximum mouth opening) of 24 degrees. However, as in some individuals, maximum advancement may be up to 15 mm, in those individuals the device would allow the freedom of further advancement.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The releasably attachable features of the flange <b>114</b>&#x2032; accommodates the interchangeability of protrusive flanges <b>114</b> of different shapes and sizes to provide the best fit for the user's mouth.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>-<b>21</b></figref>, some people in need of Continuous Open Airway Technology (COAT) may suffer from dysfunction or abnormalities of the temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ). These individuals may not have evidence of TMJ disease but may have mild restriction of the range of movement of the TMJ and mandibular advancement. As such, milder advancements of the mandible are needed for these individuals when using a mandibular repositioning device (MRD), such as the MRD <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. The MRD <b>800</b> has Dynamic Continuous Open Airway Technology (DCOAT) because the mandible will follow Arc<sub>2 </sub>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> in which as the mandible drops to open the mouth, the mandible will move forward in small increments because of the shape of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> and the driver flange <b>832</b>, thereby opening the airway.

While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> only shows the left side of the MRD <b>800</b>, it is understood that the right side can be the same, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> shows a left side and has a mirror image for the right side. It is also understood that each side (left and right) of the mandibular piece and or the maxillary piece may, in fact, be just partial (2-5 teeth) coverings that may end with the anterior or leading edges <b>817</b> and <b>833</b> of the mandibular and maxillary pieces respectively or may extend further anteriorly to cover more teeth. The number of teeth covered may be different for the right and left side of each of these pieces as well. Thus, there may be up to 4 individual pieces, Two (mandibular and maxillary) for the right and two for the left. This will provide therapeutics for individuals who have a mouth that is too small (micrognathia) to fit an entire bulky device. For most user's the left side and the right side will be mirror images, but if the user has a difference in jaw and/or facial structure making one side different from the other, the device can be custom shaped to accommodate the differences. The protrusive flange <b>814</b> extends cranially from the mandibular piece <b>804</b> which has a teeth covering <b>806</b> for the lower teeth. The driver flange <b>832</b> protrudes laterally outward from the side of the maxillary piece <b>802</b> a distance sufficient to engage the posterior side <b>815</b> of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> with the anterior side <b>833</b> thereof The driver flange <b>832</b> has a base <b>834</b> positioned on the maxillary piece <b>802</b>, i.e., the base of the driver flange does not extend caudally in an overlapping manner with the mandibular piece <b>804</b>in this embodiment. However, in another embodiment it may extend caudally as an extension of <b>835</b> in a way that it will be alongside (buccal side) of the mandibular piece <b>804</b>, thus providing additional caudal anterior surface <b>833</b> for maintaining articulation with the posterior (trailing) surface <b>815</b> of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> during extremes of mouth opening such as yawning or otherwise. The maxillary piece <b>802</b> has a teeth covering <b>807</b> for the upper teeth. The protrusive flange <b>814</b> and the driver flange <b>832</b> are not shown in these embodiments to have the housings with the motor and mechanism for moving the flanges to provide the movements described herein for the other embodiment, but they are equally usable with such mechanisms and all the systems described herein.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">The concave-to-convex curvature of the posterior side <b>815</b> of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> has a concave portion <b>850</b> most proximate the base of the protrusive flange. Cranially above the concave portion <b>850</b> is the convex section <b>852</b>. The shape and positions of the concave and convex portions <b>850</b>, <b>852</b> is described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. The mathematical model in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, was created using a scale of 1 cm=10 mm. Here, the dental horizontal axis (A<sub>H</sub>) is represented by segment BC and runs horizontally between the mandibular teeth (crowns of the teeth) along the plane and the maxillary teeth (crowns) above the plane. Thus, the mandibular coverings part of the MRD lies below the horizontal axis while the maxillary coverings part lies above the horizontal axis. A vertical axis (A<sub>v</sub>) is drawn perpendicular to the dental horizontal axis at a position passing between the protrusive flange <b>814</b> and the driver flange <b>832</b> in the at rest position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. The rest position is a position of the mandible at which there is no stress on the TMJ. This axis passes between the mating point V<sub>2 </sub>of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> and the point P<sub>2 </sub>of the driver flange <b>832</b>. Point A represents the TMJ at rest and an axis parallel to the vertical axis (A<sub>v</sub>) is drawn through point A, called the TMJ axis (A<sub>TMJ</sub>). Point B is the point where the horizontal axis and the angle of the mandible intersect. The angle ABC created thus represents an angle adjacent to the angle of the ramus of the mandible. It is typically 40 degrees since the angle of the ramus of the mandible is 140 degrees on average. However, significant age, race and gender variations exist. We have assumed an angle of the ramus to be 100 degrees and the adjacent angle to be 80 degrees for sake of simplicity. The more obtuse the angle of the ramus, the more obtuse the tangent T and the greater the lean in the surface <b>835</b> of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> and surface <b>833</b> of the driver flange <b>832</b>. Point C is the point where the TMJH vertical axis and the horizontal axis intersect. Point D is a mid-point of the length of the segment AC. Point E is a point along the TMJ axis that is at <b>2</b>/<b>3</b> of the height (H<sub>DF</sub>) of the driver flange <b>832</b>. Point F is the mirror of point D along the TMJ axis and Point G is the mirror of point A along the TMJ axis, i.e., a negative value equal to point D and Point A, respectively, below the horizontal dental axis. Point El is the mirror of point E on a vertical axis parallel to the TMJ axis but positioned at the front of the incisors (A<sub>I</sub>). Average dimensions were used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, and it is therefore understood that these dimensions may vary from individual to individual based on natural variations of body size, jaw size, head size and variations created by abnormalities of the human body as well.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">The primary concept is to use a tangent (T) that is parallel to the lean of the Ramus of the mandible (represented by line segment AB) in relationship to the horizontal axis (A<sub>H</sub>) that passes between the protrusive flange <b>814</b> and the driver flange <b>832</b> in the at rest position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. This creates an angle within the range of 10&#xb0; to 50&#xb0; with the vertical axis (A<sub>v</sub>) on the maxillary side of the horizontal axis (A<sub>H</sub>), which we call q<sub>1</sub>.

This is referred to as point V<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2 </sub>and is a point where three tangents meet to create the tangent (T). These are designed to meet at the same point although they do not always have to, especially, if a design for any individual requires a variance from this concept.

To maintain contact between the mandibular piece <b>904</b> and maxillary piece <b>802</b> (prevent disengagement) during anterior-posterior repositioning and cranial-caudal repositioning, especially when both types of repositioning occur simultaneously, a plateau <b>870</b> of a preselected height (H<sub>P</sub>) has been added to the mandibular repositioning devices of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>-<b>29</b></figref> between the base <b>816</b> of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> and the floor <b>872</b> of the tooth covering <b>806</b> of the mandibular piece. The preselected height (H<sub>P</sub>) of the plateau <b>870</b> prevents disconnect between each protrusive flange <b>814</b> and its respective driver flange <b>832</b> relative to a fully open mouth measurement between incisors of the user by having a height that compensates for the difference between the fully open mount measurement and the height of the protrusive flange (H<sub>PF</sub>).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>-<b>29</b></figref>, the preselected height (H<sub>P</sub>) for these examples was selected to be 1.06 mm because the user was capable of opening their mount 20.06 mm and the flange height (H<sub>PF</sub>) was 19 mm. The flange height is typically less than 20 mm and is often in the range of 17 mm to 19 mm for the average adult. In another example, if a user has a fully open mouth measurement of 36 mm and the protrusive flange height is 19 mm, the preselected height for the plateau is 17 mm. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b></figref>, the plateau <b>870</b> extends across the full width of the tooth covering <b>806</b> and has a length (L) equivalent to the length of the base of the protrusive flange <b>814</b>. Here, the plateau <b>870</b> has a uniform preselected height (H<sub>P</sub>) along the length (L) thereof</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, the plateau <b>870</b>&#x2032; is wedge-shaped, thereby having a first height (H<sub>1</sub>) at an anterior base <b>817</b> of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> that is greater than a second height (H<sub>2</sub>) at the posterior base <b>816</b> of the protrusive flange. The plateau <b>870</b>&#x2032;causes the concave-convex curvature of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> to be inclined relative to the mandibular piece <b>804</b>, thus the driver flange <b>832</b> is also inclined equivalently to the plateau <b>870</b>&#x2032; to maintain the engaged convex to convex mating curvature thereof This creates a gap <b>872</b> between the driver flange <b>832</b> and the mandibular piece <b>804</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b> and <b>29</b></figref> are examples of different embodiments for filling this gap with either an extension of the plateau <b>870</b>&#x2032;or of the driver flange <b>832</b>, respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, the plateau <b>870</b>&#x2032; has an extension <b>874</b> that extends posteriorly to a posterior terminus surface <b>876</b> of the tooth covering <b>806</b> of the mandibular piece <b>804</b>. The extension <b>874</b> continues the wedge shape of the plateau <b>870</b>&#x2032; and terminates with a third height (H<sub>3</sub>) that is less than the first height (H<sub>1</sub>) and the second height (H<sub>2</sub>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, the plateau terminates posteriorly at the posterior base <b>816</b> of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> and the driver flange <b>832</b> has an extension <b>878</b> that extends caudally with its anterior side extending the convex curvature thereof past the posterior base <b>816</b> of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> into a gap <b>872</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>). The driver flange <b>832</b> has a base that is seated on the mandibular piece <b>804</b> as a result of the presence of the extension <b>878</b>. The extension <b>874</b> and <b>878</b> provide the benefit of added space for the housing in which the electrical components, motors, power sources, etc. that are described herein are enclosed. In another embodiment, extension <b>878</b> may extend caudally adjacent to the mandibular piece only thus allowing an extension for continued articulation between surfaces <b>833</b> and <b>815</b> with extremes of mouth opening.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, the plateau provides significant benefits to the combined effect of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> and the driver flange <b>832</b> (anterior-posterior repositioning and cranial-caudal repositioning). For example, looking at columns <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, if a user actively opens their mouth 8.28 mm (5 degrees) in the absences of a plateau, the AVMLRD-aided anterior movement of the mandible is 6.25 mm for the average adult. With any of the mandibular repositioning devices of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>-<b>29</b></figref>, which have a protrusive flange height of 19 mm and a plateau of 1.06 mm, and an anterior movement selected to be 5 mm at the rest position based on the curvature profiles of the protrusive flange and the driver flange, the same amount of anterior movement is achieved by opening the user's mouth just 1 degree. The anterior movement for the at rest position is typically set to be in the range of 1 mm to 6 mm (see the header of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref> at the far left). Without the plateau, the mandibular repositioning device has a limited range for the cranial-caudal repositioning as determined by the height of the protrusive flange, in other words, the addition of a plateau extends this range.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, it has been determined that a combined effect within the 1 mm to 6 mm anterior movement at the rest position of: (i) Area <b>0</b>: 2.25 mm to 7.4 mm is useful for treating primary snoring disorder and mild OSA; (ii) Area <b>1</b> and Area <b>2</b>: 7.5 mm to 10.9 mm is useful to treat mild, moderate, and severe OSA with lowest saturation range of 81% to 90%; (ii) Area <b>3</b>: 11 mm to 13.9 mm is useful to treat moderate and severe OSA with lowest saturation range of 79% to 81%; (iv) Area <b>4</b>: 14 mm to 17.9 mm is useful to treat severe OSA with lowest saturation range of 76% to 79%; and (v) Area <b>5</b>: 18 mm to 28 mm is useful to treat severe OSA with lowest saturation ranges below 76%. Further, the most useful is Area <b>1</b>: a 5 mm to 6 mm anterior advancement in the rest position (central occlusion or centric relationship) with a 2 to 3 mm degree mouth opening by the user will treat mild to moderate OSA.

The maxillary piece <b>802</b>&#x2032; has a slot <b>902</b> buccally juxtaposed to a respective one of each of the left and right backmost teeth mold thereof. The orientation of the sliding attachment of each of the protrusive flange and the driver flange prevents the protrusive flange from sliding out of the mandibular pieces when the posterior side of the protrusive flange moves along the convex curvature of the driver flange as the user opens their mouth and likewise pushes the driver flange into the slot of the maxillary piece as well.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">One of the benefits of the removability of the protrusive flange and/or the driver flange is the ability to offer a kit having one or both of the maxillary piece and the mandibular piece having a removable flange and a plurality of said flanges to accomplish different amounts of anterior-posterior repositioning and cranial-caudal repositioning. In one embodiment, the kit has both a maxillary piece and a mandibular piece that have removably replaceable flanges, driver and protrusive flanges, respectively and a plurality of each flange in sets of protrusive and driver flanges to achieve different amounts of anterior-posterior repositioning and cranial-caudal repositioning.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0097">In one embodiment, a plurality of left and right protrusive flange pairs are provided with the kit and at least one of the plurality of left and right protrusive flange pairs has a plateau of a preselected height between a base of each protrusive flange and a keyed slider extending caudally from the protrusive flange. The preselected height of the plateau prevents disconnect between each protrusive flange and its respective driver flange relative to a fully open mouth measurement between incisors of the user. Each protrusive flange engagingly saddles either a left backmost teeth mold or a right backmost teeth mold of the mandibular piece as part of its respective keyways described above against cranial movement.

The plurality of left and right driver flange pairs differ in width, convex curvature of the anterior side, posterior lean, and combinations thereof to provide differing effects to the user. The width (W), labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>, is measured at the apex of the convex curvature and is typically in a range of 5 mm to 11 mm (thereby allowing at least 1 mm width at the superior end of the flange). When this is 5 mm, the mandibular piece will be in CO/CR position i.e., 0 mm advanced position. When this is 11 mm, the mandibular piece is advanced by 6 mm. The 5mm to 11 mm thickness also leaves sufficient width in the slot <b>902</b> of the maxillary piece for the post <b>900</b> to slide securely therein. The width is tailorable to provide a preselected amount of anterior advancement of the mandible of the user while in the at rest position.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0099">Differing posterior lean is shown in comparing the shape of the anterior side <b>833</b> of the driver flange <b>832</b>&#x2032;, <b>832</b>&#x2033;, <b>832</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>35</b>, <b>37</b>, and <b>38</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref> has an anterior side <b>833</b> with the most posterior lean. Here, the superior width (W<sub>S2</sub>) is much smaller than the inferior width (W<sub>12</sub>) of the driver flange <b>833</b>, thereby tilting the convex curvature of the anterior side <b>833</b> posteriorly as you move from the inferior base <b>910</b> to the superior cranial point <b>912</b> thereof. In contrast, the driver flange of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref> has the smallest (least) posterior lean. Here, the difference between the inferior width (W<sub>11</sub>) and the superior width (W<sub>S1</sub>) is the smallest. The convex curvature can be increased, decrease, or adjusted with a preselected amount of posterior lean. Such changes to the convex curvature are selected to enable the mandible of the user to advance incrementally more with mouth opening. Less superior lean advances the mandible in the anterior direction less with each degree of mouth opening. In contrast, more superior lean advances the mandible in the anterior direction more with each degree of mouth opening. For example, the posterior lean in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref> may provide only a 1 mm anterior advancement with each degree of mouth opening, and the posterior lean in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref> may provide a 3 mm anterior advancement with each degree of mouth opening.

The maxillary piece <b>804</b>, on its buccal aspect, has a housing <b>1008</b> at each of the left and right molar portion, which each enclose, in a fluid-tight manner, a power source <b>1020</b> electrically connected to a piezo motor <b>1022</b> and to an encoder <b>1023</b> that controls the movement of a rod <b>1025</b> operatively connected to the piezo motor <b>1022</b> and to the driver flange <b>832</b>. The power source <b>1020</b> is also electrically connected to a circuit board (microprocessor) <b>1024</b> that is in operative communication with the encoder and any of the sensor, stimulators, drug dispensers, etc. disclosed herein that are included in the maxillary piece. The rod <b>1025</b> encloses a set of robotic arms that move synchronously or opposite to each other (gliding together or sliding away from each other) driven mechanically, electrically, or electromagnetically by the piezo motor or electric and magnetic fields (EMF) generating coil that provides magnetic forces or mechanical forces to glide or slide the rod/arms. These are electric and magnetic fields (EMF) generated within using an EMF powered synchromesh and induction motor. Synchronous motors have an advantage of constant speed, steady load and operate with low voltage current or micro-voltage current. Absence of gearing gives them a smooth and quiet functionality that will be beneficial for this application. Induction motors have sustained torque and variable speed. Synchronous motors have pull up torque. Combination of these two facilitates movements starting after long periods of quiescence, continuous push-pull movements, and reversal of motor rotation. This creates the ideal combination that provides anterior and posterior, push-pull movements of the driver flange <b>832</b>. A first arm drives the driver flange <b>832</b> anteriorly and posteriorly. A second arm drives the lean of the anterior surface of the driver flange. The distal end <b>1027</b> of the rod <b>1025</b> houses the two arm terminations into ball-socket terminals or other hinged terminals in the housing within driver flange <b>832</b>. When both, maxillary and mandibular pieces are in place and a bite or clench is carried out or the flanges come in contact with each other or any form of trigger that will provide sensory activation of the device, such as activation through a handheld device, controller station or simply inserting all the relevant pieces into the mouth. Then the piezo motor activates (this provides the system with a signal that the device is installed in the oral cavity for use) and all components including the AVMLRD, handheld device, controller station, cloud-based repository of memory are activated. The system goes through a formal boot process and checks all components are functioning normally and live to go. The user gets a communication and then confirms active status of the system and finalizes activation. In the event that the user is incapacitated, next-of-kin followed by physician or EMS are notified in real time. It then moves the driver flange anteriorly using the first arm to bring the protrusive flange <b>814</b> to the prescribed position such as a Centric Occlusion or 1 mm to 6 mm advancement. In doing so, it clears room between the housing <b>1008</b> and the driver flange <b>832</b> that allows the second arm to perform prescribed posterior lean of driver flange <b>832</b>. Both, the first arm and the second arm are actively moving back and forth (+ and &#x2212; movements in their respective axes) during active operation and all movements are actively powered. The lean function allows the anterior leading edge of the driver flange <b>832</b> to maintain the prescribed lean and adjust the lean dynamically during use on an as needed basis.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">The piezo motor <b>1022</b> in each housing <b>1008</b> is configured for three specific functions of the rod and the two arms within the rod. Cranial to caudal adjustments of the rod <b>1025</b> (i.e., first and second arms) through rotation around a central axis, anterior-posterior gliding of the rod (performed by first arm) and preferential sliding of the second arm perform the lean function. Alternately, the cranial to caudal adjustments is performed through movement of the entire piezo motor within the housing <b>1022</b> using a robotic armature, which is accomplished by the wheels <b>1029</b> positioned above the rod <b>1025</b>. Caudal movement of the driver flange <b>832</b> enables the drive flange <b>832</b> to accompany the caudal movement of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> as the user opens their mouth and the reverse when closing their mouth. Alternately, driver flange <b>832</b> actively pushes the mandibular piece <b>804</b> caudally as the first arm anteriorly advances and the second arm leans posteriorly creating a positive pressure at the caudal anterior leading edge of the driver flange <b>832</b>, nudging the trailing edge of the protrusive flange <b>814</b> and its caudal root to move caudally; thus, actively opening the user's mouth. This keeps the two flanges <b>814</b>, <b>832</b> in constant contact with one another, thereby reducing the likelihood or possibility of changes of a disconnect therebetween. The anterior-posterior movement and cranial-caudal movement directed by the piezo motor can occur simultaneously, individually, and/or sequentially.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">The circuit board <b>1024</b> has a microprocessor comprising a quantum microchiplet and/or a photonic integrated circuit and nontransitory memory. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref> shows the left housing <b>1008</b> with circuity board <b>1024</b>, the right housing will likewise include the circuit board and other components. The left and right circuit boards may have symmetric functions or shared functionality, communicating with each other continuously, and external controller, and/or other smart devices or through a two-way transmitter housed inside the protrusive flange <b>814</b>. The microprocessor has stored in the nontransitory memory a first algorithm controlling the cranial-caudal movement of the piezo-electric motor relative to data receivable from one or more sensors. The sensors are typically in the oral cavity but are not limited thereto. The sensors can measure airway cross-sectional area, airflow volume, airflow velocity and pressure, airflow resistance, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, electrical activity of the heart, oxygen level, heart rate, and combinations thereof. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure and electrical activity of the heart may be measured by capacitive micro-machined ultrasound. Position sensors can be included that measure a first distance for cranial-caudal movement and a second distance for anterior-posterior movement of the driver flange.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">The microprocessor has stored therein a second algorithm for anterior-posterior movement and lean functionality as described above. In one embodiment, the anterior-posterior movement is corelated to movement desirable when the user is under the influence of medication, sedation, anesthesia, or alcohol.The microprocessor has artificial intelligence to learn from the collected data form the sensors when to make anterior-posterior and/or cranial-caudal adjustments to the driver flange and can do so before a measured parameter moves out of a set range of values so as to maintain those values as close to the mean as possible and within a certain set of 1 to 6 standard deviations from the mean. In one embodiment, increasing airflow resistance, decreasing airflow volume, and decreasing cross-sectional area of the airway (SMCA) will immediately trigger the prescribed caudal and anterior movements through the first arm and required lean through the second arm thus moving the mandible and the tongue anteriorly and caudally at an incremental level desired with continuous feedback through the sensors. As airflow resistance drops, airflow volume increases and SMCA begins to increase, reverse movements of the first and second arms would result in raising the mandible cranially and simultaneously or sequentially retracting the mandible posteriorly.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, another embodiment having anterior-posterior movement and the cranial-caudal movement of the mandibular repositioning device integrated into the maxillary piece <b>802</b> for control of the driver flange <b>832</b> is shown.

As discussed repeatedly herein, the anterior to posterior movement provides anterior mandibular and lingual advancement and the vertical and angular advancements provide caudal displacement of the mandible and tongue as well. In one embodiment, the microprocessor is a quantum microchip or a photonic integrated circuit, has non-transitory member, a renewable or rechargeable power source, a means to charge the power source, means for the microprocessors in each housing (right and left sides) to communicate with one another and/or external devices including those disclosed herein. Continuous machine learning will provide internal biofeedback and commands integrated with external resources. These embodiments for the protrusive flange are compatible with all other embodiments disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0115">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, at least one stimulator <b>116</b>, but preferably both stimulators <b>116</b>, include a first sensor <b>150</b>L/R and/or a second sensor <b>152</b>L/R, but preferably both sensors. <b>150</b>L and <b>152</b>L stands for the left side of the user and <b>150</b>R and <b>152</b> R stands for the right side of the user. The sensors <b>150</b>L/R and <b>152</b>L/R may be selected from a variety of sensors to create which every combination is the most likely to be useful in diagnosing or treating the user. The sensors are selected form the group consisting of a pulse oximetry sensor, a vibration sensor, an airflow sensor, a pH sensor, a combination pulse oximetry/vibration and airflow sensor, an EKG sensor, EEG sensor, EMG sensor, EOG sensor, lactic acid sensor, a pulse transit time (PTT) sensor, an ultrasound sensor (echocardiography), an electro-oculogram sensor, a temperature sensor, a body position or jaw position sensor (such as a potentiometer), an electromyogram sensor, a pressure measurement sensor, a hygrometer sensor, a microphone or sound recording sensor, video recording, and hygroscopic/hydration sensor. In one embodiment the first sensor is a combination pulse oximetry/vibration and airflow sensor and the second sensor is a pH sensor. In another embodiment, the first sensor is a pulse oximetry sensor, and the second sensor is a vibration and airflow sensor. Any number of combinations of the sensors listed above is possible and can best be selected by a medical professional based on data relative to the pre-selected end user. Sensors in the left side and right side could be symmetric or complimentary or asymmetric. For example, CMUT/IVUS sensor may have better signal delivery and reception of carotid blood flow when placed on the left side and not as good a reading from the right side. Thus, it is placed only on the left side. The EKG sensor may have better reading from the right side than from the left side and thus is placed on the right side. Together, the EKG sensor and ultrasound sensor create complete cardiovascular hemodynamic data.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0116">The stimulator <b>116</b> may also be accompanied by a sensor or sensors that can record EEG (electro-encephalogram), EOG (electro-oculogram), electromyogram (EMG) for the tongue muscles and NC (Nerve conduction) data from the nerves of the tongue, pharynx and muscles of mastication (jaw muscles) and phonation (speech). These sensors may transmit these data to the controller <b>200</b> (described in more detail below) through variety of industry standard wireless protocols that are currently in use for wireless EMG, NC and EEG recordings in other skin surface applications in neurology and sleep laboratories. Data from such sensors will be useful for detection of various medical diseases as it will be computed in time-synchronized manner by the controller <b>200</b> and cloud based servers in system <b>300</b> described in more detail below and will help to determine cause-effect of many medical diseases. The sensors will also provide feedback to controller <b>200</b> to gauge effectiveness of electric stimulation of the tongue or forward movement of the tongue and mandible and thus allowing the controller to make fine adjustments to all components of the system.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0117">The length L of each stimulator <b>116</b> will be pre-selected to fit the user's mouth and tongue, in particular for adequate contact with the base of the tongue (genioglossus muscle) during sleep or while awake performing certain activities. Each stimulator <b>116</b> has a single or dual electrode <b>154</b> connected to the power source <b>120</b> and generates an electrical impulse that travels through the electrode to one or more of the lingual muscles of the tongue identified above, which contracts the lingual muscle(s) to create a forward movement of the tongue. The forward movement of the tongue increases the cross-sectional open airway diameter in transvers, vertical and antero-posterior dimensions, thus increasing the aggregate volume of open airway and exponentially reducing air-flow resistance. The power source for the single or dual electrode can be a direct current (DC) power source or may employ any other technology such as electro-magnetic energy, photon energy among other forms of energy. The electrical impulses' power source will be in volts or microvolts and the current, likely in milli-Amps (usually 2-6 mA), will be pre-selected on a per patient basis. The power, current, and capacity will typically be within a range suitable for effective performance of mated hardware and safe for use with cardiac pacemakers, defibrillators, deep brain stimulators, or spinal cord stimulators.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0118">The forward movement of the mandible (protrusion) is performed by lateral pterygoids, medial pterygoids and masseter muscles. These are stimulated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. The neuronal firing rate drops during sleep relaxing these muscles causing the jaw to fall back (retrusion) and thus allowing the tongue to fall back (retro-glossal movement) into the airway as well creating a narrow airway which is the cause of obstructive sleep apnea, oxygen desaturation, elevated blood-pressure, cardiac arrhythmia, disruption in sleep and nocturnal acid reflux. The transverse stimulator <b>116</b> can specifically target these muscle groups and their distributing nerve and stimulate and sense electrical activity of these various muscles individually or together inside the oral cavity.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0119">Also, the stimulators <b>116</b> can stimulate selected muscles to improve their strength. This can be a training or a retraining exercise, for example, after a stroke (swallowing difficulty or speech difficulty) or for children with speech pathologies. If sensors are present in the stimulators <b>116</b>, the sensors can provide data to the controller station <b>200</b> and the system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> to determine which muscle and/or muscle group needs attention. Thus, the shape of exterior surface/housing of the stimulators <b>116</b> are shaped and sized to direct each and every sensor, stimulator or combination thereof to the appropriate location inside the oral cavity.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0120">The pulse oximetry sensor <b>150</b> is positioned in one or both stimulators <b>116</b> at a position enabling direct contact with the base of the tongue from which data will be collected. The position of the pulse oximetry sensor <b>150</b> is generally antero-superiorly positioned for measuring pulse-oximetry through the blood-flow of the tongue. The vibration and airflow sensor <b>152</b> is positioned in one or both stimulators <b>116</b> at a position suitable for airflow measurements, which can indicate when there is a restriction of airflow, and vibration measurements (sub-sonic and sonic) that are an indication of inaudible and audible snores. The vibration and airflow sensor <b>152</b> faces posteriorly to measure snores and airflow resistance/pressure from the airway.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0121">The power source <b>120</b>, <b>121</b> in all embodiments may be a rechargeable battery.

Furthermore, since the housings <b>108</b>&#x2032;are removable attachable to the teeth covering <b>160</b>, the housings <b>108</b>&#x2032;can be switched for housings having different sensors in a sequence of nights to assess various parameters of the user or during the day or both night and day. The mandibular or maxillary housings or teeth coverings, when used alone (mandibular or maxillary) should allow most speech functions and thus can be used during the course of a normal day. The data interfaces with standard Bluetooth functionality or WIFI functionality and the controller station may be used as a mobile unit with Bluetooth and WIFI functionality and as such may be carried to work or elsewhere since it has its own rechargeable battery operations. Controller station will be interfaced with proprietary or open platform program that can be securely loaded on variety of computer systems and hand-held smart devices.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0135">In another embodiment, the first sensor <b>150</b> in a first of the housings <b>108</b>&#x2032; is a pulse oxygen sensor continually measuring oxygen data at the base of the tongue and the second sensor <b>152</b> is a vibration/air flow sensor measuring snoring, turbulent flow, and vibrations from inside the user's mouth; the second of the housings <b>108</b>&#x2032;has a pH sensor as the first sensor and includes the stimulator <b>154</b>. Here, diagnostic and treatment functions are possible that are coordinated by the system <b>300</b> or any of its components such as controller or PC or smart device. The sensors <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> provide data to the microprocessor <b>159</b>. The circuit board <b>124</b> within the housing <b>108</b>&#x2032; is in operative connection to the power source to be powered and to control activation of the stimulator electrode <b>154</b> in response to data received by the circuit board <b>124</b>, more particularly, the microprocessor <b>159</b>, from the first sensor <b>150</b> and/or the second sensor <b>152</b> and/or from instructions from the controller station <b>200</b> and /or the cloud server as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> (described in more detail below) to effect a treatment. For example, if the pH sensor senses an increasing acid condition as the user sleeps and the other sensors measure airflow resistance or decreased airflow, then the stimulator will be activated to open the airway and the system will then determine if the pH decreases. Such a causal relationship may help reduce/prevent significant nocturnal acid reflux and thus minimize or eliminate the use of acid reflux medications. Moreover, the combination of sensors can be selected to determine time synchronization of the pH to other physiological occurrences of the user, such as body position, inspiration, expiration, sleep measurements, oxygenation, bruxism, snoring, apnea, etc. Ideally, a link between acid reflux and other physiological occurrences can be determined and then used for treatment.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0136">Moreover, using the controller station <b>200</b> and cloud server of the system <b>300</b>, it will be possible to receive data regarding the user's input of food and time consumed to act proactively during sleep based on a correlation of digestion time and acid reflux onset. This capability may be extended to input of any and all medications, physiological data such as BP, EKG and blood sugar, and to administering of any and all medications during the day (prompted to the user through handheld device) or night (automatically performed if pressure pellet for medication is available to the system to discharge sub-lingually or intra-orally in liquid form or inhaled as micro-aerosol powder form.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0137">The teeth covering <b>160</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> can be as simple as a plastic boil and bite mandibular device onto which the housings <b>108</b>&#x2032; are removably attachable.

The system may include a camera for video recording through the controller station <b>200</b> to evidence any nocturnal seizures, sleep-walking, other movement or violent disorders during sleep.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0162">In operation, data from the sensors on the MLRD <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, such as oxygen measurements and pulse data, is sent to the controller station <b>200</b> to be processed by the microprocessor to determine how much movement of the protrusive flange by activation of the second driver is needed, how much movement of the first driver is needed to separate the jaws of the user, and if and when to stimulate the transverse lingual muscle of the tongue to move the tongue forward. After some breaths, the controller station <b>200</b> may determine to stimulate the tongue and activate the second driver to move the mandibular piece, and hence the jaw of the user, forward (anterior) or backward (posterior) direction. In other instances, the controller station <b>200</b> may determine to stimulate the tongue and activate both the first driver and the second driver to separate the jaws and move the mandibular piece forward in order to adequately open the airway of the user.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0163">The system <b>300</b> also creates three-dimensional images and videos of breathing, cardiac function, carotid blood flow data, eye-movements, jaw movements and brain EEG recordings for identification of medical conditions and interventions that may be useful to correct or treat those medical conditions.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0164">A unique advantage of this system over any other existing systems is that the jaw and tongue can move synchronously, independently, or sequentially during sleep or during wake-related activities, in real-time and in anticipation of impending airway closure or changes in physiology, and in a provision of a measured response to those changes such as relief from restriction of airflow as determined by the controller station <b>200</b> even before the airway has completely closed; thus, restoring unrestricted airflow even before the patient has completely stopped breathing (as in sleep apnea). This system can see airway obstruction before it happens and will keep the airway constantly open in any body position or depth of sleep. This is a distinct advantage over CPAP/BIPAP or any other mechanical or electrical system that is commercially available in the market. In addition, there are distinct advantages just by the breadth of functionality that has been described above.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0165">The controller station <b>200</b> includes learning algorithms in the memory of the microprocessor that learns a user's sleep patterns and other physiological events and functions during sleep and wake, pathological events and activities during wake and sleep from the data collected over time and creates a &#x201c;best response&#x201d; for the simultaneous, independent, or sequential responses exemplified by tensing of the soft palate or Uvula, release of medication or stimulation of the stimulator and activation of the first and second drivers to open the airway or to train muscles of speech, and to synchronize these best responses such as exemplified by certain jaw movements that are associated with particular phases of respiration. The activation of the first and second drivers <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> not only includes advancements, but also retractions of the first and second drivers <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> to relax the jaws in between necessary advancements to open the airway to avoid potential TMJ problems. Any discussions herein directed to the mandibular component, with respect to the controller station <b>200</b> and the system <b>300</b>, are equally applicable to the maxillary component.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0166">The controller station <b>200</b>, in the memory of the microprocessor, may include a pre-programmed range for the movements of the first and second drivers <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> based on sleep study data for the user conducted by an authorized healthcare provider. The pre-programmed range can be used by the controller station <b>200</b> in a stand-alone or auto servo mode. The pre-programmed range may be determined by simple or multiple linear regression models that employ data from inputs and from previous experiences, which the controller station <b>200</b> will be able to forecast ranges for the amount and direction of movements of the drivers <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> and the amount or timing of energy discharge through the transverse stimulator(s). The controller station <b>200</b>, in the memory of the microprocessor, may include data from tests previously performed on the user and/or the output of algorithms to set the MLRD <b>100</b>, <b>101</b> each day for use just prior to sleep.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0167">The controller station <b>200</b> can operate based on a standalone function or a servo function. In the standalone function, the controller station <b>200</b> operates the MLDR <b>100</b>, <b>101</b> based on set parameters for the movement of the drivers, such as repetitive equal advancement and retraction of the mandible that are not based on active feedback. For example, a set 2 mm movement anteriorly of the mandible during each breath and a 2 mm posterior movement of the mandible after each breath, with a fixed amount of energy discharge to the electrode of the stimulator. The set parameters for the standalone function may be based on data collected from the specific user or may be based on a peer group of like sleep attributes.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0168">In the servo function, the controller station <b>200</b> interactively controls the MLRD <b>100</b>, <b>101</b> during sleep or wake, at home or elsewhere, based on the data collected from the sensors on-board the MLRD in a feedback loop and based on data available from the server. During operation, the continual feedback loop allows incrementally accurate interventions followed by listening to observational inputs exemplified by airflow measurements, video recordings, pulse-oximetry, doppler flow in carotids or advancement of mandible and followed by more interventions exemplified by protrusive or vertical adjustments based on real-time data even after a previous advancement or incremental increase in energy to stimulate the tongue. The changes to the advancement or application of energy to the stimulator will be capable of producing positive and negative changes regarding movement of the mandible and tongue. For example, the energy applied to the stimulator may be reduced relative to the prior application of energy discharge if the previous discharge of energy caused teeth grinding or cough. In another example, the protrusive movement of the jaw may be reversed if the previous protrusion advancement caused a deleterious change in any of the monitored physiological parameters. In another example training of muscles of swallowing would be altered upon observing retrograde movement of food or appearance of cough or gag.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0169">Also, in the servo function, data from all sources, server, MLRD, and any other sensors attached to the user that are communicating with the controller station <b>200</b>, are continuously processed through algorithms that are stored in the memory of the controller or stored in the server. Examples of other sensors includes, but is not limited to, wireless pulse-transit time sensors, and wireless EKG sensor. These two additional sensors would be utilized in addition to the MLRD to diagnose and treat sleep-induced hypertension and/or cardiac arrhythmia such as lack of oxygen to the heart, especially by collecting time synchronized data from the EKG sensor and the pulse oximeter sensor. For example, the server may include data related to sleep attributes and alcohol consumption to make adjustments for the user during sleep after drinking alcohol. For example, it may require a change in current applied to the stimulators <b>116</b> after alcohol consumption to effectively stimulate the lingual muscles. The same may be true of a user taking certain medications, especially those that depress brain function. As another example, the server may include data on myriad patients correlating sleep attributes to weight loss. As such, if the user loses 5 or 10 pounds, data from the server can be considered in the algorithm determining how much movement of the jaws is needed and/or whether to stimulate the tongue.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0170">The system <b>300</b> may be used to treat many medical diseases, including but not limited to any type of sleep apnea, bruxism, sleep related GERD, sleep-induced hypertension, snoring, etc.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0171">The system <b>300</b> may be used to diagnose any possible medical conditions related to sleep or while awake, including sleep apnea or other sleep disorders including sleep-induced hypertension, sleep-related cardiac arrhythmia, sleep related seizures, RLS and periodic limb movement disorders and other medical diseases, even those unrelated to sleep. Here, the MLRD <b>100</b> or <b>101</b> is placed in the user's mouth during a sleep period, such as at night, with the controller station <b>200</b> in a &#x201c;test mode&#x201d; in which the on-board sensors measure and monitor the user's physiological parameters mentioned above. The test mode is used for multiple sleep periods of over two to 30 days, based on a time period set by a medical professional. For example, the user may have the controller station in &#x201c;test mode&#x201d; for seven days. Then, the seven days of data is reviewed by the medical professional to determine whether the user has sleep apnea or any other sleep disorder, and if so, determines the parameters for the standalone mode, which are then stored in the controller station <b>200</b>. The same system may be used even during the day and outside of the home of the user such as at place of work.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0172">The system <b>300</b> may have a therapeutic mode, which implements the servo function. Here, the feedback loop is on for data from the on-board sensors, which is processed through an algorithm to determine the least amount of anterior and caudal movement to maintain an open airway and the least amount of energy discharge to stimulate the tongue and maintain an open airway and the order in which to take such actions, i.e., simultaneously, sequentially, or individually.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0173">The device and system disclosed herein have numerous advantages, including artificial intelligence utilizing data collected by the MLRD during use to actively in real-time adjust the MLRD in response to the phases of respiration, degree of obstruction of the airway, snore sounds and vibrations and amount of hypoxemia present relative to each breath irrespective of the stage of sleep of the user. The system is capable of measuring a large number of cardiac, neurological and endocrine sensory inputs as described above exemplified by continuous non-invasive glucose, oxygen, blood pressure, pH monitoring, heart rhythm and temperature etc. The system is capable of photography for creating dental impressions, dentures or to diagnose gum disease etc. The system is capable of executing a large spectrum of functions such as mandible protrusion, administering sub-lingual insomnia medication like Intermezzio or cardiac medication like nitroglycerine or training muscle groups for swallowing or speech. The system is capable of communicating with user, provider, EHR (Electronic Health Record) and pharmacy etc. This system is capable of determining restriction to airflow, increase in velocity of air and turbulence, decreasing levels of oxygen and increasing levels of heart rate, pH monitoring and any other physiological parameter that could be installed in the future with constant inputs of physiological parameters (unlike with CPAP machine or oral appliances that are available in the industry), such as those mentioned above. This 24 hour a day seven days a week capability of collection and processing of data allows the system to actually make adjustments exemplified by the movement of the mandible and tongue prior to closure of the airway and hence will work as a preventative form of treatment for sleep apnea.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0174">Age and gender specific physiology of the airway and the mouth during sleep are known to affect sleep and cause sleep disorders. The system <b>300</b> and <b>310</b> will collect data that will enable the development of algorithms that are age and gender specific, which can improve treatment outcomes for future users. System <b>300</b> and <b>310</b> has ability to create database of all physiological and pathological events measured in real-time and time synchronized with each other in its users and develop algorithms for normal and abnormal manifestations of disease states during wake and sleep and develop new cause-and-effect understanding of these events that have never been observed before. Recording and correlation of these phenomenon with sensors, especially during sleep would help understand conditions such as &#x2018;wake-up strokes&#x2019; (occur during sleep) that account for 14% of all strokes and diagnose conditions like obstructive sleep apnea that occurs with almost 83% of cardiovascular disease, 58% of heart failure and 53% of atrial fibrillation, to name a few.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0175">The system not only advances movement of the mandible (cranially and anteriorly), but enables a relaxed movement of the mandible (caudally and posteriorly), which allows the temporomandibular joint to relax periodically to prevent jaw discomfort, temporomandibular joint strain and destabilization, morning stiffness of said joint, and alteration of the user's bite.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0176">The system <b>300</b> can also be used for users that snore, but who do not yet have sleep apnea. The inclusion of the vibration and airflow sensor enables the measurement of the intensity of snoring and can open the airway before the sub-sonic snore has become audible. The inclusion of stimulators of soft palate and uvula can reduce or eliminate snoring in users that do not have sleep apnea yet. Also, the system <b>300</b> can be used along with a CPAP machine and enable the CPAP machine to be used at a lower air pressure than a typical setting for user's that cannot tolerate CPAP machine at their typical air pressure.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0177">In one example, the devices disclosed herein are worn by a user at nighttime and includes sensors to monitor nocturnal silent angina or myocardial ischemia (measured by continuous EKG monitoring) that could cause sudden death or acute myocardial infarction during sleep or wake (especially silent ischemia). With the medical dispenser present, an incident could be treated with release of sublingual nitroglycerine from medicament reservoir while data such as continuous blood pressure recording, EKG, echocardiography and carotid doppler blood flow is continuously recorded and transmitted to the controller station <b>200</b> or cloud server <b>300</b>. The cloud server <b>300</b> can then send the data to a monitoring on-call physician, a handheld device or computer to alert the patient, as well to the nearest ER/ED (emergency room) for early ambulance dispatch.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0178">In other examples, the sensors selected for use in the maxillary and mandibular devices disclosed herein can be those that can diagnose cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or neurological medical conditions. The devices can have sensors and treatment methods to treat the same medical conditions.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0179">In an athletic environment, the sensors selected for use in the maxillary and mandibular devices disclosed herein can be the pulse-oximetry, heart rate and EKG, PTT with non-invasive blood pressure recording, carotid blood flow, airway resistance and total tidal volume (airflow measurement per breath), EEG recording, respiratory rate measurement, and combinations thereof. Data from these sensors will allow determination of performance restrictions and methods to physiologically improve performance such as legal nutritional supplementation or medications for underlying medical conditions or increasing the size of airway to help improve oxygenation and reduce heart rate during exercise or athletic performance. Further, evaluation of concussion injuries is possible with maxillary and mandibular devices that have EEG sensors, carotid doppler blood flow ultrasound sensor, airway and airflow sensors. The protrusive aspect of the devices can improve airflow after a concussion by increasing the size of airway with electrical stimulation of the tongue when the athlete is unconscious, thereby reducing brain injury from loss of oxygen.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0180">System <b>300</b> can be used for scheduled timed administration of medication through the mechanisms and devices discussed above, especially for those medications best administered while the user is asleep.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0181">When medicaments are being administered by the devices disclosed herein, the controller station <b>200</b> or system <b>300</b> would identify a physiological problem of the user from data received from the sensors and/or from data received from an external EKG monitoring system or external blood-glucose monitoring system of the user followed by generation of an executable instruction sent to the device's on-board microprocessor through wireless data system (blue tooth or other protocols) with back-up confirmation system for dangerous medications. The back-up may be the user themselves (smart phone or display screen of controller Station <b>200</b>) or an on-call nurse or ER physician or authorized health care provider or tele-medicine through a smart handheld device or through videography/audio from a camera or video recorder in the mandibular or maxillary housing. Data related to administration of the medication would require a response the following day prompting replacement of discharged pellets or other forms of the medicament, a visit to the health care provider's office, or a tele-medicine visit.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0182">It should be noted that the embodiments are not limited in their application or use to the details of construction and arrangement of parts and steps illustrated in the drawings and description.
