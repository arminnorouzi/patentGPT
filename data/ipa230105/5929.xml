Further, when a layer is referred to as being &#x201c;under&#x201d; another layer, it can be directly under the other layer, or one or more intervening layers may also be present.

However, the above two structures have a common disadvantage, that is, a floating body effect. Charges stored in the transistor easily cause loss of information in the memory cell, which may likely cause a history effect. That is, a threshold voltage of the transistor operates depending on its previous state. To solve the above problems, embodiments of the present disclosure disclose a semiconductor structure and a method for fabricating the same.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one embodiment of the present disclosure discloses a method for fabricating a semiconductor structure, including:</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">S<b>10</b>: providing a substrate having a first surface and a second surface opposite to each other; and</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">S<b>20</b>: forming, in the substrate, active areas arranged in an array and an isolation structure <b>30</b> configured to isolate the active areas, where each of the active areas includes a source region, a drain region, and a channel region positioned between the source region and the drain region.
