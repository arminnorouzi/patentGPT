INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Conventional unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are provided with a plurality of motors, each with a rotor attached. Rotating the rotors with the motors produces lift for the UAV. The speed (and, in some UAVs, the angle) of the motors can be individually controlled, to maneuver the UAV, providing yaw, pitch and roll control.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">UAVs which create lift by &#x2018;flapping&#x2019; a set of wings, rather than rotating a set of rotors, have been developed. Such a UAV <b>1</b> is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The spar <b>3</b> of each wing <b>2</b> may be connected to an actuator, such as a rotary drive unit (e.g. a motor) on the UAV, which is configured/driven to oscillate the wing <b>2</b> back and forth, preferably (but not essentially) within a substantially horizontal plane. A wing surface <b>4</b> extends below the spar <b>3</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the wing surface <b>4</b> can rotate about an axis substantially coaxial with the spar <b>3</b>. Preferably, the wing surface <b>4</b> is connected to the spar <b>3</b>, and the spar <b>3</b> is journaled with respect to the actuator.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The angle of attack &#x3b1; of the wing surface <b>4</b> is set to provide lift as the wing <b>2</b> is driven through the air (denoted by the arrows in Figures a) and b)) during each stroke of the wing <b>2</b>. For each stroke, the spar <b>3</b> of the wing <b>2</b> acts as the leading edge. Although the magnitude of the angle of attack &#x3b1; may be substantially the same for each stroke, they are in opposing directions. Therefore, after the end of each stroke, the wing <b>2</b> needs to rotate so as to have the correct angle of attack for the return stroke. The angle &#x3b8; through which the wing <b>2</b> must rotate may be calculated as 180&#xb0;&#x2212;(&#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>+&#x3b1;<sub>2</sub>), wherein &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>is the angle of attack in the first direction, and &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>is the angle of attack in the second (opposing) direction. For example, when &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>are both equal to 10&#xb0;, the wing <b>3</b> must rotate through 160&#xb0; when transitioning from one stroke to the next. It will be appreciated that when the angle of attack &#x3b1; is low, the wing <b>2</b> must rotate through a high angle &#x3b8; when transitioning from one stroke to the next. The angle &#x3b8; is the operational angular range of the wing <b>2</b>. The wing may be mechanically limited only to rotate within the operational angular range &#x3b8;. The angle of attack &#x3b1; may be different in each direction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In such arrangements, there may be no active control of the angle of the wing <b>2</b> during a stroke. The angle of the wing <b>2</b> is a consequence of the movement of air over the wing surface <b>4</b>, as the wing <b>2</b> is driven through a stroke by the actuator. Consequently, when the wing needs to transition from one stroke to the next, the wing may not rotate towards the required angle of attack until there is sufficient air moving over the wing surface to cause the wing to rotate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The rate of rotation of the wing <b>2</b> between strokes affects the amount of lift generated during the stroke. If the rate of rotation is slow, then a higher percentage of the total stroke time is taken up with rotating the wing <b>2</b> and a lower percentage of the total stroke time is taken up with the wing <b>2</b> being set at the required angle of attack &#x3b1;, generating lift.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The various phases that a flapping wing <b>2</b> goes through are indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. It will be appreciated that the time spent in the power strokes should be maximised, and the time spent rotating the wing <b>2</b> (referred to as &#x2018;reduced effect zone&#x2019; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) should be minimised.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there may be provided a wing mounting <b>10</b> comprising a base <b>11</b> and a wing bracket <b>25</b> which is pivotally mounted to the base <b>11</b>. The base <b>11</b> may comprise a substantially semi-circular plate having teeth <b>12</b> on the circumferential perimeter. The shape is not essential. The base <b>11</b> may be mounted to the UAV so as to be pivotable about a substantially vertical stroke axis <b>13</b>. An actuator <b>14</b>, such as a motor comprising a gear wheel, may engage with the teeth <b>12</b> of the base <b>11</b>, such that rotation of the gear wheel causes the base <b>11</b> to rotate about the stroke axis <b>13</b>. Preferably, the base <b>11</b> is caused to oscillate about the stroke axis <b>13</b> with a predetermined (adjustable) stroke rate. Of course, the use of teeth <b>12</b> and a toothed gear wheel <b>14</b> on the actuator are not essential. Any other means to oscillate the base <b>11</b> about the stroke axis <b>13</b> may be adopted, including but not limited to direct drive rotary motor, indirect rotary drive motor, linear motor, pulleys, strings, gears, belt drive etc.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The base <b>11</b> comprises two upstanding bosses <b>15</b> and two protrusions <b>16</b> which act as mechanical stops.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The wing bracket <b>25</b> comprises a pin <b>26</b> which is rotatably received in the bosses <b>15</b> of the base <b>11</b> such that the wing bracket <b>25</b> is able to rotate about a wrist axis <b>27</b>. The wrist axis <b>27</b> may be substantially perpendicular to the stroke axis <b>13</b>. Wrist axis <b>27</b> may be substantially horizontal.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The spar <b>3</b> of the wing <b>2</b> is secured to the top part of the wing bracket <b>25</b>. The spar <b>3</b> is axially offset from the wrist axis <b>27</b>, though this is not essential. By comparison, it will be noted that the schematic illustration of the wing <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> comprises an arrangement in which the wrist axis <b>27</b> is substantially coaxial with the spar <b>3</b>. This is not essential. All that matters is that the wing <b>2</b> can rotate about a wrist axis <b>27</b>, which is preferably substantially horizontal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The wing bracket <b>25</b> further comprises an anvil section <b>28</b>, the underside of which provides one or more engaging surfaces <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The wing bracket <b>25</b> is constrained to rotate within an operational angular range &#x3b8; by the mechanical stops <b>16</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>. During a stroke, as the wing <b>2</b> is moved through the air by the base <b>11</b> rotating about the stroke axis <b>13</b>, the movement of the air over the wing surface <b>4</b> causes the wing bracket <b>25</b> to rotate about the wrist axis <b>27</b>. When the wing bracket <b>25</b> rotates to a maximum extent in one direction (setting the wing <b>2</b> to the angle of attack &#x3b1;), further rotation of the wing <b>2</b> is prevented by the engaging surface <b>29</b> of the anvil <b>28</b> abutting the mechanical stop <b>16</b>. When the wing <b>2</b> reaches the extent of the stroke, and decelerates, the air passing over the wing surface <b>4</b> reduces. Due to the mass and/or position of the centre of gravity of the wing bracket <b>25</b> and wing <b>2</b>, the wing bracket <b>25</b> may move back towards the middle of the angular range (or at least away from the maximum extent). As the wing <b>2</b> starts its stroke in the opposite direction, so the wing bracket <b>25</b> will start to rotate about the wrist axis <b>27</b> in the opposite direction, until it reaches the angle of attack &#x3b1; in the opposite direction. The angle of attack &#x3b1;, and thus the operational angular range &#x3b8;, is defined by the geometry of the wing bracket <b>25</b>, the mechanical stops <b>16</b> and the anvil <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Such an arrangement effectively maintains the required angle of attack &#x3b1; during each stroke. However, particularly when the wing stroke rate is high, the impact of the anvil <b>28</b> on the mechanical stops <b>29</b> can create undesired noise.

The bore <b>119</b> of the grub screw <b>118</b> may be a blind bore. The grub screw <b>118</b> is received in the threaded bore <b>117</b>. As the grub screw <b>118</b> is rotated with respect to the base <b>111</b>, the distance by which the grub screw <b>118</b> protrudes from the base <b>111</b> will be adjusted.

In the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the angle is shown relative to a central position 0&#xb0;. It will be noted that, in this example, the operational angular range is denoted as being 170&#xb0;, meaning that the angle of attack &#x3b1; is 5&#xb0; in each direction.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in at least one embodiment of the present invention, the biasing elements <b>116</b> may not always be in contact with the anvil <b>128</b>. Consequently, for at least a portion of the operational angular range &#x3b8;, the biasing element <b>116</b> does not provide any biasing force on the wing bracket <b>125</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. The biasing element <b>116</b> is configured to bias the wing bracket <b>125</b> only within a biasing range X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2 </sub>adjacent the respective boundaries of the operational angular range &#x3b8;. Consequently, the biasing elements <b>116</b> are configured not to bias the wing bracket <b>125</b> within an inner angular range Y in the middle of the operational angular range &#x3b8;. By adjusting the biasing element <b>116</b> (for example by adjusting the height), the biasing range X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2 </sub>and, as a consequence, the inner angular range Y, can be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, it will be noted that the biasing force, relative to the distance from the central position, is non-linear. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, it is illustrated as being linear. A biasing element of a wing mounting embodying the present invention may have a linear or non-linear spring constant.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As the wing bracket <b>125</b> rotates towards a respective boundary of the operational angular range &#x3b8;, the corresponding biasing element <b>116</b> will impart a biasing force on the wing bracket <b>125</b>, which may be proportional to the angular position of the wing bracket <b>125</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <i>b</i></figref>, it will be appreciated that, in use, when the wing <b>2</b> is being driven through a stroke, the wind passing over the wind surface <b>4</b> will impart a force on the wing <b>2</b>, causing it to rotate about the wrist axis <b>127</b>. As the wing bracket rotates to a particular angle, at which point the biasing element <b>116</b> starts to impart a biasing force, the opposing forces may eventually reach equilibrium. In at least one embodiment, the biasing force provided by the biasing element <b>116</b> will always exceed the maximum force imparted on the wing by wind loading.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">For comparison with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> schematically illustrates the forces which may be imparted by the mechanical stops <b>16</b> on the bracket without the at least one biasing element of the claimed invention.

With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, it will be appreciated that the grub screw <b>118</b> protrudes from the surface of the base <b>111</b>. If, in use, the compression spring <b>120</b> is compressed beyond a certain extent, then the engaging surface <b>129</b> of the anvil <b>128</b> may impact on the top of the grub screw <b>118</b>, which will provide a mechanical stop. In at least one embodiment, however, the biasing elements are configured such that the biasing force provided relative to the angular position of the wing bracket would be such that the/a mechanical stop is not needed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates another wing mounting <b>200</b> embodying the present invention.

The biasing element <b>216</b> comprises a grub screw <b>218</b> which is received in the threaded bore <b>117</b>. Rather than having a blind bore <b>119</b> in the grub screw <b>118</b> like the arrangement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the grub screw <b>218</b> of the wing mounting <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> comprises a protrusion <b>219</b> which is received inside a compression spring <b>220</b>, such that a compression spring <b>220</b> is seated on the grub screw <b>218</b>. As with the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>8</b></figref>, adjustment of the grub screw <b>218</b> within the threaded aperture <b>217</b> adjusts the height of the compression spring <b>220</b> relative to the base <b>211</b>.

The outer diameter of the shaft may be substantially the same as the internal diameter of the compression spring <b>1120</b>. A benefit of this is that the shaft may act as a bracing member for the compression spring <b>1120</b>, to prevent it from buckling under force. The outer diameter of the head is preferably larger than the internal diameter of compression spring <b>1120</b> so that the head sits on the end of the compression spring <b>1120</b> and engages with the anvil <b>1128</b>. The length of the shaft may be less than the length of the compression spring <b>1120</b>, so that the compression spring <b>1120</b> may be compressible.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates another wing mounting <b>300</b> for a UAV embodying the present invention.

Because the first <b>421</b><i>a </i>and second <b>421</b><i>b </i>ends of the torsional spring <b>420</b> are secured at either end, at all times, it will be appreciated that the torsional spring <b>420</b> provides a biasing force whenever the wing bracket <b>425</b> is caused to deviate from its central position.
