id="h-0001" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to adducts comprising carbon allotropes and unsaturated or saturated diacids and linear and/or cyclic derivatives thereof, as components for producing crosslinkable elastomer compositions.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates in particular to adducts comprising compounds preferably derived from natural sources such as mucic, pyromucic, glucaric, glycaric, galactaric acids, muconic acid and/or linear derivatives thereof containing ester or amide groups and/or cyclic derivatives thereof with heteroatoms in the ring, such as oxygen or nitrogen, and carbon allotropes in which the carbon is sp<sup>2 </sup>hybridized, such as for example carbon nanotubes, graphene or nanographites, carbon black, for the purpose of improving the physicochemical characteristics of said allotropes mainly by increasing their dispersibility and the stability of their interactions in polymer matrices, such as for example crosslinkable elastomer compositions, and in liquid media.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The nanometric sp<sup>2 </sup>carbon allotropes such as graphene, nanographites consisting of a small number of graphene layers (from a few units to a few tens), graphite, single-wall or multi-walled carbon nanotubes, are characterized by a high aspect ratio, i.e. by a high ratio of their larger dimension to their smaller dimension. It is known that on increasing the aspect ratio, the area per unit volume increases. Thus, these allotropes are nano-objects and have a high aspect ratio: they have a very large surface area.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The aforementioned carbon allotropes, produced in the laboratory or on an industrial scale, do not in fact consist of carbon alone. On their surface there are functional groups, typically oxygenated, produced during synthesis. However, these functional groups are present in a very small amount, so small that they: (i) are difficult to identify, for example by analyses such as infrared spectroscopy; (ii) do not alter the solubility parameter of the sp<sup>2 </sup>carbon allotrope; (iii) do not give rise to chemical reactions and therefore to chemical bonds in observable amounts, with other substances present in the mixture in which the allotropes are located; (iv) do not give rise to chemical reactions and therefore to chemical bonds in observable amounts with the polymer matrix in which the allotropes are located.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would instead be highly desirable to have, on the surface of the sp<sup>2 </sup>carbon allotropes, functional groups in amounts such as to: (i) alter the solubility parameter of said allotropes; (ii) give rise to chemical reactions with other substances; (iii) give rise to chemical bonds with the polymer matrices in which they are located.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The presence of functional groups on the surface of the sp<sup>2 </sup>carbon allotropes would be desirable for various applications, for example: (i) elastomer composites for dynamic-mechanical applications, for example in tire compounds; (ii) elastomeric and thermoplastic composites with polymers of a polar nature; (iii) dispersions in liquid media for coating layers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In fact, the sp<sup>2 </sup>carbon allotropes, such as carbon black, graphene and nanographites and carbon nanotubes, are used both in polymer, thermoplastic or elastomer matrices, and in liquid dispersions for coating layers. They promote mechanical reinforcement, as well as the thermal and electrical conductivity of the materials in which they are present. Moreover, some carbon allotropes such as carbon nanotubes, graphene and nanographites in polymer matrices have a notable flame-retardant effect. For the reason already mentioned, i.e. the formation of a high interfacial area, the improvement in the aforementioned properties is particularly marked when &#x201c;nanometric&#x201d; carbon allotropes are used, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene and nanographites. Moreover, carbon nanotubes and graphene are intrinsically endowed with exceptional mechanical properties, and electrical and thermal conductivity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The most important application of carbon black is in elastomer compounds, as reinforcing filler, in particular in tire compounds. Carbon black is an excellent reinforcing filler, but is not the ideal filler for reducing the dissipation of energy during a dynamic-mechanical application of an elastomer compound, e.g. for application in tire compounds. In fact, to achieve an effective action of reinforcement of an elastomer matrix, the fillers must be used in appreciable amounts. Typically, the ASTM standard compounds stipulate the use of more than 30 parts of filler per 100 parts of elastomer. At this level, the filler is beyond its percolation threshold, i.e. forms a network. Thus, there are not only filler-polymer interactions, but also filler-filler interactions. These interactions lead to a high value of the viscoelastic modulus in the material not subjected to deformation. These interactions are, however, essentially based on non-bonding forces, typically van der Waals forces. On applying energy to the composite material that contains the reinforcing fillers and gradually increasing the strain amplitude, the reinforcement based on non-bonding interactions is reduced. Thus, there is a reduction of the viscoelastic modulus with increase in the strain amplitude. This phenomenon, for low amplitudes of deformation, is known as the Payne effect and is a source of dissipation of energy. The theory of reinforcement still says that the surface area is the parameter that influences the value of the viscoelastic modulus in the undeformed material. The larger the surface area, the higher the modulus of the undeformed material.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, elastomeric materials that contain carbon black also show an appreciable reduction of loads for elongations that go beyond the limits of linear viscoelasticity.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This phenomenon is known as the Mullins effect. As stated in J. Diani, B. Fayolle, P. Gilormini, A review on the Mullins effect, European Polymer Journal 45 (2009) 601-612, the Mullins effect becomes more important as the content of carbon black is increased.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The nanometric carbon allotropes are ideal for having a high value of modulus in an undeformed elastomer composite. However, in this case as well, if the interactions that lead to a high value of modulus in the undeformed material are of a supramolecular nature, i.e. are based on van der Waals forces, the modulus declines with deformation and there is dissipation of energy by the Payne effect and/or the Mullins effect.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Ultimately, in the case of carbon allotropes it is not possible to take advantage of the large surface area to have high reinforcement at low strains without at the same time having high dissipation of energy at high strains. This is because the sp<sup>2 </sup>carbon allotropes do not establish chemical bonds with the polymer chains, not having functional groups on their surface capable of promoting chemical bonding with the polymer chains.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It would thus be highly desirable to be able to establish chemical bonds between the carbon allotropes and polymer matrices, or to have functional groups on the surface of the carbon allotropes capable of establishing such bonds.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The elastomers that are used for tire compounds are mainly poly(1,4-cis-isoprene) (from Hevea brasiliensis and synthetic), poly(1,4-butadiene) (BR rubber), poly(styrene-co-butadiene) (SBR rubber). All these polymers are nonpolar hydrocarbons. Thus, dispersion of the carbon allotropes is not particularly hampered. Nevertheless, it presents considerable technical problems. In the case of carbon black, it requires an appreciable quantity of mechanical energy, which may lead to breaking of the polymer chains, with reduction of the mechanical reinforcement. Moreover, as soon as the mixing process is completed, there is agglomeration of the filler, which leads to formation of the filler network, which will be broken on applying a strain, causing the Payne effect and/or the Mullins effect, or dissipation of energy. This is stated for example in G. A. Bohm, W. Tomaszewski, W. Cole, T. Hogan, Furthering the understanding of the non-linear response of filler reinforced elastomers, Polymer 51 (2010) 2057-2068.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Carbon nanotubes may also be mixed directly with a nonpolar elastomer matrix, by mechanical mixing.

Eng., </i>298, 241-251 (2012), the nanotubes are mixed with rubber in an internal mixer, utilizing the thermo-mechanical energy of mixing, without any prior chemical modification. However, this leads to fracture of said nanotubes, the length of which is shown to be much less than that of the nanotubes before mixing. Polymer nanocomposites with carbon nanotubes are also described in &#x201c;Carbon nanotube-polymer interactions in nanocomposites: A review, Composites Science and Technology 72 (2011) 72-84&#x201d;. In both of these publications, images are presented with carbon nanotubes dispersed at the level of the individual nanotubes (more or less fractured) but they also show agglomerates.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A nanographite may also be mixed directly with a nonpolar elastomer matrix, by mechanical mixing.

In these publications too, dispersions are shown with few graphene layers, but also agglomerates.

These polymers may have a group of a polar nature in one or in all of the repeating units. Examples of polymers with a polar group in every repeating unit are, for example: polyurethanes, polyethers, polyesters, polycarbonates, poly(vinyl esters), poly(vinyl alcohol). Examples of polymers that do not contain a polar group in every repeating unit are, for example: copolymers of ethylene with polar monomers such as for example vinyl acetate, vinyl(alcohol). Other examples of polymers that do not contain a polar group in every repeating unit are the polymers in which the polar group was introduced by a grafting reaction. Examples of these polymers on which the grafting reaction could be carried out are polyolefins, such as poly(ethylene) and poly(propylene), ethylene-propylene copolymers, polymers derived from dienes, on which an anhydride, such as maleic anhydride or itaconic anhydride, has been grafted, or on which an ester such as ethyl maleate has been grafted, or on which a mixture of an anhydride and an ester has been grafted. The dispersibility and the compatibility of the sp<sup>2 </sup>carbon allotropes in polar polymer matrices would still be better if there were polar functional groups on the surface of said allotropes.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The sp<sup>2 </sup>carbon allotropes are also used for preparing dispersions in liquid media for making conductive inks, based both on carbon black and carbon nanotubes and graphene or nanographites. It is now important to have water-based inks, especially for reducing the environmental impact. In the case of dispersions in liquid media, the first aim is to obtain stability of said dispersion, to avoid settling of the allotrope. This problem is especially important for carbon allotropes of nanometric dimensions, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, nanographites that have a higher aspect ratio and larger surface area and thus form a network more easily.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It would therefore certainly be desirable to have at our disposal sp<sup>2 </sup>carbon allotropes, such as carbon black, carbon nanotubes, graphene and nanographites, that can form stable dispersions in aqueous media.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Some methodologies have already been proposed for introducing polar groups on carbon allotropes.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The oxidation of carbon black dates back to the 19th century.

These include stacking. Stacking is defined as a stacked arrangement of aromatic molecules. Molecules containing aromatic rings in fact tend to become arranged spontaneously stacked on one another. Hence the concept of aromatic interaction (or &#x3c0;-&#x3c0; interaction), meaning a bond of the noncovalent type that is established between organic compounds containing aromatic groups, owing to intermolecular superposition of the p orbitals in the &#x3c0;-conjugated systems.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0090">The carbon allotropes may also give rise to intermolecular interactions with formation of covalent bonds. These intermolecular interactions with formation of covalent bonds are typical of aromatic polycyclic systems.

The interaction is between a doublet of &#x3c0; electrons and a &#x3c3; orbital, or between the electrons of a &#x3c3; orbital and a &#x3c0; orbital, or between the electrons of two &#x3c0; orbitals. This type of adduct is also known as &#x201c;&#x3c0; complex&#x201d;.

In this context, an addition reaction may be carried out between a compound of formula (I) that contains functional groups of a polar nature and the carbon allotrope that comprises the functional groups. Formation of the adduct may also be carried out by interaction between the functional groups of the compound of formula (I) and the functional groups present on the carbon allotrope. These interactions may be of an intermolecular nature, such as hydrogen bonds and dipole interactions, or of a covalent nature, such as for example an esterification by reaction with an acid group.

The solvents are removed before the successive actions aimed at transferring energy to the adduct between the carbon filler and the compound of formula (I).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0107">The term &#x201c;solvent&#x201d; refers to the compound of formula (I) and not the carbon allotrope, for which it only acts as a dispersing means. The solvent is preferably an environmentally friendly solvent, for example water.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0108">Generally, owing to the chemical nature of carbon, dispersion of carbon fillers in liquid matrices is rather difficult. The use of ultrasound makes it possible to disperse the carbon filler in a short time and improve the homogeneity of the dispersion (even just a few seconds). Moreover, the use of sonication makes it possible to separate, to a varying extent, the carbon fillers into the fundamental units. For example, carbon nanotubes may be separated into individual tubes from the tangle in which they are intertwined with other tubes. It is advisable to use low-power sonicators, for example ultrasonic baths. With suitable solvents (for example aromatic solvents, halogenated solvents, dimethylformamide, N-methyl pyrrolidone) it is also possible to bring about at least partial exfoliation of a graphite having a varying starting number of stacked layers and/or at least partial disentanglement of carbon nanotubes. Graphites with a small number of stacked layers have nanometric dimensions and are called nanographites. It is therefore preferable to contact the nanofiller first with a liquid so as to facilitate subsequently, by sonication and depending on the nanofiller, either the so-called disentanglement of the carbon nanotubes or exfoliation, more or less pronounced, of the graphite or nanographite. This procedure results in improvement of contact between the nanofiller and the compound of formula (I), also leading to an increase in exposed area of the nanofiller.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0109">Irradiation with ultrasound gives rise, for a field intensity above a certain threshold value, to a cavitation effect in the solution. The gas microcavities (bubbles) present in the solution, subjected to successive expansion and contraction induced by the oscillating sound pressure field, get bigger and then implode, producing zones with extremely high temperature and pressure, which facilitate dispersion of the carbon allotrope in the solvent.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0110">However, dispersion of the carbon allotrope in the solvent that also contains the compound of formula (I) may also take place solely by mechanical and/or magnetic stirring.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0111">The procedure for removing the solvent from the mixture obtained may take place by any method suitable for removing solvent, for example vacuum evaporation, spray drying, etc.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0112">The reaction of formation of the adduct is carried out with energy transfer to the system consisting of the compound of formula (I) and the carbon allotrope. Energy transfer is carried out for the purpose of improving the interaction between the compound of formula (I) and the carbon allotrope. In the absence of energy transfer, interaction between the compound of formula (I) and the carbon allotrope is weaker. Weaker interaction may lead to partial release of the compound of formula (I) from the carbon allotrope, especially if the adduct is in an environment of a polar nature.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0113">As stated above, the forms of energy that may be transferred to the composition to contribute to formation of the adduct are:<ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0114">mechanical energy;</li>        <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0115">thermal energy;</li>        <li id="ul0014-0003" num="0116">photons.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Mechanical Energy</heading><p id="p-0108" num="0117">The mechanical treatment may consist for example of putting the powder obtained (allotrope/compound of formula (I)) in a ball mill, for example comprising a jar equipped with stainless steel spheres.

The number of stacked layers was estimated by applying the Scherrer equation to the 002 rereflection at about 35 for HSAG and 12 for the CNTs. With regard to the samples of graphite and carbon nanotubes functionalized with pyrone 3, it was found that in all cases the reflections already assigned for the starting allotropes, were found at the same values of 28, indicating that formation of the adducts did not promote expansion of the distance between the layers. The number of stacked layers in the adducts of HSAG and CNT with compound 3 was calculated by applying the Scherrer equation to the 002 reflection.

The value of the shear storage modulus is then measured, by applying a sinusoidal stress at 50&#xb0; C. and a frequency of 1 Hz, in a range of strain amplitude between 0.1% and 25%, using the Monsanto R.P.A. 2000 rheometer.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0241">Operating conditions: The specimens were held in the instrument at 50&#xb0; C. for 90 seconds, the stress was then applied at 50&#xb0; C. in the range of strain amplitude between 0.1% and 25%, with a frequency of 1 Hz, increasing the strain amplitude in the range stated above. This treatment is carried out to cancel the previous thermo-mechanical history. Application of the stress is then repeated in the same experimental conditions. Vulcanization was then carried out at 150&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, with a frequency of 1.667 Hz and an angle of 6.98% (0.5 rad). The vulcanized specimen was left in the instrument for 10 minutes at 50&#xb0; C. Sinusoidal stress was then applied in the same conditions stated above, then leaving the specimen in the instrument for 10 minutes at 50&#xb0; C. Sinusoidal stress is then applied again, still in the same experimental conditions. Table 1 shows the values of G&#x2032;<sub>&#x3b3;=0.28%</sub>, &#x394;G&#x2032;, G&#x2033;max and (Tan Delta)<sub>max </sub>determined by the strain sweep test for the composites of Example 43 and of Example 44. The values presented in Table 1 demonstrate that there is a reduction of the Payne effect of the composite when a carbon black modified with a compound according to the invention is used.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Example of preparation of</entry><entry/><entry>Ex.</entry><entry>Ex.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>compound</entry><entry/><entry>43</entry><entry>44</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>G&#x2032;<sub>y=0.28%</sub></entry><entry>MPa</entry><entry>6.58</entry><entry>5.85</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x394;G&#x2032;</entry><entry>MPa</entry><entry>4.98</entry><entry>4.25</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>G&#x2033;<sub>max</sub></entry><entry>MPa</entry><entry>0.85</entry><entry>0.71</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(Tan Delta)<sub>max</sub></entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>0.27</entry><entry>0.24</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="left" id="FOO-00001">G&#x2032;<sub>y=0.28% </sub>= value of G&#x2032; measured at 0.28%. &#x394;G&#x2032; = difference between the value of G&#x2032; at minimum strain and the value of G&#x2032; measured at the maximum strain reached.
