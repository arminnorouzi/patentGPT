No. 17/154,188, filed on Jan. 21, 2021, which claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/964,373, filed on Jan. 22, 2020, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is a bottle or container for storing, transporting, and dispensing fill material for repairing a golf course divot hole. In particular, the present invention relates to a bottle that includes a lid that can be easily opened to refill the bottle and a flanged exterior surface that provides easy storage of the bottle when not in use.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When a golfer strikes a golf ball lying in the grass, he or she typically slices into the grass below the roots and leaves a hole in the turf that is referred to as a divot. Replacing the displaced grass in the divot is typically unsatisfactory because the roots have been damaged and the grass will not grow. Therefore, many golf carts are provided with a bottle or container attached to the cart that holds grass seeds, soil and or fertilizer. After a golfer completes a shot, he or she removes the bottle from a holder, fills the divot with the contents of the bottle and then places the bottle back in the holder.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many of the bottles or holders that are currently being used have a two-piece construction, wherein the open ends are threaded and the two pieces screw together. However, moist sand can create a cement like adhesion on the threads of the cap after tightening. This is disruptive to the refilling process for golf course operations; mainly in wasted time spent refilling bottles by the staff. The average golf course operation typically re-fills a minimum 80-120 sand bottles a day. Screw on caps are often broken and are easily lost or misplaced. It is a constant replacement battle for the supplier and golf course. The screwed on cap design has several problems, including worn threads and the inconvenience of having to unscrew the two halves, fill the bottle and then re-screw the halves together. Therefore, there is a need for a bottle that can be more easily disassembled, refilled, and reassembled.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with the present invention, a bottle for storing grass seeds, soil, and/or fertilizer used for filling a golf divot is provided. The bottle includes a bottom section and a top section.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The bottom section includes a base and a perimetrical sidewall extending therefrom to an open end to define an interior. The bottom section can also have a flanged ring extending outwardly from a midsection of the perimetrical sidewall and one or more handgrips in the perimetrical sidewall. Preferably, the handgrips are located between the base and the flanged ring. In preferred embodiments, the bottom section can have a handle attached to the perimetrical sidewall that can extend between the flanged ring and the open end. The open end of the bottom section has a circumferential edge that, preferably, slopes upwardly and away from the handle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A pair of bosses extend outwardly from the sidewall at the open end and, as described below, can be engaged by a pair of latches to secure the top and bottom sections together. Each of the pair of bosses is preferably located on an opposite side of the perimetrical sidewall in a recessed portion of the perimetrical sidewall. The recessed portions facilitate unlatching the top section from the bottom section.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The top section has a perimetrical edge and a top surface with a spout extending therefrom with an opening that provides communication with the interior of the bottom section. The spout is used for discharging the contents of the bottle. The spout can have a curved outer surface, a distal end, and a proximal end, wherein the distal end has a cross-sectional area that is less than a cross-sectional area of the proximal end. This minimizes clogging when materials are poured out through the spout.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A pair of latches extend from the perimetrical edge. Each of the latches has an aperture that receives one of the bosses when the latches are pivoted downwardly and engage the bosses. The top section snugly engages the open end of the bottom section and the latches engage the bosses to secure the top section to the bottom section.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The bottle can also be part of an assembly that includes the bottle and a holder. The holder includes a tubular sleeve having a sidewall extending between top and bottom open ends. The holder is configured to receive the bottom section of the bottle and includes one or more mounting studs or apertures for securing the holder to a structure on a golf cart. The bottle is inserted into the holder and passes through until it is engaged by the flanged ring. In some embodiments, a section of the sidewall of the holder is substantially flat to facilitate mounting the holder to a flat surface.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The preferred embodiments of the bottle for storing grass seeds, soil, and/or fertilizer used for filling a golf divot of the present invention, as well as other objects, features and advantages of this invention, will be apparent from the accompanying drawings wherein:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective top view of a preferred embodiment of the bottle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective bottom view of the bottle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side front view of the bottle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side rear view of the bottle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a right side view of the bottle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a left side view of the bottle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an exploded top perspective view of the bottle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an exploded bottom perspective view of the bottle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a top view of the bottle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a bottom view of the bottle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a detail section view of one of the bosses on the sidewall of the bottom section.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention is a container or bottle for storing grass seeds, soil, and/or fertilizer used for filling a golf divot. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;container&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottle&#x201d; are synonymous and refer to a vessel for storing, transporting, and dispensing materials used to fill golf divots. The bottle includes a bottom section and a detachable top section.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The bottom section has a base and a perimetrical sidewall extending therefrom to an open end to define an interior. The bottom section can have a flanged ring extending outwardly from the middle and one or more handgrips is recessed in the perimetrical sidewall. The bottom section can have a handle instead of the handgrip, wherein the handle extends between the middle of the bottle (also referred to herein as the midsection) or flanged ring and the open end. In some embodiments, the bottom section can have both a handle and a handgrip. A pair of bosses used for attaching the top section extend outwardly from the sidewall at the open end. The bosses are located in recessed portions of the sidewall and are preferably located on opposite sides of the bottom section.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The top section has a perimetrical edge and a top surface with a spout extending therefrom. The spout has an opening or a mouth that provides communication with the interior. The top section also can have a pair of pivoting latches that extend from the perimetrical edge and have apertures near the distal ends. The perimetrical edge matingly engages the open end of the bottom section and the latches pivot downwardly to engage the bosses and secure the top section to the bottom section.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The bottle can also be provided as part of an assembly that includes the bottle and a holder that is mounted to a golf cart. The holder includes a perimetrical sidewall having top and bottom open ends and one or more mounting studs or apertures for securing the holder to a structure on a golf cart. The top open end of the holder is configured to receive the bottom section of the bottle. The bottle passes through the top open end of the holder until it engages the flanged ring.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">One of the novel features of the design is that the bottle can be used with multiple pouring openings, spouts or nozzles. In the golf market depending on the geography, many different sand, seed, and fertilizer blends, and mixtures thereof are used depending on the type of grass on a golf course or on the specific requirements of the groundskeeper. The bottle is designed so that the same bottle can be used by changing the top section that includes the spout in order to meet the requirements of the user. For example, a large, long neck as opposed to a short, narrow spout reduces over pouring and wasted pours so that a golfer does not run out of fill material before the round of golf is completed. In addition, the design eliminates threads and the need for a screw on cap.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The bottle design allows for a low cost with maximum durability. The top spout is injection molded, which allows for the addition of a rubber additive based polypropylene that is virtually indestructible. The bottom section of the bottle is preferably made from blow-molded polyethylene that is both inexpensive and durable.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The novel configuration of the bosses and latches that secure the top and bottom sections together allow for quick release and a durable, snap-on mechanism. This design can withstand multiple years of repetitive releases because of the rubber based properties of the materials used for the fabrication.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The bottle can be provided with a holder that is attached to a golf cart at an accessible location. The bottle is placed in the holder when not in use. The holder is a sleeve with open ends and a circumferential sidewall that extends between top and bottom perimetrical edges. The holder is configured to receive the bottom section of the bottle and engage the flanged ring, which prevents the bottle from passing through the holder. The holder can have one or more mounting apertures that are used to attach the holder to a structure on the golf cart.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to the accompanying drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref> show various views of the bottle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a preferred embodiment of the bottle <b>10</b> that is constructed in two sections, a bottom section <b>12</b> and a top section <b>14</b>.
