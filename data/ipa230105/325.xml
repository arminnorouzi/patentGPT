Such minimally invasive techniques may be performed through natural orifices in a patient anatomy or through one or more surgical incisions. Through these natural orifices or incisions, an operator may insert minimally invasive medical tools to reach a target tissue location, Minimally invasive medical tools include instruments such as therapeutic, diagnostic, biopsy, and surgical instruments. Minimally invasive medical tools may also include imaging instruments such as endoscopic instruments, Imaging instruments provide a user with a field of view within the patient anatomy. Some minimally invasive medical tools and imaging instruments may be teleoperated or otherwise computer-assisted. Various features may improve the effectiveness of minimally invasive imaging instruments including instrument orientation cues, heat dissipation features, and leak testing features.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The embodiments of the invention are best summarized by the claims that follow the description.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Consistent with some embodiments, an imaging instrument comprises an elongate flexible shaft, a camera disposed at a distal end of the elongate flexible shaft, and a housing coupled to a proximal end of the elongate flexible shaft.

In some embodiments, teleoperated medical system <b>100</b> may be suitable for use in, for example, surgical, diagnostic, therapeutic, or biopsy procedures. While some embodiments are provided herein with respect to such procedures, any reference to medical or surgical instruments and medical or surgical methods is non-limiting. The systems, instruments, and methods described herein may be used for animals, human cadavers, animal cadavers, portions of human or animal anatomy, non-surgical diagnosis, as well as for industrial systems and general robotic or teleoperational systems.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, medical system <b>100</b> generally includes a manipulator assembly <b>102</b> for operating a medical instrument <b>104</b> in performing various procedures on a patient P positioned on a table The manipulator assembly <b>102</b> may be teleoperated, non-teleoperated, or a hybrid teleoperated and non-teleoperated assembly with select degrees of freedom of motion that may be motorized and/or teleoperated and select degrees of freedom of motion that may be non-motorized and/or non-teleoperated. Master assembly <b>106</b> generally includes one or more control devices for controlling manipulator assembly <b>102</b>. Manipulator assembly <b>102</b> supports medical instrument <b>104</b> and may optionally include a plurality of actuators or motors that drive inputs on medical instrument <b>104</b> in response to commands from a control system <b>112</b>. The actuators may optionally include drive systems that when coupled to medical instrument <b>104</b> may advance medical instrument <b>104</b> into a naturally or surgically created anatomic orifice. Other drive systems may move the distal end of medical instrument <b>104</b> in multiple degrees of freedom, which may include three degrees of linear motion (e.g., linear motion along the X, Y, Z Cartesian axes) and in three degrees of rotational motion e.g., rotation about the X, Y, Z Cartesian axes). Additionally, the actuators can be used to actuate an articulable end effector of medical instrument <b>104</b> for grasping tissue in the jaws of a biopsy device and/or the like. Actuator position sensors such as resolvers, encoders, potentiometers, and other mechanisms may provide sensor data to medical system <b>100</b> describing the rotation and orientation of the motor shafts. This position sensor data may be used to determine motion of the objects manipulated by the actuators.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Teleoperated medical system <b>100</b> also includes a display system <b>110</b> for displaying an. image or representation of the surgical site and medical instrument <b>104</b> generated by sub-systems of sensor system <b>108</b>. Display system <b>110</b> and master assembly <b>106</b> may be oriented so operator O can control medical instrument <b>104</b> and master assembly <b>106</b> with the perception of telepresence.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, medical instrument <b>104</b> may include components of an imaging system (discussed in more detail below), which may include an imaging scope assembly or imaging instrument that records a concurrent or real-time image of a surgical site and provides the image to the operator or operator O through one or more displays of medical system <b>100</b>, such as one or more displays of display system <b>110</b>. The concurrent image may be, for example, a two or three-dimensional image captured by an imaging instrument positioned within the surgical site. In some embodiments, the imaging system includes endoscopic imaging instrument components that may be integrally or removably coupled to medical instrument <b>104</b>. However, in some embodiments, a separate endoscope, attached to a separate manipulator assembly may be used with medical instrument <b>104</b> to image the surgical site. In some examples, as described in detail below, the imaging instrument alone or in combination with other components of the medical instrument <b>104</b> may include one or more mechanisms for cleaning one or more lenses of the imaging instrument when the one or more lenses become partially and/or fully obscured by fluids and/or other materials encountered by the distal end of the imaging instrument. In some examples, the one or more cleaning mechanisms may optionally include an air and/or other gas delivery system that is usable to emit a puff of air and/or other gasses to blow the one or more lenses clean. Examples of the one or more cleaning mechanisms are discussed in more detail in international Publication No. WO/2016/025465 filed Aug. 11, 2016 disclosing &#x201c;Systems and Methods for Cleaning an Endoscopic Instrument&#x201d;; U.S. patent application Ser.
