Audio watermarking is a technique used to identify media such as television broadcasts, radio broadcasts, advertisements (television and/or radio), downloaded media, streaming media, prepackaged media, etc. Existing audio watermarking techniques identify media by embedding one or more audio codes (e.g., one or more watermarks), such as media identifying information and/or an identifier that may be mapped to media identifying information, into an audio and/or video component. In some examples, the audio or video component is selected to have a signal characteristic sufficient to hide the watermark. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;code&#x201d; or &#x201c;watermark&#x201d; are used interchangeably and are defined to mean any identification information (e.g., an identifier) that may be inserted or embedded in the audio or video of media (e.g., a program or advertisement) for the purpose of identifying the media or for another purpose such as tuning (e.g., a packet identifying header).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein &#x201c;media&#x201d; refers to audio and/or visual (still or moving) content and/or advertisements. For example, as used herein, the term &#x201c;media&#x201d; includes any type of content and/or advertisement delivered via any type of distribution medium. Thus, media includes television programming or advertisements, radio programming or advertisements, movies, web sites, streaming media, etc.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some examples, to identify watermarked media, the watermark(s) are extracted and used to access a table of reference watermarks that are mapped to media identifying information. In some examples, signatures may be utilized for identifying information. Unlike media monitoring techniques based on codes and/or watermarks included with and/or embedded in the monitored media, fingerprint or signature-based media monitoring techniques generally use one or more inherent characteristics of the monitored media during a monitoring time interval to generate a substantially unique proxy for the media. Such a proxy is referred to as a signature or fingerprint, and can take any form (e.g., a series of digital values, a waveform, etc.) representative of any aspect(s) of the media signal(s)(e.g., the audio and/or video signals forming the media presentation being monitored). A signature may be a series of signatures collected in series over a time interval. A good signature is approximately repeatable when processing the same media presentation, but has at least some unique characteristics relative to other (e.g., different) presentations of other (e.g., different) media. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;fingerprint&#x201d; and &#x201c;signature&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein and are defined herein to mean a proxy for identifying media that is generated from one or more inherent characteristics of the media.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Signature-based media monitoring generally involves determining (e.g., generating and/or collecting) signature(s) representative of a media signal (e.g., an audio signal and/or a video signal) output by a monitored media device and comparing the monitored signature(s) to one or more references signatures corresponding to known (e.g., reference) media sources. Various comparison criteria, such as a cross-correlation value, a Hamming distance, etc., can be evaluated to determine whether a monitored signature matches a particular reference signature. When a match between the monitored signature and one of the reference signatures is found, the monitored media can be identified as corresponding to the particular reference media represented by the reference signature that with matched the monitored signature. Because attributes, such as an identifier of the media, a presentation time, a broadcast channel, etc., are collected for the reference signature, these attributes may then be associated with the monitored media whose monitored signature matched the reference signature. Example systems for identifying media based on codes and/or signatures are long known and were first disclosed in Thomas, U.S. Pat. No. 5,481,294, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The media measurement entity (e.g., audience measurement service, audience measurement entity, etc.) provides the service of accurately reporting television viewing behavior for individuals. The media measurement entity is to accurately report television viewing behavior for individuals by crediting exposure to a media exposure category. For example, if a first media presentation device presents first media, the media measurement entity is to credit the first media in media ratings calculations and market share reports.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In measuring media ratings, certain media (e.g., advertisements, television shows, movies, or any other type of broadcasting content) is produced by television stations (e.g., HBO, Disney Channel, Food Network, etc.) which use a watermark encoder to encode (e.g., embed) a watermark in the media prior to the media being provided to (e.g., transmitted to) a media presentation device (e.g., television). Some media is produced by television stations (e.g., C-SPAN) which do not utilize a watermark encoder to encode watermarks into the media. The non-encoded media may be identified (e.g., monitored) through a signature (e.g., fingerprinting) technique.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The media measurement entity (e.g., audience measurement service) provides the service of accurately reporting television viewing behavior for individuals. As used herein, for metered media devices (e.g., set-boxes, televisions, etc.), tuning of the media device to a television station and causing the media broadcast by that television station to be presented is credited as Homes Using Television (HUT) and is a factor in television ratings calculations. If a television station broadcasts watermarked media, then the media measurement entity credits presentation of the media to the television station. However, if the television does not broadcast watermarked media, the media measurement entity may be unable to credit the broadcast media to the correct station. In examples disclosed herein, for broadcast media that is not watermarked, the media measurement entity is able to use device mapping information to correlate the source of the signal to the television, and in cases where the device primarily provides a linear television feed, the media measurement entity is able to credit the media as All Other Tuning (AOT) which is a subset of Homes-Using-Television (HUT). Other activities occurring on the metered television such as game console usage or internet usage are not credited as HUT and are credited as Non-Homes-Using-Television (Non-HUT).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, media that is presented on a media presentation device may be classified (e.g., credited, labeled) in one of at least two media exposure classification groups (HUT and Non-HUT). A first classification group is media that is associated with a Television Station, which is referred to herein as Homes-Using-Television (HUT). In some examples, a HUT station is a linear TV station which means there is a relationship between when the media is produced, and when the media is presented by the media presentation device. For example, a sports broadcast may be occurring in &#x201c;real-time&#x201d; which is substantially live, but accounts for transmissions delays. In some examples, the sports broadcast may be delayed by a number of seconds, but the media presented corresponds to the media feed generated by filming the players on the field.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, &#x201c;non-linear&#x201d; means there is no relationship between when media is produced and when the media is presented. For example, a non-linear television feed may be a Video-On-Demand feed wherein the media may be produced in April and presented in May.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Within HUT, media is to be credited to a particular TV station (e.g., HBO, Disney channel. Food Network, etc.). However, some media is unable to be identified with watermarks, but is associated with a television broadcast, even if the specific, particular TV station is unknown. This media is credited (classified, labeled, etc.) as All-Other-Tuning (AOT), which is a catch-all classification for monitored television broadcast for which the television station is unknown. AOT is a subset of HUT. As used herein, AOT may refer to media that is associated with a television station, wherein the media does not have either watermarks (e.g., codes) or reference signatures to identify the media. Certain television stations (e.g., C-SPAN) do not use watermark encoding to encode media nor provide the media to a signature-generating service to generate reference signatures. Media produced by these certain television stations may be classified (credited, labeled, etc.) as AOT. As used herein, AOT may refer to a first media exposure category.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Some media source devices are able to tune to (e.g., provide access to) and present (or enable a connected presentation device, such as a television to present) a linear television feed. Such source devices include an over-the-air antenna, a cable, a satellite set top box, a television with direct cable access, etc. These source devices are a first type of source. The first type of source is associated with presenting of a linear television feed, wherein a creditor may determine that the media presented is to be classified (e.g., credited, labeled) as AOT (which is a subset of HUT).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A second media exposure classification group is media that is not associated with a television, which is referred to herein as Non-HUT. Some source devices are unlikely (or unable) to present a television station. These source devices include a DVD player, video game console, etc. Such sources are a second type of source. In some examples, Non-HUT refers to a second media exposure category which is to be excluded from the TV media ratings calculation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, a set top box (STB), for the purposes of this disclosure, may be defined as a computerized device that processes digital information. The set top box may come in many forms and can have a variety of functions such as tuning to a television station, and may correspond to a cable box, satellite box, etc. A typical set top box receives encoded/compressed digital signals from the signal source (e.g., the content provider's headend) and decodes/decompresses those signals, converting them into signals that television can process. In some examples, the STB accepts commands from the user (often via the use of remote devices such as a remote control) and transmits these commands back to the network operator through a return path. In some examples, the STB has a return path capability for two-way communication.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">STBs and other sources of the first type can make it possible to receive and display TV signals, connect to networks, play games via a game console, surf the Internet, interact with Interactive Program Guides (IPGs), access virtual channels, transact at electronic storefronts, enter walled gardens, send e-mail, and videoconference. Many STBs are able to communicate in real time with devices such as camcorders, DVD and CD players, portable media devices and music keyboards. Some have large dedicated hard-drives and smart card slots to insert smart cards into for purchases and identification.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Other source devices of the second type are typically unable, or unlikely, to provide access to (e.g., tune to) a linear television feed. Such source devices include a DVD player, some video game consoles, an online media player, etc. Although some versions of those types of source devices may include the capability to tune to (or otherwise provide access to) linear television feeds, that is not the primary use case for those devices and, thus, media presented by such second types of sources is classified (e.g., credited, labeled) as Non-HUT. In examples disclosed herein, the media measurement entity (e.g., audience measurement service) assumes that the media without watermarks presented by devices of the second source type is Non-HUT, even though some sources of the second type could stream or otherwise receive media that relates to media from a television station.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Television service providers may also provide other forms of media that are not typically referred to as broadcast content, such as gambling, Internet content, weather information, and/or shopping. The set top box <b>112</b> may also allow users to view a mosaic screen of several channels, a programming guide screen, and/or video-on-demand (VOD) services, each of which, if detected, provides a rich source of viewing habit information to an advertisement measurement company.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Meters that are installed on-site in a panelist home may detect possible embedded watermarks, and/or match generated signatures which represent the media to reference signatures for media presented on a media presentation device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The media measurement entity then determines to either credit the media to the correct television station (HUT), credit the content as AOT after correlation with the source information (the source information being a determination if the source is a first type of source or a second type of source) or credit the media as Non-HUT. However, for meters that are unable to detect sources, such as a non-source detection meter, the same media (e.g., non-encoded, non-watermarked television media) that would be classified (e.g., credited, labeled) as AOT (a subset of HUT) with a source detection meter, would be classified as Non-HUT which is neither AOT nor HUT. As such, first media could be credited to a first media exposure category based on media crediting data from a first media meter, while that same first media could be credited to a second media exposure category based on media crediting data from a second media meter. Disclosed examples reduce-% resolve such a discrepancy such that the same first media can be credited to the correct media exposure category, regardless of the meter used to monitor presentation of the first media. For example, disclosed solutions are able to credit non-monitored non-encoded media as AOT regardless of whether a source detection meter or a non-source detection meter is used to monitor presentation of the non-monitored non-encoded media.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Media measurement meters (also referred to herein as audience measurement meters, media meters, meters, etc. may be implemented by any meter (e.g., a set meter, an active/passive (A/P) meter, a meter within a set top box (STB), a portable people meter (PPM), portable metering via wireless telephones, portable metering via tablets, etc.) capable of measuring media selections presented on the media presentation device. The media measurement meter collects tuning data from devices, such as set top boxes, video game devices, video cassette recorders (VCRs), digital video recorders (DVRs) and/or digital versatile disk (DVD) players. The media measurement meter may be associated with any type of panel, such as a national people meter (NPM) panel, a local people meter (LPM) panel, households with third party monitoring entities (e.g., Experian&#xae;), and/or any other geographic area of interest. The media measurement meter may monitor which station is tuned, a corresponding time-of-day in which the station is tuned, a duration (e.g., number of minutes) the station is tuned, and/or to identify media associated with the tuned station (e.g., identify a program, an advertisement, etc.). Audience measurement data captured by the media measurement meter may include tuning information, signatures, codes (e.g., embedded into or otherwise broadcast with broadcast media).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Data collected by media measurement meter may be stored in a memory and transmitted via one or more networks, such as the Internet, to a data store managed by the market research entity (e.g., The Nielsen Company (US), LLC). Typically, such data is aggregated with data collected from a large number monitored panelist households. Such collected and/or aggregated data may be further processed to determine statistics associated with household behavior in one or more geographic regions of interest (e.g., designated market area (DMA) of interest). An example DMA of interest may be a city, a state, a time zone, a country, or another measure of geographical or numerical size as it pertains to monitoring media activity. In some examples, a DMA of interest spans millions of homes, wherein a human being is unable to detect watermarks, generate and compare signatures, and credit television stations for the millions of homes in a reasonable amount of time. The examples disclosed herein are a technical solution to a problem, unable to be reasonably completed by humans in the human mind or with pen and paper. Household behavior statistics may include, but are not limited to, a number of minutes a household media device was tuned to a particular station, a number of minutes a household media device was used (e.g., presenting media) by a household panelist member and/or one or more visitors, and demographics of an audience (which may be statistically projected based on the panelist data).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, media monitoring information (or media crediting data) may include generated signatures, detected watermarks, time stamps, source information, etc.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, a source detection meter is a media measurement meter that is able to detect the source (e.g., line, input, signal) of the media feed that is presented on the media presentation device. For example, a source detection meter may determine which one of a set of possible sources (e.g., STB, DVD player, game console, internal TV tuner, etc.) is actively providing media to the media presentation device for presentation. Examples of source detection meters include, but are not limited to, Nielsen's Global Television Audience Measurement (GTAM) meter, Nielsen's Active/Passive (A/P) meter, etc. As used herein, a non-source detection meter is a media measurement meter that is unable to detect the source (e.g., line, input, signal) of the media feed that is presented on the media presentation device. Examples of non-source detection meters include, but are not limited to, Nielsen's Nano meter, Nielsen's Code Reader meter.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Example source detection meters and non-source detection meter are able to detect audio watermarks (also reference to as audio codes) embedded in received audio signals. One or more detected audio watermarks may be stored in example memory to facilitate periodic, scheduled, aperiodic and/or manual transfer to the example data collection facility via the example data transmitter. The embedded audio watermarks may identify a television program or television station being presented by the example media device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some examples, a source detection meter or a non-source detection meter may employ a signature generator in place of or in addition to a watermark reader (e.g., code reader, watermark detector) to generate media signatures. Media signatures are a representation of one or more characteristics of the media signal (e.g., a characteristic of the frequency spectrum of the signal). Signatures can be thought of as fingerprints. Signatures are typically not dependent upon insertion of identification codes in the media, but instead preferably reflect an inherent characteristic of the media and/or the media signal. Systems to utilize codes and/or signatures for audience measurement are long known. See, for example, Thomas, U.S. Pat.
