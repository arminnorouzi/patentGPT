No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any non-claimed element as essential.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) is used in the treatment of neuro endocrine tumors, prostate, breast, renal, pancreatic, and other cancers. In the coming years, approximately 70,000 patients per year will need no carrier added Lu-177 during their medical treatments. Lu-177 is useful for many medical applications, because during decay it emits a low energy beta particle that is suitable for treating tumors. It also emits two gamma rays that can be used for diagnostic testing. Isotopes with both treatment and diagnostic characteristics are termed &#x201c;theranostic.&#x201d; Not only is Lu-177 theranostic, it also has a 6.65-day half-life, which allows for more complicated chemistries to be employed, as well as allowing for easy global distribution. Lu-177 also exhibits chemical properties that allow for binding to many bio molecules, for use in a wide variety of medical treatments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There are two main production pathways to produce Lu-177. One is via a neutron capture reaction on Lu-176; Lu-176 (n,&#x3b3;) Lu-177. This production method is referred to as carrier added (ca) Lu-177. A carrier is an isotope(s) of the same element (Lu-176 in this case), or similar element, in the same chemical form as the isotope of interest. In microchemistry the chemical element or isotope of interest does not chemically behave as expected due to extremely low concentrations. In addition to this, isotopes of the same element cannot be chemically separated, and require mass separation techniques. The carrier method, therefore, results in the produced Lu-177 having limited medical application.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The second production method for Lu-177 is a neutron capture reaction on ytterbium-176 (Yb-176) (Yb-176(n,&#x3b3;)Yb-177) to produce Yb-177. Yb-177 then rapidly (tin of 1.911 hours) beta-decays into Lu-177. An impurity of Yb-174 is typically present in the Yb-176, leading to a further impurity of Lu-175 in the final product. This process is considered to be a &#x201c;no carrier added&#x201d; process. The process may be carried out as ytterbium metal or ytterbium oxide.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure describes a process for the separation of Yb and Lu obtained from a no carrier added process. The process includes a distillation/sublimation process to purify the lutetium and remove excess Yb after irradiation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The separation of Yb and Lu may, at least partially, take advantage of the difference in their vapor pressure at a particular temperature and pressure. As an example, the boiling point of Yb is 1196&#xb0; C., while that of Lu is 3402&#xb0; C. at standard temperature and pressure. The difference in vapor pressures at a specified temperature and pressure can be used to separate Yb and Lu via sublimation and/or distillation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a T-x-y diagram for lutetium and ytterbium at a constant pressure of 1 &#x3bc;Torr. In the figure, the lower line (i.e. bubble point) represents the condensed phase composition at a given temperature, while the upper line (i.e. dew) represents the vapor phase. The graph was prepared using the Ideal gas and Ideal solution assumptions, which are valid in view of the low pressure, high temperature, and chemical similarity of the two components.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In sublimation, the solid phase of an element is converted directly to the gas phase via heating, and the gas phase can then be collected for later use. In distillation, the solid is heated to its boiling point (going through the liquid phase) and vaporized off. The vaporized fraction can then be recovered downstream after the vapor is condensed. In this case, the ytterbium is vaporized (and it may be collected downstream for later use) leaving behind a material that is enriched in lutetium. This may be conducted on larger scale, therefore increasing the amount of lutetium available. It is noted that the Yb that is collected is available for recycling to the reactor to produce further Lu in subsequent runs of the process.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The distillation/sublimation apparatus generally includes a high vacuum chamber with appropriate gas, cooling, vacuum, power and instrument feedthroughs. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the apparatus <b>100</b> has an appropriate volume to contain a refractory crucible <b>190</b> suspended or supported within an RF induction heating coil <b>170</b>, and a cold-finger <b>160</b> with collection substrate. The cold finger (cooling rod) <b>160</b> with an appropriate end effector is disposed directly above the crucible <b>190</b> and is capable of movement which allows the open end of the crucible to be open to the vacuum system or sealed against the collection substrate. The apparatus has appropriate instrumentation to monitor the vacuum pressure of the chamber <b>140</b>, the temperature of the crucible <b>180</b>, and the temperature of the cold plate <b>120</b>. The apparatus <b>100</b> is housed within a chamber <b>105</b> having an access port <b>110</b> to the crucible. The apparatus <b>100</b> also includes a vacuum pump connection <b>150</b> and at least one port <b>200</b> for inert gas introduction.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Generally, the process of the initial purification by distillation and/or sublimation proceeds as follows. An enriched Yb-176 metal target is packaged into a 1 cm diameter quartz tube with sealed ends. The quartz tube is then sealed in an inert overpack (e.g. aluminum) suitable for irradiation and impervious to water or air ingress. The sealed overpack is placed within the reactor and irradiated for several hours to several days (dependent on flux and batch requirements) to generate Lu-177 within the Yb-176 target. After irradiation, the irradiated Yb metal target is removed within an inert environment and placed inside a refractory metal crucible (e.g. molybdenum or tantalum), and placed in a vacuum chamber where the pressure is reduced. The crucible is then heated by radiofrequency (RF) induction. As the Yb metal sublimates from the heated crucible it is deposited onto the cold finger that is actively cooled for collection. As the sublimation advances, the crucible is heated to a higher temperature. At this stage of the process, the generated lutetium or lutetium oxide, minute quantities of ytterbium or ytterbium oxide, and trace contaminants remain in the crucible. The contents of the crucible, including the lutetium, are then dissolved in an acid to remove them from the crucible and for transfer to a chromatographic separation apparatus.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, in a first aspect, a method is provided for purifying lutetium. The method includes providing a solid composition that include lutetium and ytterbium, and subliming or distilling ytterbium from the solid composition at a reduced pressure and at a temperature of about 400&#xb0; C. to about 3000&#xb0; C. to leave a lutetium composition comprising a higher weight percentage of lutetium than was present in the solid composition. As noted, the ytterbium that is sublimed/distilled from the solid composition may be recycled as additional target material for irradiation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to various embodiments, the temperature for sublimation and/or distillation may be from about 450&#xb0; C. to about 1500&#xb0; C., or from about 450&#xb0; C. to about 1200&#xb0; C. Also, according to various embodiments, the pressure may be from about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>to about 1520 torr. In other embodiments, the temperature may be from about 450&#xb0; C. to about 1500&#xb0; C. and the pressure from about 2000 torr to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>torr; or the temperature may be from about 450&#xb0; C. to about 1200&#xb0; C., and the pressure about 1000 torr to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>torr. In some embodiments, the separation includes distillation of the ytterbium from the solid composition, where the pressure may be from about 1 torr to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>torr and the temperature about 450&#xb0; C. to about 800&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the separation includes distillation of the ytterbium from the solid composition, where the pressure may be from about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>torr to about 1000 torr and the temperature about 600&#xb0; C. to about 1500&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the separation includes distillation of the ytterbium from the solid composition, where the pressure may be from about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>torr to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>torr and the temperature about 470&#xb0; C. to about 630&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, a temperature ramp rate may be employed to avoid blistering or uneven heating of the subject Yb sample containing the lutetium, and to evaporate and remove other contaminates within the subject Yb sample. In some embodiments, temperature ramp rates over a period of 10 minutes to 2 hours may be employed to ensure no blistering or uneven heating of the subject Yb sample containing the lutetium. The temperature of the sample may be monitored indirectly through the crucible. In other embodiments, prior to heating of the crucible a vacuum is established to degas the sample. This vacuum may be about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>torr for approximately 5 minutes to 1 hour. A turbomolecular pump may be used to achieve high vacuum levels.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The time period required for the subliming and/or distilling steps may vary widely and is dependent upon the amount of material in the sample, the temperature, and the pressure. It may vary from about 1 second to about 1 week. In some embodiments, it is a rate of sublimation or distillation that is pertinent to the question of time. It may, in some embodiments, be at a rate of about 1 min/g (minute/gram) to about 10 hr/g (hours/gram) of solid composition, or about about 10 min/g to about 100 min/g of solid composition, or about 20 min/g to about 60 min/g of solid composition. In one embodiment, the rate may be about 40 min/g of solid composition.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The sublimation/distillation process yields a sample (&#x201c;the lutetium composition&#x201d;) that is enriched in lutetium as compared to the solid composition that enters the process. The yields and purity may be measured in a number of ways. For example, in some embodiments, the process yields an ytterbium mass reduction of the solid composition from 10:1 to 10,000:1. In other words, after the sublimation/distillation is completed, there is 10 to 10,000 times less ytterbium in the sample than prior to the process. In the lutetium composition that is recovered (i.e. the contents in the crucible that is subjected to the acid dissolution), there may, in some embodiments, be about 1 wt % to 99.9 wt % of ytterbium relative to total remaining mass. In some further embodiments, there may be about 1 wt % to 90 wt % of ytterbium relative to total remaining mass. In other embodiments, the ytterbium that is collected from the sublimation/distillation is collected in an amount that is about 90 wt % to about 99.999 wt % of the ytterbium present in the solid composition. The purification steps are also conducted to remove other trace metals and contaminants. For example, materials such as metals, metal oxides, or metal ions of K, Na, Ca, Fe, Al, Si, Ni, Cu, Pb, La, Ce, Lu (non-radioactive), Eu, Sn, Er, and Tm may be removed. Stated another way, a method includes subjecting a sample comprising Yb-176 and Lu-177 to sublimation, distillation, or a combination thereof to remove at least a portion of the Yb-176 from the sample and form a Lu-177-enriched sample.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It has been observed that a purification of greater than 1000:1 reduction (i.e. a 1000 times reduction in the amount of Yb present) in Yb may be achieved. This includes greater than approximately 3000:1, greater than 8000:1, greater than 10,000:1, up to and including approximately 40,000:1. However, higher reductions in Yb may be required to meet purity requirements for some pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, additional purification may be conducted prior to use in pharmaceutical applications.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention, thus generally described, will be understood more readily by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">General.
