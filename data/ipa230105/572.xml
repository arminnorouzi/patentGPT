No. 13/839,967, filed Mar. 15, 2013 and entitled &#x201c;VASCULAR REMOTE CATHETER MANIPULATOR.&#x201d; The entirety of which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Robotic interventional systems and devices are well suited for performing minimally invasive medical procedures as opposed to conventional techniques wherein the patient's body cavity is open to permit the surgeon's hands access to internal organs. Advances in technology have led to significant changes in the field of medical surgery such that less invasive surgical procedures, in particular, minimally invasive surgery (MIS), are increasingly popular.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">MIS is generally defined as surgery that is performed by entering the body through the skin, a body cavity, or an anatomical opening utilizing small incisions rather than large, open incisions in the body. With MIS, it is possible to achieve less operative trauma for the patient, reduced hospitalization time, less pain and scarring, reduced incidence of complications related to surgical trauma, lower costs, and a speedier recovery.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">MIS devices and techniques have advanced to the point where an elongated catheter instrument is controllable by selectively operating tensioning control elements within the catheter instrument. In one example, a remote catheter manipulator (RCM) or robotic instrument driver utilizes four opposing directional control elements which extend to the distal end of the catheter. When selectively placed in and out of tension, the opposing directional control elements may cause the distal end to steerably maneuver within the patient. Control motors are coupled to each of the directional control elements so that they may be individually controlled and the steering effectuated via the operation of the motors in unison.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At least two types of catheters may be employed for surgical procedures. One type includes an electrophysiology (EP) catheter that only requires a navigating distance of 15 cm or less. EP catheters also may be relatively thick and stiff and thus, due their short navigating length and high stiffness, EP catheters typically do not suffer from a tendency to buckle during use.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In comparison to EP procedures, vascular procedures include a greater amount of catheter insertion length, a greater number of catheter articulation degrees of freedom (DOFs), and a mechanism for manipulation of a guide wire. For that reason, known bedside systems provides mounting for splayer actuation hardware configured to provide the catheter insertion lengths, mounting which accounts for an increase in splayer size due to added DOFs, and mounting for a guide wire manipulator. Thus, vascular catheters typically include a relatively long stroke, such as one meter or more. Relative to EP catheters, vascular catheters are typically smaller, thinner and more flexible, and therefore have a greater tendency to buckle than EP catheters. As such, it is typically desirable to feed vascular catheters into the patient with minimal bending to reduce the tendency to buckle. Known vascular robotic catheter systems are therefore typically suspended over the patient that is lying prone on a bed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A vascular catheter (elongate member) catheter system typically includes elongate members that include an outer catheter (sheath), an inner catheter (leader), and a guidewire. Each is separately controllable and therefore they can telescope with respect to one another. For instance, a sheath carriage controls operation of the sheath and is moveable about a generally axial motion along the patient, and a leader carriage controls operation of the guidewire and is likewise moveable about the generally axial direction of the patient. Typically, the leader carriage and the sheath carriage are positioned on a remote catheter manipulator (RCM), which is supported by a setup joint (SUJ). Because the sheath carriage and leader carriage are traditionally aligned along the insertion axis, this configuration results in the RCM taking up significant space and the RCM being restricted to a specific orientation and alignment based on the insertion location. The SUJ is typically positioned on a rail that is itself mounted to the bed, below which the patient is positioned.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The RCM typically carries the weight of both carriages as well as the other hardware that are used to operate the system. And, to provide a full stroke, the SUJ is passed through the full range of motion which, as stated, can exceed one meter. To do so, typically the SUJ is moved or rotated with respect to the rail and the rail is stationary. For this reason, a bedside system is typically included that provides mounting for splayer actuation hardware configured to provide catheter insertion lengths, and mounting for a guide wire manipulator. Because this hardware is supported by the SUJ, the system can not only be cumbersome to work with, but it can interfere with other system operation (such as the C-arm and monitors), as well as provide significant weight that is carried by the bed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in some clinical situations, it is difficult, if not impossible to orient the RCM such that it is aligned along the insertion axis. For instance, in some MIS procedures an imaging device may be required in addition to the RCM. In order for the imaging device to scan the entire body, the RCM should be oriented so that it is not obstructing the imaging devices ability to capture the entire body. For example, if the insertion location is at the patient's thigh and catheter is directed towards the patient's heart, the current RCM configuration would require the RCM to be located at the base of the patient's bed below their feet. The likelihood of the catheter buckling between the RCM and the insertion location also increases as the distance between the RCM and the insertion location increases and often requires more than one person to assist in operation of the RCM, especially during tool exchanges.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As such, there is a need for an improved catheter system that can handle functional challenges experienced with long catheters and provides greater flexibility with regard to the orientation of the RCM with regard to the insertion axis. There is also a need to for an improved catheter system that operates over a smaller footprint and weighs less.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A medical device comprising a sheath catheter and at least one feed mechanism is disclosed herein. The feed mechanism includes a pair of radially arranged drive wheels opposite one another, each wheel having a wheel rotation axis. The drive wheels cooperate to define a feed axis along which the sheath catheter is advanced and retracted. The feed axis is oriented generally orthogonal to the wheel rotation axes.

System <b>100</b> may include a robotic catheter assembly <b>102</b> having a sheath instrument <b>104</b> and/or a catheter instrument <b>106</b>. Catheter assembly <b>102</b> is controllable using a robotic instrument driver <b>108</b> (generally referred to as &#x201c;instrument driver&#x201d;). During use, a patient is positioned on an operating table or surgical bed <b>110</b> to which robotic instrument driver <b>108</b> is coupled or mounted. In the illustrated example, system <b>100</b> includes an operator workstation <b>112</b>, an electronics rack <b>114</b> including a control system, such as a computer (not shown). In some instances, a setup joint mounting brace <b>116</b> may be used to support the robotic catheter assembly <b>102</b>. In certain procedures, a surgeon is seated at operator workstation <b>112</b> and can monitor the surgical procedure, patient vitals, and control one or more catheter devices.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Operator workstation <b>112</b> may include a computer monitor to display a three dimensional object, such as a catheter displayed within or relative to a three dimensional space, such as a body cavity or organ, e.g., a chamber of a patient's heart. In one example, an operator uses one or more input devices <b>120</b> to control the position of a catheter or other elongate instrument. In response to actuation of the input device by a user, the input device can output positioning information for the desired position of the catheter instrument, including the three-dimensional spatial position of the distal end of a steerable catheter. System components, including the operator workstation, electronics rack and the instrument driver, may be coupled together via a plurality of cables or other suitable connectors <b>118</b> to provide for data communication, or one or more components may be equipped with wireless communication components to reduce or eliminate cables <b>118</b>. Communication between components may also be implemented over a network or over the internet. In this manner, a surgeon or other operator may control a surgical instrument while located away from or remotely from radiation sources. Because of the option for wireless or networked operation, the surgeon may even be located remotely from the patient in a different room or building.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An exemplary instrument driver <b>108</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The instrument driver <b>108</b> may robotically insert/retract a leader catheter <b>103</b> relative to a sheath catheter <b>105</b>. To this end, the proximal ends of sheath catheter <b>105</b> and leader catheter <b>103</b> are mechanically interfaced to a housing of the instrument driver <b>108</b> in such a manner that the sheath and leader catheters <b>105</b>, <b>103</b> may be axially translated relative to each other via operation of motors, thereby effecting insertion or retraction movements of the respective sheath catheter <b>105</b> and leader catheter <b>103</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the sheath catheter <b>105</b> and leader catheter <b>103</b> respectively include proximal steering adapters <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> (&#x201c;splayers&#x201d;) mounted to associated mounting plates <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> on a top portion of the instrument driver <b>108</b>. The mounting plate <b>202</b> is affixed to the distal end of the instrument driver <b>108</b>, whereas the mounting plate <b>204</b> is affixed to a carriage (not shown) within the housing of the instrument driver <b>108</b> that can be translated relative to the mounting plate <b>202</b> via one or more motors (not shown) within the housing of the instrument driver <b>1</b>, thereby allowing the splayer <b>106</b> to be translated relative to the splayer <b>104</b>, and thus, the associated leader catheter <b>103</b> to be inserted/retracted within the sheath catheter <b>105</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, each of the splayers <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> can be actuated via motors (not shown) within the housing of the instrument driver <b>108</b> to deflect or articulate the distal ends of the respective catheters <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> in any direction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is desirable to have the instrument driver <b>108</b> positioned close to the patient for a number of reasons, including, for example to facilitate tool removal over the table <b>110</b> rather than risk tools falling to the floor. However, the instrument drivers <b>108</b> are generally heavy, due to the internal components required to advance and articulate the catheters. Moreover, for procedures where a relatively long stroke of a catheter is used, the instrument driver <b>108</b> has a sufficient length to operate the catheter system. Thus, known systems use a setup joint <b>116</b> to support the instrument driver <b>108</b> close to the patient. The positioning of the instrument driver <b>108</b> on the setup joint, however, may lead to other issues, such as blocking intra-operative imaging equipment, such as a C-arm or monitor (not shown).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, certain issues are experienced when tool exchanges are required during a procedure. For example, therapeutic tools are inserted into the sheath catheter <b>105</b>. To accomplish this task, the guide catheter <b>103</b> is removed from the sheath catheter <b>105</b>. A separate guide wire (not shown) is also included, but the tool is advanced over the guide wire for delivery, which takes two people.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">To address some of these issues, alternative arrangements of the guide and sheath splayers are proposed herein, which serve to minimize the length and weight of the instrument driver, thereby eliminating the requirement of a SUJ, and even permitting the instrument driver to be mounted directly to a bed rail. Moreover, the exemplary arrangements disclosed herein also provide for positioning of the instrument driver close to the patient, thus permitting the instrument driver to be positioned adjacent an introducer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a first exemplary configuration will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a schematic plan view of an exemplary configuration of an instrument driver <b>308</b>. A guide splayer <b>306</b> and a sheath splayer <b>304</b> are operatively mounted to the instrument drive <b>308</b>. Guide splayer <b>306</b> is mounted on a carriage <b>313</b> that can translate relative to sheath splayer <b>304</b>. Operatively connected to the guide splayer <b>306</b> is a guide catheter <b>303</b>, and operatively connected to the sheath splayer <b>304</b> is a sheath catheter <b>305</b>. The carriage <b>313</b> inserts the guide catheter <b>303</b> into the sheath catheter <b>305</b>. A guide wire <b>307</b> may extend proximally of the guide splayer <b>306</b> and further include a guide wire manipulator <b>309</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, sheath splayer <b>304</b> and guide splayer <b>306</b> are arranged to be generally aligned along a common axis A-A. In this manner, the guide catheter <b>303</b> is positioned within the sheath catheter <b>305</b>, such that the guide catheter <b>303</b> and the sheath catheter <b>305</b> are arranged in a coaxial manner. Although splayers <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> are axially aligned, movement of guide catheter <b>303</b> and catheter sheath <b>305</b> can be controlled and manipulated independently, as will be explained in further detail below. The instrument driver <b>308</b> articulates guide and sheath splayer driveshafts by motors positioned in the rear of the instrument driver <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the exemplary arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, as the sheath catheter <b>305</b> exits the sheath splayer <b>304</b>, the sheath catheter <b>305</b> is positioned within a manipulator or feed mechanism <b>330</b>. This manipulator <b>330</b> may be configured to advance, retract or roll sheath catheter <b>305</b>. It may also be configured to orientate the sheath catheter <b>305</b> such that it bends 180 into the feed mechanism <b>330</b>. More specifically, the mechanism <b>330</b> is oriented such that an axis B-B extending through the mechanism <b>330</b> is generally parallel with the axis A-A along which the sheath and guide splayers <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> are arranged. The sheath catheter <b>305</b> exits the mechanism <b>330</b> and can be directed into an introducer <b>335</b>. This configuration permits a compact design, which can reduce the required length of the instrument driver <b>308</b>, and also allow for easy draping of the surgical system. Surgical draping is in reference to the use of a curtain, bag, cloth or other acceptable sterile items that may be utilized to separate a sterile area from an unsterile area. It is advantageous to be able to place a surgical drape over items that are difficult to clean or items that need to be in the sterile field but are not sterile. By placing a surgical drape over these items, these items are prevented from coming into contact with sterile items. For example, the instrument driver <b>308</b> contains delicate and sensitive parts, so by placing a surgical drape over the instrument driver <b>308</b>, it will not come into contact with blood or other contaminating materials and may not require cleaning.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the manipulator mechanism <b>330</b> includes two radially oppositely arranged drive wheels <b>340</b>. The drive wheels <b>340</b> may include an idle wheel <b>342</b> and an active wheel <b>344</b>. The drive wheels <b>340</b> are each configured to rotate about an axes C-C that are orthogonal to the feed mechanism axis B-B. In one exemplary arrangement, the feed mechanism <b>330</b> may be fixedly connected to the instrument driver <b>308</b>, along a side surface of the instrument driver <b>308</b>. This configuration permits the feed mechanism to be placed next to the axis A-A so as to minimize wasted catheter length. As the drive wheels <b>340</b> are rotated in a first direction, the feed mechanism <b>330</b> serves to propel the sheath catheter <b>305</b>, the guide catheter <b>303</b> inserted therein, and the guide wire <b>307</b> toward the patient. As the drive wheels <b>340</b> are rotated in a second direction, the catheter assembly is moved away from the patient. A similar manipulator mechanism (not shown) disposed within the instrument driver <b>308</b> proximal of the sheath splayer <b>304</b> serves to propel guide catheter <b>303</b>. This manipulation may also involve insertion retraction or roll of the guide catheter relative to the sheath. In addition, a similar manipulator mechanism (not shown) disposed within the instrument driver <b>308</b> proximal of the leader splayer <b>306</b>, or disposed proximal of instrument driver <b>308</b> (as shown) serves to propel the guide wire <b>307</b>. It should be understood that sheath catheter <b>305</b>, guide catheter <b>303</b> and guide wire <b>307</b> may all be manipulated independently from each other. Manipulation may involve insertion, retraction and roll for all 3 manipulators but preferred embodiments involve just insertion and retract for the sheath and guide manipulators and insertion, retraction and roll for the guidewire manipulator. It should be understood that while drive wheels are shown for the sheath manipulator <b>330</b> and a gripping pad <b>309</b> is shown for the guidewire manipulator, any active drive or manipulation device such as rotating pads, grippers, rollers, chucks etc. may be used in all cases</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one alternative embodiment, the manipulator <b>330</b> may be configured to pitch with respect to the drive wheels axes C-C, while the sheath splayer <b>304</b> and guide splayer <b>306</b> remain generally level with respect to the table <b>110</b>.

A guide wire <b>507</b> may extend proximally of the guide splayer <b>506</b> and further include a guide wire manipulator <b>560</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The configuration of the instrument driver <b>508</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> differs from the arrangements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref> in that the guide splayer <b>506</b> and the sheath splayer <b>504</b> are arranged parallel to one another, as opposed to in-line with one another. In addition, the guide splayer <b>506</b> does not translate relative to sheath splayer <b>504</b>. The guide catheter <b>503</b> bends 180&#xb0; and feeds into the sheath splayer <b>504</b> by a guide manipulator mechanism <b>550</b> that is disposed at the entrance of the sheath splayer <b>504</b>.

The guidewire manipulator <b>560</b> may also be configured to insert, retract and roll a guidewire. It should be understood that the feed roller embodiment of the guidewire manipulator <b>560</b> shown here and the gripper embodiment <b>409</b> shown above are representative embodiments of active drive manipulators.

Reducing the size of the instrument driver <b>508</b> lends itself to a simple surgical drape of the catheter system.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The configuration of a catheter system with three different manipulator mechanisms <b>540</b>, <b>550</b>, <b>560</b> also allows the guide wire <b>507</b>, guide catheter <b>503</b> and/or the sheath catheter <b>505</b> to be propelled or held in place individually. More specifically, the sheath mechanism <b>540</b> may be configured to insert, retract or roll the sheath catheter <b>505</b>. The guide mechanism <b>550</b> inserts, retracts or rolls the guide catheter <b>503</b> and the guide wire mechanism <b>560</b> inserts, retracts or rolls guidewire <b>507</b>. Thus, the combination of the three feed mechanisms <b>540</b>, <b>550</b>, and <b>560</b> allows the guide wire <b>507</b>, sheath catheter <b>505</b>, and/or guide catheter <b>503</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) to be propelled or held in place individually, altering the shape of the catheter system relative to a tip of the guide wire <b>507</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In such fashion and in one example, a robotic instrument driver for elongate members <b>508</b> includes a first elongate member <b>505</b>, and at least one manipulator mechanism <b>540</b> configured to manipulate the first elongate member <b>505</b>, and at least one articulating drive <b>504</b> configured to articulate the first elongate member <b>505</b>, positionable on a bed <b>110</b> and beside a patient access site, wherein the manipulator <b>540</b> and articulating drive <b>504</b> are positioned relative to each other a distance less than the insertable length of the first elongate member, stationary in position.

However, the instrument driver <b>608</b> includes a combined sheath splayer <b>604</b>/guide splayer <b>606</b>, which are oriented in a parallel manner creating an S-shape catheter configuration similar to that which is shown and discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a further exemplary arrangement of for an instrument driver <b>708</b> will now be described. Instrument driver <b>708</b> is similar to the configuration of instrument driver <b>608</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and may include corresponding features identified with reference numerals in the <b>700</b> series. The instrument driver <b>708</b> has the guide splayer <b>706</b> and sheath splayer <b>704</b> stacked on top of one another. Stacking the guide splayer <b>706</b> on top of the sheath splayer <b>704</b> may further reduce the size of the instrument driver <b>708</b> as compared to other configurations. The guider catheter <b>703</b>, as it exits the guide splayer <b>706</b>, bends approximately 180&#xb0; to where it is received by the sheath manipulator mechanism <b>750</b> and directed into the sheath splayer <b>704</b>, orienting the guide catheter <b>703</b> in a generally vertical C-shape guide. The catheter sheath <b>705</b> exits the sheath splayer <b>704</b> and bends approximately 180&#xb0; to where it is received by the sheath mechanism <b>740</b>, orienting the catheter sheath <b>705</b> in a generally horizontal C-shape.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref>, an exemplary process for removing guide <b>503</b> or any other tool robotically or manually from the sheath catheter <b>505</b> will now be explained. For ease of description, the configuration of the instrument driver <b>508</b> will be used to explain the tool exchange process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-C</figref> illustrate the instrument driver <b>508</b> including guide or tool <b>503</b> connected to the guide splayer <b>506</b>, sheath splayer <b>504</b>, catheter manipulator mechanism <b>540</b> and tool (guide) manipulator mechanism <b>550</b> arranged so as to configure the catheter system in a generally S-shape configuration. To remove the guide or tool <b>503</b>, the tool <b>503</b> and the guide wire <b>507</b> are both pulled in unison in direction R. In other words, the guide wire is inserted into the tool or guide at the same rate as the tool or guide is retracted from the sheath. This action will cause the guide wire <b>507</b> to be pulled through the guide splayer <b>506</b>, as indicated by the phantom lines. This results in maintaining the tip of the guidewire in a fixed position relative to the sheath or relative to the patient. Once the guide catheter <b>503</b> is free from the sheath splayer <b>504</b>, clamping or pinching <b>810</b> of the tool (guide) feed mechanism <b>550</b> may be applied to the wire <b>507</b> at the rear of the sheath splayer <b>504</b> to hold the tip of the wire <b>507</b> at the distal end thereof (located in the introducer <b>535</b> and thus not visible). The guide or tool may then be slid along the guide wire <b>507</b>, until the guide or tool <b>503</b> is free from the guide wire <b>507</b>, thereby removing the guide or tool <b>503</b> from the instrument driver <b>508</b>. Once the guide or tool <b>503</b> is removed from the guide wire <b>507</b>, a new tool may be installed over the guide wire <b>507</b>. A similar but opposite sequence of moves enables the new tool to be loaded robotically into the sheath <b>505</b>. This time, the guidewire <b>507</b> is retracted through manipulator <b>560</b> at the same rate as the new tool is inserted through manipulator <b>550</b> resulting in the distal tip of the wire not moving relative to the patient. The ability to change tools may allow the user to perform multiple procedures without having to remove the catheter sheath <b>505</b> from the patient between procedures. For example, a patient may require multiple therapeutic devices to be delivered at the same location. The ability to maintain the tip of the guide wire <b>507</b> at a deployed location in the body after a first tool is delivered allows the user to switch the tool <b>503</b> and insert the second therapeutic device without removing the entire catheter. Using a robotic system to exchange tools enable the tool exchange procedure to be carried out without image guidance such as fluoroscopy. With a manual procedure, the doctor would need to retract the guide with one hand at the same rate as he is inserting the wire with the other hand to ensure the wire tip stays in a fixed position. It is not possible for a human to coordinate movement of both hands reliably with long catheters and so fluoroscopic guidance is used to ensure the wire is not moving. Fluoroscopic imaging exposes doctors and staff to significant radiation.
