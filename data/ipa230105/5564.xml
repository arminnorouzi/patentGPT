id="p-0002" num="0001">As methods for replacing a defective bit line with a spare bit line, a local column redundancy method in which a spare bit line is prepared for each column plane and a global column redundancy method in which a spare column plane is prepared and a defective bit line included in each column plane is replaced with one of bit lines in the spare column plane are known. The local column redundancy method has an advantage that, even when two or more bit lines are defective among a plurality of bit lines belonging to different column planes and selected at the same time with a same column address, these bit lines can be replaced with spare bit lines. However, in the local column redundancy method, if there is one defective bit line, all the bit lines selected at the same time with a column address are replaced with spare bit lines and therefore many spare bit lines need to be prepared. In contrast thereto, the global column redundancy method enables only defective bit lines to be replaced with bit lines in the spare column plane and the recovery efficiency is accordingly high. However, in the global column redundancy method, which bit line among a plurality of bit lines selected at the same time with a same column address is to be replaced with a spare bit line needs to be identified in a test process for detecting defective bit lines, and the test process is complicated. Therefore, simplification of the test process in a semiconductor device according to the global column redundancy method is demanded.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a configuration of a memory cell array according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a configuration of column plane regions according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining a function of a spare column plane according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram for explaining a configuration of a test circuit according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of a data generating circuit according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a truth table of the data generation circuit according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a truth table of an analyzing circuit according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Various embodiments of the present disclosure will be explained below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

The data generating circuit <b>22</b> generates the expected value EXPD based on some of the read data-bits RB<b>0</b> to RB<b>15</b>. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a one-bit expected value EXPD is generated based on read data-bits RB), RB<b>1</b>, RB<b>2</b>, RB<b>6</b>, RB<b>7</b>, RB<b>8</b>, RB<b>12</b>, RB<b>13</b>, and RB<b>14</b> respectively read from the column planes CP<b>0</b>, CP<b>1</b>, CP<b>2</b>, CP<b>6</b>, CP<b>7</b>, CP<b>8</b>, CP<b>12</b>, CP<b>13</b>, and CP<b>14</b>.

The NAND gate circuit G<b>1</b> receives the read data-bits RB<b>0</b>, RB<b>1</b>, and RB<b>2</b> and generates a signal S<b>1</b>, the NAND gate circuit G<b>2</b> receives the read data-bits RB<b>6</b>, RB<b>7</b>, and RB<b>8</b> and generates a signal S<b>2</b>, and the NAND gate circuit G<b>3</b> receives the read data-bits RB<b>12</b>, RB<b>13</b>, and RB<b>14</b> and generates a signal S<b>3</b>. The NAND gate circuit G<b>4</b> receives the signals S<b>1</b> to S<b>3</b> and generates a signal SEL. The multiplexer MUX decides a logic level of the expected value EXPD based on a logic level of the signal SEL. Specifically, the multiplexer MUX outputs the expected value EXPD having a logic level &#x201c;1&#x201d; when the logic level of the signal SEL is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, and outputs the expected value EXPD having a logic level &#x201c;0&#x201d; when the logic level of the signal SEL is &#x201c;0&#x201d;.

That is, the expected value EXPID is decided by a majority voting of the logic levels of the read data-bits RB<b>0</b>, RB<b>1</b>, RB<b>2</b>, RB<b>6</b>, RB<b>7</b>, RB<b>8</b>, RB<b>12</b>, RB<b>13</b>, and RB<b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Therefore, when the expected values of the read data-bits RB<b>0</b> to RB<b>15</b> all have one of logic levels and the likelihood of inclusion of data bits inverted to the other logic level is sufficiently low, the expected value EXPD generated by the data generating circuit <b>22</b> can be considered as an overall expected value of the read data-bits RB<b>0</b> to RB<b>15</b>. As an exception, as indicated by reference sign <b>51</b>, when the three read data-bits input to one of the NAND gate circuits G<b>1</b> to G<b>3</b>, for example, the read data-bits RB<b>0</b>, RB<b>1</b>, and RB<b>2</b> are all inverted to &#x201c;1&#x201d; even if the overall expected value of the read data-bits RB<b>0</b> to RB<b>15</b> is &#x201c;0&#x201d;, the expected value EXPI) generated by the data generating circuit <b>22</b> becomes &#x201c;1&#x201d; and an incorrect expected value EXPD is generated. Furthermore, as indicated by reference sign <b>52</b>, when data bits inverted to &#x201c;0&#x201d; are input to all the NAND gate circuits G<b>1</b> to G<b>3</b> even if the overall expected value of the read data-bits RB<b>0</b> to RB<b>15</b> is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, the expected value EXPID generated by the data generating circuit <b>22</b> becomes &#x201c;0&#x201d; and an incorrect expected value EXPID is generated.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The expected value EXPD generated in this way is compared by the comparing circuit <b>21</b> with each of the read data-bits RB<b>0</b> to RB<b>15</b> of the read data RD. A decision data DD obtained as a result of comparing is input to the analyzing circuit <b>23</b>. The decision data DD is composed of decision-bits DB<b>0</b> to DB<b>15</b> respectively corresponding to the read data-bits RB<b>0</b> to RB<b>15</b>. Each of the decision-bits DB<b>0</b> to DB<b>15</b> has one pass level (for example, &#x201c;O&#x201d;) when the corresponding read data-bits RB<b>0</b> to RB<b>15</b> match with the expected value EXPD, and has a fail level (for example, &#x201c;1&#x201d;) when the corresponding read data-bits RB<b>0</b> to RB<b>15</b> is mismatched (e.g., do not match) with the expected value EXPD. Therefore, the decision-bits DB<b>0</b> to DB<b>15</b> indicate addresses of column planes that have output incorrect read data-bits and the number of the column planes.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a truth table of the analyzing circuit <b>23</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the analyzing circuit <b>23</b> generates the fail-bit data FBD by encoding the decision-bits DB<b>0</b> to DB<b>15</b>. For example, when all the decision-bits DB<b>0</b> to DB<b>15</b> indicate a pass, values of fail-bits BB<b>0</b> to BB<b>5</b> constituting the fail-bit data FBD are &#x201c;000000&#x201d;, which indicates that 16 bit lines selected at the same time are not defective. When only the decision-bit DB<b>0</b> indicates a fail, the values of the fail-bits BB<b>0</b> to BB<b>5</b> constituting the fail-bit data FBD are &#x201c;000001&#x201d;, which indicates that a bit line included in the column plane CP<b>0</b> is defective. Similarly, when only the decision-bit DB<b>1</b> indicates a fail, the values of the fail-bits BB<b>0</b> to BB<b>5</b> constituting the fail-bit data FBD are &#x201c;000010&#x201d;, which indicates that a bit line included in the column plane CP<b>1</b> is defective. In contrast thereto, when two or more of the decision-bits DB<b>0</b> to DB<b>15</b> indicate a fail, the values of the fail-bits BB<b>0</b> to BB<b>5</b> constituting the fail-bit data FBD are &#x201c;110000&#x201d;, which indicates that there are two or more column planes including a defective bit line. In this case, the addresses of the column planes including a defective bit line are not identified.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Detection of defective bit lines is performed in the following procedure. First, a write command is issued from outside to the access control circuit <b>12</b>, and write data having a same logic level are respectively written into the column planes CP<b>0</b> to CP<b>15</b> via bit lines simultaneously selected. Next, a read operation is performed to the same address and a read data RD is read via the bit lines. A part of the read data RD is input to the data generating circuit <b>22</b> and the expected value EXPD is generated based thereon. The expected value EXPD is compared by the comparing circuit <b>21</b> with each of the read data-bits RB<b>0</b> to RB<b>15</b> of the read data RD, and the decision data DD is generated according to comparing results. The decision data DD is converted to the fail-bit data FBD by the analyzing circuit <b>23</b>. The fail-bit data FBD is output to an external tester via an output circuit included in the data control circuit <b>13</b>. The tester analyzes the fail-bit data FBD and writes column addresses corresponding to defective bit lines into the fuse circuit <b>30</b>. Accordingly, when a column address corresponding to a defective bit line is input at the time of a normal read/write operation, the access is performed to a spare bit line included in the column plane CPGCR, instead of the defective bit line.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the value of the fail-bit data FBD is &#x201c;110000&#x201d;, that is, there are two or more column planes including a defective bit line, a recovery using the column plane CPGCR cannot be performed and therefore the device is recovered by a different method or is discarded as a defective product. When the expected value EXPD generated by the data generating circuit <b>22</b> itself includes an error as indicated by reference signs <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, two or more of the decision-bits DB<b>0</b> to DB<b>15</b> certainly indicate a fail and the values of the fail-bit data FBD are &#x201c;110000&#x201d; as in the case described above. That is, even when the expected value EXPD itself includes an error, the impossibility of a recovery using the column plane CPGCR is accurately shown. In this way, the semiconductor device <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment can specify a column plane including a defective bit line without having a circuit that holds expected values. Accordingly, the test process can be more simplified while the circuit scale is reduced.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although this disclosure has been disclosed in the context of certain preferred embodiments and examples, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the disclosures extend beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and/or uses of the disclosures and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof.
