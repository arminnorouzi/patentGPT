been devised to overcome the limitations of the existing means of transportation running on the ground and to travel in the three-dimensional space. Unlike the traditional means of aviation transport including the existing aircrafts and helicopters, those next-generation air mobility devices are being developed to take off and land in various types of space without separate large facility dedicated to take-off and landing.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although next-generation air mobility devices do not require a large separate facility dedicated to take-off and landing, if many air vehicles are distributed, the air vehicles are supposed to operate in a prearranged altitude zone under air control. Although an air vehicle does not require a large separate facility dedicated to take-off and landing, a basic facility, which enables an air vehicle to take off and land, may be needed to control smoothly the movement or operation of the air vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, due to the characteristics of air vehicles, a take-off and landing facility is likely to be constructed in a peripheral region. Considering this condition, a user needs to go to a take-off and landing facility by means of a moving object and the like. Accordingly, a take-off and landing facility may be built up not only for the take-off and landing of air vehicles but also to allow multimodal access of other traffic objects.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure may provide a structure of a multimodal transport system that is capable of effectively realizing a user's transport between multimodal traffic objects in an environment of a take-off and landing facility, which is required for the operation of an air vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also, the present disclosure may provide a method and apparatus for controlling efficiently a traffic service for a user by utilizing a structure of a multimodal transport system that is prepared in a take-off and landing facility.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for providing a multimodal transport service based on an air vehicle may be provided.

present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, which will be easily implemented by those skilled in the art. However, the present disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and is not limited to the embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the following description of the embodiments of the present disclosure, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the present disclosure rather unclear. Parts not related to the description of the present disclosure in the drawings are omitted, and like parts are denoted by similar reference numerals.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the present disclosure, when a component is referred to as being &#x201c;linked&#x201d;, &#x201c;coupled&#x201d;, or &#x201c;connected&#x201d; to another component, it is understood that not only a direct connection relationship but also an indirect connection relationship through an intermediate component may also be included. Also, when a component is referred to as &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; or &#x201c;having&#x201d; another component, it may mean further inclusion of another component not the exclusion thereof, unless explicitly described to the contrary.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the present disclosure, the terms first, second, etc. are used only for the purpose of distinguishing one component from another, and do not limit the order or importance of components, etc. unless specifically stated otherwise. Thus, within the scope of this disclosure, a first component in one exemplary embodiment may be referred to as a second component in another embodiment, and similarly a second component in one exemplary embodiment may be referred to as a first component.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the present disclosure, components that are distinguished from each other are intended to clearly illustrate each feature. However, it does not necessarily mean that the components are separate. That is, a plurality of components may be integrated into one hardware or software unit, or a single component may be distributed into a plurality of hardware or software units. Thus, unless otherwise noted, such integrated or distributed embodiments are also included within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the present disclosure, components described in the various exemplary embodiments are not necessarily essential components, and some may be optional components. Accordingly, exemplary embodiments consisting of a subset of the components described in one embodiment are also included within the scope of the present disclosure. Also, exemplary embodiments that include other components in addition to the components described in the various embodiments are also included in the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Advantages and features of the present disclosure, and methods for achieving them will be apparent with reference to the exemplary embodiments described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present disclosure is not limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein but may be embodied in many different forms. The present exemplary embodiments are provided to make disclosed contents of the present disclosure thorough and complete and to completely convey the scope of the disclosure to those with ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Although exemplary embodiment is described as using a plurality of units to perform the exemplary process, it is understood that the exemplary processes may also be performed by one or plurality of modules. Additionally, it is understood that the term controller/control unit refers to a hardware device that includes a memory and a processor and is specifically programmed to execute the processes described herein. The memory is configured to store the modules and the processor is specifically configured to execute said modules to perform one or more processes which are described further below.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">An aerial vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a system for controlling next-generation aerial mobility devices such as an urban air mobility (UAM) and a personal air vehicle (PAV). When a configuration or operation of an aerial vehicle control system is described according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a personal aerial vehicle is used, but the present disclosure does not limit next-generation aerial mobility devices to personal aerial vehicles, and various next-generation mobility devices may be used.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>C</figref> are views illustrating operation zones for an aerial vehicle used in an aerial vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, an aerial vehicle control system may control movement of an aerial vehicle, particularly to enable the aerial vehicle to move in an aerial vehicle operation zone.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, an aerial vehicle operation zone may be set based on a road zone in which a moving object is operated. Herein, the road zone may be a zone on the ground in which a road is set. Herein, the road may include a driveway, in which a moving object is moved, and a sidewalk zone in which people move. As another example, a road zone may include a road zone and a roadside clear zone, which are set according to a road act.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As an example, an aerial vehicle operation zone may be set as a zone at a predetermined height or higher above a road zone. Furthermore, in case a personal aerial vehicle has an abnormality and lands or crashes while operating in an aerial vehicle operation zone set above a road zone, a moving object (or a person) moving in the road zone may be affected. Accordingly, it is desirable that an aerial vehicle operation zone is set vertically above a neighboring zone of a road zone (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;roadside zone&#x201d;), instead of vertically above the road zone. For example, it is desirable that a preset distance range from a road zone is set as a roadside zone and an aerial vehicle operation zone is set above the roadside zone. Furthermore, a predetermined buffer zone may be set between the road zone and the roadside zone.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, an aerial vehicle operation zone may include a multiplicity of operation zones that are distinguished in vertical direction. For example, an aerial vehicle operation zone may include a first operation zone and a second operation zone, and the first operation zone may be managed as a higher course than the second operation zone. In addition, a first operation zone may be set and managed as a relatively higher zone than a second operation zone. Accordingly, an aerial vehicle control system may control an aerial vehicle moving at relatively high speed to move in the first operation zone and control an aerial vehicle moving at relatively low speed to move in the second operation zone. As another example, an aerial vehicle control system may manage a second operation zone as a slow land and a first operation zone as a fast lane.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">As yet another example, a type of an aerial vehicle may be set according to size or purpose of use, and a type of an aerial vehicle capable of operating in a multiplicity of operation zones may be set and managed. As an example, according to purpose of use, aerial vehicles may be classified into passenger aerial vehicles and cargo aerial vehicles. Accordingly, an aerial vehicle control system may control a passenger aerial vehicle to move in the first operation zone and control a cargo aerial vehicle to move in the second operation zone. As another example, according to size, aerial vehicles may be classified into small aerial vehicles, mid-sized aerial vehicles and large aerial vehicles. Correspondingly, an aerial vehicle control system may control an aerial vehicle with relatively large size to operate in a higher course. As an example, an aerial vehicle control system may control a large aerial vehicle to move in the first operation zone and control a small aerial vehicle or a mid-sized aerial vehicle to move in the second operation zone. As yet another example, an aerial vehicle operation zone may include a first operation zone, a second operation zone and a third operation zone, and an aerial vehicle control system may control a large aerial vehicle to move in the first operation zone, a mid-sized aerial vehicle to move in the second operation zone and a small aerial vehicle to move in the third operation zone.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a first operation zone, a second operation zone and a third operation zone are illustrated as multiple operation zones, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and the number of operation zones may vary.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, an aerial vehicle operation zone may include a supplementary operation zone capable of expanding an operation zone either vertically or horizontally. For example, there may be an obstacle at a certain point or in a section of an aerial vehicle operation zone, a supplementary operation zone may be set to drive by evading the obstacle. As an example, a supplementary operation zone may be configured by expanding an operation zone in vertical direction. As another example, one of 8 directions from an operation path of an aerial vehicle may be set as a supplementary operation zone.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Furthermore, a supplementary operation zone may be configured adaptively according to a type of an obstacle. For example, in case there is a fixed obstacle, an aerial vehicle control system may set a supplementary operation zone in a corresponding section so that an aerial vehicle operation zone may be managed by being temporarily expanded. As another example, in case a movable obstacle is identified, an aerial vehicle control system may identify a movement direction and speed of the movable obstacle and set a supplementary operation zone by selecting one of 8 directions from an operation course of an aerial vehicle as an optimal evasion zone.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">As an example, an aerial vehicle operation zone may be set based on a predetermined altitude. As another example, an aerial vehicle operation zone may change its altitude adaptively according to weather information. For example, weather information may include information for identifying weather conditions like snowfall, rainfall, fog and the like, and an altitude range of an aerial vehicle operation zone may be set based on such weather information. An altitude range of an aerial vehicle operation zone may be set in predetermined distance units (e.g., 300 m, 500 m, and 1 km).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Meanwhile, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, an aerial vehicle may enter an aerial vehicle operation zone restrictedly through a take-off and landing facility. Herein, the take-off and landing facility may include a space, in which an aerial vehicle may take off or land, and a controller capable of controlling entry into and exit from an aerial vehicle operation zone. As an example, the take-off and landing facility may include an expressway tollgate facility, a service facility and the like. Furthermore, it is desirable that the take-off and landing facility is installed at one side or both sides of a road zone.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As another example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a road zone may have a northbound lane and a southbound lane separate from each other, and an expressway tollgate facility, a service facility and the like may be installed in the central areas of the northbound lane and the southbound lane respectively. Thus, a take-off and landing facility may be located in the central area of a road zone.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Furthermore, a take-off and landing facility may be connected with a control server that performs control of take-off and landing of an aerial vehicle, control of entry into and exit from an aerial vehicle operation zone, and information exchange with an aerial vehicle. A control server may include a local control server and a central control server. A local control server may include a server that is provided within a take-off and landing facility or adjacent to the take-off and landing facility. In addition, a central control server may include a server that is connected with at least one local control server and performs overall control of an aerial vehicle control system.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a conceptual view showing schematically a configuration of an aerial vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a view illustrating a structure of an aerial vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a take-off and landing facility and an aerial vehicle operation zone may be set, and an aerial vehicle control system may control the movement or operation of a personal aerial vehicle in the take-off and landing facility and the aerial vehicle operation zone.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">A take-off and landing facility may include a stop, in which a personal aerial vehicle or a moving object may stop, and a take-off and landing field in which a personal aerial vehicle may take off and land. Herein, the stop and the take-off and landing field may be set as different areas on a single plane. As another example, a take-off and landing facility may include a building constructed with a multiplicity of floors, and a stop and a take-off and landing field may be set on different floors. As yet another example, a stop may be configured to separate areas in which a personal aerial vehicle or a moving object may stop. For example, a stop may include a first stop, where a personal aerial vehicle stands, and a second stop where a moving object stops. A first stop and a second stop may set as different areas on a single plane or as different floors. As yet another example, a first stop and a take-off and landing field may be set as different areas on a single plane, and a second stop may be set as a different floor from the first stop and the take-off and landing field.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">For example, a personal aerial vehicle may be available in a road zone, a stop, a take-off and landing field and an aerial vehicle operation zone and may include a moving object with a shape capable of vertical take-off and landing (e.g., vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and electric vertical take-off and landing (e-VTOL)). Accordingly, a personal aerial vehicle may move from a road zone to a stop, a take-off and landing field and the like and move from the take-off and landing field to an aerial vehicle operation zone under the control of a control server (local control server or central control server). In addition, under the control of a control server (local control server or central control server), a personal aerial vehicle may move from an aerial vehicle operation zone to a take-off and landing field.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Furthermore, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, a section, in which a personal aerial vehicle is moved from a take-off and landing field to an aerial vehicle operation zone, is called an entry section, and a section, in which the personal aerial vehicle is moved from the aerial vehicle operation zone to the take-off and landing field, is called an exit section.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Meanwhile, a central control server may be connected with a local control server via a communication network and receive information on a personal aerial vehicle from the local control server. In addition, the central control server may provide the local control server with information necessary to control a personal aerial vehicle or to control an entry section or an exit section. In addition, the central control server may provide operation information necessary for a personal aerial vehicle to operate in an aerial vehicle operation zone. Meanwhile, although a personal aerial vehicle may freely move in a take-off and landing field, an entry section, an exit section and an aerial vehicle operation zone, as personal aerial vehicles move at relatively high speed, an accident is very likely to happen in the take-off and landing field, the entry section and the exit section. Accordingly, it is necessary to set control right for movement or operation by distinguishing a local control server, a central control server, a personal aerial vehicle and the like according to a location or situation of the personal aerial vehicle.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, an aerial vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a local control server, a central control server, and a personal aerial vehicle, and the local control server, the central control server and the personal aerial vehicle may exchange information necessary for control via communication. Also, a personal aerial vehicle may control movement or operation based on information received from a local control server and a central control server.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">A personal aerial vehicle and a local control server may be connected with each other based on a vehicle to everything (V2X) communication scheme, and the personal aerial vehicle and a central control server may be connected with each other based on a vehicle to everything (V2X) communication scheme. As an example, it is desirable that a personal aerial vehicle and a local control server are connected to each other through a vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) scheme and the personal aerial vehicle and a central control server are connected to each other through a V2I scheme. A personal aerial vehicle and a local control server may be connected with each other via aeronautical telecommunication network (AFTN), and the personal aerial vehicle and a central control server may be connected with each other via AFTN. As yet another example, a personal aerial vehicle and a local control server may be connected with each other via a base station-based communication network, and the personal aerial vehicle and a central control server may be connected with each other via a base station-based communication network. As an example, a base station-based communication network may include a cellular communication network, a communication network based on 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), a communication network based on long term evolution (LTE) and a communication network based on fifth generation (5G) technology standard. Although, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, a communication network based on 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), a communication network based on long term evolution (LTE) and a communication network based on fifth generation (5G) technology standard are described as examples of base station-based communications, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and various types of cellular communication networks may be used.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Furthermore, an aerial vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may configure different communication networks connecting a local control server or a central control server according to a location of a personal aerial vehicle. As an example, in case a personal aerial vehicle exists within a take-off and landing facility or exists in an entry section or an exit section, the personal aerial vehicle may be connected with a local control server based on an X2V scheme. In addition, in case the personal aerial vehicle exists in an aerial vehicle operation zone, the personal aerial vehicle may be connected with the central control server (or local control server) via AFTN or cellular communication network.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In addition, a personal aerial vehicle may be connected with another personal aerial vehicle through a V2X scheme. Thus, a personal aerial vehicle may be connected with another neighboring personal aerial vehicle through a V2X scheme, and a distance between neighboring personal aerial vehicles may be measured so that a collision between personal aerial vehicles may be prevented.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Basically, a central control server may set an operation condition in an aerial vehicle control system such as an entry section, an exit section, an aerial vehicle operation zone and the like and set and provide a control parameter matching the operation condition to a local control server or a personal aerial vehicle. Herein, the operation condition may include a speed, an interval, a set altitude of an aerial vehicle operation zone and the like.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Furthermore, a central control server may check and store a weather condition necessary to set an operation condition. To this end, the central control server may be connected with a device (or server) capable of providing weather information via a communication network and receive and store weather information periodically. As another example, the central control server may receive and store weather information from a device (or server) capable of providing weather information whenever a preset condition (e.g., lighting, gale, storm, heavy rainfall) is satisfied.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Also, a central control server may manage operation information of a personal aerial vehicle operated within an aerial vehicle control system and identify and manage a degree of congestion of each section of an aerial vehicle operation zone based on the operation information.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Also, a central control server may identify and manage event information (e.g., accident, obstacle, emergency situation) occurring within an aerial vehicle operation zone.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Also, a central control server may perform network linkage between local control servers, management of situations in a take-off and landing facility connected to a local control server, and the like.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Meanwhile, a local control server may manage control right of a personal aerial vehicle in an entry section, an exit section and an aerial vehicle operation zone. As an example, a local control server may set control right of a personal aerial vehicle to a local control server or to a personal aerial vehicle. To this end, a local control server may receive information required to set control right of a personal aerial vehicle from the personal aerial vehicle and set and manage the control right for the personal aerial vehicle based on the received information.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Also, a local control server may identify and manage a condition of a stop, a condition of a take-off and landing field and the like. For example, the condition of a stop may include an occupancy state of a spot included in the stop, an identifier of a moving object or a personal aerial vehicle present at the occupied spot and the like. Likewise, the condition of a take-off and landing field may include an occupancy state of a spot included in the take-off and landing field, an identifier of a personal aerial vehicle present at the occupied spot and the like. Furthermore, a local control server may identify and manage a degree of congestion in a take-off and landing facility based on a condition of a stop, a condition of a take-off and landing field and the like.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Furthermore, a local control server may check and store the above-described weather condition. As an example, a local control server may receive and store weather information from a central control server. As another example, a local control server may be connected with a device (or server) capable of providing weather information via a communication network and receive and store weather information periodically. Also, a local control server may store and manage operation conditions like an entry section, an exit section and an aerial vehicle operation zone. An operation condition may be received from a central control server and be managed.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Also, a local control server may identify and manage event information (e.g., accident, obstacle, emergency situation) occurring within an aerial vehicle operation zone. Event information may be received from a central control server or be generated based on a degree of congestion of a take-off and landing facility, weather information and the like.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Meanwhile, like a conventional personal aerial vehicle, a personal aerial vehicle may be controlled to move in a predetermined airspace, and the movement may be controlled through a user's operation control or autonomous driving control. Particularly, the movement or operation of a personal aerial vehicle may be controlled in a take-off and landing field, an entry section, an exit section, and an aerial vehicle operation zone, and the movement or operation may be controlled based on information received from a local control server or a central control server. Furthermore, control right of a personal aerial vehicle may be determined according to a zone that is set in an aerial vehicle control system, and movement or operation may be controlled in response to the determined control right.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">A multimodal transport system based on an air vehicle (hereinafter, referred to as &#x2018;multimodal transport system&#x2019;) according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may be a system that processes transport of various traffic entities by using a take-off and landing facility, where an air vehicle takes off and land, as a transport hub. Basically, a multimodal transport system may include an environment in which the departure point and destination of a user may be identified and the user may move from the departure point to the destination. In addition, a multimodal transport system may include an environment in which a user may be moved from a departure point to a destination especially by means of an air vehicle or a moving object. As an example, a multimodal transport system may be configured to perform and manage transport between air vehicles, transport between an air vehicle and a moving object, and transport between moving objects.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">A multimodal transport system may include a transport management server that is capable of processing management of a user's departure point or destination, management of a departure or destination of an air vehicle (or moving object), and matching the user with the air vehicle (or moving object). Furthermore, a transport management server may include a central transport management server, which performs overall management of transport of a user, and a local transport management server corresponding to each take-off and landing facility.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Hereinafter, a detailed structure of a take-off and landing facility, an operation of a central transport management server, an operation of a local transport management server and the like will be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>D</figref> illustrate a structure of a take-off and landing facility in a multimodal transport system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">First, as described above, a take-off and landing facility in a multimodal transport system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a stop and a take-off and landing pad, and the stop in particular may include a zone, in which an air vehicle may stop (hereinafter, referred to as &#x2018;air vehicle stop zone&#x2019;), and a zone in which a moving object may stop (hereinafter, referred to as &#x2018;moving object stop zone&#x2019;). As an example, an air vehicle stop zone and a moving object stop zone may be provided on a same plane. As another example, a take-off and landing facility may consist of a plurality of planes, and an air vehicle stop zone and a moving object stop zone may be provided on different planes.
