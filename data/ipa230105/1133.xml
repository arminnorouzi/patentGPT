rigidizing device includes an elongate flexible tube, a braid layer positioned over the elongate flexible tube, an outer layer over the flexible tube and the braid layer, and an inlet between the elongate flexible tube and the outer layer and configured to attach to a source of vacuum or pressure. The braid layer has a plurality of strands braided together at a braid angle of 5-40 degrees relative to a longitudinal axis of the elongate flexible tube when the elongate flexible tube is straight. The rigidizing device is configured to have a rigid configuration when vacuum or pressure is applied through the inlet and a flexible configuration when vacuum or pressure is not applied through the inlet. The braid angle is configured to change as the rigidizing device bends when the rigidizing device is in the flexible configuration.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

Indeed, one study found that looping occurred in 91 of 100 patients undergoing colonoscopy [Shah et al, &#x201c;Magnetic Imaging of Colonoscopy: An Audit of Looping, Accuracy and Ancillary maneuvers.&#x201d; <i>Gastrointest Endosc </i>2000; 52: 1-8]. Gastrointestinal looping prolongs the procedure and can cause pain to the patient because it can stretch the vessel wall and the mesentery. Furthermore, gastrointestinal looping leads to an increased incidence of perforations. In severe cases of gastrointestinal looping, complete colonoscopies are impossible since looping stretches the length of the colon and the colonoscope is not long enough to reach the end. Gastrointestinal looping is an impediment to precise tip control, denying the user the coveted one-to-one motion relationship between the handle and the endoscope tip. Such problems commonly occur across a wide range of endoscopic procedures, including colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), enteroscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), interventional endoscopy procedures (including ESD (Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection) and EMR (Endoscopic Mucosal Resection)), robotic flexible endoscopy, trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS), altered anatomy cases (including Roux-en-Y), and during NOTES (Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery) procedures. Accordingly, there is a need for device that helps prevent gastrointestinal looping to provide more successful access to the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Similar difficulties in advancing medical instruments can arise, for example, during interventional procedures in the lungs, kidneys, brain, cardiac space, and other anatomical locations. Accordingly, there is a need for a device that can provide safe, efficient, and precise access to otherwise difficult to reach anatomical locations.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In general, in one embodiment, a rigidizing device includes an elongate flexible tube, a braid layer positioned over the elongate flexible tube, an outer layer over the flexible tube and the braid layer, and an inlet between the elongate flexible tube and the outer layer and configured to attach to a source of vacuum or pressure.

overtubes) that are configured to aid in transporting a scope (e.g., endoscope) or other medical instrument through a curved or looped portion of the body (e.g., a vessel). The rigidizing devices can be long, thin, and hollow and can transition quickly from a flexible configuration (i.e., one that is relaxed, limp, or floppy) to a rigid configuration (i.e., one that is stiff and/or holds the shape it is in when it is rigidized). A plurality of layers (e.g., coiled or reinforced layers, slip layers, braided layers, bladder layers and/or sealing sheaths) can together form the wall of the rigidizing devices. The rigidizing devices can transition from the flexible configuration to the rigid configuration, for example, by applying a vacuum or pressure to the wall of the rigidizing device or within the wall of the rigidizing device. With the vacuum or pressure removed, the layers can easily shear or move relative to each other. With the vacuum or pressure applied, the layers can transition to a condition in which they exhibit substantially enhanced ability to resist shear, movement, bending, and buckling, thereby providing system rigidization.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">The rigidizing devices described herein can provide rigidization for a variety of medical applications, including catheters, sheaths, scopes (e.g., endoscopes), wires, or laparoscopic instruments. The rigidizing devices can function as a separate add-on device or can be integrated into the body of catheters, sheaths, scopes, wires, or laparoscopic instruments. The devices described herein can also provide rigidization for non-medical structures.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">An exemplary rigidizing device system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The system includes a rigidizing device <b>300</b> having a wall with a plurality of layers including a braid layer, an outer layer (part of which is cut away to show the braid thereunder), and an inner layer. The system further includes a handle <b>342</b> having a vacuum or pressure inlet <b>344</b> to supply vacuum or pressure to the rigidizing device <b>300</b>. An actuation element <b>346</b> can be used to turn the vacuum or pressure on and off to thereby transition the rigidizing device <b>300</b> between flexible and rigid configurations. The distal tip <b>339</b> of the rigidizing device <b>300</b> can be smooth, flexible, and atraumatic to facilitate distal movement of the rigidizing device <b>300</b> through the body. Further, the tip <b>339</b> can taper from the distal end to the proximal end to further facilitate distal movement of the rigidizing device <b>300</b> through the body.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">A portion of an exemplary braid layer <b>209</b> for a rigidizing device similar to device <b>300</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>. The braid layer <b>209</b> can included braided strands <b>233</b>. The braid layer <b>209</b> can, for example, be a tubular braid.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">The braid angle &#x3b1; of the strands <b>233</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>235</b> of the rigidizing device when the rigidizing device (e.g., device <b>300</b>) is in a straight (unbent) configuration can be less than 45 degrees, such as less than or equal to 40 degrees, less than or equal to 35 degrees, or less than or equal to 25 degrees. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the bending strength of the rigidizing device decreases as the braid angle &#x3b1; (when the rigidizing device is straight or unbent) increases. That is, the bending strength under vacuum of the rigidizing device with a braid angle of 45 degrees (a typical minimum angle for a torque or torsion braid. Still larger angles are typically used for catheter shaft reinforcement) under vacuum is 27% of the bending strength under vacuum of a rigidizing device with a braid angle of 25 degrees. Accordingly, having a lower braid angle (e.g., less than 45 degrees, such as 40 degrees or less or 35 degrees or less) advantageously ensures that the rigidizing device (e.g., device <b>300</b>) remains stiff in bending (resistant to a change in configuration) under vacuum (and similarly under pressure). Additionally, the braid angle &#x3b1; when the rigidizing device is in a straight (unbent) configuration can be greater than 5 degrees, such as greater than 8 degrees, such as greater than 10 degrees, such as 15 degrees or greater. Having a braid angle &#x3b1; within this range ensures that the braid remains flexible enough to bend when in the flexible configuration (i.e., when not rigidized under vacuum or pressure). Thus, the braid angle &#x3b1; of the strands <b>233</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>235</b> of the rigidizing device when the rigidizing device is in a straight configuration can be 5 to 40 degrees, such as 10 to 35 degrees, such as 15 to 25 degrees, such as approximately 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, or 40 degrees. The braid angle &#x3b1; of the strands <b>233</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>235</b> of the rigidizing device when the rigidizing device is in a straight (unbent) configuration of 5-40 degrees ensures that the rigidizing device is flexible enough to bend in the flexible configuration (e.g., when not under vacuum/pressure) yet stiff when in the rigid configuration (e.g., when placed under vacuum or pressure). Additionally, it should be understood that the strands <b>233</b> are configured to slide over one another, and therefore that the braid angle &#x3b1; will change the rigidizing device flexes and bends. Having an angle &#x3b1; that is between 5 and 40 degrees also advantageously ensures that the strands <b>233</b> can move freely relative to one another without causing the fibers to collide with one another and prevent further angular change.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Further, the braid for braid layer <b>209</b> can be between 4-60 picks per inch, such as 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, or 25 picks/inch. In one embodiment, the tube formed by the layer <b>209</b> has a diameter of 0.578&#x2033;, and the braid is 12-14 picks per inch.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">In some embodiments, the braid layer <b>209</b> (or any braid layer described herein) can be configured such that the rigidizing devices described herein have a high stiffness ratio (i.e., the ratio of the stiffness in the rigid configuration, such as when vacuum or pressure is applied, to stiffness in the flexible configuration, such as when vacuum or pressure is not applied). For example, the stiffness ratio can be greater than 5, such as greater than 6, greater than 9, greater than 9, or greater than 10. Referring to Table 1 below, six vacuum rigidizing devices (samples A-F) were built and tested over a length of 4&#x2033; and a deflection of &#xbd;&#x2033; for cantilevered bending stiffnesses at atmospheric pressure (flexible configuration) and under vacuum (rigid configuration). As shown, lowering the braid angles raises the stiffness of the rigidized devices. Samples E and F show, in particular, the stiffness difference between a braid at a typical torque angle (sample E, 47.7 degrees and rigid stiffness of 0.529 lbf) and a braid with a lower angle (sample F, 27.2 degrees, and a rigid stiffness of 1.455 lbf). As is also shown in Table 1, rigidizing devices with lower angles (e.g., angles under 45 degrees or 35 degrees, such as samples A-D and F) can have a much higher stiffness ratio (e.g., ratio of greater than 5, greater than 6, greater than 9, or greater than 10) than rigidizing devices with higher angles (e.g., angles of 45 degrees or above, such as sample F), which can have a stiffness ratio of under 5. It can also be observed from Table 1 that both samples A and B have a stiffness ratio above 5. Sample B, at a 14.9 degree braid angle, has a lower stiffness ratio but a higher absolute stiffness than sample because the strands of sample B are oriented close to the longitudinal axis (and therefore sample B has a higher stiffness in the flexible configuration).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="273pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Vacuum Rigidizing Devices</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Inside</entry><entry>Braid</entry><entry/><entry>Picks</entry><entry>Flexible</entry><entry>Rigid</entry><entry/><entry>Change in</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>diameter</entry><entry>angle</entry><entry/><entry>per</entry><entry>stiffness</entry><entry>stiffness</entry><entry>Stiffness</entry><entry>Stiffness</entry></row><row><entry>Sample</entry><entry>(Inches)</entry><entry>(degrees)</entry><entry>Strand</entry><entry>Inch</entry><entry>(lbf)</entry><entry>(lbf)</entry><entry>ratio</entry><entry>(lbf)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>A</entry><entry>0.37</entry><entry>20.4</entry><entry>0.010&#x2033;</entry><entry>14.3</entry><entry>0.046</entry><entry>0.441</entry><entry>9.6</entry><entry>0.395</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>PET</entry></row><row><entry>B</entry><entry>0.37</entry><entry>14.9</entry><entry>0.010&#x2033;</entry><entry>12.8</entry><entry>0.097</entry><entry>0.653</entry><entry>6.7</entry><entry>0.556</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>PET</entry></row><row><entry>C</entry><entry>0.576</entry><entry>32.8</entry><entry>0.010&#x2033;</entry><entry>16.2</entry><entry>0.099</entry><entry>0.661</entry><entry>6.7</entry><entry>0.562</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>PET</entry></row><row><entry>D</entry><entry>0.576</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>0.010&#x2033;</entry><entry>11.5</entry><entry>0.115</entry><entry>1.102</entry><entry>9.6</entry><entry>0.987</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>PET</entry></row><row><entry>E</entry><entry>0.77</entry><entry>47.7</entry><entry>0.010&#x2033;</entry><entry>19.8</entry><entry>0.115</entry><entry>0.529</entry><entry>4.6</entry><entry>0.414</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>PET</entry></row><row><entry>F</entry><entry>0.77</entry><entry>27.2</entry><entry>0.010&#x2033;</entry><entry>12.2</entry><entry>0.137</entry><entry>1.455</entry><entry>10.6</entry><entry>1.318</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>PET</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0162" num="0160">Referring to Table 2 below, three pressure rigidizing devices (samples G-I) were built and tested over a length of 4&#x2033; and a deflection of &#xbd;&#x2033; for cantilevered bending stiffnesses at atmospheric pressure atmospheric pressure (flexible configuration) and under 4 atm pressure (rigid configuration).

The rigidizing devices described herein can thus advantageously transition from very flexible to very stiff upon activation by the user. When a vacuum or pressure is applied, the braids or strands can radially constrict or expand to become mechanically fixed or locked in place relative to one another. As a result, the rigidizing device can go from a flexible configuration to a rigid configuration when vacuum or pressure is applied (thereby fixing the rigidizing device in the shape that the rigidizing device was in just prior to application of the vacuum or pressure).</p><p id="p-0174" num="0170">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>D</figref>, in some embodiments, one or both ends of the braid layer <b>5609</b> of a rigidizing device <b>5600</b> as described herein can be bonded to another layer of the device <b>5600</b> to prevent the strands <b>5633</b> of the braid from coming unbraided. Further, the ends of the strands <b>5633</b> can be bonded in such a way so as to allow relative movement of the strands <b>5633</b> during flexing of the rigidizing device <b>5600</b> when it is in the flexible configuration (i.e., so as to prevent rigidity or buckling of the device <b>5600</b>, which in turn can lead to drag at the tip <b>5629</b>, that might otherwise occur if the strands <b>5633</b> were constrained).</p><p id="p-0175" num="0171">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the tip <b>5629</b> of the braid layer <b>5609</b> can include a coating <b>5634</b> thereover of low durometer material, such as silicone or urethane, that is stretchable and/or flexible. As a result, the ends of the strands <b>5633</b> can be encapsulated by the coating <b>5634</b> (and therefore prevented from unbraiding) while still moving with coating <b>5634</b> as it stretches and/or flexes. The coating <b>5634</b> can be thin, such as between 0.005-0.250 thick (e.g., approximately 1/32&#x2033; thick).</p><p id="p-0176" num="0172">As another example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the tip <b>5629</b> of the braid layer <b>5609</b> can include an annular ring <b>5601</b><i>z </i>therearound.

As a result, the strands <b>5633</b> can have a greater angle relative to the longitudinal axis at the tip <b>5629</b> than in the rest of the layer <b>5609</b>. For example, while the strands <b>5633</b> in the central portion of the device <b>5600</b> can have an angle of 45&#xb0; or less relative to the longitudinal axis of the device <b>5600</b> (for example, 40 degrees or less, 35 degrees or less, 25 degrees or less, or 20 degrees or less), the strands <b>5633</b> at the tip <b>5629</b> can have an angle of greater than 45&#xb0;, such as between 45&#xb0; and 60&#xb0;, relative to the longitudinal axis (for example, 35 degrees, 45 degrees, or 55 degrees). The change in braid angle can be a continuous change at the tip <b>5629</b> and/or can be created by joining two separate braids together. The strands <b>5633</b> of greater angle can be glued down to the innermost layer at the tip <b>5629</b>.

The slip layer can be configured to reduce friction between the braid and the bordering layers to allow the bordering layers (and in particular the braid layer) to more easily shear or move relative to each other, particularly when no vacuum or pressure is applied to the rigidizing device, to maximize flexibility in the flexible configuration. The slip layer can advantageously enhance the baseline flexibility of the rigidizing device to allow the layers to move relative to one another. In one embodiment, the slip layer can include a powder, such as talcum or cornstarch. In particular, a powder slip layer can advantageously reduce friction without adding significant thickness to the device, thereby enhancing flexibility of the rigidizing device in the flexible configuration. The slip layer can be made of a low coefficient of friction material, such as a thin film fluoropolymer (FEP, Chemfilm, PTFE, with thicknesses from 2-50 microns). In one embodiment, the slip layer can be a coating. In one embodiment, the slip layer can be a slip additive added to an elastomer. In one embodiment, the slip layer can be a sheath of thin plastic film that is inherently lubricious, such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE). In one embodiment, the slip layer can be made of a thin spiral-wrapped film, such at 0.0005&#x2033; FEP or 0.00025&#x2033; Chemfilm (St. Gobain).

The layer can further provide a seal for the wall (i.e., can be leak-proof) and can be strong enough to provide resistance to diametrical collapse even during bending of the rigidizing device and/or compression of the rigidizing device during rigidization.

The reinforcement element <b>8850</b><i>z </i>can be, for example, a stent, a structure cut from a tube, or a braid.

Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, RE width is the width of reinforcement element <b>8850</b><i>z</i>, RE height is height or thickness of reinforcement element <b>8850</b><i>z</i>, and RE Gap is distance between reinforcement elements <b>8850</b><i>z</i>. The high ratio of width to height of the reinforcement element <b>8850</b><i>z </i>can advantageously help prevent external pressure caused parallelogramming-type collapse of the reinforcement elements <b>8850</b><i>z </i>within the innermost layer <b>8815</b>.

As the rigidizing device is rigidized, it does so in the shape it was in before vacuum or pressure was applied, i.e., it does not straighten, bend, or otherwise substantially modify its shape (e.g., it may stiffen in a looped configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> or in a serpentine shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>). This can be because the air stiffening effect on the inner or outer layers (e.g., made of coil-wound tube) can be a small percentage (e.g., 5%) of the maximum load capability of the rigidizing device in bending, thereby allowing the rigidizing device to resist straightening. Upon release of the vacuum or pressure, braids or strands can unlock relative to one another and again move so as to allow bending of the rigidizing device. Again, as the rigidizing device is made more flexible through the release of vacuum or pressure, it does so in the shape it was in before the vacuum or pressure was released, i.e., it does not straighten, bend, or otherwise substantially modify its shape. Thus, the rigidizing devices described herein can transition from a flexible, less-stiff configuration to a rigid configuration of higher stiffness by restricting the motion between the strands of braid (e.g., by applying vacuum or pressure).</p><p id="p-0196" num="0192">The rigidizing devices described herein can toggle between the rigid and flexible configurations quickly, and in some embodiments with an indefinite number of transition cycles.

The outermost layer <b>101</b> can be soft and atraumatic and can be sealed at both ends to create a vacuum-tight chamber with layer <b>115</b>. The outermost layer <b>101</b> can be elastomeric, e.g., made of urethane. The hardness of the outermost layer <b>101</b> can be, for example, 30 A to 80 A. Further, the outermost layer <b>101</b> can be have a thickness of 0.0001-0.01&#x2033;, such as approximately 0.001&#x2033;, 0.002, 0.003&#x2033; or 0.004&#x2033;. Alternatively, the outermost layer can be plastic, including, for example, LDPE, nylon, or PEEK.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0204">In some embodiments, the outermost layer <b>101</b> can, for example, have tensile or hoop fibers <b>137</b> extending therethrough. The hoop fibers <b>137</b> can be made, for example, of aramids (e.g., Technora, nylon, Kevlar), Vectran, Dyneema, carbon fiber, fiber glass or plastic. Further, the hoop fibers <b>137</b> can be positioned at 2-50, e.g., 20-40 hoops per inch. In some embodiments, the hoop fibers <b>137</b> can be laminated within an elastomeric sheath. The hoop fibers can advantageously deliver higher stiffness in one direction compared to another (e.g., can be very stiff in the hoop direction, but very compliant in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the rigidizing device). Additionally, the hoop fibers can advantageously provide low hoop stiffness until the fibers are placed under a tensile load, at which point the hoop fibers can suddenly exhibit high hoop stiffness.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0205">In some embodiments, the outermost layer <b>101</b> can include a lubrication, coating and/or powder (e.g., talcum powder) on the outer surface thereof to improve sliding of the rigidizing device through the anatomy. The coating can be hydrophilic (e.g., a Hydromer&#xae; coating or a Surmodics&#xae; coating) or hydrophobic (e.g., a fluoropolymer).

For instance, the inside diameter of layer <b>101</b> (assuming it constitutes a tube) may have a diametrical gap of 0&#x2033;-0.200&#x2033; with the next layer radially inwards (e.g., with a braid layer). This may give the vacuum rigidized system more flexibility when not under vacuum while still preserving a high rigidization multiple. In other embodiments, the outermost layer <b>101</b> may be stretched some over the next layer radially inwards (e.g., the braid layer). For instance, the zero-strain diameter of a tube constituting layer <b>101</b> may be from 0-0.200&#x2033; smaller in diameter than the next layer radially inwards and then stretched thereover. When not under vacuum, this system may have less flexibility than one wherein the outer layer <b>101</b> is looser. However, it may also have a smoother outer appearance and be less likely to tear during use.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0208">In some embodiments, the outermost layer <b>101</b> can be loose over the radially inward layers. A small positive pressure may be applied underneath the layer <b>101</b> in order to gently expand layer <b>101</b> and allow the rigidizing device to bend more freely in the flexible configuration. In this embodiment, the outermost layer <b>101</b> can be elastomeric and can maintain a compressive force over the braid, thereby imparting stiffness. Once positive pressure is supplied (enough to nominally expand the sheath off of the braid, for example, 2 psi), the outermost layer <b>101</b> is no longer is a contributor to stiffness, which can enhance baseline flexibility. Once rigidization is desired, positive pressure can be replaced by negative pressure (vacuum) to deliver stiffness.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0209">A vacuum can be carried within rigidizing device <b>100</b> from minimal to full atmospheric vacuum (e.g., approximately 14.7 psi). In some embodiments, there can be a bleed valve, regulator, or pump control such that vacuum is bled down to any intermediate level to provide a variable stiffness capability. The vacuum pressure can advantageously be used to rigidize the rigidizing device structure by compressing the layer(s) of braided sleeve against neighboring layers. Braid is naturally flexible in bending (i.e. when bent normal to its longitudinal axis), and the lattice structure formed by the interlaced strands distort as the sleeve is bent in order for the braid to conform to the bent shape while resting on the inner layers. This results in lattice geometries where the corner angles of each lattice element change as the braided sleeve bends. When compressed between conformal materials, such as the layers described herein, the lattice elements become locked at their current angles and have enhanced capability to resist deformation upon application of vacuum, thereby rigidizing the entire structure in bending when vacuum is applied. Further, in some embodiments, the hoop fibers through or over the braid can carry tensile loads that help to prevent local buckling of the braid at high applied bending load.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0210">The stiffness of the rigidizing device <b>100</b> can increase from 2-fold to over 30-fold, for instance 10-fold, 15-fold, or 20-fold, when transitioned from the flexible configuration to the rigid configuration. In one specific example, the stiffness of a rigidizing device similar to rigidizing device <b>100</b> was tested. The wall thickness of the test rigidizing device was 1.0 mm, the outer diameter was 17 mm, and a force was applied at the end of a 9.5 cm long cantilevered portion of the rigidizing device until the rigidizing device deflected 10 degrees. The forced required to do so when in flexible mode was only 30 grams while the forced required to do so in rigid (vacuum) mode was 350 grams.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0211">In some embodiments of a vacuum rigidizing device <b>100</b>, there can be only one braid layer. In other embodiments of a vacuum rigidizing device <b>100</b>, there can be two, three, or more braid layers.

The variable stiffness layer can include one or more variable stiffness elements or structures that, when activated (e.g., when vacuum is applied), the bending stiffness and/or shear resistance is increased, resulting in higher rigidity. Other variable stiffness elements can be used in addition to or in place of the braid layer. In some embodiments, engagers can be used as a variable stiffness element, as described in International Patent Application No. PCT/US2018/042946, filed Jul. 19, 2018, titled &#x201c;DYNAMICALLY RIGIDIZING OVERTUBE,&#x201d; the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.

Inlet <b>2293</b><i>g </i>connects to pressure gap <b>2212</b><i>g </i>(via pressure line <b>2294</b><i>g</i>). Inlet <b>2223</b><i>g </i>connects to gap <b>2206</b><i>g </i>around the braid layer <b>2209</b><i>g </i>(between bladder <b>2221</b><i>g </i>and outermost layer <b>2201</b><i>g</i>). The device <b>2200</b><i>g </i>can be rigidized in one or more different configurations. In a first rigidizing configuration, pressure can be applied to inlet <b>2293</b><i>g </i>while the vent inlet <b>2223</b><i>g </i>can be open or vented to atmospheric pressure. The pressure supplied to the pressure gap <b>2212</b><i>g </i>through the inlet <b>2293</b><i>g </i>can thus push the braid <b>2209</b><i>g </i>against the outermost layer <b>2201</b><i>g</i>, which in turn can force any air in the gap <b>2206</b><i>g </i>out through the vent inlet <b>2223</b><i>g</i>. Allowing the air to escape through the vent inlet <b>2223</b><i>g </i>can enable a tighter mechanical fit between the braid layer <b>2209</b><i>g </i>and the outer layer <b>2201</b><i>g</i>, thereby strengthening the rigidization of the device <b>2200</b><i>g</i>. In a second rigidizing configuration, pressure can be applied to inlet <b>2293</b><i>g </i>and a vacuum can be applied to vent inlet <b>2223</b><i>g</i>. This may cause the rigidizing device <b>2200</b><i>g </i>to become even stiffer than in the first configuration, as the vacuum can assist in moving the braid layer <b>2209</b><i>g </i>towards the outer layer <b>2201</b><i>g</i>. The device <b>2200</b><i>g </i>can likewise be made flexible in one or more different configurations. In a first flexible configuration, both inlet <b>2293</b><i>g </i>and vent inlet <b>2223</b><i>g </i>can be opened to atmospheric pressure. This will loosen the braid layer <b>2209</b><i>g </i>relative to the outer layer <b>2201</b><i>g </i>and cause the rigidizing device <b>2200</b><i>g </i>to be flexible as the braid layer <b>2209</b><i>g </i>moves freely relative to the outer layer <b>2201</b><i>g</i>. In a second flexible configuration, a low pressure (e.g., 5-10% above atmospheric pressure) can be provided to both inlet <b>2293</b><i>g </i>and vent inlet <b>2223</b><i>g</i>. This may cause the outermost layer <b>2201</b><i>g </i>and the innermost layer <b>2215</b><i>g </i>to separate slightly, which can provide additionally area for the braid layer <b>2209</b><i>g </i>to move freely. As a result, this may cause the rigidizing device <b>2200</b><i>g </i>to become even more flexible than in the first rigidizing configuration. Additionally, providing a low pressure above atmospheric pressure in the flexible configuration can allow the rigidizing device <b>2200</b><i>g </i>to be introduced into the body with a very small diameter (e.g., such that the pressure gap <b>2212</b><i>g </i>is essentially zero) and then the low pressure can be provided to both inlet <b>2293</b><i>g </i>and vent inlet <b>2223</b><i>g </i>to slightly expand the pressure gap <b>2212</b><i>g </i>to provide more room for the braid layer <b>2209</b><i>g </i>to move freely.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0230"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>H</figref> shows a rigidizing device <b>2200</b><i>h </i>with bellows <b>2243</b><i>h </i>connected to pressure line <b>2294</b><i>h</i>.

The pressure transmitting medium may be a radiopaque fluid that advantageously will show the rigidized device more clearly during a procedure using fluoroscopy. The pressure transmitting medium can be added to the rigidizing device immediately before use and/or when the device is being manufactured. In use, activating the actuator <b>2288</b><i>h </i>can compress bellows <b>2243</b><i>h</i>, thus reducing the volume of pressure medium in the bellows <b>2243</b><i>h</i>, which flows through the pressure line <b>2294</b><i>h </i>to the pressure gap <b>2212</b><i>h</i>, causing a rise in pressure in the pressure gap <b>2212</b><i>h </i>and movement of the braid layer <b>2209</b><i>h </i>against the outer layer <b>2201</b><i>h</i>. The vent inlet <b>2223</b><i>h </i>can be open to the atmosphere to allow gas to escape from the space <b>2206</b><i>h </i>around the braid layer <b>2209</b><i>h</i>.

In other embodiments, both sections <b>5502</b><i>z</i>, <b>5503</b><i>z </i>are activated by pressure or vacuum, respectively.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0241">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the distal section <b>5702</b><i>z </i>can include a rigidizing braid that differs from the braid of the main elongate section <b>5703</b><i>z</i>. For example, in one embodiment, the braid angle relative to the longitudinal axis in the distal end section <b>5702</b><i>z </i>can be greater than the braid angle of the main elongate body <b>5703</b><i>z</i>. For instance, the braid angle in distal section may be 40 degrees while the braid angle in the main elongate body may be 20 degrees. The braids may overlap somewhat and be joined with a flexible adhesive. These designs may give the distal end section <b>5702</b><i>z </i>more bending flexibility in a non-rigidized state than the main elongate section <b>5703</b><i>z</i>. Having a more flexible distal tip can, for example, advantageously prevent buckling and drag at the tip (caused by fixing the braid ends) and/or can advantageously provide flexibility during navigation through a body lumen to prevent trauma to the anatomy. In another embodiment, the braid angle relative to the longitudinal axis in the distal end section <b>5702</b><i>z </i>can be less than the braid angle of the main elongate body <b>5703</b><i>z</i>. This may give distal end section <b>5702</b><i>z </i>more stiffness in the rigidized state relative to the main elongate body <b>5703</b><i>z</i>. Having more stiffness in the distal end section <b>5702</b><i>z </i>can, for example, advantageously provide a stable platform for movement or delivery of a medical device through the central lumen and out the distal end of the rigidizing device <b>5700</b>.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0242">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the distal end section <b>5802</b><i>z </i>can include a plurality of linkages <b>5804</b><i>z </i>that are passively activated. The linkages <b>5804</b><i>z </i>can be connected together at one or more pivot points and can advantageously provide deterministic bending (i.e., bending in a specific and predetermined direction). Additionally, the linkages <b>5804</b><i>z </i>can advantageously provide torsional rigidity to the distal end section <b>5802</b><i>z </i>while providing high flexibility for bending. The linkages <b>5804</b><i>z </i>can be activated passively, e.g., via flexing as the device <b>5800</b> is moved through the anatomy. The distal end section <b>5802</b><i>z </i>may, for example, include 1-100 linkages <b>5804</b><i>z</i>, such as 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 16, 20, 30, or 40 links <b>5504</b><i>z</i>. In some embodiments, the linkages <b>5804</b><i>z </i>can be formed by passively cut flexures, such as laser cut tubes or stents.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0243">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, in other embodiments, the distal end section <b>7602</b><i>z </i>can include a plurality of linkages <b>7604</b><i>z </i>that are actively controlled, such as via cables <b>7624</b>, for steering of the rigidizing device <b>7600</b>. The device <b>7600</b> is similar to device <b>5800</b> except that it includes cables <b>7624</b> configured to control movement of the device. While the passage of the cables <b>7624</b> through the rigidizing elongate body <b>7603</b><i>z </i>(i.e., with outer wall <b>7601</b>, braid layer <b>7609</b>, and inner layer <b>7615</b>) is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, the cables <b>7624</b> can extend therethrough in any manner as described elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, one or more layers of the rigidizing elongate body <b>7603</b><i>z </i>can continue into the distal end section <b>7602</b><i>z</i>. For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, the inner layer <b>7615</b> can continue into the distal end section <b>7602</b><i>z</i>, e.g., can be located radially inwards of the linkages <b>7604</b><i>z</i>. Similarly, any of the additional layers from the rigidizing proximal section (e.g., the braid layer <b>7609</b> or the outer layer <b>7601</b> may be continued into the distal end section <b>7602</b><i>z </i>and/or be positioned radially inwards of the linkages <b>7604</b><i>z</i>). In other embodiments, none of the layers of the rigidizing elongate body <b>7603</b><i>z </i>continue into the distal end section <b>7602</b><i>z</i>. The linkages <b>7604</b><i>z </i>(and any linkages described herein) can include a covering <b>7627</b><i>z </i>thereover. The covering <b>7627</b><i>z </i>can advantageously make the distal end section <b>7602</b><i>z </i>atraumatic and/or smooth. The covering <b>7627</b><i>z </i>can be a film, such as expanded PTFE. Expanded PTFE can advantageously provide a smooth, low friction surface with low resistance to bending but high resistance to buckling.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0244"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>A-E</figref> show another exemplary distal end section <b>4302</b><i>z </i>that includes a plurality of linkages <b>4304</b><i>z </i>that are actively controlled, such as via cables <b>4324</b>, for steering of the rigidizing device. In some embodiments, the pivots for the linkages <b>4304</b><i>z </i>can be involutes, similar to gear teeth, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>A-E</figref>, to reduce the local contact drag. The cables <b>4324</b> can be positioned within cable guides (e.g., jackets or coil pipes) that extend the length of the rigidizing device. In some embodiments, the cables <b>4324</b> (and cable guides) can extend within the wall of the rigidizing device. The cable guides can advantageously ensure that tensile load is carried through the cable guide, rather than through the wall of the rigidizing device, so that the structure of the wall is not adversely deflected as the load is applied to the linkages <b>4304</b><i>z</i>. In some embodiments, the cable guides and cables <b>4324</b> can have excess length to account for bending of the rigidizing device. This excess length can, for example, be woven or curled within the wall of the rigidizing device. Further, the cables <b>4324</b> can run through apertures and/or grooves in the linkages <b>4304</b><i>z </i>(see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>C</figref>) while remaining otherwise free to float within the wall (and thereby to account for bending of the rigidizing device. As the cables <b>4324</b> are activated, the linkages <b>4304</b><i>z </i>pivot relative to one another, thereby providing steering for the distal end section of a rigidizing device. Articulation of the linkages <b>4304</b><i>z </i>and cables <b>4324</b> for steering can be achieved by actuators (e.g., local motors, current-activated (heat) nitinol wires, proximal actuators (typically stainless steel, tungsten, or composites), hydraulics, and/or EAP (electro-active polymers)). Such steering mechanisms can advantageously provide increased clinical utility. Further, such steering allows the device that is positioned through the central lumen (for example, an endoscope or a guidewire) be steered towards and more easily reach the desired anatomical location.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0245">When cables are used for steering the distal end section, the cables (which can be in cable guides or not) can be routed through the wall of the rigidizing devices described herein in a number of different ways. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>39</b>B</figref> show exemplary configurations of rigidizing devices with cable guides (some wall layers have been omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>39</b>B</figref> for clarity). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> shows a rigidizing device <b>6200</b> having cables <b>6224</b> extending in cable guides <b>6299</b> within the outer radial gap layer <b>6207</b> (and thus between the braid layer <b>6209</b> and the outer layer <b>6201</b>). In some embodiments, each of the cables <b>6224</b> and cable guides <b>6299</b> can be positioned approximately equidistant around the circumference (i.e., approximately 90 degrees away from neighboring cables when four cables are used). In other embodiments, one or more of the cables <b>6224</b> and cable guides <b>6299</b> can be grouped closely together (e.g., within the same quadrant) rather than spaced apart. Further, in some embodiments, the cables <b>6224</b> and/or guides <b>6299</b> can be asymmetrically positioned around the circumference of the rigidizing device <b>6200</b>.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0246"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> shows a rigidizing device <b>6300</b> in which the cables <b>6324</b> and cable guides <b>6399</b> are positioned within the inner radial gap layer <b>6311</b> (and thus between the braid layer <b>6309</b> and the inner layers of the rigidizing device, such as the bladder <b>6321</b>). When, for example, pressure is supplied to pressure gap <b>6312</b>, the bladder <b>6321</b> can push against the braid layer <b>6309</b>, and the braid layer and correspondingly push against the outer layer <b>6301</b> without the braid layer <b>6309</b> squeezing or otherwise impacting the cables <b>6324</b>. Again, the cables <b>6324</b> and cable guides can be positioned equidistant or asymmetrically about the circumference of the rigidizing device <b>6300</b>.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0247">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the rigidizing device <b>6400</b> can have cables <b>6424</b> and cable guides <b>6499</b> at least partially separated from the pressurized or vacuum zone. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, a tubular bladder layer <b>6421</b> can surround the pressure gap <b>6412</b>. Some or all of the cables <b>6424</b> and cable guides <b>6499</b> can be positioned in the gap <b>6407</b> between the inner layer <b>6415</b> and the braid layer <b>6409</b> and circumferentially adjacent to the tubular bladder layer <b>6421</b>. Advantageously, in this configuration, the cables <b>6424</b> and cable guides <b>6499</b> can both be minimally impacted by pressurization of the bladder layer <b>6421</b> and provide substantially no additive stack height or thickness to the wall.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0248">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the rigidizing device <b>6500</b> can include a plurality of tubular bladders <b>6521</b> spaced circumferentially apart such that each cable <b>6524</b> and cable guide <b>6599</b> can fit in the gap <b>6507</b> between adjacent tubular bladders <b>6521</b>.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0249">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>, rigidizing device <b>6600</b> is similar to device <b>6500</b> except that cables <b>6624</b> and guides <b>6699</b> are grouped in pairs to reduce the number of tubular bladders <b>6621</b> necessary (e.g., there can be two tubular bladders <b>6621</b> and a two pair of cables <b>6624</b> and guides <b>6699</b> positioned therebetween).</p><p id="p-0254" num="0250">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, rigidizing device <b>6700</b> is similar to device <b>6500</b> except that each tubular bladder <b>6721</b> includes a tubular braid layer <b>6709</b> therearound (i.e., rather than having a single braid layer <b>6509</b> as with device <b>6500</b>). As pressurizing medium is provided to pressure gaps <b>6712</b>, the bladder <b>6721</b> can expand to press each individual tubular braid <b>6709</b>, which can expand to press against the inner and outer layers <b>6715</b>, <b>6701</b>. Alternately, not all of the bladders can be pressurized at the same time (for instance, just 1 or 2) such that the device is only stiffened partway around the circumference.

Further, the cables can be used to steer any tip or a rigidizing device and/or to steer any distal end section (e.g., sections with linkages or different braid angles). Further, the cable guides described herein can be round with round cables, flat, rectangular with flat ribbon tensile elements, or a combination thereof. Further, in some embodiments, other steering elements can be used in addition to or in place of the cables (e.g., pneumatics, hydraulics, shape memory alloys, EAP (electro-active polymers), or motors). Intentionally separating the elements required for steering and the elements required for rigidization can enable the structure to exhibit a continuously high rigidization performance as a function of length, even if the forces available for steering are demonstrably lower than the forces required for nested system rigidization.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0258">Additionally, it should be understood that the cable configurations and placement described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>39</b>B</figref> can similarly be used for the placement of working channels or other lumens (for example, inflation lumens for balloons) within the rigidizing devices.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0259">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>D</figref>, in some embodiments, the distal end section <b>5902</b><i>z </i>may include a series of linkages <b>5904</b><i>z </i>(either active or passive) that are specifically designed to rigidize via the application of pressure or vacuum. For example, the linkages <b>5904</b><i>z </i>can be connected to each other through a pivot point <b>5928</b><i>z </i>(which can, for example, be wire pivot points). Each pivot point <b>5928</b><i>z </i>can allow bending with one degree of freedom between linkages. Further, the linkages <b>5904</b><i>z </i>can be arranged in alternating fashion with every other linkage connected with the pivot points <b>5928</b><i>z </i>positioned 90 degrees away from the previous linkage. Each linkage <b>5904</b><i>z </i>can have cut-outs <b>5975</b><i>z </i>at the proximal and distal ends thereof extending from the pivot-points <b>5928</b><i>z </i>to as to allow bending of the linkages <b>5904</b><i>z </i>relative to one another. Further, each linkage <b>5904</b><i>z </i>can be connected to a neighboring linkage <b>5904</b><i>z </i>by a respective tensile member <b>5930</b><i>z</i>. The tensile member <b>5930</b><i>z </i>can be fixed relative to one linkage and at least partially movable within a track <b>5931</b><i>z </i>of the neighboring linkage (e.g., within track <b>5931</b><i>z </i>of linkage <b>5904</b><i>z</i>). Movement of the linkages <b>5904</b><i>z </i>allows the tensile member <b>5930</b><i>z </i>to lengthen when on the outside of the curve and shorten when on the inside of the curve during bending of the rigidizing device. Further, the proximal end section <b>5902</b><i>z </i>can include two sliding clamps <b>5932</b><i>z </i>attached to tensile member <b>5930</b><i>z </i>along opposite axis (i.e., 90 degrees away from one another). The two tensile members <b>5930</b><i>z </i>extend from each of the sliding clamps <b>5932</b><i>z </i>to the distal-most end of the distal section <b>5902</b><i>z</i>. As the distal end section <b>5902</b><i>z </i>is bent, one cable element of each sliding clamp <b>5932</b><i>z </i>gets shorter and one cable element of each sliding clamp <b>5932</b><i>z </i>gets longer, resulting in circumferential movement of the sliding clamps <b>5932</b><i>z</i>. When vacuum or pressure is applied, the outer sleeve can compress the sliding clamps <b>5932</b><i>z </i>to the track <b>5931</b><i>z </i>surface. The sliding clamps <b>5932</b>Z and the track <b>5931</b><i>z </i>surface may be smooth, rough or have teeth.

In some embodiments, the bladder <b>2521</b> and the braid of the braid layer <b>2509</b> can be omitted in the section where the cable <b>2524</b> is not inside the cable guide <b>2599</b>, leaving only inner and outer layers <b>2515</b>, <b>2501</b>, or just an outer layer or just an inner layer.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0263">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>43</b>A-<b>43</b>C</figref>, in some embodiments, the distal end section <b>4602</b><i>z </i>can include active deflection segment <b>4646</b>. The deflection segment <b>4646</b> can include a ribbon or spine extending therethrough that provides bending only in one or more predetermined directions upon activation. The active deflection segment <b>4646</b> can be deflected, for example, using one or more cables, bladders, pullwires, and/or introduction of a guide wire, to a predetermined shape. The active deflection segment <b>4646</b> can thus provide bending of the rigidizing device <b>4600</b> at a fixed location and in a fixed direction. In some embodiments, markers (e.g., radiopaque markers) can be positioned within or proximate to the active deflection segment <b>4646</b> to indicate where the bend will occur and/or in which direction the active deflection segment <b>4646</b> will bend. Bending of the rigidizing device <b>4600</b> using the active deflection segment <b>4646</b> can be advantageous, for example, where bending is required without assistance from the anatomy (i.e., when the anatomical path for the rigidizing device <b>4600</b> is not predefined or constrained by the anatomy). For example, such bending might be useful to create a bend across the open or relatively unconstrained space between the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the atrial septum during transseptal procedures in the mitral valve. The active bending segment <b>4646</b> can be configured to be rigidized (i.e., via pressure or vacuum) as described herein to fix or lock the active deflection segment <b>4646</b> in the bent configuration. Further, the rigidizing device <b>4600</b> can include a steerable distal section <b>4647</b> (e.g., with linkages) in addition to the active deflection segment <b>4646</b>. The steerable distal section <b>4647</b> can be used to point or orient the distal end of the rigidizing device <b>4646</b> in the desired direction (e.g., via cables and/or along four axes), as described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0264">Any of the rigidizing devices described herein can include one or more separately rigidizing sections. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>44</b>A-<b>44</b>C</figref>, in some embodiments, a rigidizing device <b>900</b> can have separate vacuum/pressure chambers <b>975</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>(e.g., four vacuum or pressure chambers) along the length thereof. Each chambers <b>975</b><i>a,b,c,d </i>can have its own vacuum/pressure line <b>927</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>extending thereto for individual rigidization of the chambers <b>975</b><i>a,b,c,d</i>. Pressure seals <b>929</b> can extend between each chamber and/or at the distal end. The rigidizing device <b>900</b> with separately rigidizing chambers <b>975</b><i>a,b,c,d </i>can, in some embodiments, include a steerable distal section <b>902</b><i>z </i>(e.g., with linkages as otherwise described herein). The cables <b>924</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>to control the steerable distal section <b>902</b><i>z </i>can be managed using cable guides <b>999</b> (e.g., there can be at least one, such as 1-4 cable guides <b>999</b> in each vacuum chamber <b>975</b>). In some embodiments, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b>B</figref>, the cables <b>924</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, cable guides <b>999</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, and/or vacuum/pressure lines <b>927</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>can extend within a radial gap <b>911</b> between the innermost layer <b>915</b> and the braid layer <b>909</b> (and thus also beneath the outermost layer <b>901</b>). In other embodiments, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b>C</figref>, the cables <b>924</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, cable guides <b>999</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, and/or vacuum/pressure lines <b>927</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>can extend within the central lumen <b>920</b> of the rigidizing device <b>900</b>. In use of the rigidizing device <b>900</b>, any of the chambers <b>975</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>that are in the flexible state can be steered or deflected in the direction of cable tension while the chambers <b>975</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>that are rigidized will remain in their position and not be deflected. Advantageously, this design allows alternating which chambers <b>975</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are under vacuum/pressure and/or direction of steering to form a variety of complex shapes and provide navigation through the anatomy with minimal looping.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0265">In some embodiments, the distal end section of the rigidizing devices described herein can include an element for local tissue stabilization, such as suction, a balloon or a cage element. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>45</b>A-<b>45</b>D</figref>, in one embodiment, a rigidizing device <b>600</b> can include a balloon <b>666</b> and a balloon inflation lumen or tube <b>667</b> extending thereto. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>45</b>B-<b>45</b>D</figref> (the outer layers have been removed in <b>6</b>B-<b>6</b>C for clarity), the balloon inflation tube <b>667</b> can extend alongside the working channel <b>655</b> (and thus within the radial gap <b>611</b> between the slip layer <b>613</b> and the first braid layer <b>609</b>). As shown in FIGS. <b>45</b>B-<b>45</b>C, the inflation tube <b>667</b> can be configured to include a service loop <b>668</b> that can change lengths (i.e., straighten as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b>B</figref> or obtain a greater bend as in <b>45</b>C) to accommodate bending of the rigidizing device <b>600</b>. In some embodiments, the balloon inflation tube can be spiraled about its axis to accommodate bending. In some embodiments, a vacuum rigidizing device can include a balloon inflation tube between the innermost layer and the braid, between the braid and the outer layer, radially inwards of the inner layer, or radially outwards of the outer layer. In some embodiments, a pressure rigidizing device can include an inflation lumen in the pressure gap, between the bladder and braid, between the braid and outer layer, radially inwards if the inner layer, or radially outwards of the outer layer. For example, the inflation lumen can be positioned similar to as described herein with respect to working channels and/or cables.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0266">As another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>46</b>A-<b>46</b>B</figref> show an exemplary vacuum tip <b>5354</b> for use with a rigidizing device. The vacuum tip <b>5354</b> can include a circumferential array of vacuum holes <b>5358</b> on the distal-most face <b>5359</b>. Further, the array of vacuum holes <b>5358</b> can be connected to a vacuum line <b>5356</b> that runs along the rigidizing device (e.g., within or alongside the layered walls of the rigidizing device). The vacuum line <b>5356</b> can be connected to a source of vacuum such that, when activated, vacuum is provided through the vacuum line <b>5356</b> to each of the holes <b>5358</b> of the array (e.g., through an annular inlet <b>5319</b><i>z</i>). As a result, suction can be provided on the distal-most face <b>5359</b> of the tip <b>5354</b> (and thus the distal-most face of the rigidizing device). Such suction can be useful, for example, to suction tissue thereto (e.g., for stabilization during interventional procedures such as for cannulation of the papilla, e.g., for access to the pancreatic duct or bile duct). The suction can also be useful, for example, for Endoscopic Submucosa Dissection (ESD), or Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection (EFTR).</p><p id="p-0271" num="0267">In some embodiments, the vacuum tip <b>5354</b> can be positioned just distal to a steering section of the rigidizing device, which can advantageously be used to orient the vacuum tip <b>5354</b> in the desired direction. Further, in some embodiments, a tool (e.g., guidewire or scope) can pass through the central lumen <b>5320</b><i>z </i>of the tip <b>5354</b> and between the array of vacuum holes <b>5358</b> to allow for procedures to be performed while suction is activated.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0268">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>47</b>A-<b>47</b>B</figref>, in some embodiments, the vacuum tip <b>5254</b> can include a semi-annular array of holes <b>5238</b> at the distal-most face <b>5259</b> rather than a circumferential array of holes.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0269">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>48</b>A-<b>48</b>B</figref>, in some embodiments, the vacuum tip <b>5454</b> can have an angled distal face <b>5459</b> (e.g., angled at 30-80 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the tip <b>5454</b>, such as 30, 45, 60, 70, or 80 degrees). The angled distal face can advantageously help approach angled anatomy to more easily adhere to the local surface.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0270">The vacuum tips described herein can advantageously provide suction without causing &#x201c;red-out&#x201d; of the endoscopic lens, as the suction can occur locally (e.g., at the holes <b>5358</b>) and not at the lens of the scope. Accordingly, the scope can provide visualization of the tissue even when suction is applied.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0271">In some embodiments, the vacuum tips described herein can include a metallized portion and/or have co-joined wires such that the vacuum tips can conduct current. Such current can be used, for example, to cut or coagulate the suctioned tissue.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0272">In some embodiments, the vacuum tips described herein can be used with a standard endoscope or endoscopic type device that does not include rigidization.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0273">Any of the rigidizing devices described herein can be used with a handle configured to allow manual manipulation and/or activation of the device.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0274">An exemplary handle <b>1031</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>49</b>A-<b>49</b>D</figref>. The handle <b>1031</b> includes an activation element <b>1048</b> in the form of a button configured to activate the vacuum or pressure (the button is shown off in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>49</b>A and <b>49</b>C</figref> and on in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>49</b>B and <b>49</b>D</figref>). Further, a flow path within the handle <b>1031</b> can include a vacuum or pressure inlet port <b>1049</b> configured to be attached to the vacuum or pressure source, a rigidizing device port <b>1050</b> that connects to the rigidizing device via output <b>1073</b><i>z</i>, and a vent port <b>1051</b> that connects to atmosphere. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b>A</figref>, when the activation element <b>1048</b> is in a distal &#x201c;off&#x201d; position (i.e., such that vacuum or pressure for rigidization to the rigidizing device is off), the vent port <b>1051</b> and rigidizing device port <b>1050</b> are in communication with one another, thereby venting any rigidizing pressure or vacuum to the air and allowing the rigidizing device to be in a flexible configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b>B</figref>, when the activation element <b>1048</b> is in a proximal &#x201c;on&#x201d; position (i.e., such that vacuum or pressure to the rigidizing device is on), the rigidizing device port <b>1050</b> and the vacuum or pressure inlet port <b>1049</b> are in communication with one another, thereby supplying pressure or vacuum to the rigidizing device to allow the device to rigidize. In some embodiments, the handle <b>1031</b> can be configured to be bonded to the rigidizing device (e.g., to an inner coil wound tube over the rigidizing device) at bonding region <b>1053</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>49</b>C-D</figref>, the handle includes a status indicator element <b>1067</b><i>z </i>to indicate whether the rigidizing device is in the flexible or rigid configuration. In this embodiment, the status indicator <b>1067</b><i>z </i>is such that the word &#x201c;on&#x201d; shows when the button is placed in the &#x201c;on&#x201d; position, and the word &#x201c;off&#x201d; shows when the button is placed in the &#x201c;off&#x201d; position. In other embodiments, the status indicator can be a symbol, color, light, or moving indicator.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0275">The activation element for a rigidizing device handle as described herein can be a button, switch, toggle, slider, screwed connection, squeeze handle, or stop-cock. Further, the activation element can be planar, a sector, or omnidirectional. The indicator element can include words, lights, or an element that spins with flow of vacuum or pressure. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>50</b>A-<b>50</b>B</figref>, in some embodiments, the activation element <b>1548</b> can be a slider element. The activation element <b>1548</b> can include a connection element <b>1574</b><i>z </i>(e.g., a hollow tube or snap-fit element) configured to slide over a handle. The indicator element <b>1567</b><i>z </i>can be built into the slider (e.g., indicate &#x201c;rigid&#x201d; when the slider is in one position and &#x201c;flexible&#x201d; when the slider is in another position). A similar slider actuation element <b>1648</b> (this one orthogonal) can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>51</b>A-<b>51</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0276">In some embodiments, rather than including the activation element and indicator element on the handle, one or both can be on separate elements. For example, the activation element can be positioned along the vacuum or pressure line between the handle and the vacuum or pressure pump, can be actuated by a foot pedal, can be on the scope umbilical, on the scope shaft, or can be clipped on the patient's bed. In some embodiments, the actuation element can be separate from the handle, but can clip onto the handle during part of the procedure. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>52</b>A-<b>52</b>C</figref> show an activation element <b>1448</b> that includes an attachment mechanism <b>1452</b> (e.g., a c-shaped clip) for detachable coupling to a handle <b>1431</b>. Having the indicator element and/or activation element separate from the handle can advantageously allow the actuator and indicator to be seen more clearly (i.e., not be obstructed by the person's anatomy) and/or can allow the actuator and indicator to be controlled/used more easily by an additional person (e.g., a procedural assistant).</p><p id="p-0281" num="0277"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>53</b>A-D</figref> show a handle <b>1131</b> that is designed to allow manipulation of a rigidizing device, but that does not include an activation element or an indicator element.

For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>54</b>A-<b>54</b>B</figref> show a handle <b>1231</b> having spool valve activation element <b>1248</b> that is shuttled in one direction to activate the vacuum in the rigidizing device and can be shuttled in the opposite direction to deactivate the vacuum or pressure. When deactivating vacuum or pressure to the rigidizing device, the activation element <b>1248</b> can provide venting via vent port <b>1251</b>. The activation element <b>1248</b> can be positioned on the vacuum or pressure line <b>1232</b> leading to the handle, such as 4&#x2033;-8&#x2033;, e.g., 6&#x2033; away from the handle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b>A</figref>, the spool valve with end button indicator element <b>1267</b><i>z </i>can indicate that the rigidizing device is in the flexible configuration (as shown) or the rigid configuration (when pushed in the opposite direction).</p><p id="p-0283" num="0279">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>55</b>A-<b>55</b>C</figref>, the activation element <b>1348</b> can be a rotary valve (e.g., connected to the handle or elsewhere as described herein), and a sliding indicator <b>1367</b><i>z </i>on the rotary valve activation element <b>1348</b> can show that the vacuum or pressure is on (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>C</figref>) or off and vented (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0284" num="0280">In some embodiments, a handle for use with a vacuum rigidizing device can include a mechanism configured to automatically lock the handle in the vacuum or vented configuration. For example, handle <b>7531</b> for use with a vacuum rigidizing device <b>7500</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>56</b>A-<b>56</b>G</figref>. The handle <b>7531</b> includes a handle body <b>7515</b><i>z </i>configured to attach to the rigidizing device <b>7500</b>. The handle <b>7531</b> further includes an activation element <b>7548</b> in the form of a switch ring for supplying vacuum to the rigidizing device <b>7500</b>. The switch ring activation element <b>7548</b> can include a magnet <b>7522</b><i>z </i>that is configured to mate with either a proximal magnet <b>7523</b><i>z </i>(as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b>D</figref>) or a distal magnet <b>7524</b><i>z </i>(as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b>E</figref>). When the switch ring magnet <b>7522</b><i>z </i>is mated with the proximal magnet <b>7523</b><i>z</i>, the vacuum feed line <b>7532</b> in the handle <b>7531</b> is disconnected from the vacuum port <b>7550</b> to the rigidizing device, and both the rigidizing device and the vacuum are vented or open to the atmosphere (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b>F</figref>). When the switch ring magnet <b>7522</b><i>z </i>is mated with the distal magnet <b>7523</b><i>z</i>, the vacuum feed line <b>7532</b> in the handle <b>7531</b> is connected to the vacuum port <b>7550</b> to the rigidizing device so as to supply vacuum thereto (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b>G</figref>). Advantageously, the magnets <b>7522</b><i>z</i>, <b>7523</b><i>z</i>, <b>7524</b><i>z </i>can lock the switch ring <b>7548</b> in the vacuum or vent configurations, thereby preventing harm to the patient that could result if in the unintended configuration (e.g., attempted movement of the device <b>7500</b> through the anatomy when in a rigid configuration when it could damage the anatomy). In some embodiments, the magnet <b>7522</b><i>z </i>can be a ferrous material while the magnets <b>7523</b><i>z</i>, <b>7524</b><i>z </i>can be magnets or vice versa. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>56</b>A-<b>56</b>B</figref>, the handle <b>7531</b> can further include a user grip <b>7521</b><i>z </i>for the user's hand with a grip cover <b>7525</b><i>z </i>configured to cover the vacuum feed tube line <b>7532</b> in the handle <b>7531</b>. Further, the vacuum feed tube line <b>7532</b> can connect directly to the switch ring activation element <b>7548</b>. The vacuum feed line <b>7532</b> may have a spiral or winding shape under the grip cover <b>7525</b><i>z</i>, which can allow the switch ring activation element <b>7548</b> to move proximally and distally without restricted motion caused by the vacuum feed line <b>7532</b>. The spiraling of the vacuum feed line <b>7532</b> may be from 30 to about 1440 degrees. For instance, 90 degrees (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b>C</figref> where the grip cover is removed for clarity) 180, 360 and 720 degrees. The grip cover <b>7525</b><i>z </i>may be designed such that it covers the whole vacuum feed line <b>7532</b> even when the spiral goes all the way around the handle <b>7531</b>. The handle <b>7531</b> can further include a stopper flange <b>7561</b> to prevent the handle <b>7531</b> from moving into the anatomy (for instance, the stopper flange may prevent the device from passing through the anus or through an oral bite guard), a proximal handle port <b>7526</b><i>z </i>for insertion of a scope or other working tool therethrough, and/or an indicator element <b>7567</b><i>z</i>. The indicator element <b>7567</b><i>z </i>is a band that is visible only when the switch ring activation element <b>7548</b> is in the distal position. The indicator element <b>7567</b><i>z </i>may have a different color and or value than the rest of the handle, preferably a color that contrasts sharply and is visible in reduced lighting configurations. For instance, the handle <b>7531</b> may be white and the indicator element <b>7567</b><i>z </i>may be a medium to dark blue. The indicator element <b>7567</b><i>z </i>band may also have a different texture than the rest of the handle <b>7531</b>. For instance, it may have raised bumps or a crosshatching.

The handle includes a gap inlet <b>6293</b> and a vent gap inlet <b>6223</b>. Pressure gap inlet <b>6293</b> connects to pressure gap <b>6212</b> (via pressure line <b>6294</b>). Vent gap inlet <b>6223</b> (which can extend all the way through the handle to exit on both sides thereof) connects to gap <b>6206</b> around the braid layer <b>6209</b> (between the bladder <b>6221</b> and the outermost layer <b>6201</b>).

For example, an exemplary handle <b>7431</b> attached to a pressure rigidizing device <b>7400</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>58</b>A-<b>58</b>E</figref>. The handle <b>7431</b> includes a handle body <b>7415</b><i>z </i>and a grip/lever <b>7411</b><i>z </i>that can be activated to provide pressure medium to the rigidizing device <b>7400</b>, such as pressure medium pre-filled or stored in the fluid chamber <b>7412</b><i>z </i>of the handle <b>7431</b>. The chamber <b>7412</b><i>z </i>can, for example, be bordered by a rolling diaphragm <b>7416</b><i>z</i>. The grip/lever <b>7411</b><i>z </i>can include teeth <b>7476</b><i>z </i>that mate with a rack <b>7414</b><i>z </i>of a piston <b>7413</b><i>z</i>. As the grip/lever <b>7411</b><i>z </i>is moved towards the handle body <b>7415</b><i>z</i>, the piston <b>7413</b><i>z </i>can move distally towards the rolling diaphragm <b>7416</b><i>z </i>of the fluid chamber <b>7412</b><i>z</i>. As the rolling diaphragm <b>7416</b><i>z </i>is pushed distally, it forces the pressure medium from the chamber <b>7412</b><i>z </i>through the gap inlet <b>7493</b> to the pressure gap <b>7412</b> outside of the bladder <b>7421</b> for stiffening (and air or other fluids can likewise escape from around the braid layer via vent <b>7423</b>). In some embodiments, the handle <b>7431</b> can include a locking mechanism (e.g., via a click on/click off mechanism, such as that found in a ball point pen) with spring and feeler <b>7778</b><i>z </i>configured to lock the grip/lever <b>7411</b><i>z </i>against the body <b>7415</b><i>z </i>so as to lock the rigidizing device <b>7400</b> in the rigid configuration. Similarly, when the grip/lever <b>7411</b><i>z </i>is pushed against the body again, the grip/lever <b>7411</b> can be released, and the fluid can move back into the fluid chamber <b>7412</b><i>z </i>via inlet <b>7493</b>.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0283">In some embodiments, the handle <b>7431</b> can further include a pressure relief valve <b>7417</b><i>z </i>between the chamber <b>7412</b><i>z </i>and an overflow chamber <b>7418</b><i>z</i>. When the pressure in the fluid chamber <b>7412</b><i>z </i>reaches a predetermined maximum pressure (e.g., 5 atm), the pressure relief valve <b>7417</b><i>z </i>can open to allow fluid to be channeled into the overflow chamber <b>7418</b><i>z</i>. The fluid chamber <b>7412</b><i>z </i>can be overfilled during manufacturing such that the valve <b>7417</b> always opens upon the first activation of the grip/lever <b>7411</b><i>z</i>, which can ensure calibration of the handle <b>7431</b> to the desired pressure. One exemplary method of filling the fluid chamber <b>7412</b><i>z </i>can include: (1) attaching the handle <b>7431</b> to a filling fitting that attaches to a tube leading to the pressure system; (2) drawing a vacuum on the handle to remove air through that filling fitting; (3) while maintaining vacuum, introducing water, DI, Saline, an oil or another incompressible fluid into the system through the filling fitting; and (4) crimping and sealing the tube (via a mechanical crimp, via melting the tube, etc.) distal to the pressure fitting and then removing the pressure fitting, leaving the crimped/sealed tube in the handle.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0284">Any of the handles described herein can have a pressure indicating feature built in. For instance, the handles may have a pressure gauge. The handles may include a feature, such as a piston, that is displaced to give a visual indication that the device is pressurized. The handles may have a feature that flips or turns such that it displays a different color; for instance, it may display a green dot at atmospheric pressure and red dot when rigidized. In some embodiments, the visual indication can be seen on fluoroscopy.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0285">Any of the pressure rigidizing handles described may have an emergency venting feature if, for some reason, the handle passageways became clogged. The emergency venting feature can, for example, allow for incising of the device, thereby breaking its pressure cavity. The emergency venting feature can, for example, be a valve distal to the handle (for example, a swabable valve), such that should the valve be actuated, the device would vent pressure and therefore de-rigidize.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0286">Any of the rigidizing devices described herein can include built-in cameras, lighting, etc. to provide for on-board imaging. In some embodiments (and as shown below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>63</b></figref>), the cameras and lighting can be positioned at the distal tip of the device. In other embodiments, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref>, a rigidizing device <b>8200</b> can include a camera <b>8234</b><i>z </i>and lighting <b>8235</b><i>z </i>mounted on the elongate body <b>8203</b><i>z </i>proximal to the distal end <b>8202</b><i>z </i>of the device (e.g., proximal to steering linkages <b>8204</b><i>z</i>).</p><p id="p-0291" num="0287">In some embodiments, the rigidizing devices described herein can be configured as an introducer (i.e., an instrument for introduction of a flexible device, such as an introducer sheath for interventional cardiology). For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b></figref>, a rigidizing device <b>8700</b> can include a rigidizing elongate body <b>8703</b><i>z </i>with a tapered distal tip <b>8733</b><i>z</i>. The device <b>8700</b> can further include a hemostatic valve <b>8749</b><i>z </i>and/or a flush line <b>8748</b><i>z. </i></p><p id="p-0292" num="0288">The braid described herein can include or be replaced by a mesh, a woven material, a ribbon or a cloth. In some embodiments, the braid can be non-woven (i.e., fibers at different angles may not go over and under each other but instead be on separate layers that do not cross each other). Similarly, the braid can be replaced by a stent or a structure (e.g., metal structure) cut from a hypodermic tube.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0289">In some embodiments, the rigidizing devices described herein can be configured to be loaded over the side of the scope or other instrument (e.g., rather than requiring insertion of the scope/instrument into the proximal end of the rigidizing device). For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>61</b>A-<b>61</b>B</figref>, the rigidizing device <b>400</b> can be split along the length thereof (i.e., split longitudinally through the wall from the proximal end to the distal end). Further, a connection feature <b>444</b> can connect the split wall together. In some embodiments, the connection feature <b>444</b> can be reusable. For example, the connection feature <b>444</b> can be a series of magnets that can engage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b>A</figref>) to hold the rigidizing device <b>400</b> together and disengage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b>B</figref>) to provide side access for the scope/instrument. Other exemplary reusable connection features include zippers, interlocking zip-lock male and female configuration, or reusable tape. In some embodiments, the connection feature <b>444</b> can be permanent and not reusable, such as permanent tape or adhesive.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0290">In some embodiments, the vacuum and pressure multi-layered systems described herein can be used to create stiffness for non-cylindrical or non-tubular structures. For example, the systems described herein could be used to create a balloon that assumes the desired shape when pressurized and/or rigidized. Such a structure can be a flexible structure that nevertheless contains elements that exhibit high hoop stiffness, such as wire (tension or compression) or thin fiber strands (tension).</p><p id="p-0295" num="0291">In some embodiments, the rigidizing devices described herein can include proximal and distal seals within the innermost layer to create a space between the scope or instrument and the innermost layer to hold lubrication.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0292">In some embodiments, the rigidizing devices described herein can be used in conjunction with other versions of the product. For example, an endoscope can include the rigidizing mechanisms described herein, and a rigidizing device can include the rigidizing mechanisms described herein. Used together, they can create a nested system that can advance, one after the other, allowing one of the elements to always remain stiffened, such that looping is reduced or eliminated (i.e., they can create a sequentially advancing nested system).</p><p id="p-0297" num="0293">An exemplary nested system <b>2300</b><i>z </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>62</b></figref>. The system <b>2300</b><i>z </i>can include an outer rigidizing device <b>2300</b> and an inner rigidizing device <b>2310</b> (here, configured as a rigidizing scope) that are axially movable with respect to one another either concentrically or non-concentrically. The outer rigidizing device <b>2300</b> and the inner rigidizing device <b>2310</b> can include any of the rigidizing features as described herein. For example, the outer rigidizing device <b>2300</b> can include an outermost layer <b>2301</b><i>a</i>, a braided layer <b>2309</b><i>a</i>, and an inner layer <b>2315</b><i>a </i>including a coil wound therethrough. The outer rigidizing device <b>2300</b> can be, for example, configured to receive vacuum between the outermost layer <b>2301</b><i>a </i>and the inner layer <b>2315</b><i>a </i>to provide rigidization. Similarly, the inner scope <b>2310</b> can include an outer layer <b>2301</b><i>b </i>(e.g., with a coil wound therethrough), a braid layer <b>2309</b><i>b</i>, a bladder layer <b>2321</b><i>b</i>, and an inner layer <b>2315</b><i>b </i>(e.g., with a coil wound therethrough). The inner scope <b>2310</b> can be, for example, configured to receive pressure between the bladder <b>2321</b><i>b </i>and the inner layer <b>2315</b><i>b </i>to provide rigidization. Further, an air/water channel <b>2336</b><i>z </i>and a working channel <b>2355</b> can extend through the inner rigidizing device <b>2310</b>. Additionally, the inner rigidizing scope <b>2310</b> can include a distal section <b>2302</b><i>z </i>with a camera <b>2334</b><i>z</i>, lights <b>2335</b><i>z</i>, and steerable linkages <b>2304</b><i>z</i>. A cover <b>2327</b><i>z </i>can extend over the distal section <b>2302</b><i>z</i>. In another embodiment, the camera and/or lighting can be delivered in a separate assembly (e.g., the camera and lighting can be bundled together in a catheter and delivered down the working channel <b>2355</b> and/or an additional working channel to the distal-most end <b>2333</b><i>z</i>).</p><p id="p-0298" num="0294">An interface <b>2337</b><i>z </i>can be positioned between the inner rigidizing device <b>2310</b> and the outer rigidizing device <b>2300</b>. The interface <b>2337</b><i>z </i>can be a gap, for example, having a dimension d (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>62</b></figref>) of 0.001&#x2033;-0.050&#x2033;, such as 0.0020&#x2033;, 0.005&#x2033;, or 0.020&#x2033; thick. In some embodiments, the interface <b>2337</b><i>z </i>can be low friction and include, for example, powder, coatings, or laminations to reduce the friction. In some embodiments, there can be seals between the inner rigidizing device <b>2310</b> and outer rigidizing device <b>2300</b>, and the intervening space can be pressurized, for example, with fluid or water, to create a hydrostatic bearing. In other embodiments, there can be seals between the inner rigidizing device <b>2310</b> and outer rigidizing device <b>2300</b>, and the intervening space can be filled with small spheres to reduce friction.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0295">The inner rigidizing device <b>2310</b> and outer rigidizing device <b>2300</b> can move relative to one another and alternately rigidize so as to transfer a bend or shape down the length of the nested system <b>2300</b><i>z</i>. For example, the inner device <b>2310</b> can be inserted into a lumen and bent or steered into the desired shape. Pressure can be applied to the inner rigidizing device <b>2310</b> to cause the braid elements to engage and lock the inner rigidizing device <b>2310</b> in the configuration. The rigidizing device (for instance, in a flexible state) <b>2300</b> can then be advanced over the rigid inner device <b>2310</b>. When the outer rigidizing device <b>2300</b> reaches the tip of the inner device <b>2310</b>, vacuum can be applied to the rigidizing device <b>2300</b> to cause the layers to engage and lock to fix the shape of the rigidizing device. The inner device <b>2310</b> can be transitioned to a flexible state, advanced, and the process repeated. Although the system <b>2300</b><i>z </i>is described as including a rigidizing device and an inner device configured as a scope, it should be understood that other configurations are possible. For example, the system might include two overtubes, two catheters, or a combination of overtube, catheter, and scope.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0296"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>63</b></figref> shows another exemplary nested system <b>2700</b><i>z</i>. System <b>2700</b><i>z </i>is similar to system <b>2300</b><i>z </i>except that it includes a cover <b>2738</b><i>z </i>attached to both the inner and outer rigidizing device <b>2710</b>, <b>2700</b>. The cover <b>2738</b><i>z </i>may be, for example, low-durometer and thin-walled to allow elasticity and stretching. The cover <b>2738</b><i>z </i>may be a rubber, such as urethane, latex, or silicone. The cover <b>2738</b><i>z </i>may protect the interface/radial gap between the inner and outer devices <b>2710</b>, <b>2700</b>. The cover <b>2738</b><i>z </i>may prevent contamination from entering the space between the inner and outer tubes. The cover <b>2738</b><i>z </i>may further prevent tissue and other substances from becoming trapped in the space between the inner and outer tubes. The cover <b>2738</b><i>z </i>may stretch to allow the inner device <b>2710</b> and outer device <b>2700</b> to travel independently of one another within the elastic limits of the material. The cover <b>2738</b><i>z </i>may be bonded or attached to the rigidizing devices <b>2710</b>, <b>2700</b> in such a way that the cover <b>2738</b><i>z </i>is always at a minimum slightly stretched. This embodiment may be wiped down externally for cleaning. In some embodiments, the cover <b>2738</b><i>z </i>can be configured as a &#x201c;rolling&#x201d; seal, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,447,491, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0297"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>64</b>A-<b>64</b>B</figref> show another exemplary nested system <b>9400</b><i>z</i>. In this system <b>9400</b><i>z</i>, the outer rigidizing device <b>9400</b> includes steering and imaging (e.g., similar to a scope) while the inner device includes only rigidization (though it could include additional steering elements as described elsewhere herein). Thus, outer device <b>9400</b> includes linkages or other steering means disclosed herein <b>9404</b><i>z</i>, camera <b>9434</b><i>z</i>, and lighting <b>9435</b><i>z</i>. The outer device <b>9400</b> can further include a central passageway <b>9439</b><i>z </i>for access to the inner device <b>9410</b> (e.g., lumens such as working channels therein). In some embodiments, bellows or a loop of tubing can connect the passageway <b>9439</b><i>z </i>to lumens of the inner device <b>9410</b>. Similar to the other nested systems, at least one of the devices <b>9410</b>, <b>9400</b> can be rigidized at a time while the other can conform to the rigidization and/or move through the anatomy. Here, the outer device <b>9400</b> can lead the inner device <b>9410</b> (the inner device <b>9410</b> is shown retracted relative to the outer device <b>9400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>A</figref> and extended substantially even with the outer device <b>9400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>B</figref>). Advantageously, system <b>9400</b><i>z </i>can provide a smooth exterior surface to avoid pinching the anatomy and/or entrance of fluid between the inner and outer devices <b>9410</b>, <b>9400</b>. Having the steering on the outer device <b>9400</b> can also provide additional leverage for steering the tip. Also, the outer device can facilitate better imaging capabilities due to the larger diameter of the outer device <b>9400</b> and its ability to accommodate a larger camera.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0298"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>65</b>A-<b>65</b>H</figref> show the exemplary use of a nested system <b>2400</b><i>z </i>as described herein. At <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>A</figref>, the inner rigidizing device <b>2410</b> is positioned within the outer rigidizing device <b>2400</b> such that the distal end of the inner rigidizing device <b>2410</b> extends outside of the outer rigidizing device <b>2400</b>. At <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>B</figref>, the distal end of the inner rigidizing device <b>2410</b> is bent in the desired direction/orientation and then rigidized (e.g., using vacuum or pressure as described herein). At <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>C</figref>, the outer rigidizing device <b>2400</b> (in the flexible configuration) is advanced over the rigidized inner rigidizing device <b>2410</b> (including over the bending distal section). Once the distal end of the outer rigidizing device <b>2400</b> is sufficiently advanced over the distal end of the inner rigidizing device <b>2410</b>, then the outer rigidizing device <b>2400</b> can be rigidized (e.g., using vacuum or pressure as described herein). At <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>D</figref>, the inner rigidizing device <b>2410</b> can then be transitioned to the flexible state (e.g., by removing the vacuum or pressure as described herein and by allowing the steering cables to go slack such that tip can move easily) and can be advanced and directed/oriented/steered as desired. Alternately, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>D</figref>, the inner rigidizing device <b>2410</b> can be actively steered (either manually or via computational control) as it emerges such that is minimizes the load on the rigidized outer tube. Minimizing the load on the outer rigidizing device <b>2400</b> makes it easier for this tube to hold the rigidized shape. Once the inner rigidizing device <b>2410</b> is rigidized, the outer rigidizing device <b>2400</b> can be transitioned to the flexible state and advanced thereover (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>E</figref>). The process can then be repeated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>65</b>F-H</figref>.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0299">In some embodiments, at the completion of the sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>65</b>A-H</figref>, a third rigidizing device can be slid over the first two rigidizing devices (<b>2400</b>, <b>2410</b>) and rigidized. Rigidizing devices <b>2400</b> and <b>2410</b> can then be withdrawn. Finally, a fourth rigidizing device can be inserted through the inner lumen of the third tube. This fourth rigidizing device may have a larger diameter and more features than rigidizing device <b>2410</b>. For instance, it may have a larger working channel, more working channels, a better camera, or combinations thereof. This technique can allow two smaller tubes, which tend to be more flexible and maneuverable, to reach deep into the body while still ultimately deliver a larger tube for therapeutic purposes. Alternately, in the example above, the fourth rigidizing device can be a regular endoscope as is known in the art.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0300">In some embodiments, at the completion of the sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>65</b>A-H</figref>, outer rigidizing device <b>2400</b> may be rigidized and then the inner rigidizing device <b>2410</b> may be removed. For example, the rigidizing device <b>2410</b> may be a &#x201c;navigation&#x201d; device comprising a camera, lighting and a distal steering section. The &#x201c;navigation&#x201d; device <b>2410</b> may be well sealed such that it is easy to clean between procedures. A second inner device may then be placed inside the rigidized outer device <b>2400</b> and advanced past the distal end of the outer device <b>2400</b>. The second inner device may be a &#x201c;therapeutic&#x201d; tube comprising such elements as a camera, lights, water, suction and various tools. The &#x201c;therapeutic&#x201d; device may not have a steering section or the ability to rigidize, thereby giving additional room in the body of the therapeutic tube for the inclusion of other features, for example, tools for performing therapies. Once in place, the tools on the &#x201c;therapeutic&#x201d; tube may be used to perform a therapy in the body, such as, for example, a mucosal resection or dissection in the human GI tract.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0301">In another embodiment, after or during the completion of the sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>65</b>A-H</figref>, a third device may be inserted inside inner tube <b>2410</b>. The third device may be rigidizing and/or an endoscope.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0302">Although the outer rigidizing device for the nested systems described herein is often referred to as rigidizing via vacuum and the inner scope rigidizing device as rigidizing via pressure, the opposite can be true (i.e., the outer rigidizing device can rigidize via pressure and the inner rigidizing device via vacuum) and/or both can have the same rigidizing source (pressure and/or vacuum).</p><p id="p-0307" num="0303">Although the inner and outer elements of the nested systems are generally described as including integrated rigidizing elements, the rigidizing elements can be separate (e.g., so as to allow relative sliding between the imaging scope elements and the rigidizing elements).</p><p id="p-0308" num="0304">The rigidizing devices of the nested systems described herein can be designed such that inner rigidizing device can't rotate substantially within outer rigidizing device when they are assembled. For instance, the outer surface of the inner rigidizing device can have longitudinal ridges and grooves that form a spline. The inner surface of the outer rigidizing device can have corresponding ridges and grooves that mate with the same features in the outer rigidizing device.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0305">Either or both of the rigidizing devices of the nested systems described herein can be steerable. If both rigidizing devices are steerable, an algorithm can be implemented that steers whichever rigidizing device is flexible and moving longitudinally. The algorithm can steer the flexible rigidizing device to anticipate the shape of the rigidized device thus minimizing the tendency for the moving, flexible rigidizing device to straighten the rigid device.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0306">If one rigidizing device of the nested systems described herein requires vacuum and the other rigidizing device requires pressure, user controls can be constructed in which moving one vs. the other (outer and inner) involves flipping a switch, with the switch toggling between a first condition in which, for example, one is pressurized for rigidity when the other is vented for flexibility and a second condition in which one is vented for flexibility and the other is vacuumed for stiffness. This, for example, could be a foot pedal or a hand switch.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0307">In some embodiments, the alternate movement of the nested systems described herein can be controlled manually. In other embodiments, the alternate movement can be controlled automatically, via a computer and/or with a motorized motion control system.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0308">The nested systems described herein can advantageously be of similar stiffness. This can ensure that the total stiffnesses of the nested system is relatively continuous. The nested systems described herein can be small so as to fit in a variety of different anatomies. For example, for neurology applications, the outside diameter of the system can be between 0.05&#x2033;-0.15&#x2033;, such as approximately 0.1&#x2033;. For cardiology applications, the outside diameter of the system can be between 0.1&#x2033;-0.3&#x2033;, such as approximately 0.2&#x2033;. For gastrointestinal applications, the outside diameter of the system can be between 0.3&#x2033;-1.0&#x2033;, such as 0.8&#x2033;. Further, the nested systems described herein can maintain high stiffness even at a small profile. For example, the change in relative stiffness from the flexible configuration to the rigid configuration can be multiples of 10&#xd7;, 20&#xd7;, 30&#xd7;, and even larger. Additionally, the nested systems described herein can advantageously move smoothly relative to one another.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0309">The nested systems described herein can advantageously navigate an arbitrary path, or an open, complex, or tortuous space, and create a range of free-standing complex shapes. The nested systems can further advantageously provide shape propagation, allowing for shape memory to be imparted from one element to another. In some embodiments, periodically, both tubes can be placed in a partially or fully flexible state such that, for instance, the radii or curvature of the system increases, and the surrounding anatomy provides support to the system. The pressure or vacuum being used to rigidize the tubes can be reduced or stopped to place the tubes in a partially or fully flexible state. This momentary relaxation (for instance, for 1-10 seconds) may allow the system to find a shape that more closely matches the anatomy it is travelling through. For instance, in the colon, this relaxation may gently open tight turns in the anatomy.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0310">In some embodiments, the stiffness capabilities of the inner or outer rigidizing devices may be designed such that tight turns formed by the inner rigidizing device at its tip, when copied by the outer rigidizing device, are gradually opened up (made to have a larger radius) as the shape propagates proximally down the outer tube. For instance, the outer rigidizing device may be designed to have a higher minimum radius of curvature when rigidized.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0311">The nested systems are continuous (i.e., non-segmented) and therefor provide smooth and continuous movement through the body (e.g., the intestines). The nested systems can be disposable and low-cost.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0312">In some embodiments, the outer rigidizing device can be a dynamically rigidizing overtube (e.g., as described in PCT/US18/42946, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein). In some embodiments, the inner rigidizing device can be a rigidizing system or a commercially available scope, for example a 5 mm diameter nasal scope. Utilizing rigidization and a nested system enables the utilization of a smaller scope that delivers, compared to a duodenoscope, more flexibility if desired, more stiffness if desired, enhanced maneuverability, and the ability to articulate at a much smaller radius of curvature.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0313">In some embodiments, upon reaching the target destination, the inner rigidizing device of a nested system can be withdrawn. The outer rigidizing device can remain rigidized and contrast can be injected through the inner element's space to fluoroscopically image.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0314">RF coils can be used in any of the nested systems described herein to provide a 3-D representation of whatever shape the nested system takes. That representation can be used to re-create a shape or return to a given point (e.g., for reexamination by the doctor after an automated colonoscopy).</p><p id="p-0319" num="0315">In some embodiments, the nested systems described herein can be useful as a complete endoscope, with the internal structure carrying the payload of working channels, pressurization lines, vacuum lines, tip wash, and electronics for lighting and imaging (vision systems, ultrasound, x-ray, MRI).</p><p id="p-0320" num="0316">The nested systems described herein can be used, for example, for colonoscopy. Such a colonoscopy nested system can reduce or eliminate looping. It could eliminate the need for endoscopic reduction. Without looping, the procedure can combine the speed and low cost of a sigmoidoscopy with the efficacy of a colonoscopy. Additionally, colonoscopy nested systems can eliminate conscious sedation and its associated costs, time, risks, and facility requirements. Further, procedural skill can be markedly reduced for such colonoscopy procedures by using the nested systems described herein. Further, in some embodiments, the nested systems described herein can provide automated colonoscopy, wherein a vision system automatically drives the nested system down the center of the colon while looking for polyps. Such an automated system would advantageously not require sedation nor a doctor for the basic exam while allowing the doctor to follow up for further examination if required.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0317">In some embodiments, a rigidizing device as described herein can be configured as a rigidizing rod.

The outer layer <b>4901</b> can be a wire-reinforced layer, such as a coil reinforced urethane tube. The braid layer <b>4901</b> can include braided strands <b>4933</b> and can include any of the features of other braid layers described herein.

In other embodiments, the distal end of the inner bladder layer <b>4921</b> can be sealed to itself or to the atraumatic distal tip and the proximal end can be configured to have an inlet to the inside of the inner bladder layer <b>4921</b> (i.e., radially inward of the inner bladder layer <b>4921</b>) to provide pressure rigidization. When pressure rigidization is used, the rod <b>4900</b> can further include a vent on the distal and/or proximal end to allow venting of air from between the inner bladder layer <b>4921</b> and outer layer <b>4901</b> (thereby allowing the bladder <b>4921</b> to fully push the braid layer <b>4909</b> against the outer layer <b>4901</b>).</p><p id="p-0323" num="0319">In some embodiments, the outer surface of the outer layer <b>4901</b> can be coated to provide a low friction surface including a hydrophilic coating. In some embodiments, the outer diameter of the rod <b>4900</b> can be less than 5 mm, less than 4 mm, or less than 3 mm. For example, the outer diameter can be between 2 mm and 5 mm, such as between 2.5 mm and 3 mm, such as approximately 2.8 mm. In some embodiments, an angle of the braid of the braid layer <b>4909</b> can be less than 25 degrees relative to a longitudinal axis of the tube, such as approximately 5-15 degrees. In some embodiments, there can be between 10 and 50 strands, such as 20-40 strands, extending within the braid layer <b>4909</b>.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0320">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b></figref>, the rod <b>4900</b> can be used, for example, as a stiffening wire for colonoscopy. In use as such, the colonoscope <b>5091</b> can be inserted into the patient's colon. If looping occurs (thereby hindering advancement of the colonoscope), the scope <b>5091</b> can be left in place, the working channel <b>5055</b> of the scope <b>5091</b> can be flushed, water can be applied to the outer surface of the rod <b>4900</b> to activate the hydrophilic coating, and the rod <b>4900</b> can be inserted in the flexible state (i.e., un-rigidized) through the working channel <b>5055</b>. Once the rod <b>4900</b> is fully inserted into the endoscope such that the distal end of the rod <b>4900</b> is flush with the distal end of the colonoscope <b>5091</b> vacuum or pressure can be applied to the rod <b>4900</b> (e.g., via pressure inlet and/or connector <b>5063</b><i>z</i>), thereby rigidizing the rod. In some embodiments, the pressure or vacuum can be supplied to the rod <b>4900</b> through a syringe or locking insufflator The colonoscope <b>5091</b> can be advanced over the rod <b>4900</b> and relative to the patient while holding the rod <b>4900</b> stationary relative to the patient. The vacuum or pressure can be removed to advance or remove the rigidizing rod <b>4900</b>.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0321">Advantageously, the rod <b>4900</b> can thus be inserted into the scope <b>5091</b> in a flexible configuration so as to navigate around turns easily relative to a standard stiffening wire (i.e., relative to a stiffening wire of fixed rigidity). Further, the rod <b>4900</b> can conform to the shape of the looped colon in the flexible configuration while providing a rigid track for the scope to ride along in the rigid configuration. Dynamic transitions of the rod <b>4900</b> between flexible and stiff configurations can prevent unwanted straightening of the scope <b>5091</b> (which can otherwise occur with standard stiffening wires). Further, the atraumatic tip of the rod <b>4900</b> can prevent damaging of the working channel <b>5055</b>. The rigidizing rod <b>4900</b> can further be relatively long (e.g., longer than the scope) without prohibiting navigation of the scope because the scope moves over and along the rigidizing rod <b>4900</b>, and thus the rod <b>4900</b> can work with a variety of scopes regardless of length of the scope. Similarly, the rod <b>4900</b> can have a diameter of 3.2 mm or less and can thus work with a variety of endoscopes regardless of diameter (as most endoscopes have a working channel that is 3.2 mm or larger).</p><p id="p-0326" num="0322">The rigidizing systems and devices described herein can be used to treat or access a number of different anatomical locations.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0323">In one method of use, during a surgical procedure, a rigidizing device as described herein can be introduced to the patient in the flexible configuration. Once the distal end of the rigidizing device is positioned past the challenging anatomy (e.g., a portion of the anatomy that would cause looping or is otherwise difficult to pass with a standard instrument), the rigidizing device can be transitioned to the rigid configuration. An instrument (e.g., a scope) can then be passed over or through the rigid device.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0324">For example, the devices described herein can be used to navigate the gastrointestinal tract, to reach anatomical locations in the stomach, for abdominal access to anatomical locations otherwise blocked by other organs, for interventional endoscopic procedures (including ESD (Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection) and EMR (Endoscopic Mucosal Resection)), for direct cholangioscopy, for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, for cardiac applications, for resection or snaring of a lesion in the gastrointestinal tract, for enteroscopy, for EUS, to access the lungs, to access the kidneys, for neuro applications, for treatment of chronic total occlusions, for laparoscopic manual tools, for contralateral leg access, for ear nose and throat applications, during esophagogastroduodenoscopy, for transoral robotic surgery, for flexible robotic endoscopy, for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, or for altered anatomy cases. Specific examples are further described below.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0325">Further, the rigidizing devices described herein can have different dimensions depending upon the desired application. For example, a rigidizing device can have an inner diameter of approximately 0.3&#x2033;-0.8&#x2033; (e.g., 0.5&#x2033;), an outer diameter of 0.4&#x2033;-1.0&#x2033; (e.g., 0.6&#x2033;), and a length of 50-200 cm, such as 75-150 cm, when designed, for example, for use in the gastrointestinal tract. The rigidizing device can have an inner diameter of, for example, 0.04&#x2033;-0.3&#x2033; (e.g., 0.2&#x2033;), an outer diameter of 0.06&#x2033;-0.4&#x2033;, and a length of 30-130 cm when designed, for example, for use in the cardiac vessels.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0326">The rigidizing devices described herein can be used as overtubes for scopes in at least three different manners: (I) placement of the overtube after the scope has reached the destination; (II) overtube follows the scope closely, but remains proximal to the tip of the scope until the scope has reached its destination; or (III) the point and shoot method. An exemplary rigidizing device <b>2000</b> and scope <b>2091</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>68</b>A-<b>68</b>B</figref></p><p id="p-0331" num="0327">For method I, the scope <b>2091</b> can be placed in the body at the desired location using standard technique, and then the rigidizing device <b>2000</b> can be advanced from the proximal end until the rigidizing device <b>2000</b> is sufficiently supporting the scope <b>2091</b>. For instance, in order to perform a resection in the colon, a doctor may advance a colonoscope to the target site and then advance a rigidizing device almost or completely to the tip of the endoscope. The rigidizing device <b>2000</b> may then be rigidized. The rigidized device <b>2000</b> can, for example, advantageously enhance control during resection of a colon by providing a stable surgical platform. The rigidized device <b>2000</b> can also advantageously facilitate a good connection between the doctor's hand motion of the shaft of the scope <b>2091</b> external to the patient and motion of the tip of the scope <b>2091</b> (so called &#x201c;1 to 1&#x201d; motion).</p><p id="p-0332" num="0328">For method II, the scope <b>2091</b> may lead the rigidizing device <b>2000</b> (for example, the distal end of the scope <b>2091</b> and the distal end of the rigidizing device <b>2000</b> may never approximately align) with the rigidizing device repeatedly being switched between a flexible and rigid state to aid advancement of the scope. For example, when advancing the scope <b>2091</b>, the rigidizing device <b>2000</b> may be rigid, helping to prevent scope looping and aiding in scope force transmission. Once the scope <b>2091</b> has been advanced, the rigidizing device may be made flexible again and advanced distally on the scope. The process may be repeated.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0329">Method III may include the following steps: (1) rigidizing device <b>2000</b> can be in a flexible state with the distal end of the rigidizing device <b>2000</b> approximately aligned with the distal end of the scope <b>2091</b>; (2) scope <b>2091</b> can be steered with the distal end of the rigidizing device <b>2000</b> positioned thereover and therefore being steered by the scope <b>2091</b>; (3) rigidizing device <b>2000</b> can be placed in a rigid state that mirrors the steering position of the scope <b>2091</b>; (4) the distal end of scope <b>2091</b> can be advanced. This point and shoot method can advantageously allow the scope <b>2091</b> to be advanced in the direction to which the tip of the scope <b>2091</b> is pointing. In some embodiments, the steps can be repeated to advance the rigidizing device <b>2000</b> and scope <b>2091</b> within a body cavity or lumen.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0330">It should be understood that methods I-III can be used in combination with one another. Further, in some embodiments, the rigidizing device can be steerable to further provide direction for the scope.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0331">The three different manners of control can be used in the digestive tract. For example, these techniques may allow an endoscope <b>2691</b><i>a </i>to be positioned in the upper digestive tract <b>2646</b><i>z </i>with a rigidizing device <b>2600</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>A</figref>. As another example, a rigidizing device <b>2600</b><i>b </i>may be used to position an endoscope <b>2691</b><i>b </i>in the lower digestive tract <b>2647</b><i>z </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>B</figref>. The described manners of control may make the positioning shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>69</b>A and <b>69</b>B</figref> easier and faster to achieve, while minimizing risk of complications (such as GI tract perforation) and reducing or eliminating patient discomfort form endoscopic looping.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0332">The rigidizing devices and systems described herein can be used for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and/or direct cholangioscopy (DC). The goal of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is to diagnose and treat disease in the bile and pancreatic ducts. This is most commonly performed with a side viewing duodenoscope by navigating a guidewire into the bile and pancreatic ducts, injecting contrast into the ducts, viewing under fluoroscopy, and passing various tools through the ducts over the wire. It is desirable to directly visualize the ducts with a camera rather than using radiation and contrast injections. By passing a small endoscope into the bile ducts, one can directly visualize the ducts without radiation. However, it is very difficult to navigate such a small endoscope through the stomach and into the bile duct as the scope will tend to loop.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0333">Cannulation of the bile or pancreatic duct is made difficult due to two reasons. First, the endoscope must be small in order to fit inside the small ducts which means it is very flexible and buckles inside the stomach when trying to exit the stomach. Second, the duct entrance (papilla) is on the side of the duodenum wall which means the endoscope must bend and advance at an angle relative to the long axis of the endoscope which cannot be done without a surface to deflect against. The rigidizing devices described herein can be used to create more optimal access and stabilization during ERCP and DC, including the kinematically and clinically challenging tasks of cannulating the papilla. For example, the devices described herein can be used both for getting to the papilla (which is typically performed with a duodenoscope) and to cannulate the biliary and pancreatic trees.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0334">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>70</b>A-<b>72</b>D</figref>, the rigidizing devices described herein can be used for ERCP and direct visualization of the pancreatic or bile duct (cholangioscopy) in a variety of ways. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>B</figref>, a rigidizing device <b>8300</b> (which can be similar to the rigidizing device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>) with a steerable distal end <b>8302</b><i>z </i>may be used over a cholangioscope <b>8391</b>. The cholangioscope <b>8391</b> can be a flexible endoscope with a camera, lighting, and optionally a tool channel designed to achieve the bend radius and diameter necessary to navigate into the bile ducts. The bend radius of the cholangioscope <b>8391</b> can be 0.5&#x2033; with a distal tip and insertion tube diameter of 2 mm-6 mm. The cholangioscope <b>8391</b> can be placed inside the rigidizing device <b>8300</b>, and the rigidizing device <b>8300</b> can begin in the flexible condition. The two devices <b>8300</b>, <b>8391</b> may be navigated together through the upper gastrointestinal tract to the duodenum <b>8354</b><i>z </i>(or the cholangioscope <b>8391</b> may be advanced ahead of the rigidizing device <b>8300</b> with the rigidizing device <b>8300</b> following it when deemed necessary by the operator). Once in the duodenum <b>8354</b><i>z</i>, the rigidizing device <b>8300</b> can be rigidized and steered to angle the cholangioscope <b>8391</b> towards the entrance to the ducts (papilla <b>8355</b><i>z</i>). The rigidizing device <b>8300</b> steering can be locked in place and the cholangioscope <b>8391</b> can be advanced towards the papilla <b>8355</b><i>z</i>. A guidewire <b>8385</b> can be pushed through the cholangioscope <b>8391</b> and aimed at the entrance to the papilla <b>8355</b><i>z </i>and pushed through into the bile duct <b>8357</b><i>z </i>or the pancreatic duct <b>8356</b><i>z </i>(positioning in the bile duct <b>8355</b><i>z </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>70</b>A</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>70</b>B</figref>, the cholangioscope <b>8391</b> can be advanced into the bile duct <b>8357</b><i>z </i>over the wire <b>8385</b> to achieve direct cannulation. This rigidizing device <b>8300</b> in this method can advantageously support the small cholangioscope <b>8391</b> to keep it from buckling in the stomach, and the steering section <b>8302</b><i>z </i>of the rigidizing device <b>8300</b> can advantageously deflect the cholangioscope <b>8391</b> and direct it towards the papilla. As a result, direct visualization can be achieved, reducing the amount of radiation required during ERCP.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0335">Another exemplary ERCP method is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>71</b>A-<b>71</b>B</figref>. In this embodiment, a rigidizing device <b>8400</b> without a steerable distal end can be used. The cholangioscope <b>8491</b> can be used to steer the rigidizing device <b>8400</b> while in the flexible configuration to point the rigidizing device <b>8400</b> towards the papilla <b>8455</b><i>z</i>. Once pointed in the correct direction, the rigidizing device <b>8400</b> can be rigidized. The cholangioscope <b>8491</b> can then be advanced in the same manner as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>70</b>A-<b>70</b>B</figref>. This method can be referred to as the &#x201c;point and shoot&#x201d; method of direct cholangioscopy.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0336">Another exemplary ERCP method is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>72</b>A-<b>72</b>D</figref>. In this embodiment, the rigidizing device <b>8500</b> includes at least two working channels therein (e.g., similar to the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-<b>20</b>B and <b>21</b>A-<b>21</b>B</figref>). The cholangioscope <b>8591</b> is placed down the first tool channel initially for navigation and cannulation of the papilla <b>8555</b><i>z</i>. Once the guidewire <b>8585</b> has been crossed into the bile duct <b>8557</b><i>z </i>(as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b>B</figref>) or pancreatic duct (<b>8556</b><i>z</i>), the cholangioscope <b>8591</b> can be removed from the first tool channel with the wire <b>8585</b> remaining in place inside the duct <b>8557</b><i>z </i>(as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b>C</figref>). The cholangioscope <b>8591</b> can then be placed into the second tool channel (e.g., which may extend sideways out of the wall of the device <b>8500</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b></figref>) such that the duodenal side of the papilla <b>8555</b><i>z </i>can be seen (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b>D</figref>). The first tool channel can be used to place larger instruments therethrough, such as a stent <b>8558</b><i>z </i>to be placed into the duct <b>8557</b><i>z</i>. In some embodiments, it may be useful to have to have exterior (duodenal) visualization of the papilla <b>8555</b><i>z </i>during stent placement since the stent <b>8558</b><i>z </i>takes up most of the diameter of the duct <b>8557</b><i>z </i>and a portion of the stent <b>8558</b><i>z </i>remains inside the duodenum <b>8554</b><i>z. </i></p><p id="p-0341" num="0337">In another exemplary ERCP method, a rigidizing device similar to the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref> includes a single tool channel running the entire length of the device. The rigidizing device includes a camera attached to the outside of the rigidizing device just proximal to the steering section. Cannulation, ERCP, and direct cholangioscopy can be performed similar to the methods described above. When a stent or larger tools are to be used, the cholangioscope can be removed from the tool channel and the rigidizing device camera can be used to view the exterior of the papilla while larger instruments or stents are used.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0338">In another exemplary ERCP method, the rigidizing device includes a suction tip on the distal end thereof as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>46</b>A-<b>46</b>B</figref>. The suction tip can surround the papilla, and suction can be applied at the tip. This action can stabilize the papilla and make it easier for the cholangioscope to aim to the appropriate location to cross the wire. Holding the surrounding tissue of the papilla can also provide some counter-tension when pushing on the papilla with the wire or cholangioscope. Providing counter tension to the compression force of the cholangioscope or other tools could decrease the number of sphincterotomies (cutting open the papilla) required.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0339">Advantageously, the rigidizing devices used for ERCP as described herein can be disposable and sterile, reducing risk of infection or cross-patient contamination. The methods further result in less radiation and easy of navigation to the papilla with steering capabilities on the rigidizing device and/or the scope.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0340">The rigidizing devices and systems described herein can be used for cardiology and cardiac surgery, including in the aortic and mitral valves.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0341">Typically, in transcatheter, percutaneous procedures, the clinician affects motion from the access site (e.g., an artery or vein in the groin, arm, etc.) using some sort of flexible rod or shaft that has adequate stiffness to advance the catheter to the treatment site but is flexible enough to conform to the anatomy. This means that all the force or leverage is developed at the remote access site and may be reflected off of more local anatomy to: (a) bend the flexible rod or shaft to navigate to the procedure site; and to (b) provide localized forces (linear and torque) at the procedure site. In contrast, a dynamically rigidizing device as described herein effectively moves the access site to the treatment site by providing a means to both navigate through tortuous anatomy to the treatment site and to rigidize and form a stable port at the treatment site independent of anatomical reflections.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0342">One of the advantages of the rigidizing devices described herein is the ability to conform to surrounding anatomy (e.g., the vasculature). Devices such as guide catheters need to provide a certain amount of stiffness to be advanced through the anatomy (e.g. vasculature) and perform the functions required. Stiff systems, however, can prevent the device from being advanced to the target anatomy due, at least in part, to highly tortuous paths, forcing the anatomy to conform to the device, which can lead to trauma to surrounding tissues and vessels. In contrast, the rigidizing devices described herein can be flexible enough to be moved through the vasculature, conforming to the vasculature instead of remodeling the vasculature. The inch-worming allowed by a rigidizing device or nested system as described herein allows for this flexible forward movement. Once the device has advanced to a target site, the rigidization allows for preservation and utilization of the created path through the vasculature. The rigidizing devices described herein, for example, can be 1/10 as stiff as a typical guide catheter when in a flexible state and 5 times stiffer than a typical guide catheter when in a rigid state.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0343">In some embodiments, a rigidizing device as described herein can be used during percutaneous procedures in the heart or vasculature. The rigidizing device can both conform to the cardiac anatomy and provide a local distal fulcrum for instrument manipulation. Currently, when performing a percutaneous procedure, the mechanical fixation and stabilization occurs at the access site (e.g., femoral vein, radial artery, iliac vein, etc.). As described above, this fixation point creates a long moment arm extending from the access site to the procedure site. Further, as described in further detail below, the mechanical linkage created by typical stiff catheter systems between the access site and target anatomy relies on anatomical reflections to direct the catheter tip and transmit force to the tools being used. Stiff catheter systems create potential energy along the access route when they are bent to conform to the anatomy. This energy can be released when there is voluntary or involuntary patient movement or unintentional movement by the operator at the access site. In contrast, the rigidizing devices described herein conform to the anatomical pathway prior to rigidization, eliminating stored energy associated with stiff catheter systems. Once rigidized, the mechanical fixation is achieved independently of anatomical reflections, greatly reducing the moment arm and increasing a physician's control over the procedure tools leading to more predictable results. In some embodiments, the rigidizing device can comprise an integrated hemostasis valve, obviating the need for a separate access sheath.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0344">In some embodiments, the rigidizing devices described herein can be used to stiffen a guide sheath in interventional cardiology or structural heart cases. For example, the rigidizing devices can be used to provide a &#x201c;rail&#x201d; for the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) device, thereby keeping the tip of the TAVR catheter from scraping and skiving the top of the aortic arch where there is often thrombus burden (current systems tend to ride the outside of the arch, rubbing against plaques, creating embolic debris). The rigidizing devices can help enable superior alignment and placement as well as lower paravalvular leakage and optimal placement relative to pacing nodes.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0345">In some embodiments, the rigidizing devices described herein can be used as a delivery system that may be passed from the venous circulation through the right atrium and atrial septum into the left atrium through the mitral valve and antegrade into the left ventricular outflow tract and aortic valve. In this manner, a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may be facilitated avoiding contact with the aortic arch and ascending aorta typical with retrograde deployment</p><p id="p-0350" num="0346">In some embodiments, the rigidizing devices described herein can be used to deliver a mitral valve replacement. That is, crossing the septal wall during mitral valve replacement can be particularly difficult, as it involves multiple curves, a beating heart, and the need for precisely aligned entry and stabilization before delivery of the implant. Current valve delivery platforms can be quite rigid, which can be dangerous for anatomy that it straightens (such as the femoral artery, which can be highly calcified and friable). The rigidizing devices described herein can advantageously create a conduit that goes in flexibly, then rigidizes in whatever shape the particular person's anatomy provided, such that the rigidizing device conforms to the entire anatomical track. As a result, the rigidizing devices described herein can allow the clinician to create a stable mechanical lumen leading directly to the anatomy, to locate it without significant local anatomical load, then to stabilize rigidly in that shape as a device is delivered through it.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0347"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b>A</figref> depicts an embodiment of a rigidizing device <b>3700</b> advanced through the right atrium RA to the left atrium of the heart. A guidewire or other piercing member and dilator can be used to puncture the atrial septum <b>3704</b> to create access to the left atrium LA. The rigidizing device <b>3700</b> can be advanced to the treatment site using the methods described herein. A cardiac tool <b>3787</b> (which may or may not be rigidizing) can be advanced within with the rigidizing device <b>3700</b>. For example, the cardiac tool <b>3787</b> and rigidizing device <b>3700</b> can be advanced as described with respect to the nested system shown herein, such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>65</b>A-H</figref>. The dynamic nature of the rigidization allows the device <b>3700</b> and tool <b>3787</b> to be advanced through tortuous anatomy. The rigidizing device <b>3700</b> can be rigidized once at the treatment site to provide a stable base for the treatment. Optionally, the rigidizing device <b>3700</b> may comprise an anchoring balloon <b>3778</b> near its distal tip to anchor the rigidizing device <b>3700</b> to chambers in the heart, e.g., to the atrial septum <b>3704</b> to maintain the tip of the tube <b>3700</b> in the left atrium LA. The detailed view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b>B</figref> shows the balloon <b>3778</b>. The balloon <b>3778</b> can be positioned at any location around a circumference of the tube <b>3700</b>. In some embodiments, the balloon is annular and surrounds a circumference of the tube <b>3700</b>. The rigidizing device <b>3700</b> may include an echogenic tip. Other tips allowing real time visualization are also possible (e.g., radiographic tip, a scope within a saline filled bag, etc.).</p><p id="p-0352" num="0348"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>74</b>A-<b>74</b>B</figref> show an exemplary method for use of a dynamically rigidizing device in performing treatment of a in a small branching vessel, such as the coronary arteries. When navigating to these smaller vessels, oftentimes, applying force in these areas can cause the guide catheter or other advanced devices to be pushed out of the area. Sometimes, access sheaths are used in such situations to provide a bit of mechanical advantage. Still, using such an access sheath, when applying force, for example, to push through an occlusion, the whole device can be pushed out of the area. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b>A-<b>74</b>B</figref> compare the use of a standard guide catheter to a rigidizing device as described herein.

A guidewire <b>3885</b> extends from the tip of the guide catheter <b>3886</b> and can be used to perform a procedure (e.g., placing a stent). The guide catheter <b>3886</b> can, in some embodiments, reflect off of adjacent anatomy <b>3873</b> to achieve mechanical advantage, prevent catheter push back, and/or provide more local force. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b>B</figref> show a rigidizing device <b>3800</b> as described herein advanced through the ostium <b>3845</b> and into the coronary artery <b>3842</b>. Because of the rigidization capability of the device <b>3800</b>, it does not need to reflect off local anatomy and can instead provide inherent stabilization at the treatment site.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>A</figref>, the rigidizing device <b>3900</b> is advanced through the vasculature to the right atrium RA, through the atrial septum, and into the left atrium LA. The end of the rigidizing device can be steered such that a longitudinal axis <b>3983</b> extending through the end <b>3969</b> of the tube aligns with the desired treatment area (e.g., portion of the valve). The steering, dynamically rigidizing, and tip visualization capabilities can allow for precise positioning of the rigidizing device. For example, the axis <b>3983</b> extends through the mitral valve MV into the left ventricle LV. Another position <b>3964</b> of the rigidizing device <b>3900</b> is shown in phantom with the axis extending through a leaflet of the mitral valve MV. Current methods of mitral valve repair utilize a guide catheter to navigate to the left atrium LA, and often reliable axial alignment is not possible. The presently disclosed method of using the rigidizing device <b>3900</b> to achieve axial alignment in a flexible state prior to rigidization provides a significant benefit over currently used methods of positioning during procedures such as mitral valve repair. This sort of precise alignment can be beneficial in other areas of the anatomy as well (e.g., across other valves, in transseptal access sites, within a vessel lumen, etc.), including the ability to place sutures, clips and other devices within the heart with equivalent precision normally reserved for open heart surgery.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0350">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>B</figref>, the rigidizing device <b>3900</b> used in a procedure such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>A</figref> can comprise various configurations. In some embodiments, the rigidizing device <b>3900</b> can be steered and positioned using a guidewire <b>3985</b>. In some embodiments, the rigidizing device <b>3900</b> can comprise a nested system comprising an inner rigidizing device <b>3910</b>.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0351">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>C</figref>, in one embodiment, at needle-tipped catheter <b>3958</b><i>z </i>can be advanced through the rigidizing device <b>3900</b> and positioned within the cardiac anatomy, such as above a mitral valve leaflet.

Suture and anchors delivered through the rigidizing device can be used to sew tissue structures together, such as leaflet plication for mitral valve repair.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0352">It will be appreciated that a system comprising one or more rigidizing devices as described herein can be used in heart procedures other than mitral valve repair. For example, the system may be used in complex mitral valve procedures where the goal may be to effect leaflet repair and mitral annuloplasty during the same procedure. The system can be used to perform transseptal delivery of an aortic prosthesis (e.g., TAVI). In some embodiments, the system is used to perform aortic valve repair via transseptal access. A combination of dynamically rigidizing overtubes can used in synchrony to pass suture or other instruments from one heart chamber to another. In any of these procedures, the dynamically rigidizing systems described herein can advantageously provide a cannula or access sheath providing universal access to the various chambers of the heart.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0353"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b>A</figref> shows an exemplary dual rigidizing cannula system that can be simultaneously placed in multiple chambers of the heart. The two rigidizing cannulas <b>4000</b><i>a</i>, <b>4000</b><i>b </i>can be axially aligned and provide the capability for clinicians to pass instruments from one cannula to the other. In use, the first rigidizing cannula <b>4000</b><i>a </i>can be navigated through the right atrium RA to the left atrium LA with the tip <b>4004</b> of the cannula facing towards the mitral valve <b>4081</b>. The rigidizing cannula <b>4000</b><i>a </i>can be rigidized in this position. The cannula <b>4004</b><i>a </i>may comprise a bending section near the tip <b>4004</b> to properly position the tip and steer the device. The second cannula <b>4000</b><i>b </i>can be navigated retrograde through the aorta <b>4066</b><i>z </i>into the left ventricle LV. The cannula <b>4000</b><i>b </i>can be steered and positioned such that a tip <b>4039</b> is positioned below the mitral valve and facing the tip <b>40004</b> of the first cannula <b>4000</b><i>a</i>. The cannula <b>4000</b><i>b </i>can be rigidized in this position. The axis <b>4014</b> extending between the tip <b>4004</b> of the first cannula and the tip <b>4039</b> of the second cannula can be aligned with the area to be treated. This dual access can allow, for example, a suture to be passed from one cannula to the other and/or to allow tools to be passed therebetween. Using two cannulas can also allow the procedure to be performed with a greater degree of precision and accuracy (for example, the treatment site can be approached from the top, or bottom, or both). Examples of procedures that can be performed with two such rigidizing cannulas <b>4000</b><i>a</i>, <b>400</b><i>b </i>include leaflet plication with standard suture techniques and annuloplasty with conventional rings. Each cannula <b>4000</b><i>a</i>, <b>4000</b><i>b </i>can include multiple working channels and provide fixed access sites within the heart. The provision of these dual fixation sites can allow for replication of standard open heart surgical procedures through far less invasive percutaneous access.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0354"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b>B</figref> shows the dual rigidizing cannula system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b>A</figref> being used to pass suture through a tissue.

In contrast, the dynamically rigidizing trocar <b>4141</b> can allow for minor adjustments during or after placement of the trocar. The dynamically rigidizing trocar <b>4141</b> can have steering capability, as described with respect to other dynamically rigidizing devices disclosed herein. Using this capability, the trocar <b>4141</b> can be bent or deflected in a desired direction and then rigidized, allowing far greater control than standard trocars. The dynamically rigidizing trocar <b>4141</b> can be used in cardiac applications and/or elsewhere in the body.

This area of the vasculature can commonly become diseased and require complex repair based on the extreme tortuous anatomy at this site. Currently, many catheters or other delivery devices used to treat this area travel up to the apex of the bifurcation and then deploy tools down from there. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>78</b></figref>, a dynamically rigidizing device <b>4200</b> can use a combination of steering and dynamic (e.g., periodic) rigidization to navigate around the bifurcation <b>4297</b> and be able to reach any treatment site in the area.

The rigidizing device <b>4700</b> can be positioned in the left atrium LA such that it independently maintains axial alignment with the treatment site, in this example, the mitral valve MV. The rigidizing device <b>4700</b> can thus be advanced through the vasculature to the right atrium RA, through the atrial septum, and into the left atrium LA. The end of the rigidizing device can be steered such that a longitudinal axis <b>4783</b> extending through the end <b>4769</b> of the tube aligns with the desired treatment area (e.g., portion of the valve). To achieve the desired positioning, the active deflection segment <b>4746</b> can be bent in the relatively unconstrained space between the IVC and the atrial septum while the distal steerable section <b>4747</b> can be positioned within the left atrium LA and steered or oriented towards the mitral valve MV. In such a position, the rigidizing device <b>4700</b> can have a bend with an arc radius of approximately 4-6 cm, such as 5 cm, at an angle of 90 degrees or more.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0358">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>80</b></figref>, a rigidizing device <b>4800</b> for use in mitral valve repair (with active deflection segment <b>4846</b> and steerable distal section <b>4847</b>) can include a distal payload <b>4848</b> (e.g., a mitral clip, mitral valve replacement, or annuloplasty ring) attached thereto. Having the distal payload <b>4848</b> attached thereto while still incorporating the active deflection segment <b>4846</b> and steerable distal section <b>4847</b> can advantageously reduce or eliminate the need for an outer large-bore guide catheter during such procedures.
