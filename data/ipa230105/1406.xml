id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A microporous substrate for detection of surface bound target analyte molecules includes a microporous substrate material having opposed surfaces and tapered micropores extending through the substrate with the micropores having wider openings on one side of the substrate compared to the other side. The micropores have bound therein analyte specific receptors complementary to the target molecules. When a liquid sample containing the target analyte molecules with optical probes attached to the target molecules is flowed through the substrate, they bind to their complementary analyte specific receptors and emit light. This microporous substrate structure gives an increase in the collection efficiency of light emitted from optical probes when the light is detected by a light detector spaced from the side of the microporous substrate facing the larger micropores openings compared to a light collection efficiency of light emitted from the optical probes when the micropores are straight and not tapered.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="155.62mm" wi="105.33mm" orientation="landscape"

PATENT APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application is a US continuation patent application of U.S. Ser. No. 17/716,729 filed on Apr. 8, 2022, entitled MICROPOROUS SUBSTRATE FOR USE IN A DISPOSABLE BIOASSAY CARTRIDGE, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a microporous substrate with tapered micropores extending right the substrate with the openings on one side of the substrate being wider than openings on the opposed substrate surface. The microporous substrate is for use with a disposable cartridge and method to move fluids and carry out multiple bioassay steps within the cartridge.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typical cartridge devices for biological assays are interfaced with an instrument containing syringes or other types of positive displacement pumps in order to accurately meter liquid volumes required sequentially in a reaction zone within the disposable cartridge. This often also involves the integration of mechanical valves within the cartridge structure to control fluid flows. In addition, care must be taken in the design of the fluidic paths to eliminate the formation of air bubbles that can significantly interfere with accurate fluid transfer. Complex structures or bubble control mechanisms are introduced into the design to mitigate these issues. This introduces manufacturing complexity and increased cost of the cartridges which are often meant to be used in a disposable fashion.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the trend toward point of use diagnostic testing, there is a need to integrate multiple functions/assay steps in a single cartridge on a cost effective basis consistent with mass production of the disposable cartridges. Therefore, it would be very beneficial to provide a disposable cartridge which integrates multiple functions with a minimum number of moving parts such as active pumps and valves in the field of automated point of use diagnostic bioassays.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a microporous substrate for detection of surface bound target analyte molecules includes a microporous substrate material having opposed surfaces and micropores, the micropores having bound therein analyte specific receptors complementary to the target analyte molecules, the micropores having tapered walls extending through a thickness of the microporous substrate in which the micropores are wider near one surface of the microporous substrate compared to a width of the micropores on the opposed surface to increase the collection efficiency of light emitted from optical probes bound to target analyte molecules when the target analyte molecules are captured by the analyte specific receptors which is detected by a light detector spaced from the side of the microporous substrate facing the larger micropore openings compared to a light collection efficiency of light emitted from the optical probes when the micropores are straight and not tapered.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The micropores may be progressively wider near one surface of the microporous substrate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The micropores may have a rectangular cross section.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The micropores may have a square cross section, or they may have a circular cross section.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The tapering of the micropore walls may be conical, spherical, or parabolic.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The micropore dimension on the side opposite the side of the widened micropores may be substantially smaller thereby providing structural stability.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The micropores may be of uniform dimensions and morphology.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The microporous substrate may further comprise reinforcement ribs to provide structural stability, and the reinforcement ribs may be an integral part of the microporous substrate, or alternatively, they may be made in a form of a rigid supporting mesh.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The microporous substrate may be attached to a supporting mesh placed on the surface of the microporous substrate having the smaller micropore openings.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The microporous porous substrate may be placed between two supporting meshes placed on the opposite sides of the microporous substrate.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The microporous substrate may have a thickness of between 0.15 to about 0.75 mm.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The tapered surface of the micropores may be covered with a reflective coating.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The microporous substrate may be made of silicon.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The microporous substrate may be made of a material that is opaque such that light from one micropore cannot be transmitted to neighboring micropores with the microporous substrate.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The microporous substrate may be made by performing electrochemical etching of silicon to manufacture the microporous substrate.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The microporous substrate may be made by embossing or molding of a plastic material to manufacture the microporous substrate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The device, method disclosed herein is of particular use in the area of medical diagnostics (human and veterinary), food safety testing, monitoring of environmental and biological hazards and general measurement of biological species.

The design is amenable to injection molded manufacturing lowering cost for large volume manufacturing. Cartridge <b>100</b> includes a first reagent chamber <b>10</b> which holds a liquid reagent or sample, and a second reagent chamber <b>12</b> which holds a second liquid reagent.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">An upper processing chamber <b>14</b> is provided having a volume greater than the first reagent chamber <b>10</b> or second reagent chamber <b>12</b>. Cartridge <b>100</b> includes a lower processing chamber <b>16</b> which has a volume equal to or exceeding the maximum liquid capacity of upper processing chamber <b>14</b> and is designed to minimize the space between the bottom inner surface of chamber <b>16</b> and the bottom surface of a microporous substrate <b>18</b> located within chamber <b>16</b>. Cartridge <b>100</b> includes an outlet chamber <b>20</b> with a volume greater than all of the reagents and samples combined.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">First reaction chamber <b>10</b> includes a pneumatic port <b>26</b> which is configured to provide negative differential pressure, positive differential pressure or vent under external system control to chamber <b>10</b>. Upper processing chamber <b>14</b> includes a pneumatic port <b>28</b> which is configured to provide negative differential pressure, positive differential pressure or vent under external system control to upper processing chamber <b>14</b>. Second reaction chamber <b>12</b> includes a pneumatic port <b>30</b> which is configured to provide negative differential pressure, positive differential pressure or vent under external system control to chamber <b>12</b>. Lower processing chamber <b>16</b> includes a pneumatic port <b>34</b> which is configured to provide negative differential pressure, positive differential pressure or vent under external system control to lower processing chamber <b>16</b>. Similarly, outlet chamber <b>20</b> includes a pneumatic port <b>36</b> configured to provide negative differential pressure, positive differential pressure or vent under external system control to outlet chamber <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Pneumatic ports <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> may incorporate flexible diaphragms in their respective pneumatic conduits which can be used to isolate a given chamber from a pneumatic source while allowing a flux of gas through the conduit which is limited by the deformation of the diaphragm. Upon application of pneumatic pressure, gas will flow through the conduit until the back-pressure of the diaphragm equals the applied pneumatic pressure. Such flexible diaphragms are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,470,546, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">More particularly, flexible diaphragms may be incorporated into pneumatic ports <b>28</b> and <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> so that when a positive pneumatic pressure is applied to port <b>28</b> gas flows into upper processing chamber <b>14</b> until the diaphragm deforms enough to create a back pressure equal to the applied pressure. The gas entering the upper processing chamber <b>14</b> causes the liquid to flow through the microporous substrate <b>18</b> into lower processing chamber <b>16</b>, and air flows through port <b>34</b> and deforms the diaphragm in port <b>34</b> which would be vented to the atmosphere. Although port <b>34</b> is vented to the atmosphere there would be no passage of material between the interior of the cartridge <b>100</b> and the environment. This configuration permits back-and-forth transport of liquid across the microporous substrate <b>18</b> by the periodic application of pressure to port <b>28</b> which can be vented to the atmosphere when pressure is not applied.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The microporous substrate <b>18</b> serves as an interface between processing chambers <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> and has a size and shape configured to prevent fluid from passing between processing chambers <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> other than through the microporous substrate <b>18</b> when the critical pressure is exceeded. Head spaces <b>22</b> are produced in lower processing chamber <b>16</b> due to microporous substrate <b>18</b> projecting into lower processing chamber <b>16</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows two (2) head spaces <b>22</b> it will be understood that the cartridge may be configured to have only one. The direction of flow depends on the sign of the differential pressure between chambers <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Lower processing chamber <b>16</b> includes an optical window <b>40</b> which forms part of the lower surface of this lower processing chamber <b>16</b> to allow imaging of the microporous substrate <b>18</b> from outside the device cartridge <b>100</b>. In those embodiments using microporous substrate <b>18</b> which has been functionalized with binding agents and which imaging is to be performed through optical window <b>40</b>, microporous substrate <b>18</b> is a rigid substrate disposed in a rigid plane parallel to the image plane of the imaging device such that it does not move or is not displaced which would result in poor quality images being detected. Preferred properties and structure of rigid microporous substrate <b>18</b> will be discussed hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Upper process chamber <b>14</b> includes a solid support zone <b>44</b> which is the space immediately above the microporous substrate <b>18</b> which can be occupied by a solid support material of a larger size than the pores in the microporous substrate <b>18</b> such that the material is retained in zone <b>44</b> since it cannot pass through the microporous substrate <b>18</b>. The support material is capable of binding analytes of interest or acting as a support for reactions between bound and soluble materials.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A capillary flow channel <b>48</b> connects reagent chamber <b>10</b> with the upper processing chamber <b>14</b> and is designed with an inner diameter sized to prevent flow in either direction until a differential pressure is applied exceeding a preselected critical level to permit flow between the chambers <b>10</b> and <b>14</b>. A capillary flow channel <b>50</b> connects reagent chamber <b>12</b> with the upper processing chamber <b>14</b> and is designed with an inner diameter sized to prevent flow in either direction until a preselected differential pressure is applied exceeding the critical level to permit flow between the chambers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. A capillary flow channel <b>52</b> connects lower processing chamber <b>16</b> with the outlet chamber <b>20</b> and is designed with an inner diameter sized to prevent flow in either direction until a preselected differential pressure is applied exceeding the critical level to permit flow. For example, the capillary inner diameter could be selected from the range of 50 to 500 microns to provide critical pressures of 0.1 to 0.5 psi.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Flow is effected from one chamber to the next by applying pressure to the originating chamber containing the fluid through the pneumatic port mounted on that chamber while simultaneously venting the destination chamber to which the capillary channel is connected through the pneumatic port mounted on that chamber. Alternatively, negative differential pressure can be applied to the destination chamber while simultaneously venting the originating chamber. In both cases a sufficient pressure differential must be provided to overcome the resistance of the channel and allow flow to occur.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the case when a cycling of the fluid is required between two reagent chambers (e.g., for mixing) the differential pressure between these chambers can be changed from positive to negative and back to positive. This will change the direction of fluid flow.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Reagent chambers <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> may contain liquid reagents or dried reagents for dissolution in the device by transferring a solution from another chamber. One or more of the reagent chambers <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> may be designed to accept the introduction of a sample or other material from an external source. It is noted that while only two (2) reagent chambers <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> are shown connected to upper processing chamber <b>14</b>, more could be included depending on the application at hand. Each reagent chamber <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> is provided with the port <b>26</b> for chamber <b>10</b> and port <b>30</b> for chamber <b>12</b> which can be interfaced with an external pneumatic system capable of providing one or more of positive or negative pressures or venting to a given chamber under external control.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The upper processing chamber <b>14</b> is provided with port <b>28</b> which can also be interfaced with an external pneumatic system capable of providing one or more of positive or negative pressures or venting to the chamber under external control.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The internal diameter of each capillary channel <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> is selected to only permit flow through the channel from one chamber to the other when a differential pressure exceeding the critical pressure is applied.

This geometry presents a greater surface area to the detection optics and less restriction to the transmission of light from within the pores. Despite the large pores on a front surface and great porosity, the substrate <b>18</b> has adequate strength and structural stability for flow-through applications due to the small pore size on the opposite side and there is a substantial amount of material between the pores.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The remarkable asymmetric optical properties of the substrate are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A</figref> and B.

The parameters used for this evaluation are: 1) the width of non-tapered portion of a pore is 8 um; 2) the thickness of a wall between pores is 4 um; 3) the substrate thickness is 350 um; 4) tapering angle 2 degrees; 5) the diameter of the objective lens is 25.4 mm; and 6) the working distance of the objective lens is 50 mm.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> the rise of the flat part of the curve is caused by increase of the collection surface area, the shift of the curve is caused by increase of the pore depth from which the light collection is limited by the parameters of the optical assembly rather than the pore walls, the change in a slope of the curve is associated with a change of the collection angle. As a result, the expected improvement of light collection efficiency is 1.4 to 1.5 fold.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The substrate <b>18</b> using silicon has been used to manufacture flow-through chips on which different probes have been immobilized in discrete regions or spots. The same flow-through chips have been manufactured with a highly microporous silicon substrate with pore walls normal to the surface. When these flow-through chips were hybridized with the same target molecules and processed with identical protocols to detect chemiluminescent labels attached to target molecules bound by the probes, the signal intensities were approximately 40% greater with the substrate described in this invention (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). This experimental result confirms the theoretical evaluation of efficiency enhancement due to pore tapering. The enhanced optical detection sensitivity improves the sensitivity of assays performed on the chips and/or improves the throughput of the assay system.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The suggested approach is not very sensitive to a particular selection of the tapering angle as long as the inner plane of a pore wall does not restrict light collection. For the parameters listed above the tapering angle can be selected in the range between 0.3 degrees (tapering of a pore wall along full pore depth) to approximately 14 degrees. Tapering with the angles outside of this range will still increase amount of collected light, but the improvement will be less pronounced. It is noted that selection of a particular tapering angle and depth of tapering can be additionally influenced by the process of substrate manufacturing, the selected pore size and membrane thickness.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The geometry of pores does not need to be square.

The cartridge is readily produced using standard molding techniques, no nanostructrures are required and no precise tolerances are required. The movement of sample and reagent fluid is solely determined by application of differential pressures, which are correlated primarily with the properties of the sample substrate <b>18</b>, namely pore size and distribution in the substrate <b>18</b>, as well as the inner diameter of the capillary channels (e,g. 48). The cartridge disclosed herein advantageously contains no moving parts and is made of a small number of parts compared to current systems, which typically contain active pumps, active valves and the like.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The cartridge disclosed herein may be used for, but is not limited to use in sandwich, or competitive immunoassay for protein antigen analysis; serology for antibody binding to immobilized antigens for allergy, autoimmune, infectious disease; nucleic acids measurement of DNA, RNA, mRNA, microRNA (miRNA) etc. to identify specific sequences whose presence or expression is correlated to presence or progress of disease, sequences that can be used to identify species of bacteria, fungi, viruses in a sample, sequences that indicated the presence of specific resistance genes in pathogens, measurement of copy number variations (CNV's) or specific gene variants or deletions that correlate to risk of disease, gene signatures used to type samples for forensic or identification purposes.

In this example, identical samples containing biotinylated mouse IgG analyte were cycled through a microporous substrate <b>18</b> that was functionalized with a rabbit anti-mouse antibody know to have a high binding affinity for mouse IgG (Treated sample) or cycled through a microporous substrate <b>18</b> that had not been functionalized, (Non-treated sample).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The resulting fluid was then processed through a microporous substrate that had been functionalized in discrete regions to form analysis spots, each of approximately 200 um in diameter with either a rabbit anti-mouse antibody known to have a high binding affinity for mouse IgG or a biotinylated bovine serum albumin to serve as a reference spot. Washing, binding of streptavidin-HRP to any captured biotin-mouse IgG and immobilized biotin-BSA, and introduction of a chemiluminescent substrate that could be processed by the bound HRP enzyme to produce a chemiluminescent emission in that specific region were sequentially carried out. During the final step, an image of the microporous substrate <b>18</b> was captured with a CCD camera <b>120</b> located below the optical window <b>40</b>.

It can also be observed that the sample that had been processed by the first non-functionalized microporous substrate <b>18</b> (non-treated) exhibited high levels of mouse IgG analyte when processed on the second microporous substrate <b>18</b> used for detection.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>B</figref> represents the signal captured by the CCD camera <b>120</b> from the second microporous substrate <b>18</b> for the treated sample.

Significant signal from the analysis spots for both the reference biotinylated BSA and the biotinylated mouse IgG can be observed. This illustrates the high efficiency of using a first microporous substrate <b>18</b> functionalized with analyte specific reagents to deplete those analytes prior to detection and quantitation on a second microporous substrate <b>18</b>.
