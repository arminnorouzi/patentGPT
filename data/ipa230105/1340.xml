id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Air cleaner assemblies, components, and features are described. The features can be used to provide that the air cleaner assembly includes a housing and cover within which primary and secondary filter cartridges, having a media pack and a seal arrangement surrounding the media pack, can be installed. The filter cartridges can include an open end cap with an axially deviating seal arrangement and a plurality of axially extending channels for engaging with ribs on the housing. The filter cartridges can also include extension members extending from the open end cap that include the axially extending channels, entirely or partially. The filter cartridges can also include a guide member extending from the extension members for providing a low friction surface against the housing during installation that allows axial force exerted by the installer to be translated into a rotational force that rotates the filter cartridge during installation.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img

A typical application is in the filtration of intake air to internal combustion engines. Another is in the filtration of crankcase ventilation filter assemblies. Typically, such systems comprise filter assemblies having a serviceable filter cartridge therein. After a period of use, filter media within a filter housing requires servicing, either through cleaning or complete replacement. Typically, for an air cleaner or crankcase ventilation filter assembly used with an internal combustion engine, for example on a vehicle, the filter media is contained in a removable and replaceable, i.e. serviceable, component, typically referred as a filter element or cartridge. The filter cartridge is configured to be removably sealed within the air cleaner, in use. Improvements in filter arrangements relating to assembly, serviceability, use are desirable. The filter cartridge can be provided as a primary filter cartridge or a secondary filter cartridge. The air cleaner assembly can contain only a primary filter cartridge or both a primary filter cartridge and a secondary filter cartridge.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Filter assembly (such as air cleaner assemblies or crankcase ventilation filter assemblies) features and components are described.

The filter assemblies generally comprise a housing having a filter cartridge removably positioned therein.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An example assembly includes a first filter cartridge and a second filter cartridge, wherein the first filter cartridge has a first sealing structure configured for sealing against a portion of a housing and having a sealing surface, and wherein the second filter cartridge has a second sealing structure configured for sealing against the second filter cartridge sealing surface. In one embodiment, the first sealing structure is an outwardly directed radial seal while the second sealing structure is an inwardly directed radial seal.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Each of the first and second filter cartridges may be provided with features for ensuring proper alignment of the cartridges with respect to the housing and outlet cover. As each of the first and second filter cartridges is provided with an axially deviating seal structure, proper alignment is beneficial in ensuring that a proper seal is achieved. The filter cartridges can be provided with extension members that extend from an open end cap of the cartridges. In one example, the extension members are provided with axially extending, radial facing recesses that are received by corresponding ribs associated with the outlet cover. In one example, the extension members are provide with a guide member that provides a low friction surface with the outlet cover which enables for self-alignment of the filter cartridges. In one example, both such features are provided. Each of these features provides an installer with a tactile feedback that allows the user to feel whether the filter cartridge is properly aligned and inserted with respect to the housing outlet cover.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is no specific requirement that an air cleaner assembly, component therefor, or feature thereof include all of the detail characterized herein, to obtain some advantage according to the present disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Herein, example filter assemblies, filter cartridges, features and components therefor are described and depicted. A variety of specific features and components are characterized in detail. Many can be applied to provide advantage. There is no specific requirement that the various individual features and components be applied in an overall assembly with all of the features and characteristics described, however, in order to provide for some benefit in accord with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It is noted that a plurality of embodiments are depicted and described. The embodiments are not meant to be exclusive with respect to features depicted. That is, selected features of one embodiment can be applied in one or more of the other embodiments if desired, to advantage. In many examples, the filter assembly depicted is an air cleaner assembly, for example, used to filter intake air for an internal combustion engine. However, the concepts disclosed are not in any way limited to such an application and may be applied across a variety of different applications, such as crankcase ventilation. The disclosed filter assemblies are generally &#x201c;gas filter assemblies,&#x201d; since the carrier stage being filtered is gas (air or crankcase ventilation gases). While the techniques described herein will typically be used in application for gas filtration, they can be used in the filtration of other materials, for example, liquids, if desired.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">I. Filter Assembly&#x2014;General Description</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The reference numeral <b>1</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, generally indicates a filter assembly, for example an air cleaner or air cleaner assembly or arrangement in accord with the present disclosure. The filter assembly (in the example an air cleaner assembly) <b>1</b> comprises a housing <b>2</b>. The housing <b>2</b> defines a sidewall <b>2</b><i>s </i>and includes: a first body or housing section <b>3</b>; and a second body section or access cover <b>4</b>. In the example depicted, the access cover <b>4</b> is removably secured to the first body section <b>3</b>, but alternatives are possible. Also although alternatives are possible, for the example depicted, attachment of the cover section <b>4</b> to the body section <b>3</b> is by a latch arrangement <b>5</b> including over center latches. The cover section <b>4</b> can alternatively be held to the body section <b>3</b> by a twist lock arrangement. An exemplary twist lock arrangement is depicted in U.S. application Ser. No. 15/192,272, filed on Jun. 24, 2016, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The cover section <b>4</b> can be held to the body section <b>3</b> by latches <b>5</b> such as, for example, over center latches.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In general, the air (gas) cleaner <b>1</b> includes an air (gas) flow inlet arrangement <b>7</b>. In the example depicted, the air flow inlet arrangement <b>7</b> is an inlet tube indicated at <b>7</b><i>t</i>, on the body section <b>3</b>. The particular inlet tube <b>7</b><i>t </i>depicted, is configured as a side, tangential, inlet, i.e. gas flow is directed tangentially against an inner wall of housing <b>2</b>, as opposed to being directed directly toward a housing central axis X. Alternate inlet arrangements, locations and direction are possible. However, the tangential inlet arrangement depicted is convenient and advantageous for reasons discussed below.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">At <b>8</b>, a dust/water ejector arrangement is depicted on the housing <b>2</b>, comprising tube <b>9</b>. In the example depicted, the tube <b>9</b> comprises a portion of access cover <b>4</b>, although alternatives are possible. The tube <b>9</b> is covered by an evacuator valve arrangement <b>10</b>, in the example depicted comprising a duck-billed valve of a type widely used with air cleaners, see for example WO 2006/026241 A1; U.S. Pat. No. 6,419,718 B1; and U.S. Pat. No. 8,864,866, incorporated herein by reference. Alternate evacuator valve arrangements can be used.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">At <b>50</b>, an outlet cover having an outlet tube or flow tube <b>52</b> is depicted, as a portion of housing <b>2</b> positioned on a remainder of the housing body section <b>3</b>. The outlet cover <b>50</b> can be formed integral with the housing body <b>3</b>, but is shown as being a separate piece attached to the housing body <b>3</b> via fasteners. As shown, the outlet structure or tube <b>52</b> extends into the interior of the housing such that the filter cartridges can seal against the outlet structure <b>52</b>. The outlet structure also extends to the exterior of the housing. In the embodiment shown, the interior and exterior extending portions of the outlet structure <b>52</b> are discontinuous in that they are not of the same diameter. However, these features, which are integrally formed with the outlet cover, provide for a continuous pathway from the interior of the housing to the exterior of the housing.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In operation, air (gas) to be filtered enters the air cleaner assembly through inlet tube <b>7</b><i>t</i>. Eventually the air passes through filter media of a filter cartridge arrangement positioned within interior <b>2</b><i>i </i>of the housing <b>2</b>. After passage through media of the air filter cartridge, the filtered air is directed to exit the housing through outlet tube <b>52</b>. From outlet tube <b>52</b>, the filtered air is directed to downstream equipment such as to a turbo system or to the air intake of an engine system.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The particular air cleaner (filter) assembly <b>1</b> depicted includes an optional precleaner stage. The precleaner stage is provided in part by directing air from inlet tube <b>7</b><i>t </i>tangentially into interior <b>2</b><i>i </i>of the housing <b>2</b>. The air will then be directed into a cyclonic pattern around an interior of the assembly <b>1</b>. This will tend to drive a portion of any water or dust particles contained within the air stream, against an interior surface of sidewall <b>2</b><i>s</i>. This material, separated from the air stream, will eventually migrate to, and enter, the tube <b>9</b>, from which ejection occurs through valve <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The particular air cleaner assembly <b>1</b> depicted is configured so that it can be mounted in a variety of orientations, for example with the central axis X directed vertically, or alternatively with the central axis X directed horizontally. This is facilitated by having outlet tube <b>9</b> directed downwardly.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The housing body section <b>3</b> can include a mounting pad arrangement thereon. The mounting pad arrangement can be formed integral with a remainder of the housing <b>2</b> or it can be a separate piece. The mounting pad arrangement is used to help secure the housing <b>2</b> in place, on equipment with which air cleaner <b>1</b> would be used. By having the mounting pad arrangement on the housing section <b>3</b>, the housing section <b>3</b> can be retained in place on the equipment by bolts, or other systems during servicing, with access cover <b>4</b> being removably secured to body section <b>3</b>, for convenient servicing. An exemplary mounting pad arrangement that can be used as part of the housing section <b>3</b> is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,864,866, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As thus far described the air cleaner assembly is similar to many prior air cleaner assemblies, including those depicted and described in WO 2006/026241 A1; WO 2009/014988; U.S. Pat. No. 6,419,718 B1; and, U.S. Pat. No. 8,864,866, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, which show the housing assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> used in conjunction with a first example of serviceable internal filtration components that can be provided within the housing <b>2</b>. In the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a first filter cartridge <b>100</b> and a second filter cartridge <b>200</b> are viewable and shown as being positionable within housing interior <b>2</b><i>i</i>.

In general, the cartridge <b>100</b> is a serviceable component that includes an extension of filter media <b>102</b> through which air to be filtered passes, before it can exit assembly <b>1</b>. Likewise, the cartridge <b>200</b> is a serviceable component that includes an extension of filter media <b>202</b> through which air to be filtered also passes before exiting assembly <b>1</b>. By the term &#x201c;serviceable component&#x201d;, as used herein in reference to the cartridges <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, it is meant that the cartridges <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> are removable and replaceable in the air cleaner assembly <b>1</b>. Thus, as media <b>102</b>, <b>202</b> of the filter cartridges <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> occludes during use, the cartridge <b>100</b> and/or the cartridge <b>200</b> can be removed, and can be refurbished or replaced.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In one aspect, the housing <b>2</b> can include an optional, but advantageous, shield arrangement surrounding a selected portion of the filter cartridge <b>100</b>. The shield arrangement can be used to inhibit direct impingement, of dust and other material carried by the inlet air onto the media <b>102</b> until after the air has moved at least partially through the cyclonic pattern and past shield in a direction toward access cover <b>4</b>. Such a shield helps facilitate removal of dust and other materials into dust ejector arrangement <b>8</b>. Use of shield arrangements is common in many air cleaner arrangements, see for example WO 2006/026241 A1; WO 2009/014988; U.S. Ser. No. 61/446,653; U.S. Ser. No. 61/473,296; U.S. Pat. No. 6,419,718 B1; and U.S. Pat. No. 8,864,866, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Analogous features and principles can be used here.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">It is noted that the use of a shield arrangement and dust ejector arrangement <b>8</b> is consistent with many applications in which a &#x201c;dual stage&#x201d; or &#x201c;two stage&#x201d; air (gas) cleaner is desired, having a first precleaner stage to separate water and larger particles from the air before it passes into the filter cartridge <b>100</b> (the second stage). However, such features are generally optional, and many of the principles of the present disclosure can be applied in air cleaners that do not have such a two stage configuration or precleaner stage.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Downstream of the filter cartridge <b>100</b> is the secondary filter cartridge <b>200</b> so that air passes through both of the filter cartridge <b>100</b> and the filter cartridge <b>200</b> prior to exiting via the air outlet <b>52</b>. It should be understood that the air cleaner assembly <b>1</b> can be operated with the filter cartridge <b>100</b> alone, with the filter cartridge <b>200</b> alone, or with both the filter cartridge <b>100</b> and the filter cartridge <b>200</b> provided together and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">II.

In general, the primary filter cartridge or primary filter element and the secondary or safety filter cartridge or the secondary or safety filter element can be referred to as the filter cartridge or the filter element for convenience. Based on context, it should be apparent that references being made to the primary filter cartridge or the secondary filter cartridge.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In general terms, again, the cartridges <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> are serviceable components. That is, they can be removed and replaced through the lifetime of the air cleaner <b>1</b>. A releasable seal is necessary between the cartridge <b>100</b> and a portion of the outlet cover <b>50</b> and between the cartridge <b>200</b> and the outlet cover, to allow the cartridges to be serviceable components and to ensure that unfiltered air does not bypass the cartridge <b>100</b> and/or the cartridge <b>100</b> and enter the outlet tube <b>52</b>, as this can cause damage to the engine.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The filter cartridge <b>100</b> generally includes filtration media <b>102</b> extending between first and second opposite media ends <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. First media end <b>104</b> is engaged by a first end cap or piece <b>108</b>. The second media end <b>106</b> is engaged by a second end cap or piece <b>110</b>. Thus, the media <b>102</b> extends between opposite end caps (or end pieces) <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Although alternatives are possible with selected techniques described herein, for the example depicted, the filter media <b>102</b> is configured surrounding an open filter interior <b>102</b><i>i</i>, generally around a central axis X of the air cleaner <b>1</b> and cartridge <b>100</b>. The media <b>102</b> can be pleated media, although alternatives are possible. The media <b>102</b> can be configured in a cylindrical pattern as shown, if desired, although alternatives are possible. For example, the media <b>102</b> can be somewhat conical in extension between the opposite ends <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. Also, the media <b>102</b> can be configured with non-circular inner and/or outer perimeters; for example oval or other cross-sectional configurations are possible. In addition, the primary filter cartridge <b>100</b> can be provided with a screen or support structure <b>102</b><i>s </i>extending from the first end <b>104</b> to the second <b>106</b> to help support the filtration media <b>102</b> while allowing gas (air) to pass therethrough. The filtration media <b>102</b> can be embedded in the first and second end caps <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>. In addition, the screen or support structure <b>102</b><i>s </i>for the filtration media <b>102</b> can be embedded in the first and second end caps <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Although alternatives are possible with selected techniques described herein, the second end piece or cap <b>110</b> is typically a closed end piece or cap, extending completely across the media <b>102</b> at the second end <b>106</b>, closing that end <b>106</b> of the media <b>102</b> and the filter interior <b>102</b><i>i</i>. That is, end piece or cap <b>110</b>, for the example depicted, is a closed end piece or cap, i.e. an end cap having no aperture therethrough in communication with the open filter interior <b>102</b><i>i. </i></p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">First end piece or cap <b>108</b> on the other hand, is an open end piece or cap. That is, it surrounds and defines a central aperture <b>112</b> in communication with the media, in the example via open filter interior <b>102</b><i>i</i>. In typical use, aperture <b>112</b> is an air flow exit aperture from the media, for example open filter interior <b>102</b><i>i</i>, for filtered air. In alternate applications with a reverse direction of gas flow during filtering, aperture <b>112</b> can be an inlet aperture. In general, it is a gas flow aperture.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">For the example depicted, first end cap <b>108</b> extends completely across all media <b>102</b> of the cartridge <b>100</b>, from an outer perimeter <b>108</b><i>a </i>to an inner perimeter <b>108</b><i>b</i>. The first end cap <b>108</b> typically has only one, central, aperture <b>112</b> therethrough.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Again, when the access cover <b>4</b> is removed from the housing body section <b>3</b>, access to interior <b>2</b><i>i </i>is provided for either installation or removal of the cartridge <b>100</b>. The filter cartridge <b>100</b>, then, needs to be adequately removably sealed to the outlet cover <b>50</b> to protect against flow of unfiltered air into the exit tube <b>52</b>. To provide for this, the cartridge <b>100</b> is provided with a primary (or housing) seal arrangement <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">With respect to the first housing seal or primary seal arrangement <b>114</b>, and other features of first end cap <b>108</b>, attention is directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b> and <b>18</b>-<b>20</b></figref>. The primary seal arrangement <b>114</b> can be seen as defining a radially directed seal or seal surface <b>114</b><i>s </i>directed to engage a surface <b>52</b><i>s</i><b>1</b> of the outlet cover flow tube <b>52</b>, for releasable sealing. Accordingly, the primary seal arrangement <b>114</b> forms an inwardly directed radial seal with the outlet tube <b>52</b> when the primary filter cartridge <b>100</b> is installed in the filter assembly <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, it will be understood that the surface <b>114</b><i>s</i>, of primary seal arrangement <b>114</b>, that forms a seal with outlet tube <b>52</b> is generally a radially directed surface. Hence, the primary seal arrangement <b>114</b> can be referred to as a radially directed seal. By &#x201c;radially&#x201d; in this context, it is meant that the seal or seal surface (and the compression of the seal surface during sealing) is directed generally toward or away from (i.e. around) central axis X. The particular surface <b>114</b><i>s </i>in the example depicted, is radially inwardly directed relative to the central axis X, so the seal arrangement <b>114</b> can be characterized as &#x201c;radially inwardly directed.&#x201d; It is noted however, that a radially outwardly directed seal can be used with the same principles in accord with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">It is noted that in the example depicted, the housing seal arrangement <b>114</b> comprises a portion of end cap <b>108</b>. In more general terms, the housing seal arrangement <b>114</b> is mounted on a filter cartridge and is configured to releasably seal to a housing component or outlet tube <b>52</b>, whether that particular housing seal arrangement comprises a portion of an end piece or not.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The preferred and advantageous housing seal arrangements described herein are generally &#x201c;non-clamp&#x201d; or &#x201c;clampless&#x201d; housing seal arrangements. By this it is meant that they are established as the cartridge is inserted into the housing, without the need for tightening the clamp or connector of some type.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In one aspect, the end cap <b>108</b> and seal arrangement <b>114</b> can be constructed in a manner so that the amount of radial compression of end piece (cap) material in a region between surface <b>114</b><i>s </i>and the support media <b>102</b> or support <b>102</b><i>s </i>will have a maximum compression of at least 10%, typically at least 15%, preferably no more than about 35% and will typically be with a maximum compression within the range of about 20-30%, inclusive. To accomplish this, a seal support can be provided within the end cap <b>108</b>. In one aspect, the seal arrangement <b>114</b> has a stepped profile such that the seal arrangement has a smaller diameter proximate the closed end cap <b>110</b> in relation to the diameter most remote from the closed end cap <b>110</b>. This stepped profile facilitates easier acceptance onto the outlet tube <b>52</b> and also allows for progressive compression of the seal arrangement <b>114</b> during installation. Although a stepped profile is shown, many other profiles can be utilized, for example, profiles having cross-sectional shapes that are rectangular, oblong, geometric, chamfered, and/or round.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In one aspect, the seal arrangement <b>114</b> on the end cap is also provided with an axially deviating profile, wherein first portions <b>114</b><i>a </i>of the seal arrangement <b>114</b> are disposed at a first axial position and second portions <b>114</b><i>b </i>of the seal arrangement <b>114</b> are disposed at a second axial position <b>114</b><i>b</i>. The first and second portions <b>114</b><i>a</i>, <b>114</b><i>b</i>, which are separated by a height h<b>2</b>, are interconnected by sloped intermediate portions <b>114</b><i>c</i>. In one aspect, the edges of the first portion <b>114</b><i>a </i>most remote from the closed end cap <b>110</b> extend along a radial plane <b>130</b> while the edges of the second portion <b>114</b><i>b </i>most proximate the closed end cap <b>110</b> extend along a radial plane <b>132</b>. As most easily seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the radial planes <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> extend orthogonally with respect to the longitudinal axis X and are separated by a height h<b>3</b>. In the example shown, three first portions <b>114</b><i>a </i>and three second portions <b>114</b><i>b </i>are provided with six intermediate portions <b>114</b><i>c </i>therebetween. More or fewer portions <b>114</b><i>a</i>, <b>114</b><i>b</i>, <b>114</b><i>c </i>may be provided to obtain the desired axial deviation pattern.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In one aspect, the end cap <b>108</b> can be characterized as having a main body <b>116</b> from which a plurality of discrete, circumferentially spaced extension members <b>118</b> can extend axially away from the main body <b>116</b>. In the example shown, the extension members <b>118</b> are radially aligned with the seal arrangement second portions <b>114</b><i>b</i>. However, the extension members <b>118</b> may be oriented to align with the first portions <b>114</b><i>a </i>and/or the intermediate portions <b>114</b><i>c</i>. In the example shown, three similarly sized and configured extension members <b>118</b> are shown at an equal spacing from each other. However more or fewer extension members <b>118</b> could be provided. The extension members <b>118</b> are also not required to have an identical shape, size, or spacing. Instead, the filter cartridge <b>100</b> could be provided with differently sized or arranged extensions members <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Each of the extension members <b>118</b> has radially inward and outward facing sides <b>118</b><i>a</i>, <b>118</b><i>b </i>that extend from a base end <b>118</b><i>c </i>to a distal end <b>118</b><i>d </i>(to a height h<b>1</b>) and between first and second sides <b>118</b><i>e</i>, <b>118</b><i>f </i>(at a width w<b>1</b>). As presented, the first and second sides <b>118</b><i>e</i>, <b>118</b><i>f </i>slope inwardly towards each other in a direction from the base end <b>118</b><i>c </i>toward the distal end <b>118</b><i>d</i>. In the example shown, the sides <b>118</b><i>e</i>, <b>118</b><i>f </i>are disposed at about a 10 degree angle from the longitudinal axis X such that the angle defined between the sides <b>118</b><i>e</i>, <b>118</b><i>f </i>is about 20 degrees. In this example, the ratio between the height h<b>1</b> and the width w<b>1</b> is about 0.8. Other dimensions and configurations are possible. For example, the sides <b>118</b><i>e</i>, <b>118</b><i>f </i>could be parallel to the longitudinal axis X such that they extend vertically from the main body <b>116</b>. When the filter cartridge <b>100</b> is fully installed into the housing <b>2</b> and onto the outlet cover <b>50</b>, the extension members <b>118</b> are received into recesses or pockets <b>56</b> of the outlet cover <b>50</b>. Once in this position, the sides <b>118</b><i>e</i>, <b>118</b><i>f </i>contact sidewalls <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b </i>of the recess to prevent rotation of the cartridge <b>100</b> with respect to the outlet cover <b>50</b>. In the example shown, the contact between the sides <b>118</b><i>e</i>, <b>118</b><i>f </i>and the sidewalls <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b </i>occurs along only a portion of the sides <b>118</b><i>e</i>, <b>118</b><i>f </i>In other examples, the sidewalls <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b </i>can be configured to be parallel to the sides <b>118</b><i>e</i>, <b>118</b><i>f </i>such that a greater contact length is achieved.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Each of the extension members <b>118</b> is provided with one or more rotational alignment features that enable the filter cartridge <b>100</b> to be properly aligned with respect to the outlet cover <b>50</b> and within the housing <b>2</b>. In the example shown, each extension member is provided with an optional axial channel or recess <b>120</b> extending from a distal end <b>120</b><i>a </i>proximate the extension member distal end <b>118</b><i>d </i>to a base end <b>120</b><i>b </i>that is within the interior space <b>102</b><i>i </i>proximate the seal structure second portions <b>114</b><i>b </i>and adjacent to the media <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the axially deviating seal arrangement first portions <b>114</b><i>a </i>are located between the channels or recesses <b>120</b> while the second portions <b>114</b><i>b </i>are located axially below the channels or recesses <b>120</b>. In alternate arrangements, the channels or recesses <b>120</b> are not aligned with the second portions <b>114</b><i>b</i>. However, in such an example, the length of the channels or recesses <b>120</b> would be limited by the axial location of the portion of the seal arrangement <b>114</b> with which the channels or recesses <b>120</b> are aligned. The shown arrangement allows for the channels or recesses <b>120</b> to have the maximum possible length.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the example shown, the axial recess <b>120</b> has a width and depth that each taper or narrow in a direction from the distal end <b>120</b><i>a </i>to the base end <b>120</b><i>b</i>. As can be seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, the outlet cover <b>50</b> is provided with axially extending ribs <b>54</b> that are similarly tapered from a distal narrow end <b>54</b><i>a </i>to a wider base end <b>54</b><i>b </i>to form a complementary shape with the axial channels or recesses <b>120</b>. Thus, when the filter cartridge <b>100</b> is initially being inserted into the outlet cover <b>50</b>, the narrow end <b>54</b><i>a </i>of each rib <b>54</b> is received by the wider acceptance area of the distal end <b>120</b><i>a </i>of the recess <b>120</b>. This arrangement allows for the filter cartridge <b>100</b> to be inserted towards the outlet cover <b>50</b> and subsequently rotated until the ribs <b>54</b> are aligned with the channels or recesses <b>120</b> at which point the filter cartridge <b>100</b> will drop further into place until the ribs <b>54</b> are fully received into the channels or recesses <b>120</b> and the extension members <b>118</b> are received into a recess <b>56</b> of the outlet cover <b>50</b>. Once fully inserted, the ribs <b>54</b> fit tightly against the channels or recesses <b>120</b> to securely hold the filter cartridge <b>100</b> in the desired alignment with the seal structure <b>114</b> sealing against the outer surface <b>52</b><i>s</i><b>1</b> of the outlet tube <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Another rotational alignment feature associated with the filter cartridge <b>100</b> is provided by a guide member <b>122</b> which extends from each extension member <b>118</b>. The guide member <b>122</b> has an arc-shape that generally follows the shape of the distal end <b>118</b><i>d </i>of the extension member <b>118</b>. However, in contrast to the polyurethane extension member <b>118</b>, the guide member <b>122</b> is formed from a relatively hard plastic, such as ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) or PP (polypropylene plastic). The guide member <b>122</b> can thus be referred to as a low friction member in that it has lower frictional resistance with respect to the hard plastic housing. In some cases, the low friction member need not have a greater hardness than the extension members, provided the material of the low friction member acts to reduce friction to a level lower than that which would otherwise exist between the housing and the extension members. Where, the extension members are made from a relatively hard plastic, the guide member <b>122</b> can contribute to the stiffness of the extension members <b>118</b>. In one aspect, the desired stiffness (and thus, the tactile feedback to the installer) of the extension members <b>118</b> can be achieved by designing the shape and size of the polyurethane forming the extension members and the shape and size of the portion of the guide members <b>122</b> embedded within the polyurethane. In some examples, a guide member is provided on less than the total number of extension members. For example, a filter cartridge could be provided with six extension members, three of which include the guide member.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">During installation of the filter cartridge <b>100</b> into the outlet cover <b>50</b>, the guide member <b>122</b> will initially contact sloped walls <b>56</b><i>c </i>or <b>56</b><i>d </i>adjacent the recess <b>56</b> when the extension members <b>118</b> are not perfectly aligned with the recesses or pockets <b>56</b>. The sloped walls <b>56</b><i>c </i>and <b>56</b><i>d </i>are interconnected by a curved or radiused portion <b>56</b><i>e </i>to allow the guide member <b>122</b> to be smoothly guided in either direction towards wall <b>56</b><i>c </i>or <b>56</b><i>d</i>. As the outlet cover <b>50</b> is also formed from a relatively hard plastic, relatively little friction exists between the sloped walls <b>56</b><i>c</i>, <b>56</b><i>d </i>and the guide members <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> shows a condition in which filter cartridge <b>200</b>, which is provided with a similar guide member, has been initially inserted into the outlet cover <b>50</b> such that the guide member is in contact with the sloped wall. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> shows the filter cartridge further inserted wherein the guide members are sliding along the sloped walls such that the filter cartridge extension members are being gradually aligned with the recesses. Due to the sloped walls <b>56</b><i>c</i>, <b>56</b><i>d </i>and the low friction relationship between the hard plastic (e.g. ABS, PP) guide surfaces <b>122</b> and the hard plastic (e.g. ABS, PP) walls <b>56</b><i>c</i>, <b>56</b><i>d</i>, the filter cartridge <b>100</b> will automatically begin to rotate as the installer applies force to the filter cartridge in a direction towards the open end cap <b>108</b>. Preliminary testing by the inventors has shown that this type of automatic rotation or translation of force cannot be easily achieved, if at all, when the portion of the extension members <b>118</b> that contacts the walls <b>56</b><i>c</i>, <b>56</b><i>d </i>are formed from a relatively soft material, such as polyurethane. Thus, the addition of the hard plastic guide members <b>122</b> are included in the end cap <b>108</b> to enable the axial force provided by the installer to be translated into rotational force.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The automatic rotation of the filter cartridge <b>100</b> will occur until one of the sides <b>118</b><i>e</i>, <b>118</b><i>f </i>of each extension member <b>118</b> comes into contact with the rib <b>54</b>. At this point, the ribs <b>54</b> provide resistance to rotation of the filter cartridge <b>100</b>, and the installer must then either apply additional axial force and/or begin to actively rotate the filter cartridge with a rotational force, depending upon the sloped configuration of the walls <b>56</b><i>c</i>, <b>56</b><i>d </i>and the configuration of the guide members <b>122</b>. Notably, the slope of the walls <b>56</b><i>c</i>, <b>56</b><i>d </i>increases at a radius or curved portion <b>56</b><i>e </i>as the walls approach the recesses or pockets <b>56</b> in order to increase the amount of force that is translated from the axial direction to the rotational direction.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The extension members <b>118</b> are formed with enough flexibility such that they will deflect radially outwardly over the ribs <b>54</b> when the filter cartridge <b>100</b> is subjected to sufficient rotational force. As most easily seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the ribs <b>54</b> are provided with a dual tapered profile (i.e. rib narrows in direction from recess <b>56</b> towards end <b>52</b><i>b </i>and in a direction from the sealing surface <b>52</b><i>s</i><b>1</b> radially outward) to enable the extension members <b>118</b> to initially deflect over the ribs. As the filter cartridge <b>100</b> is forced to rotate, the ribs <b>54</b> will eventually snap into the channels or recesses <b>120</b> of the extension members <b>118</b>, at which point the extension members <b>118</b> largely return to their original position. The snapping action that occurs when the ribs <b>54</b> snap into the channels or recesses <b>120</b> provides a tactile feedback to the installer, thereby providing verification to the installer that the filter cartridge <b>100</b> is fully installed. Once the filter cartridge <b>100</b> has been rotated to this point, the extension members <b>118</b> can then drop fully into the recesses or pockets <b>56</b>, as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>. Depending on how the installer applies force, the extension members <b>118</b> can drop into the recesses during rotation (if axial and rotational force are applied at same time) or after rotational force is applied to cause the ribs <b>54</b> to be received within the recesses or pockets <b>56</b>. Of course, if the installer initially aligns the channels or recesses <b>120</b> with the ribs <b>54</b>, the filter cartridge <b>100</b> can simply be dropped straight into the housing and pressed into the fully installed position without rotation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> shows the filter cartridge fully installed wherein the extension members <b>118</b> have dropped into the recesses. In some embodiments, the recesses or pockets <b>56</b> and extension members <b>118</b> are formed such that the guide members <b>122</b> no longer contact the housing once the cartridge <b>100</b> is fully installed. This can be accomplished by providing the recesses or pockets <b>56</b> with a longer depth such that the extension members <b>118</b> provide all contact with outlet cover <b>50</b> via the sidewalls <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> to <b>10</b></figref>, it can be seen that the guide members <b>122</b> are formed from a ring structure <b>124</b> in which the guide members <b>122</b> extend upwardly from a base ring <b>126</b>.

In the embodiment shown, the guide members <b>122</b> are also provided with a support rib <b>122</b><i>b </i>which not only provides strengthening to the guide member <b>122</b> itself but also to the extension members <b>118</b> within which they are embedded within. In an alternative example, the extension members <b>118</b> can include separate guide members <b>122</b> that are either individually embedded into the extension members <b>118</b> or are simply attached to the distal ends <b>118</b><i>d </i>of the extension members <b>118</b>. In one example, the guide members <b>122</b> are provided as an attachment to the extension members <b>118</b>. The guide members <b>122</b> can also be formed such that they are integrally formed with the filter cartridge liner <b>102</b><i>s</i>.

Preliminary testing has shown that, without the presence of a hard plastic guide member <b>122</b>, the filter cartridge will not automatically rotationally align, with an applied axial force, as too much friction essentially exists between the polyurethane extension member and the outlet cover walls. Accordingly, there is no need to provide walls <b>56</b><i>c </i>at a sloped angle towards the recesses or pockets <b>56</b>&#x2032; since the guide members <b>122</b> are not provided.

Outlet cover <b>50</b>&#x2033; is also shown as being provided with additional rib structures <b>55</b>&#x2033; located on the outer surface of the outlet tube <b>52</b>&#x2033; such that the seal pathway along the outer surface is more tightly constrained. The rib structures <b>55</b>&#x2033; are shown as being a pair of spaced apart parallel ribs, although a single rib could be provided.

Where similar features do exist, similar reference numbers are used within the series designation (e.g. <b>202</b> instead of <b>102</b>, etc.). Outside of having a smaller overall dimension, such that the filter cartridge <b>200</b> can fit within the interior space <b>102</b><i>i </i>of the filter cartridge <b>100</b>, the filter cartridge <b>200</b> has an axially deviating seal arrangement <b>214</b> that seals against surface <b>52</b><i>s</i><b>2</b> and recesses or channels <b>220</b> in the extension members <b>118</b> that are both directed radially outward and are disposed on the outward side of the end cap <b>208</b>.

Furthermore, in the event of a malfunction in the primary filter cartridge <b>100</b>, the secondary filter cartridge <b>200</b> is available to prevent dust or debris from entering the outlet tube <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The secondary filter cartridge <b>200</b> includes a first end <b>204</b>, and second end <b>206</b>, and filtration media <b>202</b> extending between the first end <b>204</b> and the second end <b>206</b>. In the exemplary secondary filter cartridge <b>200</b> depicted, the first end <b>204</b> includes a first endcap <b>208</b> and the second <b>206</b> includes a second end cap <b>210</b>. The secondary filter cartridge <b>200</b> can be provided, if desired, without a second end cap <b>210</b>. That is, the secondary filter cartridge <b>200</b> can be provided so that the media extends over the second end <b>206</b>. In addition, the secondary filter cartridge <b>200</b> can be provided with a screen or support structure(s) <b>202</b><i>s </i>extending from the first end <b>204</b> to the second <b>206</b> to help support the filtration media <b>202</b> while allowing gas (air) to pass therethrough.

The media <b>202</b> can be provided as depth media, although alternatives are possible. For example, the media <b>202</b> can be provided as pleated media or as multilayer laminate media such as the media disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 2015/010085, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, the media <b>202</b> can be provided as the filtration media layer arranged in a wave configuration disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 2015/010085. The media <b>202</b> can be configured in a cylindrical pattern as shown, if desired, although alternatives are possible. For example, the media <b>202</b> can be somewhat conical in extension between the opposite ends <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>.

The support or screen(s) <b>202</b><i>s </i>helps support the secondary seal member <b>214</b> when it engages the outlet tube <b>52</b>. The secondary seal member <b>214</b> can be referred to as a housing seal structure or arrangement for the secondary filter cartridge <b>200</b>. As with the seal arrangement <b>114</b>, the seal arrangement <b>114</b> has a stepped profile and has an axially deviating profile into which channels or recesses <b>220</b> extend.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In general, the secondary seal member <b>214</b> can be molded integrally with the end cap <b>208</b> and provides an outwardly directed sealing surface <b>214</b><i>s</i>.

The filter cartridges <b>200</b>&#x2032; and <b>200</b>&#x2033; share many common features with the filter cartridge <b>200</b>. For such features, the description for the filter cartridge <b>200</b> is entirely applicable to filter cartridges <b>200</b>&#x2032; and <b>200</b>&#x2033;, and need not be repeated here. Where similar features do exist, similar reference numbers are used. The description for filter cartridges <b>200</b>&#x2032;, <b>200</b>&#x2033; will be directed to the differences between the filter cartridges.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">One such difference is that the guide members <b>222</b> are not provided for filter cartridge <b>200</b>&#x2032;.

The extension members <b>218</b>&#x2032; also have a slightly different shape with a lower height to width ratio, as compared to extension members <b>218</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b>-<b>40</b></figref> show the filter cartridges <b>100</b>&#x2032; and <b>200</b>&#x2032; in an assembled state with respect to the outlet cover <b>50</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">As with filter cartridge <b>200</b>&#x2032;, filter cartridge <b>200</b>&#x2033; is provided without guide members <b>222</b>. The primary remaining difference for filter cartridge <b>200</b>&#x2033; is that the extension members <b>218</b> are provided with a much greater width and the sidewalls of the extension members <b>218</b> are sloped at a greater angle towards each other. Accordingly, there is relatively less space between the extension members <b>218</b>&#x2033; in comparison to the first two embodiments. To accommodate the greater width extension members <b>218</b>&#x2033; of filter cartridge <b>200</b>&#x2033;, the outlet cover recesses can be provided with a similar shape.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>23</b></figref>, the filter cartridges <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> are shown in a fully installed state with respect to outlet cover <b>50</b>. As can be appreciated from these views, it can be seen that that the filter seal arrangements <b>114</b>, <b>214</b> seal against a common wall <b>52</b> of the outlet cover <b>50</b> in which the axially extending ribs <b>54</b>, <b>60</b> are directly opposite each other. With such an arrangement, the extension members <b>118</b>, <b>218</b> are likewise opposite each other and are received within oppositely aligned recesses or pockets <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>. Although such an alignment is not necessarily required, the resulting construction of the outlet cover <b>50</b> is less complex when the outlet cover <b>50</b> receives aligned cartridges <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. As can be most easily seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>23</b></figref>, the outlet tube wall <b>52</b><i>a </i>against which the seal arrangements <b>114</b>, <b>214</b> form a seal has an axially varying profile at end <b>52</b><i>b</i>. This axially varying profile matches the axially varying profile of the seal arrangements <b>114</b>, <b>214</b>. Thus, proper sealing can only be obtained when the filter cartridges <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> are rotated such that the seal arrangements <b>114</b>, <b>214</b> are properly aligned and in phase with the outlet tube wall <b>52</b><i>a</i>. Also, because the profile at end <b>52</b><i>b </i>matches the profile of the seal arrangements <b>114</b>, <b>214</b>, the seal arrangements <b>114</b>, <b>214</b> do not need to be inserted deeply into the tube wall <b>52</b><i>a </i>during installation, which would be required if the end <b>52</b><i>b </i>had a straight profile. This configuration avoids significant frictional forces that would otherwise exist if the end <b>52</b><i>b </i>had a straight profile that would impede the ability of the filter cartridge <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> to automatically rotate as an installer pressed the filters axially into the housing. The alignment of the filter cartridges is ensured by the interaction of the extension members <b>118</b>, <b>218</b> within recesses or pockets <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> and/or by the interaction of the ribs <b>54</b>, <b>60</b> within the channels or recesses <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>. It noted that the filter cartridges <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> could be provide could be provided with only the channels or recesses <b>120</b>, <b>220</b> or with only the guide members <b>122</b>, <b>222</b> as each of these structures serves such an alignment function.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Although specific examples for the first and second filters <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> including many or all of the above described features, many combinations of features are possible although a reduction in some functionality or performance may result. For example, a filter cartridge can be provided that includes an axially varying seal arrangement and axially extending channels within the end cap with or without the presence of the extension and guide members. In one example, a filter cartridge can be provided that includes the extension members and axially extending channels with or without a seal arrangement that varies axially and with or without the guide members. In one example, a filter cartridge can be provided that has the extension members and guide members with or without a seal arrangement that varies axially and with or without the axially extending channels. The housing and/or outlet cover can likewise be provided with or without the corresponding features that interact with such filter cartridge arrangements. For example, the outlet cover can be provided without the ribs if axially extending channels are not present in the filter cartridge. Similarly, where the extension members are not provided on the filter cartridge, the outlet cover can be provided without the recesses into which the extension members extend.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">IV.

Filtration Media and Terminology</heading><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The particular material chosen for the media is a matter of choice for a selected application. When the filter assembly is an air cleaner, any of a variety of media materials now used in air cleaners can be used with principles according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The media pack can comprise only media <b>102</b>, <b>202</b> or the media can be provided with an inner and/or outer liner before installation in the cartridge <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. The media can be pleated, nonpleated, depth media, or wave media although additional alternatives are possible. The media can be provided in a variety of configurations including cylindrical and conical, and with a variety of inner and/or outer perimeter definitions, for example circular or oval.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">It is noted that although the seal of the arrangements are sometimes characterized as &#x201c;radial.&#x201d; However, as a result of the non-circular shape, some of the sealing forces will be directed other than specifically at or away from the central axis X of the cartridge. The seals are nevertheless characterized herein as &#x201c;radial,&#x201d; since, in general, the seal surfaces on the cartridge and housing are generally radially directed and the sealing forces are either radially outwardly directed or radially inwardly directed, around the axis X, depending on whether an outward or inward seal surface is involved. Alternately stated, the compression forces are still not axial (i.e. in the longitudinal direction of axis X), but rather are generally radial. There are applications, however, where the seal forces are not aligned directly toward or away from the axis X in each of these non-circular configurations.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In more general terms, radial seals comprise seal surfaces that surrounds (directed toward away from) a central axis. That central axis in many instances will comprise a central axis of a filter cartridge around which media is also positioned. However, from alternative arrangements described herein below, it will be understood that a radial seal can be a seal that surrounds an axis that is not also a central axis for the cartridge (by contrast, an axial seal is a seal that is generally aligned with a central axis around which the seal is positioned, typically also, but not necessarily in all instances, a central cartridge axis X).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In the general terminology used herein, the various housing seal arrangements depicted can also be characterized as generally comprising a radially directed seal surface, since the seal direction for the various housing seals depicted in the drawings, is generally with a surface of the seal engaging some portion of the housing (be it a portion of an outlet tube or outer portion of the housing, depending on whether which of the two of the housing seals is involved) that can be generally characterized as a &#x201c;radially directed surface.&#x201d; In each instance, the surface that actually forms the seal is directed around (and facing toward or away from) a central axis X (typically, also of the cartridge) as opposed to an axial seal which would be generally with seal forces directed in the longitudinal direction of the central axis X. The examples depicted are &#x201c;outward radial seal surfaces&#x201d; or &#x201c;outwardly directed radial seals&#x201d; since the actual surface of the seal member on the cartridge that will form a seal in engagement with a housing, is generally directed away from a central axis of the cartridge, as opposed as toward the axis. However, many of the principles described herein can be applied in alternate arrangements in which the seal surface on the cartridge that engages the housing to form a seal is directed radially toward the central axis.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The radial housing seals described herein can be generally characterized as &#x201c;non-clamp,&#x201d; &#x201c;non-clamping&#x201d; or &#x201c;clampless&#x201d; arrangements or by similar terms. By this it is meant that the seal arrangements typically do not involve the use of a clamp such as a hose clamp or other structure that needs to be tightened in order to provide for a secure seal. Rather, the seals are established by mere installation, with compression of the seal material against a surface of the housing being directed by a cartridge component.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The principles described herein can be applied in a variety of filter assemblies. Examples described in which the principles applied to (air) gas filter assemblies. Examples are described include air filters and crankcase ventilation filter assemblies. The principles can be applied to a variety of alternate gas filtration arrangements, in some instances even with liquid filter assemblies.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Principles according to the present disclosure relate to interactions between filter cartridges and air cleaner systems, in advantageous manners to achieve certain, selected, desired results discussed below. The filter cartridge would generally include a filter media therein, through which air and other gases pass, during a filtering operation. The media can be of a variety of types and configurations, and can be made from using a variety of materials. For example, pleated media arrangements can be used in cartridges according to the principles of the present disclosure, as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The principles are particularly well adapted for use in situations in which the media is quite deep in extension between the inlet and outlet ends of the cartridge, but alternatives are possible. Also, the principles are often used in cartridges that relatively large cross-dimension sizes. With such arrangements, alternate media types to pleated media will often be desired.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In this section, examples of some media arrangements that are usable with the techniques described herein are provided. It will be understood, however, that a variety of alternate media types can be used. The choice of media type is generally one of preference for: availability; function in a given situation of application, ease of manufacturability, etc. and the choice is not necessarily specifically related to the overall function of selected ones of various filter cartridge/air cleaner interaction features characterized herein.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-50" num="01-50"><claim-text><b>1</b>.-<b>50</b>.
