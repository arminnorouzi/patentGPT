Driving of the gate lines can be implemented by an integrated driving circuit amounted on an array substrate.

Data signals are provided by data lines to the pixel units of a corresponding row in the pixel array, thereby forming gray voltages required for displaying grayscales of an image, and displaying each frame of the image.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The embodiments of the present disclosure provide a gate driving circuit and a display panel.

It should be noted that the resistance value of the first resistor in the embodiment of the present disclosure may be zero, that is, the input terminal of the first clock signal line may not be connected to a resistor.
