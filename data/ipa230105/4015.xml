The range information is detected in relation to timing and waveform characteristics of reflected light received back by the system. While not limiting, the light wavelengths used in a typical LiDAR system may range from ultraviolet to near infrared (e.g., 250 nanometers, nm to 1500 nm or more). Other wavelength ranges can be used.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">One commonly employed form of LiDAR is sometimes referred to as coherent pulsed LiDAR, which generally uses coherent light and detects the range based on detecting phase differences in the reflected light. Such systems may use a dual (I/Q) channel detector with an I (in-phase) channel and a Q (quadrature) channel. Other forms of LiDAR systems can be used, however, including non-coherent light systems that may incorporate one or more detection channels. Further alternatives that can be incorporated into LiDAR systems include systems that sweep the emitted light using mechanical based systems that utilize moveable mechanical elements, solid-state systems with no moving mechanical parts but instead use phase array mechanisms to sweep the emitted light in a direction toward the target, and so on.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term collimation generally refers to the extent to which light rays (e.g., photons/photon paths) are nominally parallel with one another. It is generally desirable to increase collimation (parallelism) and decrease divergence (scattering) within a light beam to enhance LiDAR performance. As a result, there remains a continued need for small sized, light weight and inexpensive emitter and detector configurations that provide tailored and well controlled beam characteristics including high levels of collimation and low levels of divergence. It is to these and other needs that various embodiments of the present disclosure are generally directed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As described below, various embodiments provide an optical collimation system suitable for use in a LiDAR system. The collimation system includes a light source, a first optics assembly and a second optics assembly. A light beam emitted by the light source passes successively through the respective first and second optics assemblies to collimate the light beam along multiple orthogonal axes.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The collimation system has specially configured refraction features that diverge along one axis and converge along another orthogonal axis, allowing for better collimation power in a smaller amount of space. In some cases, multiple lenses may be adjoined into the optics assembly to carry out these functions. While the axes may be vertical and horizontal (e.g., X-Y), other arrangements can be provided depending on the requirements of a given application. Additional axes of collimation can be utilized as desired.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">These and other features and advantages of various embodiments can be understood beginning with a review of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which provides a simplified functional representation of a LiDAR system <b>100</b> constructed and operated in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. The LiDAR system <b>100</b> is configured to obtain range information regarding a target <b>102</b> that is located distal from the system <b>100</b>. The information can be beneficial for a number of areas and applications including, but not limited to, topography, archeology, geology, surveying, geography, forestry, seismology, atmospheric physics, laser guidance, automated driving and guidance systems, closed-loop control systems, etc.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The LiDAR system <b>100</b> includes a controller <b>104</b> which provides top level control of the system.

In some cases, the controller can include the use of one or more programmable processors with associated programming (e.g., software, firmware) stored in a local memory which provides instructions that are executed by the programmable processor(s) during operation. Other forms of controllers can be used, including hardware based controllers, digital signal processors (DSPs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), system on chip (SOC) integrated circuits, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), gate logic, reduced instruction set computers (RISCs), etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An energy source circuit <b>106</b>, also sometimes referred to as an emitter or a transmitter, operates to direct electromagnetic radiation in the form of light pulses (beams) towards the target <b>102</b>.

The controller <b>104</b> directs operation of the emitted light from the emitter <b>106</b>, denoted by arrow <b>110</b>, and decodes information from the reflected light obtained back from the target, as denoted by arrow <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Arrow <b>114</b> depicts the actual, true range information associated with the intervening distance (or other range parameter) between the LiDAR system <b>100</b> and the target <b>102</b>.
