Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a device for monitoring and balancing voltage of cell blocks in a battery, and more particularly to an external connector, which directly connects to terminals of cells in a battery module, for balance charging and discharging of the cell blocks, and a method for balance charging and discharging the cell blocks through the external connectors.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Battery modules are the key component of electric vehicles, including electric cars, electric scooters etc. The main factors to evaluate a battery module include capacity, voltage, safety, and charging time. A conventional battery module includes plural cells, and a plurality of the cells are connected in parallel to form a cell block, which is the basic component of the battery module. A voltage of the cell block is the same as the voltage of each cell since the cells are connected in parallel. In practice, the properties of the cells, such as charged ability, voltage, capacity curve will be different after times of charging and discharging even though they should be the same in theory.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In modern electric vehicles, the battery thereof usually has ten or more battery modules in series or in parallel (usually is in series), each battery module has dozens of cell blocks, and each cell block has one to dozens of cells. Therefore, there may be twelve to eighteen cell blocks in the battery of an electric scooter, and two hundreds or more cell blocks in the battery of an electric bus. Take the electric bus for example, the battery may has 1,200 cells while the battery has 200 cell blocks, and each cell block has 6 cells.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The difference among the 1,200 cells will be significant when the battery of the bus is charged and discharged a lot of times. Therefore, the battery is unable to be fully charged when the charged ability of at least one of the cells decreased, and unable to discharge even when the battery still has power therein in a short time. As a result, the electric will have worse and worse cruising endurance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To fix above problem, the battery will be checked to charge the cells with low voltage and discharge the cells with high voltage respectively.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A conventional method of charging and discharging the abnormal cells includes recording the voltages of every cell through a vehicle control unit (VCU) when the electric vehicle is running, and marking the cells with abnormal voltages (too high or too low). Next, the battery is removed from the vehicle to charge and discharge the abnormal cells by connecting a specific device to terminals of the abnormal cells. Sometime the cells are deep inside the battery and the operator is unable to reach the terminals of the cells, such cells will be charged or discharged through sampling wires of a battery management system (BMS). However, the sampling wires of BMS usually sustain a low current, so that the time of charging or discharging through the sampling wires is very long.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The conventional method of charging and discharging the abnormal cells has several drawbacks. First, usually the battery is very heavy that is very hard to remove it. Second, open the battery is harmful to the waterproof of the battery. Third, it is a hard task and takes a long time, and forth, the abnormal cells have different status, so they still will be different when they are charged or discharged in the same process.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above, the primary objective of the present invention is to provide a device and a method, which allows the abnormal cells to be charged and discharged in an easy way.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve the objective of the present invention, a battery includes a case, in which a battery module, a battery management system and a junction terminal block are received. The battery module has cell blocks electrically connected in series, and each of the cell blocks has electrodes. The junction terminal block has a plurality of junction terminals to be electrically connected to the electrodes of the cell blocks through a plurality of junction wires respectively. The battery further has an external connector having a plurality of external terminals to be electrically connected to the junction terminals of the junction terminal block through a plurality of external wires. The external terminals of the external connector are electrically connected to the cell blocks through the external wires, the junction terminals of the junction terminal block and the junction wires respectively, so that all the cell blocks are able to be charged individually through the external connector.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention allows the cell blocks in the case to be charged independently through the external connector. User is no need to disassemble the battery, so that the charging task is easy to ensure all the cell blocks would be charged to a uniform condition to elongate the battery life.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention will be best understood by referring to the following detailed description of some illustrative embodiments in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a circuit of the battery model with eight cell blocks of a preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a circuit of the alternate design of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, showing the single type junction terminal block, the battery module, the and external connector of the cell blocks;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a circuit of another alternate design of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, showing the dual type junction terminal block, the battery module, and the external connector of the cell blocks;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, showing the circuit board type junction terminal block and the external connector of the cell blocks;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a sketch diagram of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, showing the circuit board type junction terminal block and the BMS;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, showing the external connector on the case;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective view of the alternate design of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, showing the external connector extending out of the case through the cable;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of another alternate design of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, showing the case with a lid to cover the external connector; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view of the third alternate design of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, showing the case with a lid and the external connector with a cable.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a circuit of a battery <b>1</b> of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, including a battery module <b>2</b>, a temperature sensor module <b>3</b>, a battery management system (BMS) <b>4</b>, a communication connector <b>5</b>, and a charging/discharging connector <b>6</b>.

These cells construct cell blocks, and the cell blocks are connected in series to form the battery module. The cells will have different statuses after predetermined times of charging and discharging, and that will decrease the performance of the battery.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In practice, a cell is fully charged for the first time, and recharged until the cell has 20% power remained. Usually, it is called 80% DOD (depth of discharge). With such operation, it will take ten years that the cell will have 80% performance than the new cell. In average, the performance of the cell decreases 0.167% per month, and decreases 2% per year. However, when the cells are connected to form a battery module, the total performance of battery module decreases larger than the cells because of the variation of the cells. In practice, the performance of the battery module will decrease 1% (including 0.167% decrease of the cells) after 60 times of charge/discharge in a month. Therefore, it will have 12% decrease ((including 2% decrease of the cells) every year. The performance of the battery module will be less than 80% after two years. The only way to fix this problem is balance charging and discharging the cell blocks. However, the conventional way of balance charging and discharging the cell blocks is not easy.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present invention provides the external connector which make the balance charging and discharging task easier to recover the battery module in an easy way. If a battery module is operated for balance charging and discharging task every one to three months, it will have 2% decrease per year (the decrease caused by the variation of the cells is eliminated) to elongate the life of the battery module. Therefore, the present invention provides the external connector which electrically connects the electrodes of the cell block inside to make the balance charging and discharging task easier than the conventional way.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">If a battery module is charged with the BMS, the BMS will stop the charging task when a difference of the voltage of any two if the cells is larger than 0.3V. In our invention, all the cells are directly charged through the external connector, so that the charging task will be stop only when the cells are fully charged even there is a cell with 0 voltage.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In practice, the battery module is charged with a large constant current until at least one cell block is full (or reach a predetermined voltage), and then charged with a constant voltage until the current is lower to a predetermined value. In this condition, usually there is only one cell block being fully charged since the cell blocks of the battery module are different. For rest of the cell blocks they only are nearly full or reach a voltage that can be called full. Next the battery module is connected to a charger through the external connector to charge the cell blocks individually until all the cell blocks are fully charged or all of them have the same voltage to make sure all the cell blocks have the same condition. In conclusion, the present invention may charge the battery module with a large current to shorten the charging time.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The present invention allows to monitor a temperature inside the battery module through the testing member <b>3</b>-<b>1</b><i>t </i>to <b>3</b>-<b>4</b><i>t </i>and the junction terminal blocks <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">However, the vehicle is stopped when the battery module is charged with the method of the present invention, so the battery module usually does not have the temperature problem in the time of charging with the method of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It must be pointed out that the embodiments described above are only some preferred embodiments of the present invention.
