AC power is input through an AC terminal. The AC power of 220V/50 Hz is taken as an example. The waveform of the input AC power is a 220V sine wave. Through a full-bridge rectifier U<b>1</b> composed of four diodes, the input alternating-current power is rectified as an arc-shaped wave. The primary winding of the transformer T<b>1</b> is connected to the switching pin SW of the switching power supply chip U<b>2</b>. A Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) square wave with a high frequency output by the switching pin SW is used to modulate the arc-shaped wave output by the rectifier U<b>1</b>. The feedback is obtained by a separate winding and input to the feedback pin FB of the switching power supply chip U<b>2</b> so that the output voltage of the secondary side is stable.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">An electrical apparatus (such as a chargeable device) may require an AC-DC power supply device for providing output voltages with different voltage values. For example, when a terminal that supports the power delivery (PD) protocol or the quick charge (QC) protocol requires an adapter for providing direct-current voltages with different voltage values, the AC-DC power supply device needs to communicate with the electrical apparatus through a communication chip. The electrical apparatus sends the required voltage value to the AC-DC power supply device. The AC-DC power supply device adjusts the pulse width or frequency of the output PWM signal according to the required voltage value, and obtains the feedback voltage from the winding of the transformer. The AC-DC power supply device also adjusts the pulse width or frequency of the PWM signal according to the feedback voltage, thereby obtaining a stable output voltage.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to the above description, it can be understood that the control circuit for adjusting the output voltage is located at the primary side of the transformer.

The trickle charging current is usually one tenth of the constant current charging current. When the battery voltage rises to be above a trickle charging threshold, the charging current increases, and the charging process enters the constant current charging stage.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the constant current charging stage, the battery is charged with a constant current, and the battery voltage rises rapidly. When the battery voltage reaches an expected voltage threshold (or cut-off voltage) of the battery, the charging process enters the constant voltage charging stage.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the constant voltage charging stage, the battery is charged at a constant voltage, and the charging current gradually decreases. When the charging current decreases to a set current threshold (the current threshold is usually one tenth of the value of the charging current in the constant current charging stage or lower, or optionally the current threshold may be tens of milliamps or lower), the battery is fully charged.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In addition, after the battery is fully charged, due to the influence of the self-discharge of the battery, the partial current loss may occur. At this time, the charging process enters a supplementary charging stage. In the supplementary charging stage, the charging current is very small for ensuring that the battery is fully charged.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The constant current charging stage in the embodiment of the present disclosure does not require that the charging current remains completely constant. However, it may generally mean that the peak value or average value of the charging current remains unchanged for a period of time.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In practice, the constant current charging stage may be achieved by a multi-stage constant current charging manner for the charging operation.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The multi-stage constant current charging comprises M constant current stages (M is an integer not less than 2). The multi-stage constant current charging starts from the charging of the first stag with a predetermined charging current. The M constant current stages of the aforementioned multi-stage constant current charging are executed sequentially from the first stage to the M-th stage. After the previous constant current stage among the constant current stage turns into the next constant current stage, the current becomes smaller. When the battery voltage reaches the charging voltage threshold corresponding to the present constant current stage, it goes to the next constant current stage. The current conversion process between two adjacent constant current stages may be gradual, or it can be a step-like jumping change.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">According to the above description, during the charging process of the battery, in the constant current charging stage, the charging current is the maximum, and the electric energy provided by the power supply device is the maximum so that the battery voltage increases rapidly. In the constant current charging stage, the switching frequency of the switch unit <b>117</b> may increase, that is, the frequency of the high-frequency control signal may increase, so as to speed up the extraction of energy.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the trickle charging stage and/or the constant voltage charging stage, since the required charging current is small, the switching frequency of the switch unit <b>117</b> may decrease, that is, the frequency of the high-frequency control signal may decrease, so as to slow down the extraction of energy.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Similarly, when the volume of the battery <b>132</b> is low, the frequency of the high-frequency control signal may increase to speed up the extraction of energy.
