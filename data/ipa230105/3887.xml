The system includes a control that is operable to receive sensing data from multiple sensors and, responsive to the sensing data, generates an alert or controls an accessory or system of the vehicle, or highlights or overlays an alert on a display screen (that may be displaying video images captured by a single rearward viewing camera or multiple cameras providing forward, side or 360 degree surround views of the area surrounding the vehicle during a reversing or low speed maneuver of the vehicle), or controls one or more vehicle systems.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring now to the drawings and the illustrative embodiments depicted therein, a vehicle <b>10</b> includes a lidar sensing system <b>12</b> (also known as LIDAR, LiDAR, and Lidar) that includes a plurality of lidar sensor modules or units such as a forward facing lidar sensor module or unit <b>14</b> (and other optional placement, such as a rearward facing sensor at the rear of the vehicle, and a sideward/rearward facing sensor at respective sides of the vehicle), which sense regions exterior of the vehicle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The sensing system <b>12</b> includes a control or electronic control unit (ECU) or processor that is operable to process data captured by the sensors and may detect objects or the like. The data transfer or signal communication from the sensor to the ECU may comprise any suitable data or communication link, such as a vehicle network bus or the like of the equipped vehicle. The lidar sensor module <b>14</b> and system <b>12</b> may utilize aspects of the sensing modules and systems described in U.S. Publication No. US-2018-0222450, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The automotive lidar sensor modules <b>14</b> of the present invention are configured to be mounted outside of the vehicle for detecting the environmental scene. A preferred location for these lidar sensor modules <b>14</b> to mount is within the bumpers and viewing or sensing outwardly. Generally, every design element at or in which a lidar sensor can be hidden and has an effectual view opening is optionally a place for mounting a lidar sensor, such as at the front grill, the head lights, the daytime running lights, a blinker, the license plate illumination, the tire housings, the vehicle emblem, the trunk lid opener handle, the door handles, the rearview mirrors or wing elements with rear view cameras at the place where usually the rearview mirrors were, the rooftop bars, the roof top antenna fins or the spoiler or the like.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is often advantageous to have a field of sensing that is wider than an individual sensor module <b>14</b> can provide. For example, a 360 degree field of sensing may be desired. To achieve a 360 field of sensing, three sensor modules with a field of sensing of 120 degrees may be used. However, for reasons such as mounting tolerances, this may lead to gaps or mismatches in the combined field of sensing. Therefore, sensor modules <b>14</b> with a wider field of sensing can be used, causing an overlap in the fields of sensing. It is then necessary to accurately &#x201c;stitch&#x201d; the overlapping fields of sensing together to determine a combined field of sensing. This allows the field of sensing of multiple sensor modules <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>) to be combined both spatially and temporally into a single field of sensing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with the present invention, each lidar sensor module <b>14</b> comprises a laser unit or laser generator or laser light source and a sensor unit or sensor and each module <b>14</b> is disposed at a vehicle <b>10</b> in such a way to give each module <b>14</b> a respective field of sensing exterior of the vehicle <b>10</b>. Each field of sensing is different from one another and partially overlaps at least one other field of sensing. The overlap may be any amount, but a minimal overlap is optimal. For example, the overlap may be just enough to overcome mounting tolerances. Each laser unit outputs a pulsed laser light that is reflected by a target. As the target reflects the laser light back toward system <b>12</b>, each respective sensor unit measures the reflected pulse from its associated laser unit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Sensing system <b>12</b> also includes a control. The control communicates with each lidar sensor module <b>14</b> and receives data output from the modules. The data output includes the measured reflected pulses. Differences in return times and wavelengths can be used to generate a three dimensional (3D) point cloud of the target. Responsive to these outputs, the control determines a combined field of sensing. Point clouds generated by separate sensor modules may be fused together by different region-of-interests (ROIs) or subareas. These subareas are stitched together to cover the entire field of sensing. Each subarea is typically generated by an independent sensor module <b>14</b>. When being stitched, it is desirous that the subareas be stitched accurately temporally and spatially.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">To this end, each laser unit that transmits in an overlap area may transmit a pattern of pulsed laser light that is different than each other pattern transmitted in the overlap area by other laser units. That is, for example, if two fields of sensing generated by two laser units has one overlap area between them, each laser may transmit a unique pattern in the overlap area. A laser unit may transmit the same pattern in overlap areas and non-overlap areas or transmit different patterns in overlap areas versus non-overlap areas. The laser units may alter the pattern in any number of ways. For example, the laser units may alter a laser energy level of the transmitted laser light. Each sensor unit may be operable to detect pattern differences between the overlap areas and the non-overlap areas. Alternatively, the control may be operable to determine differences in the patterns. The control may determine a degree of misalignment of a lidar sensor module relative to another lidar sensor module based on the detected pattern differences. That is, the control may determine an amount of actual overlap between the fields of sensing of the lidar sensor modules.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The control may be operable to determine, based at least on the detected patterns, an alignment marker (e.g., at the border between the overlap and non-overlap area). With such an alignment marker, in conjunction with computer vision analysis of subpictures and reordering of the subareas and other intelligent algorithms, the lidar data representative of the field of sensing of each sensor module <b>14</b> may be spatially synchronized and combined. In some examples, a laser unit detects the alignment marker of another laser unit and adjusts its field of sensing accordingly by mapping its overlap area with the other laser unit's overlap area. The control may determine a failure when the stitching fails, and report a failed framed to the system <b>12</b>. In this way, the overlap area can be minimized, as the control can accurately stitch the fields of sensing without requiring a large overlap area.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, a first laser unit may transmit a pattern &#x201c;A&#x201d; and a second laser unit may transmit a pattern &#x201c;B&#x201d;, with the patterns being different from one another and overlapping at an overlap area or region. The second laser unit detects the pattern A and can align its position via detection and processing of the received pattern A reflections. Optionally, the system or second laser unit can map the pattern &#x201c;A&#x201d; with its pattern &#x201c;B&#x201d; to determine alignment of the second laser unit relative to the first laser unit. The system thus is operable to determine the alignment of one laser unit relative to another via processing of a pattern transmitted by the other laser unit at an area where the first laser unit senses.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The system thus calibrates and combines the sensor information in a way that the Lidar sensors fit together at the borders of the fields of sensing. With a minimum overlap area of the different sensors, a special pattern can be projected by the Lidar (e.g., by adapting the laser energy pixel wise), and the special pattern can be recognized by both sensors. The system or processor processes data captured by the sensors and spatially synchronizes the data.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The system may utilize sensors, such as radar or lidar sensors or the like.
