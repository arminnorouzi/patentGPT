Many thousands of tons of grain are brought to processing facilities to be converted to food, industrial and feed products every day. The proper treatment and decontamination of these grain products is necessary to generate the highest possible product quality, from both an economic perspective but more importantly, from a human and animal safety standpoint.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to the CDC, In the past few years several <i>E. coli </i>infections have been linked to contaminated flour. These events have required several recalls of flour, cookie dough and brownie mixes in numerous states. Product labels have also been changed to reflect that flour is a raw agricultural product and requires cooking prior to consumption.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other contaminants on raw grains may include molds, yeast and/or bacteria. These contaminants can be activated in a temper or other wet processing system and cause the spores to enter a vegetative state, adding to the contaminant load. Untreated, these various contaminants can also limit the shelf life of finished products made with flour.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Pesticide residues are also an issue and are becoming more recognized as cancer-causing agents. Currently, pesticides are not actively treated in the processing of grains and the residues can eventually end up in finished products.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Prior to milling, some grains go through a conditioning process known as tempering. Tempering is where water mixed with a small amount of disinfectant (e.g., bleach at &#x2dc;150 ppm) is added to the grain to reduce contaminants during the softening of the exterior shell of the grain being processed. In the conditioning process, the grain absorbs the water and swells, therefore increasing the size of the grain and raising the moisture content. After the addition of the conditioning water, the grain is moved to conditioning bins, where it is left for &#x2dc;30 minutes in the corn milling process and up to &#x2dc;48 hours in the wheat milling process. Allowing the grain to set in the conditioning bins creates an environment that will allow the grain to enter the milling stage of the process and extraction of the germ.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Within the grain treatment and milling industry, it is widely accepted that there is always a level of surface contamination either on the incoming grain or grain undergoing the milling process. Thus, one of the problems with this approach is from placing damp grain in a dark bin without a very high reduction of contaminants (such as molds, yeast, bacteria, etc.), which can cause an actual increase in overall contaminant load.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thereafter, the softened husks are removed, and the grain is put through a grinder to help separate the germ from the other grain components. The ground grain is carried to degerminators, where the germ is fully separated and kept for later processing. The grain is then put through a dry milling process where a variety of roller mills, sifters, and purifiers are used to produce flour or meal.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">During the tempering process, the conditioning water that is added to the grain provides one of the only opportunities to impact the microbial levels of the final milled grain. It is imperative that during the dry milling process, with the addition of conditioning water, the moisture content (by weight) after mixing does not exceed 20%, and preferably closer to either 12% or 18% depending on the type of grain treated. These moisture parameters are put in place to manage the downstream handling and milling of the grains, as well as to limit the moisture amount in the final product without an additional drying step. Therefore, one major challenge is to treat the grain to the greatest possible extent without exceeding the moisture limitations inherent in the milling process itself.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Using certain chemical treatment options involves the risk of carry-over decontaminants into the final grain product. If residual chemicals, in particular chlorine, peroxyacetic acid, hypochlorous acid and/or sodium hypochlorite (bleach), leave residuals carried over from the treatment step to the final product, issues may arise in the quality of the product. For example, residual chlorine impacts the viability of yeast additives that are required during fermentation of the leavening of bread dough, rendering the product unusable. If the addition of chlorine-based chemicals to the conditioning water are dropped to a level where carry-over would no longer pose a threat, the biocidal capacity of the fluid would drop substantially, therefore not appreciably decontaminating the grain being treated as well as risking microbial tolerance to the treatment solution.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, the agricultural industry has no formal way of addressing the growing issue of pesticide contamination (i.e., glyphosate). Glyphosate is the most common pesticide and is used globally with no easy way to remove or eliminate it from the milling process. If glyphosate is found in high enough concentrations in the incoming grain or in the final product, the grain must be discarded or blended with grain of a lower concentration of the pesticide.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, a need exists for improved techniques and materials for use in the treatment of grains, and particularly for the removal of pathogens and/or pesticides therefrom.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

Electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b> ionize the brine solution or carrier fluid of system <b>100</b> and system <b>200</b>. The generation of an ionized carrier fluid is produced by ionizing the carrier fluid in electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b>. Electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b> typically include an insulated container, vessel, shell, and/or housing <b>1002</b> with a plurality or series of pairs of electrode plates, such as anode electrode <b>1004</b> and cathode electrode <b>1006</b>. In some designs a conducting material may be used for the housing and then doubles as the electrodes. In some embodiments, anode electrode <b>1004</b> and cathode electrode <b>1006</b> are separated by a permeable or semi-permeable membrane <b>1008</b>. An electrical potential or voltage is applied to anode electrode <b>1004</b> and cathode electrode <b>1006</b> via electrical leads <b>1010</b> and <b>1012</b> while a carrier fluid flows through electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b>. Generally, the electrical potential or voltage is applied by a power source <b>1014</b> that is in communication with control units <b>102</b>, <b>202</b> via communication link <b>1016</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, insulated housing <b>1002</b> may have an internal diameter of sufficient size that reduces the turbulence and flow velocity of the mixed gas/liquid phase stream as they flow through electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b>. This provides or allows the buoyant vertical separation of gas and liquid phases with insulated housing <b>1002</b>. In one embodiment, a capacitive proximity sensor <b>1034</b> positioned near the midpoint of the vertical vessel wall detects when the gas volume has grown to reach the sensor's switch point. Once the volume of gas in the vessel has exceeded the threshold level, a controlled valve orifice <b>1036</b> is pulse modulated for predetermined amounts of time, normally on the order of milliseconds. The counting of on/off cycles of the orifice valve <b>1036</b> (i.e., duration of &#x201c;on&#x201d; time) along with pressure measurements within insulated housing <b>1002</b> of electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b> provides for indirect measurement of gas volumes. As the gas compositions may be different between a cathodic chamber or passageway <b>1018</b> and an anodic chamber or passageway <b>1020</b> sides of electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b>, they are each directed to subsequent reaction positions further downstream.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">This system provides for the accurate measurement of gas volumes and maintains consistent component contributions to the staged reactions used in the generation of the electrolytic temper fluid compositions, resulting in more consistent formulary generation through time.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Passageways <b>1018</b> and <b>1020</b> are created on each side of permeable membrane <b>1008</b>. Cathode electrode <b>1006</b> is disposed within passageway <b>1018</b> and anode electrode <b>1004</b> is disposed within passageway <b>1020</b>. The carrier fluid produced by combining water with the feedstock chemicals as further described below produces a feedstock brine solution <b>1022</b> that is supplied to passageway <b>1020</b> that acts as the conducting medium between anode electrode <b>1004</b> and cathode electrode <b>1006</b>. Additionally, a supply of water <b>1024</b> is provided to passageway <b>1018</b>. The charge across anode electrode <b>1004</b> and cathode electrode <b>1006</b> causes anions to be attracted to anode electrode <b>1004</b> and cations to be attracted to the cathode electrode <b>1006</b>. Thus, the ionized carrier fluid is oxidized at the anode electrode <b>1004</b> producing an oxidative acidic fluid <b>1026</b> and the ionized carrier fluid is reduced at the cathode electrode <b>1006</b> producing a reductive alkaline fluid <b>1028</b>. Oxidative acidic fluid <b>1026</b> in passageway <b>1020</b> is oxidized and reductive alkaline fluid <b>1028</b> in passageway <b>1018</b> is reduced. Additionally, anodic gases <b>1030</b> are produced in passageway <b>1020</b> and are also exited out of electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b>. Hydrogen gas <b>1032</b> is also generated in passageway <b>1018</b> and is also exited out of electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b>. A basic ionizer may also be constructed by using simple containers (like tanks) with an electrode in each container and linked with a conduit separated by a membrane. In this &#x201c;batch&#x201d; approach a flowing fluid may not be necessary.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In general, electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b> have inlets (not shown) disposed in their bodies or housings for accepting the inputs or inlets of feedstock brine solution <b>1022</b> and water <b>1024</b>. Further, electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b> have outlets (not shown) disposed in their bodies of housings for accepting the outputs or outlets of oxidative acidic fluid <b>1026</b>, reductive alkaline fluid <b>1028</b>, and anodic gases <b>1030</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Permeable membrane <b>1008</b> may be any type of membrane that facilitates the flow of certain ions through the membrane as is commonly known to those skilled in the arts of electrolytic cells. In one embodiment, permeable membrane <b>1008</b> may be an AGC, Inc. Femion type membranes or a GoreTex&#xae; SGT100120-1 (or similar) membrane material for ion transfer therethrough.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one embodiment, control units <b>102</b>, <b>202</b> of system <b>100</b> and system <b>200</b> operate with a dynamic process instrumentation diagram (&#x201c;PID&#x201d;)-loop control of each component stream flow, dynamic trim adjustments are made to individual stream controls to maintain formula proportions. In addition, coiled or serpentine-routed tubes of a calculated diameter and length, as well as expansion chambers and/or vessels of significantly larger cross-sectional diameter and internal volume, may be used to obtain engineered reaction resonance required for the optimization of the described electrolytic chlorine dioxide biocide composition steps.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The ionization of feedstock brine solution <b>1022</b> that is saline (or other fluid with appropriate TDS) changes the fluid ionic composition on both sides of permeable membrane <b>1008</b>. For example, as feedstock brine solution <b>1022</b> passes through electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b>, it undergoes a partial disassociation of both the water (HOH) component and salt (NaCl) component, for example, of the carrier fluid, with ions migrating through permeable membrane <b>1008</b> to the opposite charged side where re-association will occur. For example, in passageway <b>1018</b> of permeable membrane <b>1008</b>, sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) and hydroxyl ions (OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) will re-associate to form sodium hydroxide, NaOH, commonly known as the &#x201c;alkaline&#x201d; side to produce reductive alkaline fluid <b>1028</b>. On the opposite charged side, passageway <b>1020</b>, hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) will re-associate with chlorine (Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) and form hydrochloric acid, HCl or more typically hypochlorous acid, HOCl, and is often known as the &#x201c;acidic&#x201d; or astringent side to produce oxidative acidic fluid <b>1026</b>. Other compounds or combinations of compounds are used to attain the same goals using this approach.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Both ionized materials will also have a significant &#x201c;shift&#x201d; in their respective redox potential from the initial state of the carrier fluid as the carrier fluid is adjusted to a different ionic state. The alkaline side will have a dramatic increase in excess electrons and become a powerful reducing agent. The opposite is true for the acidic side, which is deficient in electrons and is thus a powerful oxidizer. These shifts in redox potential can be well in excess of +/&#x2212;1150 mV as measured by ORP. This limit can be as high as where the carrier fluid completely disassociates and will not carry any additional charge, or is no longer useful to the process. Alternatively, any measurable change in redox may be sufficient to produce desirable results. This measurement can be made by a simple pH/ORP meter or sensor or more sophisticated data logging can be achieved by using a continuous flow through design, such as with inline pH/ORP/conductivity analyzers.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Some of the variables that control the magnitude of the electrolytic process are the flow rate of the carrier fluid through insulated housing <b>1002</b>, the charge potential between anode electrode <b>1004</b> and cathode electrode <b>1006</b>, the carrier fluid residence time, and the voltage and amperage used to ionize the carrier fluid. According to process designs, variables such as voltage and amperage applied to anode electrode <b>1004</b> and cathode electrode <b>1006</b>, flow rate through passageway <b>1018</b> and passageway <b>1020</b>, and/or brine concentration of feedstock brine solution <b>1022</b> may be optimized to produce specific formulary requirements.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Also, permeable membrane <b>1008</b> could potentially be moveable between each pair or plurality of anode electrode <b>1004</b> and cathode electrode <b>1006</b>. Permeable membrane <b>1008</b> may be located closer to one electrode than the other electrode to create a larger volume of one species of precursor fluids or solutions. In one aspect, permeable membrane <b>1008</b> could be located closer to the anode electrode <b>1004</b>, thereby creating a greater volume of electrolytic precursor alkaline fluids to be produced. In another aspect, permeable membrane <b>1008</b> can be moved closer to one electrode to produce one species of ionized precursor fluid, such as electrolytic acidic fluids, and then later moved closer to the other electrode to produce another species of ionized precursor fluid.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one embodiment, feedstock brine solution <b>1022</b> may be passed through electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b>, which are split electrolytic cells that are operated at a substantially low pressure, such as from about 5 to about 90 pounds per square inch (&#x201c;psi&#x201d;). In another aspect, the operating pressure within electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b>, may be from about 12 to about 65 psi.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">System <b>100</b> and system <b>200</b> may also include other configurations of an ionization apparatus that could include systems using simple electrolysis with or without a membrane (e.g., ported systems or other configuration), variations in plate materials/configurations or any other embodiment that is able to produce an ionized fluid adequate to generate beneficial results during the decontamination process.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b> may be powered by direct current (&#x201c;DC&#x201d;) power supply produced by converting alternating current (&#x201c;AC&#x201d;) power supply to DC with transformers, rectifiers, capacitors, regulators, etc. for example. For example, a 120 voltage alternating current (&#x201c;VAC&#x201d;) supply may be connected with a transformer that converts the power supply to voltage direct current (&#x201c;VDC&#x201d;), which may be adjusted or modulated to provide the desired voltage output at power source <b>1014</b> for providing the desired voltage and current through electrical leads <b>1010</b> and <b>1012</b>. In another aspect, electrolytic cell units <b>132</b>, <b>208</b> may be powered by a portable or non-portable DC power supply. For example, portable system <b>200</b> may include a battery and/or battery pack that is or provides power source <b>1014</b> with the desired voltage and current to electrical leads <b>1010</b> and <b>1012</b>.

Initially, a brine solution <b>406</b> is produced by mixing feedstock chemicals from a chemical source <b>404</b> with water provided from a water source <b>402</b>. This step may include loading an amount of water into water source <b>402</b> or connecting water source <b>402</b> to a source of water, such as a public utility, lake, vessel, and the like. Water source <b>402</b> may also be purified water. Additionally, this step may include loading the desired chemical into chemical source <b>404</b>. In some embodiments, the chemical in chemical source <b>404</b> is a salt, such as NaCl, KCl, etc. The two sources <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> are mixed together to produce a basic brine solution <b>406</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, basic brine solution <b>406</b> is fed into one or more electrolytic cell units <b>408</b>, which are used to generate oxidative acidic fluid <b>414</b>, reductive alkaline fluid <b>422</b>, and oxidative and anodic gases <b>416</b> as described in greater detail above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this step, electrolytic cell units <b>408</b> may be optimally slow-started via low pulse-width modulation (&#x201c;PWM&#x201d;) duty cycle and ramped up to allow electrical flow-inhibiting gas bubbles evolved from the electrolyte at the surfaces of anode electrode and cathode electrode to form and reach their steady-state level. This prevents startup conditions in which the power requirements are momentarily significantly higher than during all other operating conditions. Net potential/voltage at anode electrode and cathode electrode may be maintained as a constant through dynamic control of PWM duty cycle. A solid-state H-Bridge can be utilized to modulate power and polarity for periodic de-scaling and cleaning of electrolytic cell units <b>408</b> components.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, the generated oxidative acidic fluid <b>414</b>, reductive alkaline fluid <b>422</b>, and anodic gases <b>416</b> are recovered from electrolytic cell units <b>408</b>. The generated oxidative acidic fluid <b>416</b> may have a pH between about 1.5 and 4.5 and an oxidative (electron deficient or +mV) potential.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, the reductive alkaline fluid <b>422</b> may be used as a pre-rinse <b>424</b> on the grain material to be treated using the temper fluid prepared in accordance with the methods described herein. The reductive alkaline fluid <b>422</b> generally comprises common hydroxides (e.g., NaOH, KOH). By subjecting the grain material to a pre-rinse <b>424</b> using the reductive alkaline fluid <b>422</b>, surficial contamination present on the grain may be removed therefrom. Surficial contamination that may be removed from this pre-rinse step includes, but is not limited to, dust, fungal spores, bacteria and glyphosate. Remaining fungal spores, bacteria and glyphosate are also impacted from the sudden alkaline pH shift that occurs upon carrying out the pre-rinse step. For example, most grain material is slightly acidic (e.g., 4.5 to 5+pH) and the pH shift to &#x2dc;11+ alone helps to degrade/kill microbes and glyphosate that are tolerant of the slightly acidic pH. The addition of food-safe surfactants as described above can enhance the alkaline pre-rinse effectiveness.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Any manner of washing the grain with the reductive alkaline fluid <b>422</b> as part of pre-rinse <b>424</b> may be used, including continuous or batch processes. When combining the reductive alkaline fluid <b>422</b> with the grain material, agitation may optionally be used to promote removal of surficial contamination from the grain material. This pre-rinse step can be carried out at any time prior to washing the grain material with the chlorine dioxide product produced by the method described herein and discussed in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The pre-rinse step may also be optionally combined with or preceded by mechanical washing of the grain material. Mechanical cleaning applications can remove unwanted organic compounds that may have bacteria counts attached, such as dust, coarse impurities, stones, fine particles, husk and light particles. Exemplary, though non-limiting, mechanical cleaning applications include: abrasion equipment; scourers; aspirators; peeling; pearling; separators; destoning; enoleters; indented cylinders and sieves. Mechanical cleaning applications can also be performed after the pre-rinse <b>424</b> but prior to combining the temper fluid with the grain material.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Regardless of whether/when a pre-rinse <b>424</b> is carried out, the process of preparing the temper fluid may proceed by combining a sodium hypochlorite solution <b>412</b> with a chlorite salt solution <b>410</b> to provide a first composition <b>413</b> including the hypochlorite solution and the chlorite salt.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The source of the hypochlorite solution <b>412</b> is generally not limited. Similarly, the source of the chlorite salt solution <b>410</b> is generally not limited. In some embodiments, neither the hypochlorite solution <b>412</b> nor the chlorite salt solution <b>410</b> is produced by the method described herein. That is to say, neither chlorite salt nor hypochlorite is produced as a product or byproduct of any of the steps described herein. Instead, the hypochlorite and the chlorite salt may be provided from a separate source distinct from the method described herein, such as a source of stock hypochlorite solution and chlorite salt.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments, the hypochlorite solution and the chlorite salt solution are combined at a ratio such that a subsequently produced final temper fluid (described in greater detail below) will have a chlorine dioxide concentration of 500-1000 ppm and an ORP of between +500 my to +1100 mv, such as between +800 my and +1100 mv. The ratio selected should also minimize any undesirable residuals from the reaction to &#x3c;2 ppm.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The first composition <b>413</b> is then combined with the oxidative acidic solution <b>414</b> to form a second composition <b>415</b>. Oxidative acidic fluid <b>414</b> may include, e.g., hydrochloric/hypochlorous acids (HCl, HOCl). The oxidative acidic fluid <b>414</b> and first composition <b>413</b> can be combined using any suitable methods, such as mixing the two components in a reaction vessel or via a flow through continuous mixing approach. This step results in releasing chlorine dioxide to thereby provide a first composition <b>415</b> including chlorine dioxide. This step can also result in bringing the pH of the composition <b>415</b> from about 8 to in the range of 2 to 5.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The released chlorine dioxide solution <b>415</b> is then combined with anodic gases <b>416</b> to enhance create a preliminary temper fluid <b>417</b> having the ORP value to well in excess of +800 mV. The reaction of the combined anodic gases with the second composition <b>415</b> helps ensure a more complete reaction and would minimize any undesirable residuals to &#x3c;2 ppm.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the anodic gases <b>416</b> (e.g., chlorine, oxygen, ozone, etc.) are produced by the electrolytic cell units <b>408</b> and are used to enhance the second composition <b>415</b>. More specifically, combining the anodic gas <b>416</b> with second composition <b>415</b> results in shifting the ORP of the resultant solution <b>417</b> to within a range of from about +500 my to about +1100 mv.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Any manner of combining the second composition <b>415</b> and the anodic gas <b>416</b> may be used. In some embodiments, the anodic gases <b>416</b> are bubbled through the second composition <b>415</b> in order to combine the two materials.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some embodiments, the chlorine species of the anodic gas <b>410</b> are captured by the excess of hydroxide (e.g., up to 10%) in the second composition <b>415</b>, making the resultant composition <b>417</b> more potent. This step also eliminates any discharge of chlorine species later in the process, and thus eliminates a potential regulatory issue. The combination of the anodic gas <b>416</b> and the second composition <b>415</b> also shifts the pH more acidic, allowing the electrolytic cell units <b>408</b> to operate at a lower power setting, thus improving efficiency and longevity. The ozone component of anodic gas <b>416</b> is mostly captured and, along with the oxygen component of the anodic gas <b>416</b>, transfers the oxidation enhancement and minimizes undesired residuals shift to the preliminary temper fluid <b>417</b>. This again improves efficiency via conservation of energy.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">After production of the preliminary temper fluid <b>417</b>, various additives <b>418</b> may be mixed into the highly oxidative chlorine dioxide product, such as in a mixing vessel <b>419</b>. These additives must be tolerant of the oxidative environment without degradation of the formulation. These additives may include: carboxylic acids and other acids; buffers; surfactants including food grade surfactants (wetting agents, micelle generators, detergents); among other additives.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">When buffering agents are used, the buffering agent can bring the chlorine dioxide composition to near neutral (such as to a pH of from about 5 to about 8). A wide range of buffers may be used at this step, such as potassium/sodium carbonate or similar compounds. Once buffered, pH sensitive surfactants may be added to the chlorine dioxide composition. These include oxidative solution-tolerant surfactants that do not destroy the solution's ORP or cause any other adverse reactions. Surfactant additives may include typically include FDA and/or EPA-approved ethylene oxide-based surfactants, such as (but not limited to) DOW's L-61 or BASF's Pluronic or various alcohol ethoxylates, alkyl sulfates, among numerous others. In some embodiments, surfactants are used in the 0.05 to 2.0% range. The alcohol ethoxylates (such as Stepan's Bio-Soft series) can be used to enhance wetting properties, while alkyl sulfates such as the Stepanol ME-Dry series can be included if micelle generation or enhanced cleaning properties are desired. If corrosion is a major concern, Croda's LS-30 surfactant can be added to the formulation to act as a corrosion inhibitor (with or without other surfactant combinations). This description is provided as an example only, and other DFE and traditional surfactants may be used to create a chlorine dioxide composition with desired properties.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, a common surfactant load combination is 0.2% of Stepan's Bio-Soft series to enhance wetting combined with 0.2% alkyl sulfates such as Stepanol ME-Dry for micelle generation.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Other additives that may be considered for addition to the chlorine dioxide solution include dispersants, agglomerants, flocculants, chelants and nano-particles.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some preferred embodiments, at least one carboxylic acid is added to the chlorine dioxide solution. Exemplary though non-limiting carboxylic acids include: acetic acid, formic acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, butyric acid, gluconic acid, itaconic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, and levulinic acid. Carboxylic acid can be added to the chlorine dioxide solution in a range of from about 0.05 to about 2%. Addition of a carboxylic acid enhances the overall fluid characteristics by means of lengthening the activation time of the fluid to eight hours. Regrowth of certain microorganisms have been noted inside the temper bin, therefore lengthening the activation time of the fluid may be beneficial in such scenarios.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Following addition of additives <b>418</b>, a stable, highly oxidative chlorine dioxide product <b>420</b> is formed. This chlorine dioxide product <b>420</b> serves as the final temper fluid. The temper fluid <b>420</b> may be stored or containerized as desired. Alternatively, temper fluid <b>420</b> may be directly applied to wheat material and other foodstuffs as described herein.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">While not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a variation on method <b>400</b> may include adding the anodic gas to the hypochlorite solution first, then adding the chlorite salt, then adding the oxidative acidic fluid, and finally optionally adding additives in order to prepare the temper fluid.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">When applying the temper fluid <b>420</b> described herein and produced via method <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the temper fluid is generally added to the grain material, followed by a rest period in tempering bins until the added temper fluid penetrates the kernel and reaches the optimum moisture distribution which helps to prepare the wheat or grains for optimal processing or milling.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Any device or equipment suitable for adding moisture to grains as a conditioning or treatment process to maintain moisture standardization can be used for applying the temper fluid to the grain material. Exemplary processes include but are not limited to equipment application methods of: vibratory mixers; auger screw with moisture and/or steam: washing equipment with moisture and/or steam; atomizing equipment; coating applicators; mixing conveyors; vibratory conveyors; rotary dampeners, and technovators.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In some embodiments, the addition of the electrolytic temper fluid to grain and other foodstuffs is also used to significantly lower the amount of adhered glyphosate and neonicotinoid or neonic containing pesticides, including but not limited to: amiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some embodiments, the ratio of electrolytic temper fluid to grain is 1-part electrolytic temper fluid to 70 parts grain; 1-part electrolytic temper fluid to 65 parts grain; 1-part electrolytic temper fluid to 50 parts grain; 1-part electrolytic temper fluid to 45 parts grain; 1-part electrolytic temper fluid to 40 parts grain; 1-part electrolytic temper fluid to 35 parts grain; 1-part electrolytic temper fluid to 30 parts grain; 1-part electrolytic temper fluid to 25 parts grain; 1-part electrolytic temper fluid to 20 parts grain; 1-part electrolytic temper fluid to 15 parts grain; 1 part electrolytic temper fluid to 10 parts grain; 1 part electrolytic temper fluid to 5 parts grain; 1 part electrolytic temper fluid to 1 part grain. Higher or lower ratios of electrolytic temper fluid may be used but may interfere with moisture requirements of the milling process.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">While described herein primarily in the context of treating grain material, it should be appreciated that the methods described herein can also be applied to other foodstuffs. For example, processes described herein apply to the tempering or treating of all cereal grains including but not limited to; amaranth, barley, buckwheat, bulgur, corn, einkorn, farro, freekeh, Khorasan, millet, oats, quinoa, brown rice, rye, Sorghum, spelt, teff, wheat, and wild rice. The temper fluid described herein may also be applied to treat seeds, leafy greens, various vegetables (e.g., onions, carrots, peas, etc.) fruits or most any applicable raw agricultural products.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Various embodiments of the methods described herein may result in a multi-log reduction of bacteria such as <i>Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria</i>, and others, as well as various molds and yeasts. Additionally, a significant reduction of pesticide residue can simultaneously be achieved by reducing glyphosate and various other residues, including neonicotinoid pesticides. Additionally, embodiments of the processes described herein do not create any halogenated organic byproducts that are commonly created with chlorine, hypochlorous acid or various hypochlorite formulas. Embodiments of the methods described herein also minimize undesirable residuals from the reaction.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In these embodiments, the electrolytic temper fluid may have a 99.9-99.999 percent reduction in certain pathogens which includes a reduction of bacteria such as <i>Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria</i>, and others as well as various molds and yeasts (fungal)
