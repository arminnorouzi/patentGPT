end="lead"?><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The figures are not necessarily to scale. Wherever appropriate, similar or identical reference numerals are used to refer to similar or identical components.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Conventional digital radiography (DR) and/or computed tomography (CT) scanner positioning systems involve a user interface that provides controls for individual modes of component positioning. For instance, a conventional scanner positioning system may include a number and a range representative of the height of the X-ray emitter, a number and a range representative of the height of the manipulator, and/or a number and a range representative of the height of the X-ray receiver. However, the person operating the controls may not have a clear idea of the final position resulting from a change to the number on the interface. Accordingly, conventional scanner positioning systems may involve significant trial-and-error on the part of the operator to determine the desired positioning to achieve the desired scan. Development of the scan positioning and parameters is conventionally performed using a physical scanning system, which can impose substantial costs on the owner or operator of the system due to the loss in time available to actually perform scans. As a result, throughput of conventional scanning systems is reduced while the appropriate scanning procedure is determined by personnel, which can lead to increases costs and/or loss of revenue due to increased scanning cycle time.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Disclosed systems and methods enable scanning procedures to be generated in a virtual environment, which can be separate and/or remote from the scanning system or scanner positioning system (e.g., at any other location). For example, a design, test, or manufacturing engineer, or any other personnel, may use the virtual environment to position and/or orient the workpiece (e.g., object to be scanned) while obtaining interactive (e.g., real-time or substantially real-time) feedback to assist the user. The virtual environment and interactive feedback of disclosed examples enables the user to simulate and/or optimize factors that affect scanning technique development. The user may also specify radiation source and/or radiation detector parameters, and simulate the resulting scan via the virtual environment based on the component arrangements, the CAD model of the workpiece, and the source and detector parameters, to determine whether the designed scanning procedure will obtain the desired scan images.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In disclosed examples, generated scanning procedures include the necessary information and parameters to permit a scanner positioning control system to automatically perform the scanning procedure. For example, the generated scanning procedure may include commands to position, orient, and/or move a radiation source or emitter, a radiation detector, a workpiece positioner or manipulator, the workpiece or object to be scanned, and/or any other relevant components. The generated scanning procedure may further include operational parameters for the radiation source and/or the radiation detector. Other commands, parameters, data and/or information will be provided in examples disclosed below.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Disclosed systems and methods advantageously allow the user to design scanning techniques or procedures from any convenient location. In some examples, the user may use the disclosed systems and methods to design scanning procedures in a virtual environment and verify that the procedure will conform to the requirements of an industry standard (e.g., ASTM Standard E1695, ASTM Standard E2737, etc.) or required by a customer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Disclosed examples are described with reference to X-rays. However, this disclosure is not limited to X-rays, and the examples disclosed herein may be modified to use any desired wavelengths or energies, or any combinations of wavelengths or energies, in the electromagnetic spectrum, such as gamma rays, monochromatic and/or polychromatic X-rays, white light, and/or neutron radiation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, the term &#x201c;arrangement&#x201d; refers to both location and orientation of one or more components.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The terms &#x201c;source&#x201d; and &#x201c;emitter,&#x201d; as used with reference to the source of radiation, are used interchangeably herein. In other words, as used herein, an &#x201c;X-ray source&#x201d; is the same as an &#x201c;X-ray emitter.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Disclosed example scan procedure generation systems include: a display, a processor, and a computer readable storage medium comprising computer readable instructions which, when executed, cause the processor to: output, via the display, a first visual representation of an arrangement of a radiation source, a radiation detector, a workpiece positioner, and a workpiece; and based on positions and orientations of the radiation source, the radiation detector, the workpiece positioner, and the workpiece, generate a scanning procedure for execution by a physical scanner having a physical radiation source, a physical radiation detector, and a physical workpiece positioner, in which the generated scanning procedure comprises a plurality of movements of one or more of the physical radiation source, the physical radiation detector, and the physical workpiece positioner and a plurality of image captures to capture a plurality of scan images of a physical workpiece corresponding to the workpiece in the first virtual representation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some example scan procedure generation systems, the computer readable instructions cause the processor to: identify a change to be made to the arrangement of at least one of the radiation source, the radiation detector, the workpiece positioner, or the workpiece; and output, via the display, a second visual representation of the arrangement of the radiation source, the radiation detector, the workpiece positioner, and the workpiece based on the change to be made to the arrangement.
