id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to an implant conveying system, and in particular, to an implant conveying device and an inner tube assembly thereof, and a catheter.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">During loading and release, an implant, such as a self-expanding stent, is required to have a specific structure to be fixed to a corresponding structure of a conveyor by means of shape fit or cable pull, either at one end or at both ends, so as to realize stable press grip and release of the implant by the conveyor. This specific structure on the implant is called a lug, and the corresponding structure on the conveying system is called a fixing head. The lug may appear at any joint on the stent. In the case of a single-layer stent, the lug is generally arranged at one end of the sent. In the case of a double-layer stent, the lug is generally arranged at one end of the inner or outer stent. However, after the double-layer stent is pressed and gripped, the lug is not necessarily at the top. Lugs may be arranged on all joints in a circumferential direction at an end of the stent or only on some joints. Stent rods where the remaining joints without lugs are located are called non-lug rods. Depending on whether there are lugs at the joints, the stent rods with lugs may be called anchoring rods, and the stent rods without lugs may be called non-anchoring rods. In the case of the double-layer stent, the anchoring rods and the non-anchoring rods may be in different stent layers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional conveying system has the following problems. When a valve stent is a circumferentially symmetric stent, a number of joints for shape fit or cable pull on the fixing head may be less than a number of joints corresponding to the anchoring rod on the stent in most cases. Then, in the loading process, the lug is tightly integrated in a recess, and the anchoring rod is pressed and gripped by a sheathing canal/loading tool and is supported by the fixing head, while the non-anchoring rod is only pressed and gripped. Moreover, due to the existence of an axial height difference, that is, a height of the lug or a height difference formed by notches arranged on an end portion of a stent main body, the anchoring rod and the non-anchoring rod are often subjected to different forces. As a result, during the loading and release, the non-anchoring rod easily causes inward adduction, and the stent directly applies force to a valve leaflet, which easily damages the valve leaflet and affects a function of a prosthesis. Besides, uneven force of the implant causes inclination of and damage to the implant or even loading failure or unavailability of the implant. When the valve stent is designed as a stent not circumferentially symmetric, the above phenomenon is more serious. For example, in the stent, some regions are less rigid than others, or notches are asymmetrically arranged. As a result, the valve stent is subjected to uneven force and is more prone to inclination, distortion and damage during the loading and release, thereby leading to loading failure or unavailability of the implant.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A common fixing head is generally a truncated cone or wedge with a recess. The lug on the implant and the recess match in shape and are connected by shape fit. In clinical applications, an existing implant loading process involves fixing a lug into a recess of a fixing head after an implant is partially pressed and gripped, and then driving a catheter forward to gradually wrap the implant completely. In the whole loading process, especially for the circumferential asymmetrical stent, the implant is prone to inclination and damage due to poor force uniformity. Large supporting force, a short axial height and non-circumferential symmetry of the self-expanding stent may aggravate the problem of poor force uniformity of the stent. At the same time, in the releasing process, the implant may be distorted, indented, damaged or even not used normally. In addition, when a certain end face of the valve leaflet of the self-expanding stent is as high as or close to the end face of the stent, the stent may squeeze the valve leaflet during the loading and release, resulting in damage to the valve leaflet and affecting its use. In the prior art, a conveyer catheter, an implant or a loading tool is generally improved, which has a complex scheme, a long cycle and high costs, but ignores the function of the fixing head.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need to develop a new implant conveying device and an inner tube assembly thereof, which can solve the above problems.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The technical problem to be solved in the present disclosure is to provide an implant conveying device and an inner tube assembly thereof, and a catheter, which can provide supporting force for the implant and avoid the collapse of the implant in a conveying process.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A technical solution adopted by the present disclosure to solve the above technical problem is to provide an inner tube assembly of an implant conveying device, wherein the inner tube assembly includes an implant protection part, an inner tube and a fixing head connected to the inner tube, the implant protection part is connected to the inner tube or/and the fixing head, and the implant protection part is configured to be in contact with an implant to support the implant.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the implant protection part includes at least one protector, and the protector is in the shape of a circular ring sheet or a circular arc sheet.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the implant protection part is connected to the inner tube, the implant protection part includes a connector and a protector, the connector is connected to the inner tube, and the protector is connected to the connector.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the fixing head has a recess, and the recess is arranged opposite to the protector in an axial direction.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the implant protection part includes a first protector and a second protector connected to each other, and one of the first protector and the second protector is connected to the fixing head.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the inner tube assembly includes a first implant protection part and a second implant protection part, the first implant protection part is connected to the fixing head, and the first implant protection part has a first protector; the second implant protection part is connected to the inner tube, the second implant protection part includes a connector and a second protector, the connector is connected to the inner tube, and the second protector is connected to the connector; and the first protector is arranged opposite to the second protector in an axial direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the connector is a cylinder with an opening in the middle, and the connector is circumferentially connected to the inner tube at the opening.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the first protector is in the shape of a circular ring sheet, and the second protector is in the shape of a circular arc sheet.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, a gap is formed between the implant protection part and the inner tube.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another technical solution adopted by the present disclosure to solve the above technical problem is to provide a catheter of an implant conveying device, including an outer tube and the inner tube assembly described above, the inner tube assembly passing through the outer tube.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Yet another technical solution adopted by the present disclosure to solve the above technical problem is to provide an implant conveying device, including a handle, an outer tube and the inner tube assembly described above, the inner tube assembly passing through the outer tube, and the handle being configured to drive the outer tube to axially move relative to the inner tube assembly.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Beneficial Effects</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Compared with the prior art, the present disclosure has the following beneficial effects. In the implant conveying device and the inner tube assembly thereof, and the catheter according to the present disclosure, by arranging the implant protection part on the fixing head or the inner tube, regions with weak circumferential supporting force of a valve stent, such as the non-anchoring rod or notches, can be supported, and inclination of and damage to the valve stent in the loading process and distortion and indentation in the releasing process are avoided. In particular, a hollowed-out internal space is formed radially between the implant protection part and the inner tube, and the hollowed-out internal space may be used for accommodating the valve leaflet. Therefore, the implant protection part separates the valve stent from the valve leaflet, which effectively protects the valve leaflet, avoids the squeezing of the valve leaflet, effectively solves the problem of the stent squeezing the valve leaflet during the loading and release, and ensures the fatigue performance of the valve leaflet. When the protector that constitutes the implant protection part is made of a soft material, the soft material can further reduce the damage to the stent or valve while providing certain supporting force. With the development of a stent research technology, more and more stents with notches or other types of irregularities may be designed according to an original physiological structure of hearts, and the implant protection part may be used more extensively.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic structural diagram of an implant conveying device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>is a schematic structural diagram of an inner tube assembly of the implant conveying device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;

In the embodiment of the present disclosure, the protector <b>11</b> is in the shape of a circular ring sheet or a circular arc sheet. The protector <b>11</b> being in the shape of a circular ring sheet means that a projection of the protector <b>11</b> in a circumferential direction is in the shape of a circular ring sheet, for example, a second protector <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The protector <b>11</b> being in the shape of a circular arc sheet means that the projection of the protector <b>11</b> in the circumferential direction is in the shape of a circular ring arc, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The protector <b>11</b> may be in various forms. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>d </i></figref>show plane shapes of the protector expanded along the circumferential direction.

Its axial length and radial width are determined according to a position and a structure of the non-anchoring rod of the valve stent to be supported, provided that the protector <b>11</b> is in contact with the non-anchoring rod at the top of the frame of the valve stent to provide supporting force and prevent the collapse of the stent. The structure is especially suitable for the loading and release of, for example, notched valve stents with incomplete symmetry at the top of the stent frame.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The arrangement of the implant protection part <b>1</b> is described as a two-dimensional plane in which the protector <b>11</b> that constitutes the implant protection unit <b>1</b> falls on a basic unit. The basic unit is a sectional view obtained by bisecting the cross section of the catheter, which includes preferably 1-8 basic units; and more preferably 2-6 basic units, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref><i>e. </i></p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The protectors <b>11</b> may be arranged in one basic unit, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>; or arranged in a plurality of basic units, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c</i></figref>. The protectors <b>11</b> in different basic units may be the same or different in shape. When arranged in different basic units, the protectors <b>11</b> may be arranged symmetrically or asymmetrically. For example, two protectors <b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>and three protectors <b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>are arranged symmetrically. Asymmetric arrangement is mainly specific to asymmetric ends of a main body of the valve stent.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">One basis unit may also be provided with two or more protectors <b>11</b> at the same time, which, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, includes two protectors <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>. Certainly, the protectors <b>11</b> arranged in different basic units may be the same or different in shape.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in one implementation, the implant protection part <b>1</b> is connected to the inner tube <b>3</b>, and the implant protection part <b>1</b> includes a connector <b>12</b> and a protector <b>11</b>. In one preferred embodiment, the connector <b>12</b> is a cylinder with an opening in the middle, and the connector <b>12</b> is circumferentially connected to the inner tube <b>3</b> at the opening and is arranged coaxially with the inner tube <b>3</b>. The protector <b>11</b> is connected to the connector <b>12</b>. The shape of the connector <b>12</b> is not specially limited in the present disclosure, provided that the protector <b>11</b> can be connected to a position requiring fixed support on the stent and the size does not affect the loading and release of the stent. Preferably, a recess <b>21</b> on the fixing head <b>2</b> is arranged opposite to the protector <b>11</b> in an axial direction. That is, an opening direction of the recess <b>21</b> is opposite to an axial setting direction of the protector <b>11</b> on the connector <b>12</b>. The setting may be applied to stents where the lug and the notch exist at different ends, so that the lug at one end of the stent matches the recess <b>21</b> and the notch at the other end of the stent matches and contacts the protector <b>11</b>. When the lug and the notch exist at different ends of the stent, it is more likely to cause distortion or indentation of the stent. Therefore, the implant protection part <b>1</b> is arranged on the inner tube <b>3</b>, so as to effectively avoid distortion or indentation of the stent by providing supporting force at the notch. When connected to the inner tube <b>3</b>, one or more, preferably 1 or 2, implant protection parts <b>1</b> may be provided. The manner in which the implant protection part is arranged on the inner tube <b>3</b> is determined according to a to-be-covered position with weak circumferential supporting force of a stent, for example, a position of a non-anchoring rod, when the stent is pressed and gripped. That is, with respect to the fixing head <b>2</b>, the protectors <b>11</b> may be arranged on two sides of the fixing head <b>2</b>. In this case, at least two protectors <b>11</b> are required. The at least two protectors <b>11</b> may also be arranged on one side of the fixing head <b>2</b>, to cover the position where the circumferential supporting force of the stent is weak. Taking a stent with a notch as an example, the protector <b>11</b> covers a non-anchoring rod where the notch is located.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another implementation, the implant protection part <b>1</b> is directly connected to the fixing head <b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.

The implant protection part <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>includes a plurality of protectors <b>11</b> in the shape of a circular arc sheet. The implant protection part <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> includes a first protector <b>111</b> and a second protector <b>112</b> connected to each other. Preferably, one or more first protectors <b>111</b> are provided and in the shape of a circular arc sheet. One second protector <b>112</b> is provided and in the shape of a circular ring shape. The second protector <b>112</b> is connected to the fixing head <b>2</b>. The first protector <b>111</b> is connected to the second protector <b>112</b>. The structure may be applied to loading and release of valve stents with the lug and the notch at a same end, which can provide supporting force for the notch and the non-anchoring rod at the same time and is more conducive to the uniform force of the stents.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In yet another implementation, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the inner tube assembly includes a first implant protection part <b>1</b><i>a </i>and a second implant protection part <b>1</b><i>b</i>. Preferably, the second implant protection part <b>1</b><i>b </i>has a second protector <b>112</b>. The second protector <b>112</b> is in the shape of a circular ring sheet, and the second protector <b>112</b> is connected to the fixing head <b>2</b>. The first implant protection part <b>1</b><i>a </i>includes a connector <b>12</b> and at least one first protector <b>111</b>. The connector <b>12</b> is connected to the inner tube <b>3</b>. The connector <b>12</b> is preferably a cylinder with an opening in the middle, and the connector <b>12</b> is circumferentially connected to the inner tube <b>3</b> at the opening and is arranged coaxially with the inner tube <b>3</b>. The first implant protection part <b>1</b><i>a </i>is connected to the connector <b>12</b>. The first protector <b>111</b> is in the shape of a circular arc sheet, and the first protector <b>111</b> is arranged opposite to the second protector <b>112</b> in an axial direction. That is, an axial setting direction of the first protector <b>111</b> on the connector <b>12</b> is opposite to that of the second protector <b>112</b> on the fixing head <b>2</b>. The inner tube assembly of the structure may provide supporting force for the non-anchoring rods at two ends of the stent at the same time, which is more conducive to the uniform force of the stent.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the present disclosure, the implant protection part <b>1</b> is in contact with one end of a stent frame, so that part of the implant protection part <b>1</b> overlaps with the valve stent in the axial direction to support the valve stent. An axial length of a contact surface on which the implant protection part <b>1</b> overlaps with the stent is determined according to the position of the non-anchoring rod of the stent, to cover a length of the non-anchoring rod preferably less than 5 mm, more preferably 1-2 mm.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A material of the implant protection part <b>1</b> is not limited, which may be a hard metal material or a soft material. The soft material can further reduce the damage to the valve stent or valve while providing certain supporting force for the stent.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferably, the protector <b>11</b> is in the shape of a sheet and forms a hollowed-out internal space radially with the inner tube. That is, a gap is formed between the protector and the inner tube. The hollowed-out internal space may be used for accommodating a valve leaflet. The implant protection part <b>1</b> separates the valve stent from the valve leaflet, which may protect the valve leaflet, prevent squeezing of and damage to the valve leaflet, and ensure the fatigue performance of the valve leaflet. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the valve stent <b>5</b> includes a non-anchoring rod <b>51</b> and an anchoring rod <b>52</b>. In the loading process, the stent <b>5</b>, which is subjected to press grip force, may squeeze the internal valve leaflet, and the implant protection part <b>1</b> prevents inward movement of the non-anchoring rod <b>51</b>. In the releasing process, in the prior art, the non-anchoring rod <b>51</b> still in the sheathing canal <b>6</b> may be deformed due to outward supporting force of a stent rod outside the sheathing canal <b>6</b>, and then close up toward the interior of the stent to squeeze the valve leaflet, while the implant protection part <b>1</b> provides supporting force for the non-anchoring rod <b>51</b> in the sheathing canal <b>6</b>, thereby avoiding the squeezing of the valve leaflet. When the stent is provided with a free skirt toward an axis direction of the stent, the gap formed between the implant protection part <b>1</b> and the inner tube may also be used for placing the free skirt, which avoids the squeezing of the free skirt. When the stent is a double-layer stent, the gap may also be used for placing the inner stent of the double-layer stent, thereby avoiding the squeezing of the inner stent. When the stent is loaded or released and a gap is formed between the protector and the inner tube, the protector also plays a certain cushioning role, which is more conducive to the gentle grip or release of the stent.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a mitral valve replacement stent. A main structure of the stent includes a lug <b>8</b>, an inflow tract <b>901</b>, a transition section <b>902</b>, an outflow tract <b>903</b> and a notch <b>7</b>. The notch <b>7</b> and the lug <b>8</b> are arranged at two ends of the stent respectively. The stent has a short axial height and a notch. The stent has poor force uniformity in the loading process, and the stent is prone to inclination, distortion, collapse or even damage. When an implant protection part <b>1</b> is arranged at a position corresponding to the notch <b>7</b> on the inner tube assembly of the conveying system, in the loading process, a grid at the notch <b>7</b> is in contact with the implant protection part <b>1</b>, which can ensure the balanced force of the outflow tract <b>903</b> of the stent and avoid the occurrence of inclination, distortion and collapse of the stent.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>b </i></figref>shows another stent with a notch <b>7</b> in the middle of a main structure of the stent. An implant protection part <b>1</b> may be arranged at a position corresponding to the notch <b>7</b> on the inner tube assembly of the conveying system. The implant protection part <b>1</b> is in contact with at least part of a grid around the notch to provide supporting force, so as to ensure the balanced force of the stent and avoid the occurrence of inclination, distortion and collapse of the stent.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a top view of another stent. An inflow tract <b>901</b> of the stent has a special-shaped region <b>9011</b> arranged asymmetrically. When an implant protection part <b>1</b> is arranged at a position corresponding to the special-shaped region <b>9011</b> on the inner tube assembly of the conveying system, the implant protection part <b>1</b> is in contact with the special-shaped region <b>9011</b> of the stent, which can ensure the balanced force of the inflow tract <b>901</b> of the stent and avoid the occurrence of inclination, distortion and collapse of the stent.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Therefore, in the implant conveying device according to this embodiment, the implant protection part <b>1</b> is arranged in the inner tube assembly thereof, and the protector <b>11</b> therein solves the problem of poor force uniformity caused by the large supporting force, the short axial height and asymmetry of the self-expanding stent, thereby realizing high-quality release of the artificial valve into the lesions. The present disclosure also applies to the following situation. When the stent is a circumferential asymmetric stent, for example, in the stent, some regions are less rigid than others, or notches are asymmetrically arranged, the stent is subjected to uneven force and is more prone to inclination, distortion and damage during the loading and release, thereby leading to loading failure or unavailability of the implant. By arranging the protector on the inner tube assembly corresponding to the regions, the stent can be supported to ensure loading and release thereof. Furthermore, with the diversity of stent types, such as a split stent, each part of the stent has different requirements for supporting force, and different implant protection parts may be selected as required by each part.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although the present disclosure has been disclosed as above with preferred embodiments, the embodiments are not intended to limit the present disclosure.
