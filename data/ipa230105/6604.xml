As a result, the lifetime of the solar panel may decrease or the solar panel may be permanently damaged. To solve the above problem, the negative electrode (or the positive electrode) of the photovoltaic battery array may be connected to the ground to form a single point grounding system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In related art, a fuse may be used to directly connect the negative electrode of the single point grounding system to the ground. When a ground-fault occurs and the fault current is much greater than the rated current of the fuse, the fault current may melt the fuse to form an open circuit between the negative electrode and the ground for protecting the system. However, the related art fails to detect the ground-fault on the AC side of the system. When the grounding cable of the system is exposed to the large fault current for a long time, the insulation aging of the grounding cable may deteriorate the safety of the photovoltaic power generating system or even lead to cable fire.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to a ground-fault detecting device, and more particularly to a ground-fault detecting device for a photovoltaic power generating system and the related method.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention provide a ground-fault detecting device.

Accordingly, the method is able to effectively detect the ground-fault(s) of the photovoltaic power generating system before the photovoltaic power generating system is connected to the grid and when the photovoltaic power generating system is connected to the grid such that the system may operate normally. In addition, when the voltage between the three-phase AC power on the AC side and the ground is obtained by using the detecting module installed between the AC side and the ground, the controller <b>30</b> may be used to determine if the ground-fault occurs in AC side before the system is connected to the grid according to the sampled voltages.
