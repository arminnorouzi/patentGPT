The power buttons may interface with a controller (e.g., a chipset) to provide an input to the controller. For example, a button press event may trigger an interrupt to the controller. Then, the controller may control the power supply to the electronic device upon detecting the button press event. In this example, the controller may detect the button press event and output a control signal to supply power, for instance, for booting the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The controllers may be used in various low-power and/or battery-powered applications, such as notebook computers, tablet computers, smartphones, MP3 players, video game consoles, and the like. The lifetime of batteries in such applications may depend on the power consumption of components of the electronic device. For example, a controller in such an electronic device may be in a turn-on state (i.e., working) when the electronic device is in a power-off mode. In this example, the controller may be in an active or turn-on state to monitor the power button and detect the power button input (i.e., the button press event) while the electronic device is in the power-off mode, For example, the power button input may be generated by pressing the power button.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In such examples, the controller may consume power (e.g., about 0.3 W) while waiting for a signal from the power button during the power-off mode of the electronic device. The controller may spend substantial amount of time inactive and wait for the signal from the power button by consuming a significant amount of battery power. Thus, the controller may consume the battery power of the electronic device even when the electronic device is in the power-off mode.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Examples described herein may provide an electromagnetic generator coupled to a power button. The, electromagnetic generator may generate an induced current when the power button is pressed. In this example, the electromagnetic generator may convert the kinetic energy (e,g, of the power button) into electrical energy (e.g., induced current) in accordance with Faraday's law of induction. The electromagnetic generator may supply the induced current to a controller to power on the controller. The controller, when powered on, may output a control signal to an electronic switch to enable the electronic switch to control the power supply to the electronic device. Thus, examples described herein may use the induced current (i.e., magnetically generated power) to enable the controller to generate a control signal for controlling the power supply to the electronic device. During the power off mode (i.e., a shutdown mode) of the electronic device, the controller may not consume the battery power of the electronic device. Thus, examples described herein may facilitate zero power consumption in the power off mode of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present techniques.
