The power saving mode is a driving method for reducing/minimizing power consumption by limiting the maximum luminance of the display panel <b>100</b> to a preset luminance or less. For example, the power saving mode may be an Always On Display (AOD) mode in which simple display information is always displayed, and/or a predetermined display mode in which a screen is displayed with ultra-low luminance to present a relatively dark screen in a dark environment.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the power saving mode, the display device <b>1000</b> may reduce/minimize power consumption by using the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> to change the voltage level of VSS and/or VDD supplied to the display panel <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Hereinafter, for brevity of explanation, a description will be given based on a case in which the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> changes the voltage level of VSS in the power saving mode.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The display device <b>1000</b> may decrease a voltage difference between VSS and VDD by increasing the voltage level of VSS when VSS is negative (hereafter, &#x201c;a negative VSS&#x201d;). Power consumption may thereby be reduced/minimized. The reduction in power consumption may be at least partly due to less power consumed by transistors within pixels PX drawing pixel current through paths between VDD and VSS circuit nodes. When the difference between VDD and VSS is reduced, this pixel current is either maintained or does not increase relatively as much as the reduction in (VDD-VSS), whereby power consumption (the product of current and the voltage difference between the circuit nodes) is reduced. For example, the display device <b>1000</b> may generate VSS of a first negative level in the normal mode, and may generate VSS of a second negative level higher than the first level in the power saving mode. In this case, the display device may output a positive VDD at the same level in both modes, whereby the difference (VDD-VSS) is reduced in the power save mode as compared to the normal mode. Alternatively, the difference (VDD-VSS) is reduced in the power save mode in other ways, such as by just lowering VDD or by both lowering VDD and raising VSS.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an embodiment, the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> may change VSS based on the power control signal SWIRE in the power saving mode. For example, the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> may change the voltage level of VSS by controlling a duty ratio (equivalently, &#x201c;duty cycle&#x201d;) of the switching pulse applied to transistors within the DC-DC converter <b>500</b>. To this end, the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> may generate VSS of a target voltage level by controlling the duty ratio. For example, the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> may increase the voltage level of a negative VSS by reducing the duty ratio in response to SWIRE (equivalently, since the VSS target voltage level is negative, the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> may reduce the magnitude of the absolute value of VSS). Power consumption may thereby be reduced/minimized in the power saving mode.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Note, however, that a &#x201c;minimum on-time&#x201d; may be designated to allow the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> to stably generate VSS and VDD. For example, the minimum on-time may be designated to secure a time for preventing overcurrent from flowing through the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> by sensing and limiting the inductor current of the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> and secure a dead time between the switching operations applied to the DC-DC converter transistors. The dead time may prevent the transistors from being simultaneously turned on. Therefore, the &#x201c;on-pulse&#x201d; time corresponding to the duty ratio may be set to be equal to or greater than the minimum on-time designated for the DC-DC converter <b>500</b>. The time corresponding to the duty ratio may be understood as an on-pulse time during a switching pulse cycle having a switching period. The minimum on-time may hereinafter be referred to as &#x201c;switching on-time&#x201d; or &#x201c;on-pulse&#x201d; time, and may correspond to a value obtained by multiplying the switching period of the switching pulse by the duty ratio.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Due to such a minimum on-time, in conventional devices, the voltage level of VSS that is changed by the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> may be restricted. As described above, the switching on-time may need to be set equal to or greater than the minimum on-time. Thus, when the switching frequency is the same, the variable range of the on/off duty ratio of the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> is limited. Consequently, the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> cannot increase a negative VSS above a certain level in conventional devices. That is, the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> cannot reduce the on-duty ratio beyond a certain range according to the minimum on-time.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">However, the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> according to the embodiments of the inventive concept may change the switching frequency so as to increase VSS above a certain level (so as to generate VSS of the target voltage level). For example, when the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> reduces the switching frequency, the switching period increases in response to the reduced switching frequency. Thus, the switching on-time may increase for the same duty ratio. Therefore, the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> may generate VSS of the target voltage level by further reducing the duty ratio. These operations will be explained further below.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an embodiment, the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> may determine the target voltage level of VSS based on the power control signal SWIRE. The DC-DC converter <b>500</b> may calculate a target duty ratio based on the voltage level of the input voltage VIN and the target voltage level of VSS, and may calculate an optimum switching frequency (a &#x201c;correction switching frequency&#x201d;, or a &#x201c;second frequency&#x201d;) for the minimum on-time according to the target duty ratio. Therefore, the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> may stably generate VSS of the target voltage level by changing the switching frequency from a currently driven switching frequency (the &#x201c;first frequency&#x201d;) to the correction switching frequency (the &#x201c;second frequency&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">However, when the second frequency calculated based on the input voltage VIN and the target voltage level of VSS is lower than a reference frequency (e.g., less than 500 kHz), the switching operation period of the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> is lengthened, causing output ripples.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Therefore, when the second frequency is lower than the reference frequency, the DC-DC converter <b>500</b> according to the embodiments of the inventive concept may set the switching frequency corresponding to the reference frequency. As will be explained further below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, at this time, the minimum on-time may be reduced by turning off the operation of a current sensor used for inductor current sensing and limiting.
