Play on EGMs typically involves a player establishing a credit balance by inputting money, or another form of monetary credit, and placing a monetary wager (from the credit balance) on one or more outcomes of an instance (or single play) of a primary or base game. In many games, a player may qualify for secondary games or bonus rounds by attaining a certain winning combination or triggering event in the base game. Secondary games provide an opportunity to win additional game instances, credits, awards, jackpots, progressives, etc. Awards from any winning outcomes are typically added back to the credit balance and can be provided to the player upon completion of a gaming session or when the player wants to &#x201c;cash out.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">&#x201c;Slot&#x201d; type games are often displayed to the player in the form of various symbols arrayed in a row-by-column grid or matrix. Specific matching combinations of symbols along predetermined paths (or paylines) through the matrix indicate the outcome of the game. The display typically highlights winning combinations/outcomes for ready identification by the player. Matching combinations and their corresponding awards are usually shown in a &#x201c;pay-table&#x201d; which is available to the player for reference. Often, the player may vary his/her wager to include differing numbers of paylines and/or the amount bet on each line. By varying the wager, the player may sometimes alter the frequency or number of winning combinations, frequency or number of secondary games, and/or the amount awarded.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typical games use a random number generator (RNG) to randomly determine the outcome of each game. The game is designed to return a certain percentage of the amount wagered back to the player (RTP=return to player) over the course of many plays or instances of the game. The RTP and randomness of the RNG are critical to ensuring the fairness of the games and are therefore highly regulated. Upon initiation of play, the RNG randomly determines a game outcome and symbols are then selected which correspond to that outcome. Notably, some games may include an element of skill on the part of the player and are therefore not entirely random.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As alluded to earlier herein, some gaming machines are configured to present a bonus game in response to the occurrence of a bonus condition or bonus trigger in a base, or primary, game. Specifically, a player may qualify for a bonus game based upon one or more base game outcomes. A bonus game may be played in accordance with rules that are different from the rules of the base game, and prizes or awards generated during the bonus game may be different from prizes and awards generated during the base game.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As the number and variety of available gaming systems increases, gaming systems operators, such as casinos, continue to strive for the design and implementation of new and exciting gaming systems. The present disclosure is therefore directed to such gaming systems. In particular, the present invention is directed to gaming systems and methods including a stop-based bonus game, e.g., a wheel or reel with multiple stops, although the concepts discussed herein may also be applicable to various other types of bonus games.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Gaming systems, methods, and machines discussed herein may be used to provide bonus games that are associated with two different classes of awards, e.g., one or more first awards and one or more second awards. The first award(s) may generally be much more desirable to players than the second award(s), e.g., the first awards may be large-denomination jackpot awards, whereas the second awards may be small-denomination credit awards, e.g., non-jackpot awards. During play of such bonus games, selection of a stop position associated with a second award may cause that stop position to be instead associated with one of the one or more first awards for future play of the bonus game, thereby increasing the opportunities to win a first award in subsequent play of the bonus game.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some implementations, a method of electronic gaming may be implemented using a gaming system. The gaming system may include a player input interface, a credit input mechanism including at least one of a card reader, a ticket reader, a bill validator, a coin input mechanism, and one or more displays configured to display a wagering game. The credit input mechanism may be configured to establish a credit balance that is increasable and decreasable based on wagering activity. The gaming system may also include a tangible, nontransitory, computer-readable memory and a processor communicatively coupled to the memory. The method may include initiating, by the processor and in response to a primary game outcome of the wagering game, a bonus game; causing, by the processor and in association with the bonus game, a bonus wheel that includes a plurality of stop positions to be displayed on the one or more displays, at least one of the plurality of stop positions associated with a secondary jackpot wheel; selecting, by the processor, a first stop position from the plurality of stop positions included on the bonus wheel; determining, by the processor, that the selected first stop position is associated with the secondary jackpot wheel; displaying, by the processor, the secondary jackpot wheel, the secondary jackpot wheel including a plurality of stop positions, each of the plurality of stop positions associated with one of i) one of a plurality of jackpot awards and ii) one of a plurality of credit prizes; selecting, by the processor, a first stop position from the plurality of stop positions displayed on the secondary jackpot wheel, the first stop position associated with a first credit prize of the plurality of credit prizes; and replacing, by the processor, the first credit prize associated with the first stop position with a first jackpot award of the plurality of jackpot awards, such that the first stop position is associated with the first jackpot award rather than the first credit prize.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some implementations, the method may further include awarding, by the processor, the first credit prize to the player.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some implementations, the method may further include awarding, by the processor, the first credit prize to the player prior to replacing the first credit prize with the first jackpot award.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some implementations, the method may further include displaying, by the processor and in response to the replacing, the bonus wheel, the bonus wheel including the first stop position associated with the first jackpot award rather than the first credit prize.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some such implementations, the method may further include selecting, by the processor and from the bonus wheel, a second stop position from the plurality of stop positions included on the bonus wheel. In some additional implementations, the method may further include determining, by the processor, that the second stop position is associated with a second credit prize of the plurality of credit prizes. In some implementations, the method may further include replacing, by the processor, the second credit prize associated with the second stop position with a second jackpot award of the plurality of jackpot awards, such that the second stop position is associated with the second jackpot award rather than the second credit prize.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some implementations, an electronic gaming system may be provided that includes a display configured to display a wagering game; a player input interface configured to receive a player input; a credit input mechanism including at least one of a card reader, a ticket reader, a bill acceptor, and a coin input mechanism, the credit input mechanism configured to receive a credit wager, the credit wager initiating play of the wagering game; a processor for controlling the wagering game; and a tangible, non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium having instructions stored thereon that, in response to execution by the processor, cause the processor to perform operations including: initiating, by the processor and in response to a primary game outcome of the wagering game, a bonus game; displaying, by the processor and in association with the bonus game, a bonus wheel, the bonus wheel including a plurality of stop positions, at least one of the plurality of stop positions associated with a secondary jackpot wheel; selecting, by the processor, a first stop position from the plurality of stop positions included on the bonus wheel; determining, by the processor, that the selected first stop position is associated with the secondary jackpot wheel; displaying, by the processor, the secondary jackpot wheel, the secondary jackpot wheel including a plurality of stop positions, each of the plurality of stop positions associated with one of i) one of a plurality of jackpot awards and ii) one of a plurality of credit prizes; selecting, by the processor, a first stop position from the plurality of stop positions displayed on the secondary jackpot wheel, the first stop position associated with a first credit prize of the plurality of credit prizes; and replacing, by the processor, the first credit prize associated with the first stop position with a first jackpot award of the plurality of jackpot awards, such that the first stop position is associated with the first jackpot award rather than the first credit prize.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some implementations of the electronic gaming system, the instructions may further cause the processor to perform operations including awarding, by the processor, the first credit prize to the player.

The jackpot wheel may include a plurality of stop positions, many of which may be associated with one or more credit prizes. When a player lands on a stop position associated with a credit prize, the credit prize may be awarded, and the credit prize previously associated with the stop position may be replaced by a jackpot award. In this respect, a credit prize associated with the stop position may &#x201c;metamorphose&#x201d; to a jackpot award. As gameplay progresses, the number of jackpot awards included on the jackpot wheel may increase, such that a player's odds of winning a jackpot award also increase. In addition, jackpot awards added to a jackpot wheel may persist over time irrespective of player gaming session, such that a subsequent player may win a jackpot award added during an earlier player's gaming session. Players are encouraged, as a result, to continue gameplay, once it has begun, until a jackpot award is won.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates several different models of EGMs which may be networked to various gaming related servers.

The player may use the player tracking interface <b>232</b> to access his/her account information, activate free play, and/or request various information. Player tracking or loyalty programs seek to reward players for their play and help build brand loyalty to the gaming establishment. The rewards typically correspond to the player's level of patronage (e.g., to the player's playing frequency and/or total amount of game plays at a given casino). Player tracking rewards may be complimentary and/or discounted meals, lodging, entertainment and/or additional play.

Therefore, to satisfy security and regulatory requirements in a gaming environment, hardware and software architectures are implemented in gaming devices <b>104</b>A-<b>104</b>X, <b>200</b> that differ significantly from those of general-purpose computers. Adapting general purpose computers to function as gaming devices <b>200</b> is not simple or straightforward because of: 1) the regulatory requirements for gaming devices <b>200</b>, 2) the harsh environment in which gaming devices <b>200</b> operate, 3) security requirements, 4) fault tolerance requirements, and 5) the requirement for additional special purpose componentry enabling functionality of an EGM. These differences require substantial engineering effort with respect to game design implementation, hardware components and software.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">When a player wishes to play the gaming device <b>200</b>, he/she can insert cash or a ticket voucher through a coin acceptor (not shown) or bill validator <b>234</b> to establish a credit balance on the gamine machine. The credit balance is used by the player to place wagers on instances of the game and to receive credit awards based on the outcome of winning instances. The credit balance is decreased by the amount of each wager and increased upon a win. The player can add additional credits to the balance at any time. The player may also optionally insert a loyalty club card into the card reader <b>230</b>. During the game, the player views the game outcome on the game displays <b>240</b>, <b>242</b>. Other game and prize information may also be displayed.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">For each game instance, a player may make selections, which may affect play of the game. For example, the player may vary the total amount wagered by selecting the amount bet per line and the number of lines played. In many games, the player is asked to initiate or select options during course of game play (such as spinning a wheel to begin a bonus round or select various items during a feature game). The player may make these selections using the player-input buttons <b>236</b>, the primary game display <b>240</b> which may be a touch screen, or using some other device which enables a player to input information into the gaming device <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">During certain game events, the gaming device <b>200</b> may display visual and auditory effects that can be perceived by the player.

The ticket may be &#x201c;cashed-in&#x201d; for money or inserted into another machine to establish a credit balance for play.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Throughout this specification and in the claims, the terms &#x201c;primary game&#x201d; and &#x201c;bonus game&#x201d; refer to a game session that includes more than one game event or, simply, one or more games. The primary game may correspond to a primary or &#x201c;base&#x201d; game, as opposed to a bonus game, as described below. The primary game may be initiated in response to a wager or credit being received by or transferred to a gaming machine, such as gaming machines <b>104</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The primary game (as well as one or more games including the primary game) may also be initiated by other game events including, for example, a player selecting a &#x201c;spin&#x201d; button, a start button, a deal button, or any other such input selector designated for initiating a game session. The primary game may be terminated voluntarily in response to an input by the player indicating that the player wishes to stop the game or automatically by the gaming device in response to a termination event, such as a zero credit balance in the game.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Further, as used herein, the terms &#x201c;bonus game,&#x201d; &#x201c;secondary game,&#x201d; &#x201c;bonus game session,&#x201d; and &#x201c;bonus feature&#x201d; refer generally to a game or a component of a game involving procedures in addition to the primary game. The bonus game may be initiated after, or during, the primary game and in response to a particular condition occurring during the primary game or, in some instances, in response to a particular condition occurring during another bonus game, e.g., events in a primary game may cause a bonus game to be provided to a player, and a subsequent event in the bonus game may cause a second bonus game to be provided to the player (it is conceivable that you could have any number of such tiered bonus games). The bonus game may include a plurality of bonus game events. For example, where the primary game includes a slot machine game, the bonus game may allow players a possibility of winning more than the pay table for the primary game indicates. Typically, a bonus game outcome may depend upon a particular symbol being displayed when one of a plurality of final game events takes place. In addition, the bonus game outcome may depend upon winning a payout while gaming machine <b>104</b> is in a bonus mode or &#x201c;zone.&#x201d; In various implementation, the outcome of the bonus game may be unrelated to the outcome of the primary game.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of a technique for providing a bonus game in accordance with the concepts discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In block <b>302</b>, a bonus game may be provided to a player of an electronic gaming machine. The bonus game may, for example, be any of a number of different types of bonus games in which a player is generally provided with a number of opportunities to win a prize in response to the determination of a random outcome. The bonus games in this example may generally be associated with one or more first awards and one or more second awards. The one or more first awards may generally be higher-value, more desirable awards than the one or more second awards&#x2014;typically much higher in value than the one or more second awards. For example, the one or more second awards may be awards such as fixed-credit awards within an order or magnitude or so of the credit awards that are potentially awardable in the main game of the electronic gaming machine, and the one or more first awards may, for example, be multiple orders of magnitude larger than the credit awards that are potentially awardable in the main game of the electronic gaming machine, e.g., jackpot awards. For example, the one or more first awards may be progressive awards that grow in magnitude with every wager placed on the electronic gaming machine and, optionally, on other electronic gaming machines as well. The one or more second awards may also include, in some implementations, non-credit or no-value awards, including zero credit awards, i.e., awards that provide no actual benefit, and bonus features that may affect future play or current awards of the main game or of the bonus game. For example, such bonus features may include awards such as win multipliers, free games, wild cards or the like, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some implementations, the first awards may be understood to include jackpot awards such as monetary awards greater than a predefined threshold, monetary awards more than X orders of magnitude larger than a next highest, lower-amount award of the awards, and progressive awards. For example, in some implementations, a jackpot award may be between 4X to 40X (or higher) in value as compared with non-jackpot awards available in a wagering game. In some implementations, there may be multiple, different-valued jackpot awards. For example, there may be a set of one or more jackpot award values available in a wagering game (and/or, in some cases, a bonus game associated therewith) that each have a value that is between 4X to 40X (or higher) than a highest award value available in the wagering game that is not included in the set of one or more jackpot award values. For example, a wagering game might offer award values of 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 10,000 credits; the 500, 1000, and 10,000 credit amounts may be classed as &#x201c;jackpot&#x201d; awards since they are each higher than 4X the amount of the highest award value not in the &#x201c;jackpot&#x201d; set (which is 100 credits).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Similarly, the second awards may be understood to include, in some implementations, non-jackpot awards, e.g., fixed credit amount awards below a predefined threshold, multiplier bonus awards applicable in a primary wagering game of the electronic gaming system, one or more wild symbols applicable in the primary wagering game of an electronic gaming system, a free play of a bonus game (either the bonus game discussed above, or a different bonus game), a free play of a base game associated with the bonus game, an additional selection of one of the stop symbols, addition of an additional reel window, or no-value awards.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In block <b>304</b>, a construct may be caused to be displayed. The construct may, for example, be a graphical object or objects that represents a physical object or objects that has one or more stop positions, each of which is associated with one of the one or more first awards or the one or more second awards. For example, each stop position may have an indication depicted thereon or therein that indicates the nature of the award associated with that stop position. The stop positions may, for example, each represent an opportunity to obtain an associate outcome&#x2014;for example, in a wheel-based bonus game, each stop position may be a wheel segment extending across a predefined angular range, e.g., a &#x201c;pie-slice.&#x201d; In a reel-based bonus game, each stop position may, for example, be a different reel position or reel stop. When the bonus game is initiated or reset to a &#x201c;fresh&#x201d; state, the number of stop positions associated with the one or more first awards maybe set to a relatively low value as compared with the number of stop positions associated with the one or more second awards. For example, there may initially be only one (or perhaps zero) stop positions associated with the one or more first awards, whereas there may be a much larger number of stop positions associated with the one or more second awards. For example, a typical bonus game may have upwards of 10 to 15 or more stop positions associated with the one or more first and second awards, and the vast majority of those stop positions may be associated with the one or more second awards.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In some implementations, the bonus game may be caused to be displayed continuously, e.g., in a secondary display of the gaming machine and during the play of the main game, so that the player may be aware of the potential opportunity to play the bonus game, whereas in other implementations, the bonus game may be hidden from view or minimized to a reduced format during play of the main game (when the bonus game is not actively being played)&#x2014;although the state of the bonus game may generally be preserved or otherwise have permanence between plays of the bonus game punctuated by plays of the main game in such implementations.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In block <b>306</b>, monitoring for an indication of a trigger event may be performed&#x2014;such trigger event indications may, for example, include events such as the selection of a predefined symbol or outcome in a base game or another bonus game, winning of a threshold amount in the main game or another bonus game, winning a &#x201c;free play&#x201d; award in the bonus game itself, or other trigger event. If an indication of a trigger event is not detected in block <b>306</b>, the technique may return to block <b>306</b> for further monitoring. If a trigger event is detected in block <b>306</b>, then the technique may proceed to block <b>308</b>, in which an outcome for the bonus game governing which stop position is selected may be determined. The display of the construct may be modified during this process to show an animation, e.g., to show a rotating wheel or reel that concludes with the selected stop position indicated. For example, for a wheel-type construct, the construct may include a pointer or other indicator that may point to the segments (stop positions) of the wheel as it rotates and, when the wheel stops, indicates the selected segment (or stop position). It should be understood that while the examples discussed herein typically feature a construct in which the stop positions move during play in order to cause a particular stop position to be positioned at a location associated with selection of a stop position, other implementations may feature stop positions that are stationary. For example, a wheel-type construct may be fixed in place such that the orientations of the various wheel segments do not change during a wheel &#x201c;spin&#x201d; (in other words, the wheel does not actually spin); in such implementations, the &#x201c;spinning&#x201d; may be indicated by sequentially changing the color or brightness of the segments, or otherwise emphasizing particular segments, in a clockwise or counterclockwise manner around the center of the wheel. Alternatively, a pointer located at the periphery of the wheel may be animated so as to traverse around the outer perimeter of the wheel and stop when indicating the selected stop position.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In block <b>310</b>, a determination may be made as to whether the selected stop position is associated with one of the one or more first awards or one of the one or more second awards. It will be understood that such a determination may be made before the selected stop position is selected in some implementations. For example, block <b>308</b> may involve selecting an outcome, e.g., a win of a second award, and the display of the construct may then be controlled to cause a stop position associated with that outcome to be selected.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">If the selected stop position is associated with one of the one or more second awards, the technique may proceed to block <b>312</b>, in which the second award associated with the selected stop position may be provided to the player, e.g., if the associated second award is a credit amount, then that credit amount may be added to the player's credit balance.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">After a stop position that is associated with one of the one or more second awards is selected, the technique may further proceed to block <b>314</b>, in which the selected stop position is associated with one of the one or more first awards instead of the second award it was previously associated with. Thus, for example, if a stop position associated with a second award that provides a $5 credit is selected, the $5 credit may be provided to the player, and the selected stop position may then be associated with a first award, e.g., a jackpot award. The construct may be updated to reflect this change, e.g., an indicator saying &#x201c;5 credits&#x201d; may morph or otherwise change into an indicator saying &#x201c;Jackpot!&#x201d; or the like. In some implementations, stop positions that were associated with a second award and are then changed to be associated with a first award after the associated second award is won may be portrayed in a different manner than other stop positions that were already associated with a first award prior to the selection of the most recently selected stop position. For example, a stop position that is newly associated with a first award may have the indicator of the first award shown in a &#x201c;greyed out&#x201d; manner (compared to colored indicators shown for other stop positions previously associated with first awards) or have text like &#x201c;New!&#x201d; displayed thereon. Such implementations may avoid circumstances where a player believes that they won a first award because the indicator for the second award that they just won has changed into an indicator of an associated first award while the stop position is still selected&#x2014;in such circumstances, it may be desirable to retain the ability to differentiate between stop positions that were associated with first awards prior to the most recent selection of a stop segment and a stop position that was newly associated with a first award after the most recent selection of a stop segment.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">After the selected stop position previously associated with a second award is re-associated with a first award, the technique may return to block <b>306</b>, where monitoring of trigger events continues. For example, after a player wins a second award due to the selection of a stop position associated with the second award and after the selected stop position is then newly associated with one of the one or more first awards, play of the bonus game may stop, and the player may be returned to the base game or another bonus game. As the player plays the base game or another bonus game, a further trigger event may occur, which may cause play of the bonus game associated with the one or more first awards and one or more second awards to begin again. Generally speaking, the stop positions that were previously associated with a second award but then re-associated with a first award, as described above, may remain associated with those first awards when play of the bonus game begins again after a further trigger event is detected. Thus, each time the player plays the bonus game and wins a second award, the number of stop positions associated with the one or more first awards may be increased by one&#x2014;thereby increasing the player's chances of winning a first award on a subsequent play of the bonus game. It will be understood that the apparent chances of achieving a particular outcome may, in some implementations, not actually reflect the actual chances of achieving that particular outcome. For example, 75% of the stop positions (assuming equal-sized stop positions) for a given bonus wheel may be associated with a particular outcome, but the behavior of the bonus wheel may be governed such that the actual chance of achieving that outcome is less than 75%. In such cases, however, increasing the number of stop positions associated with a particular outcome will still generally cause the chance of achieving that particular outcome to increase compared to its previous value. In an extreme case, the visual appearance of achieving a particular outcome may appear to change due to an increased number of stop positions associated with that particular outcome, but the actual chance of achieving that particular outcome may be controlled so as to remain static, i.e., unchanged.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">If the selected stop position is associated with one of the one or more first awards then the technique may proceed to block <b>316</b> instead, in which the gaming machine may cause the first award associated with the select stop position to be provided to the player, for example, by causing an associated number of credits to be awarded to the player. In some implementations, the technique may then proceed to block <b>318</b>, in which the stop positions associated with the first award that was provided to the player may be reset to a default state. For example, such a reset may involve re-associating with second awards any stop positions that were originally associated with second awards and then subsequently associated with first awards due to the second awards for those stop positions being won during play of the bonus game. For example, if six stop positions were changed from being associated with second awards to being associated with first awards during play of the bonus game, then those six stop positions may be returned to being associated with second awards after the first award is won. In some implementations, such resets may be position-specific, e.g., exactly the same stop positions that were re-associated to a first award during play are reset to being associated with second awards, whereas in other implementations, such resets may be position-neutral, e.g., if six of seven stop positions were re-associated to a first award during play of the bonus game, then any six of those seven stop positions, may be reset to be associated with a second award. In some implementations, a reset of stop positions may entail decreasing the number of stop positions associated with a first award by associating them with a second award.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">It will be understood that bonus games such as are described herein may, in some implementations, have a plurality of different types of first awards and second awards that are associated with the stop positions of the bonus game. For example, a bonus game may initially feature two stop positions that are each associated with a different first award, e.g., a fixed jackpot award and a progressive jackpot award (which may continue to increase over time). Similarly, the bonus game may feature multiple stop positions that are each initially associated with one of several second awards, e.g., $1, $2, $5, $10, etc. credit awards. When a stop position is selected that is associated with one of the second awards, it may then be associated with one of the two jackpot awards in this example for future play. The determination of which of the two jackpot awards to associate with the selected stop position may be made randomly or according to one or more rules governing such associations. For example, stop position association with multiple first awards may occur in an alternating or sequential fashion so that the increases in the number of stop positions associated with each first award occur generally in sequential lockstep. In other implementations, the specific first award that is associated with a selected stop position may be determined based on the nature of the second award that was previously associated with the selected stop position, e.g., stop positions associated with higher-value second awards may be associated with a higher-value first award, and stop positions associated with lower-value second awards may be associated with lower-value first awards.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A through <b>4</b>J</figref> depict a bonus game according the concepts discussed herein in various stages of operation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A through <b>4</b>J</figref>, a bonus wheel is depicted that initially has one stop position (shaded for easy reference) that is associated with a first award (a &#x201c;Jackpot&#x201d; award in this example) and seventeen stop positions that are each associated with, in this case, a different second award (other implementations may use only one type of second award, or may use multiple second awards but allow multiple stop positions to be associated with the same second award). The second awards, in this example, are fixed credit amounts. In this example, each play of the bonus game involves spinning the wheel and then seeing which stop segment lines up with the triangular selection indicator located at the top of the wheel when the wheel comes to a stop.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the wheel is spun and, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, comes to a stop such that a stop position for 4000 credits is selected. The player receives 4000 credits, and the selected stop position is then associated with the first award, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. In a subsequent spin of the wheel, e.g., after another trigger event occurs and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, another stop position associated with a second award may be selected, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, the stop position associated with a second award of 150 credits has been selected and is then re-associated with the Jackpot award responsive to such selection. At this point, there are three of eighteen stop positions associated with the first award and the chances of winning the first award have tripled compared to the initial chances of doing so.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>, the wheel is spun again (in response to detection of another trigger event), and the stop position for 2000 credits is selected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>; the selected stop position is then associated with the first award for further play. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>G</figref>, a further spin of the wheel during further play of the bonus game results in the selection of a stop position for a 50-credit second award, after which the selected stop position is associated with the first award. This general mode of operation may continue until the wheel is spun, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>, and a stop position associated with the first award is selected, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>J</figref>. In this example, the player has finally won the Jackpot after 50% of the wheel stop positions have been associated with the first award.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">It will be understood that the techniques discussed above may be employed using constructs other than wheels, such as are discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A through <b>4</b>J</figref> and as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B through <b>5</b>D</figref> depict various additional examples of constructs that may be used in bonus games according to the concepts discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, a reel-type construct is shown&#x2014;in many respects, the reel construct is similar to the wheel construct in that the stop positions are distributed about its circumference and it rotates so that a particular stop position may be selected, e.g., by being indicated by the triangular indicator, based on where the reel stops. In contrast to the wheel-type constructs, such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, reel-type constructs do not have all of the stop positions visible at once, which may be less appealing to players since they will not be immediately able to tell how many of the stop positions are associated with the first award(s)&#x2014;such information is only revealed when the reel rotates, and even then, stop positions that were previously visible may be hidden from view as the reel rotates.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, a dice-type construct is shown. The dice (it will be understood that more or less than two dice may be used, as well as dice with different numbers of sides) may be &#x201c;rolled&#x201d; during play of the bonus game, and each side or facet of each die may be associated with a first award or a second award. In such bonus games, a plurality of stop positions may be selected responsive to a trigger event, e.g., a stop position from each die may be selected (in this example, the uppermost faces of the dice may indicate the selected stop positions), and used to determine a bonus game outcome. In such bonus games, awarding the first award may be contingent on a particular multiple stop position outcome, e.g., each selected stop position resulting from a given trigger event may need to be associated with a first award (or, in some implementations, with the same first award) for the first award to actually be awarded. In other implementations, only a proper subset of the selected stop positions may need to be associated with a first award in order for the gaming machine to award the player with the associated first award.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">For example, if the dice are &#x201c;rolled&#x201d; and one die shows a selected stop position associated with a first award, and the other shows a selected stop position associated with a second award, the stop position associated with the first award may effectively be ignored for that play of the bonus game, and the stop position associated with the second award may be treated in the same manner as discussed above, e.g., by awarding the second award and then associating the selected stop position associated with that second award with one of the one or more first awards instead.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Other scenarios that may occur for such multi-stop-position selection bonus games may include, for example, situations in which multiple stop positions are selected that are associated with either a first award or a second award. For example, if the dice of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> are &#x201c;rolled,&#x201d; in some instances, stop positions may be selected that are associated with two different second awards. In some implementations, the gaming machine may be configured to award to the player each second award associated with the selected stop positions for a given bonus game play. Thus, for example, if the selected stop positions for the depicted dice both indicate second awards, e.g., a 1-credit award and a 5-credit award, then the player may be awarded 6 credits. In some alternative implementations, the gaming machine may be configured to pick only one of the second awards associated with the selected stop positions and award it to the player. The determination of which second award to award to the player may be made randomly or according to a preset rule, e.g., the lowest second award selected may be awarded (or, conversely, the highest).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">With regard to post-selection association of the stop positions with one or more of the first awards, a similar approach may be taken. For example, if the selected stop positions indicate multiple different first awards, the gaming machine may, in some implementations, be configured to randomly select a single one of those first awards to award to the player. Such selection may proceed in a manner similar to the possible techniques discussed above with respect to the second awards.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref> depicts a diagram of a &#x201c;grid&#x201d; or &#x201c;treasure map&#x201d; type construct. In such constructs, the player may be presented with a play area, e.g., a grid or map (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>, this area is represented by the upper 5&#xd7;7 grid of squares), that is divided into a large number of different regions (35 in this example); these regions may be thought of as equivalent to the stop positions discussed earlier. One or more of the regions is then selected by the player during play of the bonus game; in this example, there are three regions selected, each marked with an &#x201c;X.&#x201d; Each of the regions is also associated with a first award or a second award&#x2014;the player, however, will not know in advance what the award associations of the regions are. After the player selects the permitted number of regions, the grid display may be updated to show which awards each region was associated with and a determination may be made as to which awards are associated with the selected regions (or stop positions). In this respect, grid or treasure map bonus games may function in a manner similar to that described above.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">One key difference between grid- or treasure map-type bonus games and the previous types of bonus games discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A through <b>4</b>C</figref> is that the player may have the ability to actively select the selected stop positions, whereas the other implementations feature random selection of stop positions. In view of this, grid- or treasure map-type bonus games may randomize the associations of the stop positions with the first and second awards prior to each play so that the player does not simply select the most desirable stop positions as revealed during previous plays of the bonus game. In such gaming machines, the total number of regions associated with each type of first award and/or second award prior to such randomization may be retained and the actual associations between those awards and the regions may then be controlled so as to preserve the same relative proportions of each. Thus, if a player has managed to re-associate regions or stop positions of the 35 regions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref> so that there are a total of 9 stop positions associated with a first award, then the next play of the bonus game would also feature 9 stop positions associated with the first award, but their locations within the grid would be randomized.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In some similar implementations, the selection of the regions/stop positions may be randomly determined by the gaming machine (as opposed to selected under human control). In some such implementations, the associations of regions or stop positions with their respective first or second awards may generally be left unchanged prior to each play of the bonus game (the exception being stop positions that were re-associated from second awards to first awards as a result of the most recent selection of a stop position). In such implementations, the associations of the stop positions with their respective first and second awards may be made visible to the player prior to the selection of stop positions, as the player would not be in a position to benefit from such knowledge.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>, three stop positions have been selected during play of the bonus game, all of which are associated with second awards (two $10 awards and a $1 award (not visible). There is only one stop position associated with a first award (the one marked &#x201c;Jackpot&#x201d;). However, during the next play of the bonus game there will be between one and three additional regions, i.e., one or more of the selected &#x201c;X&#x201d; regions, that are also associated with a first award.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The above are high-level descriptions of various types of bonus games that may benefit from the concepts described herein. Such bonus games may prove particularly attractive to players since the longer a player plays a gaming machine offering such a bonus game, the more &#x201c;upgraded&#x201d; the bonus game will be and the more likely it is that the player will win one of the first awards. A player who has invested significant time in &#x201c;upgrading&#x201d; a bonus game of a gaming machine may be more willing to continue playing the gaming machine to avoid losing their investment of time and credits in the gaming machine. The Figures discussed below illustrate a particular implementation of a gaming machine employing some of the concepts discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">With attention now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, an example process <b>600</b> of electronic gaming is shown in conjunction with a plurality of screenshots <b>700</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>900</b>, <b>1000</b>, and <b>1100</b>. Processor <b>60</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may implement process <b>600</b> as part of a bonus game, which may be triggered or initiated as a result of a primary game outcome (as described above).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Accordingly, and with specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, processor <b>60</b> may initiate a bonus game <b>701</b>, such as a wheel-based bonus game, in response to a primary game outcome of a primary game <b>702</b> (step <b>602</b>). Primary game <b>702</b> may include any suitable primary game, such as a five-reel primary game. In addition, a bonus wheel <b>704</b> and a plurality of secondary jackpot wheels, such as a first jackpot wheel <b>706</b>, a second jackpot wheel <b>708</b>, a third jackpot wheel <b>710</b>, and/or a fourth jackpot wheel <b>712</b> may be displayed in conjunction with primary game <b>702</b>.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Bonus wheel <b>704</b> may include an inner bonus wheel <b>716</b> and an outer bonus wheel <b>714</b>, each of which may spin independently.

In the example implementation, inner bonus wheel <b>716</b> includes a plurality of credit prizes arranged within a plurality of inner bonus wheel segments or stop positions <b>720</b>. Similarly, outer bonus wheel <b>714</b> includes a plurality of bonus game features <b>722</b>, such as a jackpot wheel feature <b>724</b> or free games feature <b>718</b>, arranged within a plurality of outer bonus wheel segments or stop positions <b>726</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Each of jackpot wheels <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> may be associated with a corresponding bonus game and displayed during primary game <b>702</b>, and each jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> may be related to (and configured to award) a specific bonus game, such as for example, a specific jackpot. In the example implementation, jackpots may include a &#x201c;GRAND&#x201d; jackpot, a &#x201c;MAJOR&#x201d; jackpot, a &#x201c;MINOR&#x201d; jackpot, and a &#x201c;MINI&#x201d; jackpot. However, in other implementations, any other suitable bonus and/or jackpot may be included. In addition, although the terminology &#x201c;jackpot wheel&#x201d; is used herein, it will be appreciated that jackpot wheels <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> may, in various implementations, be associated with a variety of bonuses. Thus, in the contemplated example, play of the base game may provide a player with an opportunity to play the bonus wheel game, which may, depending on the outcome of the bonus game, allow the player to play a further bonus game in the form of one of the four jackpot wheel bonus games&#x2014;the jackpot wheel bonus games in this example operate in the manner discussed previously, as will become evident from the following discussion.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Further, in various implementations, each of the bonuses and/or jackpots (e.g., the GRAND, MAJOR, MINOR, and MINI jackpots) may be associated with a specific bonus and/or jackpot value. For example, a GRAND jackpot may be associated with a largest jackpot value, and a MINI jackpot may be associated with a smallest jackpot value. The MAJOR and MINOR jackpot values may fall between the GRAND jackpot value and the MINI jackpot value, such that the MAJOR jackpot value is greater than the MINOR jackpot value but less than the GRAND jackpot value.

More particularly, either or both of inner bonus wheel <b>716</b> and/or outer bonus wheel <b>714</b> may spin (e.g., wheels may be animated by processor <b>60</b> such that they appear to spin on a video display) in response to selection of the &#x201c;spin&#x201d; option. Processor <b>60</b> may, in addition, select a particular stop position <b>720</b> from inner bonus wheel <b>716</b> and/or a particular stop position <b>726</b> from outer bonus wheel <b>714</b>, such as in response to selection by a player of the &#x201c;spin&#x201d; option (step <b>606</b>).</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Selections on inner bonus wheel <b>716</b> may result in a variety of credit prizes and/or different numbers of free games.

These credit prizes and/or free games may, in addition, be supplemented by an award feature, such as a &#x201c;Wilds Added&#x201d; award feature selected from outer bonus wheel <b>714</b>. Thus, in the example implementation, a player may be awarded a first bonus prize or bonus feature from inner bonus wheel <b>716</b> and a second bonus prize or bonus feature from outer bonus wheel <b>714</b>. In some implementations, the prize or feature awarded from inner bonus wheel <b>716</b> may be modified by the prize or feature awarded from outer bonus wheel <b>714</b>, such as, for example, where a multiplier feature (e.g., a free games multiplier or a credit prize multiplier) is selected from outer bonus wheel <b>714</b>, e.g., if the inner bonus wheel indicates &#x201c;10&#x201d; and the outer bonus wheel indicates &#x201c;Wilds Added,&#x201d; 10 wilds would be added.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In addition, and with reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a player may also be provided an opportunity to spin one of secondary jackpot wheels <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> in response to a determination by processor <b>60</b> that a selected stop position <b>726</b> on outer bonus wheel <b>714</b> corresponds to (or is associated with) a jackpot wheel feature, such as jackpot wheel feature <b>724</b> (step <b>608</b>).

In the example implementation, processor <b>60</b> may randomly select a secondary jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b>. In other implementations, however, a jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> may be selected, at least in part, based upon a wager amount or other factor. For example, larger wagers may increase the odds that a jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> associated with a larger jackpot (e.g., a GRAND or MAJOR jackpot) may be selected, while smaller wagers may increase the odds that a jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> associated with a smaller jackpot (e.g., a MINOR or MINI jackpot) may be selected.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In some implementations, processor <b>60</b> may substitute a plurality of bonus indicia and/or jackpot indicia, such as GRAND, MAJOR, MINOR, and MINI jackpot indicia (not shown) over the stop positions <b>720</b> arranged on inner bonus wheel <b>716</b> as part of an animation intended to illustrate selection of one of jackpot wheels <b>706</b>-<b>712</b>. However, in other implementations, the jackpot wheel selection process may not be accompanied by an animation, or it may be accompanied by a different animation. In any case, however, processor <b>60</b> may replace bonus wheel <b>704</b> with a selected secondary jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> and/or display the selected jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b>.

As shown, jackpot wheel <b>708</b> (and/or any other selected jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b>) may include a plurality of jackpot wheel segments or stop positions. Here, jackpot wheel <b>708</b> is partitioned into a plurality of stop positions <b>928</b>. In this example, only a first stop position <b>928</b><i>a </i>and a second stop position <b>928</b><i>b </i>are individually labeled, as well as three additional stop positions at the bottom of the jackpot wheel; the remaining stop positions are not labeled to avoid undue visual clutter.

In addition, although the following description is provided with reference to a jackpot award (and/or a jackpot award wheel segment/stop position), it will be appreciated that, in some implementations, and as described above, stop positions <b>928</b> may be more broadly associated with any suitable credit prize and/or bonus award.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">For example, and as shown, first stop position <b>928</b><i>a </i>is associated with a credit prize (e.g., a credit prize of 50 credits), and second stop position <b>928</b><i>b </i>is associated with a jackpot award (e.g., a MAJOR jackpot award). However, in various implementations, any suitable credit prize and/or jackpot award may be included on a selected jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b>. Specifically, in at least some implementations, a jackpot award provided at a stop position <b>928</b> may correspond to a jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> selected by processor <b>60</b>. For instance, where processor <b>60</b> selects jackpot wheel <b>706</b> (corresponding to a GRAND jackpot award), jackpot wheel <b>706</b> may include (and/or may be modified to include, as described herein) one or more stop positions associated with the GRAND jackpot award.

Jackpot wheels <b>710</b> and <b>712</b> (corresponding to MINOR and MINI jackpot awards) may also be organized and/or modified in this way.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">During gameplay, processor <b>60</b> may select one of the plurality of stop positions <b>928</b>, such as, for example, in advance of providing a credit prize and/or jackpot award associated with the stop position <b>928</b> to a player (step <b>612</b>). In various implementations, a stop position <b>928</b> may be randomly selected by processor <b>60</b>. However, in other implementations, a stop position <b>928</b> may be selected, at least in part, based upon a wager amount.

For instance, and in the example shown, first stop position <b>928</b><i>a </i>is selected by processor <b>60</b>, and the credit prize (e.g., 50 credits) associated with first stop position <b>928</b><i>a </i>is provided to the player.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, in addition to providing the credit prize associated with a selected stop position (e.g., first stop position <b>928</b><i>a</i>), processor <b>60</b> may also replace the credit prize shown at the selected stop position with a jackpot award, i.e., change the association of that stop position from an association with a second award to an association with a first award, such as a second jackpot award <b>1102</b> (step <b>614</b>). A selected stop position may thus be regarded as &#x201c;metamorphosing&#x201d; from a credit prize to a jackpot award. In this example, second stop position <b>928</b><i>a</i>, which was previously associated with a credit prize, is associated (or re-associated) with a jackpot award, such as, for example, a MAJOR jackpot award. Thus, after a first spin of jackpot wheel <b>708</b>, there are, in this example, two jackpot awards provided on the wheel <b>708</b> (e.g., the jackpot award at stop position <b>928</b><i>b </i>and jackpot award <b>1102</b> at stop position <b>928</b><i>a</i>).</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the example implementation, gameplay may continue in this manner, such that, each time a jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> is selected and spun by processor <b>60</b>, a selected credit prize is awarded to the player landing on the credit prize, and the stop position associated with the credit prize is replaced with a jackpot award. These changes to a jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> may be persistent over time, such that jackpot awards added to a particular jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> are not removed from the jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b>, even in the circumstance that a player ends a gaming session during which a particular jackpot award was added to a jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b>. In other words, a player may terminate a gaming session without affecting the jackpot awards added during the gaming session to a jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">In the example implementation, one or more jackpot awards added to a jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> may, however, be removed from the jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> in response to selection, by processor <b>60</b>, of any of the jackpot awards added to the jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b>. Specifically, one or more jackpot awards added to a jackpot wheel <b>706</b>-<b>712</b> may be removed when a player lands on or wins a particular jackpot award. For example, a player may play the bonus game described above until the jackpot award at stop position <b>928</b><i>a </i>and/or the jackpot award at stop position <b>928</b><i>b </i>is selected by processor <b>60</b> and provided to the player. In response to such an event, processor <b>60</b> may remove the jackpot awards at stop position <b>928</b><i>a </i>and stop position <b>928</b><i>b</i>. In some implementations, the jackpot award at stop position <b>928</b><i>b</i>, which was not added as a result of player activity, may not be removed by processor <b>60</b>, but may persist irrespective of an outcome on jackpot wheel <b>708</b>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Implementations of the system and method of electronic gaming, as described above, thus facilitate a bonus game in which a bonus wheel may trigger a separate jackpot wheel. The jackpot wheel may include a plurality of stop positions, many of which may be associated with one or more credit prizes. When a player lands on a stop position associated with a credit prize, the credit prize may be awarded, and the credit prize previously associated with the stop position may be replaced by (or &#x201c;metamorphose&#x201d; into) a jackpot award. As gameplay progresses, the number of jackpot awards included on the jackpot wheel may increase, such that a player's odds of winning a jackpot award also increase. In addition, jackpot awards added to a jackpot wheel may persist over time irrespective of player gaming session, such that a subsequent player may win a jackpot award added during an earlier player's gaming session. Players are encouraged, as a result, to continue gameplay, once it has begun, until a jackpot award is won.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">As indicated above, the process may be embodied in computer software.
