id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A wireless device receives a DCI indicating a first priority of a transport block and a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback timing of a HARQ feedback of the transport block. The wireless device switches, after receiving the DCI and before the HARQ feedback timing, from a first bandwidth part to a second bandwidth part as an active bandwidth part. The wireless device transmits or drops the HARQ feedback based on whether or not the first priority of the transport block comprises a first value.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure

Example transmission mechanisms may include, but are not limited to: Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Wavelet technologies, and/or the like. Hybrid transmission mechanisms such as TDMA/CDMA, and OFDM/CDMA may also be employed. Various modulation schemes may be applied for signal transmission in the physical layer. Examples of modulation schemes include, but are not limited to: phase, amplitude, code, a combination of these, and/or the like. An example radio transmission method may implement Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) using Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), 16-QAM, 64-QAM, 256-QAM, and/or the like. Physical radio transmission may be enhanced by dynamically or semi-dynamically changing the modulation and coding scheme depending on transmission requirements and radio conditions.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an example Radio Access Network (RAN) architecture as per an aspect of an embodiment of the present disclosure. As illustrated in this example, a RAN node may be a next generation Node B (gNB) (e.g. <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B) providing New Radio (NR) user plane and control plane protocol terminations towards a first wireless device (e.g. <b>110</b>A). In an example, a RAN node may be a next generation evolved Node B (ng-eNB) (e.g. <b>124</b>A, <b>124</b>B), providing Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) user plane and control plane protocol terminations towards a second wireless device (e.g. <b>110</b>B). The first wireless device may communicate with a gNB over a Uu interface. The second wireless device may communicate with a ng-eNB over a Uu interface. In this disclosure, wireless device <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B are structurally similar to wireless device <b>110</b>. Base stations <b>120</b>A and/or <b>120</b>B may be structurally similarly to base station <b>120</b>. Base station <b>120</b> may comprise at least one of a gNB (e.g. <b>122</b>A and/or <b>122</b>B), ng-eNB (e.g. <b>124</b>A and/or <b>124</b>B), and or the like.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">A gNB or an ng-eNB may host functions such as: radio resource management and scheduling, IP header compression, encryption and integrity protection of data, selection of Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) at User Equipment (UE) attachment, routing of user plane and control plane data, connection setup and release, scheduling and transmission of paging messages (originated from the AMF), scheduling and transmission of system broadcast information (originated from the AMF or Operation and Maintenance (O&#x26;M)), measurement and measurement reporting configuration, transport level packet marking in the uplink, session management, support of network slicing, Quality of Service (QoS) flow management and mapping to data radio bearers, support of UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state, distribution function for Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages, RAN sharing, and dual connectivity or tight interworking between NR and E-UTRA.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">In an example, one or more gNBs and/or one or more ng-eNBs may be interconnected with each other by means of Xn interface. A gNB or an ng-eNB may be connected by means of NG interfaces to 5G Core Network (5GC). In an example, 5GC may comprise one or more AMF/User Plan Function (UPF) functions (e.g. <b>130</b>A or <b>130</b>B). A gNB or an ng-eNB may be connected to a UPF by means of an NG-User plane (NG-U) interface.

For example, a base station may transmit higher layer signaling (e.g. RRC signaling) or MAC CE comprising parameters related to the Rx beam setting of a wireless device for monitoring PDCCH on one or more beam pair links. A base station may transmit indication of spatial QCL assumption between an DL RS antenna port(s) (for example, cell-specific CSI-RS, or wireless device-specific CSI-RS, or SS block, or PBCH with or without DM-RSs of PBCH), and DL RS antenna port(s) for demodulation of DL control channel. Signaling for beam indication for a PDCCH may be MAC CE signaling, or RRC signaling, or DCI signaling, or specification-transparent and/or implicit method, and combination of these signaling methods.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">For reception of unicast DL data channel, a base station may indicate spatial QCL parameters between DL RS antenna port(s) and DM-RS antenna port(s) of DL data channel. The base station may transmit DCI (e.g. downlink grants) comprising information indicating the RS antenna port(s). The information may indicate RS antenna port(s) which may be QCL-ed with the DM-RS antenna port(s). Different set of DM-RS antenna port(s) for a DL data channel may be indicated as QCL with different set of the RS antenna port(s).</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is an example of beam sweeping in a DL channel. In an RRC_INACTIVE state or RRC_IDLE state, a wireless device may assume that SS blocks form an SS burst <b>940</b>, and an SS burst set <b>950</b>. The SS burst set <b>950</b> may have a given periodicity. For example, in a multi-beam operation, a base station <b>120</b> may transmit SS blocks in multiple beams, together forming a SS burst <b>940</b>. One or more SS blocks may be transmitted on one beam. If multiple SS bursts <b>940</b> are transmitted with multiple beams, SS bursts together may form SS burst set <b>950</b>.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260">A wireless device may further use CSI-RS in the multi-beam operation for estimating a beam quality of a links between a wireless device and a base station. A beam may be associated with a CSI-RS. For example, a wireless device may, based on a RSRP measurement on CSI-RS, report a beam index, as indicated in a CRI for downlink beam selection, and associated with a RSRP value of a beam. A CSI-RS may be transmitted on a CSI-RS resource including at least one of one or more antenna ports, one or more time or frequency radio resources. A CSI-RS resource may be configured in a cell-specific way by common RRC signaling, or in a wireless device-specific way by dedicated RRC signaling, and/or L1/L2 signaling. Multiple wireless devices covered by a cell may measure a cell-specific CSI-RS resource. A dedicated subset of wireless devices covered by a cell may measure a wireless device-specific CSI-RS resource.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261">A CSI-RS resource may be transmitted periodically, or using aperiodic transmission, or using a multi-shot or semi-persistent transmission. For example, in a periodic transmission in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, a base station <b>120</b> may transmit configured CSI-RS resources <b>940</b> periodically using a configured periodicity in a time domain. In an aperiodic transmission, a configured CSI-RS resource may be transmitted in a dedicated time slot. In a multi-shot or semi-persistent transmission, a configured CSI-RS resource may be transmitted within a configured period. Beams used for CSI-RS transmission may have different beam width than beams used for SS-blocks transmission.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> is an example of a beam management procedure in an example new radio network.

A UE may determine an RA-RNTI at least based on an index of a first OFDM symbol and an index of a first slot of a selected PRACH occasions, and/or an uplink carrier index for a transmission of Msg1 <b>1220</b>.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0294">In an example, a UE may receive, from a base station, a random access response, Msg 2 <b>1230</b>. A UE may start a time window (e.g., ra-Response Window) to monitor a random access response. For beam failure recovery request, a base station may configure a UE with a different time window (e.g., bfr-Response Window) to monitor response on beam failure recovery request. For example, a UE may start a time window (e.g., ra-Response Window or bfr-Response Window) at a start of a first PDCCH occasion after a fixed duration of one or more symbols from an end of a preamble transmission. If a UE transmits multiple preambles, the UE may start a time window at a start of a first PDCCH occasion after a fixed duration of one or more symbols from an end of a first preamble transmission. A UE may monitor a PDCCH of a cell for at least one random access response identified by a RA-RNTI or for at least one response to beam failure recovery request identified by a C-RNTI while a timer for a time window is running.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0295">In an example, a UE may consider a reception of random access response successful if at least one random access response comprises a random access preamble identifier corresponding to a random access preamble transmitted by the UE.

If a contention free random access procedure is triggered for a beam failure recovery request, a UE may consider a contention free random access procedure successfully complete if a PDCCH transmission is addressed to a C-RNTI. In an example, if at least one random access response comprises a random access preamble identifier, a UE may consider the random access procedure successfully completed and may indicate a reception of an acknowledgement for a system information request to upper layers. If a UE has signaled multiple preamble transmissions, the UE may stop transmitting remaining preambles (if any) in response to a successful reception of a corresponding random access response.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0296">In an example, a UE may perform one or more Msg 3 <b>1240</b> transmissions in response to a successful reception of random access response (e.g., for a contention based random access procedure).

Subcarrier spacing for PUSCH transmission for Msg3 <b>1240</b> may be provided by at least one higher layer (e.g. RRC) parameter. A UE may transmit a random access preamble via PRACH and Msg3 <b>1240</b> via PUSCH on a same cell. A base station may indicate an UL BWP for a PUSCH transmission of Msg3 <b>1240</b> via system information block. A UE may employ HARQ for a retransmission of Msg 3 <b>1240</b>.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0297">In an example, multiple UEs may perform Msg 1 <b>1220</b> by transmitting a same preamble to a base station and receive, from the base station, a same random access response comprising an identity (e.g., TC-RNTI). Contention resolution <b>1250</b> may ensure that a UE does not incorrectly use an identity of another UE. For example, contention resolution <b>1250</b> may be based on C-RNTI on PDCCH or a UE contention resolution identity on DL-SCH. For example, if a base station assigns a C-RNTI to a UE, the UE may perform contention resolution <b>1250</b> based on a reception of a PDCCH transmission that is addressed to the C-RNTI. In response to detection of a C-RNTI on a PDCCH, a UE may consider contention resolution <b>1250</b> successful and may consider a random access procedure successfully completed. If a UE has no valid C-RNTI, a contention resolution may be addressed by employing a TC-RNTI. For example, if a MAC PDU is successfully decoded and a MAC PDU comprises a UE contention resolution identity MAC CE that matches the CCCH SDU transmitted in Msg3 <b>1250</b>, a UE may consider the contention resolution <b>1250</b> successful and may consider the random access procedure successfully completed.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0298"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an example structure for MAC entities as per an aspect of an embodiment.
