Specifically, the signal machine in this embodiment may be a traffic signal light located at a road intersection. The traffic light corresponds to a plurality of phases, which correspond to, for example, 8 phases, namely, north straight, north left, south straight, south left, west straight, west left, east straight and east left, for controlling the traffic at the road intersection.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this embodiment, the light-state data stream acquired by performing S<b>101</b> includes a plurality of light-state data frames arranged in chronological order. Each light-state data frame includes light-state information of all phases of the signal machine at corresponding times. The light-state information of each phase includes information such as a light color state and a light color countdown of the phase at a corresponding time.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this embodiment, after S<b>101</b> is performed to acquire the light-state data stream, S<b>102</b> is performed to determine a target light-state data frame in the light-state data stream and a target time of the target light-state data frame.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this embodiment, the light-state data stream acquired by performing S<b>101</b> may include a wrong light-state data frame. For example, a light-state data frame at a certain time is obtained by copying a light-state data frame at a previous time. Therefore, in this embodiment, S<b>102</b> is performed to determine a target light-state data frame in the light-state data stream. that is, a correct light-state data frame is found from the light-state data stream.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Specifically, in this embodiment, when S<b>102</b> is performed to determine a target light-state data frame in the light-state data stream, the following optional implementation manner may be adopted: selecting two light-state data frames from the light-state data stream; comparing the two light-state data frames selected, wherein light-state information of all phases included in the two light-state data frames are specifically compared; and taking the latter of the two light-state data frames as the target light-state data frame in a case where a comparison result is the two light-state data frames being inconsistent with each other. That is, the light-state data frame further back in time in the two light-state data frames is taken as the target light-state data frame.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this embodiment, when S<b>102</b> is performed to select two light-state data frames from the light-state data stream, the following optional implementation manner may be adopted: setting a window of a preset length, wherein the preset length in this embodiment may be 2, indicating that each window includes two light-state data frames; sliding the window in the light-state data stream at a preset step size, wherein the preset step size in this embodiment may be 1, that is, the window is slid to the latest time at an interval of 1 second; and selecting a first light-state data frame and a last light-state data frame located in the window.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, in this embodiment, when S<b>102</b> is performed to select two light-state data frames from the light-state data stream, any two adjacent light-state data frames may be selected, or a light-state data frame at a current time and a light-state data frame at a previous time may be selected.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this embodiment, after S<b>102</b> is performed to determine the target light-state data frame, the target time of the target light-state data frame is determined. In this embodiment, the target time determined by performing S<b>102</b> is a time at which the signal machine sends the target light-state data frame.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this embodiment, after S<b>102</b> is performed to determine the target light-state data frame and the target time corresponding thereto, S<b>103</b> is performed to acquire a timing scheme of the signal machine.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this embodiment, the timing scheme acquired by performing S<b>103</b> is configured to allow the signal machine to control a light color and a light color countdown of each phase. The acquired timing scheme includes information such as a preset light color sequence of each phase and a preset duration of each light color.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">If the timing scheme of the signal machine does not change under any circumstance, in this embodiment, when S<b>103</b> is performed, a preset timing scheme may be directly acquired as the timing scheme of the signal machine.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">However, in an actual scenario, traffic conditions at road intersections may change rapidly, and in order to better control the traffic conditions at the road intersections, the timing scheme of the signal machine may also change constantly. Since the timing scheme of may affect the accuracy of the generated correct light-state data frame, in this embodiment, a timing scheme corresponding to the determined target light-state data frame is required to be acquired.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In order to further improve the accuracy of the generated correct light-state data frame, in this embodiment, when S<b>103</b> is performed to acquire the timing scheme of the signal machine, the following optional implementation manner may be adopted: acquiring the timing scheme of the signal machine at the determined target time. That is, this embodiment can ensure correlation between the acquired timing scheme and the determined target light-state data frame.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this embodiment, after S<b>103</b> is performed to acquire the timing scheme of the signal machine, S<b>104</b> is performed to generate, according to the acquired timing scheme and the target light-state data frame, at least one light-state data frame at a time before and/or after the determined target time. In this embodiment, the light-state data frames generated by performing S<b>104</b> are correct light-state data frames corresponding to various times.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">That is, in this embodiment, the at least one light-state data frame at the time before and/or after the determined target time is generated by combining the target light-state data frame and the timing scheme. Since the generated light-state data frame includes correct light-state information of each phase, a purpose of accurately restoring and/or accurately predicting the light-state data frame can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Specifically, in this embodiment, when S<b>104</b> is performed to generate, according to the timing scheme and the target light-state data frame, at least one light-state data frame at a time before and/or after the determined target time, the following optional implementation manner may be adopted: determining, for each phase, a preset light color sequence and a preset duration of each light color of the phase in the timing scheme; obtaining a light color state and a light color countdown of the phase at a time before and/or after the target time according to the preset light color sequence and the preset duration of each light color as well as a light color state and a light color countdown of the phase in the target light-state data frame; and generating, according to light color states and light color countdowns of phases at a same time, the at least one light-state data frame at the time before and/or after the target time.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this embodiment, when S<b>104</b> is performed to generate at least one light-state data frame at a time before and/or after the determined target time, a preset number of light-state data frames at the time before and/or after the target time. for example, light-state data frames located in a window are restored in a manner of setting the window where the light-state data frames are located.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this embodiment, the light-state data frames generated by performing S<b>104</b> are correct light-state data frames. Therefore, for a same time, light-state data frames in the light-state data stream that are inconsistent with the generated light-state data frames are replaced with the generated light-state data frames, to achieve a purpose of correcting the acquired light-state data stream, thereby improving accuracy of the light-state data stream.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition, in this embodiment, after S<b>104</b> is performed to generate at least one light-state data frame, the generated light-state data frames may also be sorted directly in chronological order, so as to take a sorting result as a correct light-state data stream.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As can be seen from the above technical solutions, in this embodiment, after a target light-state data frame in a light-state data stream of a signal machine is determined, at least one light-state data frame at a time before and/or after a target time of the target light-state data frame may be generated in combination with a timing scheme of the signal machine, which achieves a purpose of restoring and/or predicting light-state data frames in the light-state data stream and can improve accuracy of the light-state data frames in the light-state data stream, thereby correspondingly improving utilization of the light-state data stream.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a second embodiment according to the present disclosure.
