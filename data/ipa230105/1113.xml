id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A dry powder inhaler includes a powder storage element configured to hold a powdered medicament and an inlet channel receives, powdered medicament from the powder storage element that is entrained in an airflow. The inlet channel has a first diameter and defines an opening. The inhaler includes a dispersion chamber that receives the airflow and the powdered medicament from the opening. The dispersion chamber has a second diameter. The inhaler includes an actuator housed within the dispersion chamber. The actuator oscillates within the dispersion chamber when exposed to the airflow to deaggregate the powdered medicament entrained by the airflow passing through the dispersion chamber. A ratio between the first diameter and the second diameter is between about 0.40 and 0.60 such that an audible sound is produced as the actuator oscillates. The inhaler includes an outlet channel through which the airflow and powdered medicament exit the inhaler.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img

In many instances, inhalers with relatively uncomplicated flow paths may be characterized by poor efficiency, as generally less than 30% of the nominal dose is delivered to the deep lung. Alternatively, inhalers with relatively more complex internal flow paths, may provide increased efficiency, such as less than or equal to 40% of the nominal dose, though the increased complexity of the internal flow path may lead to increased deposition within the inhaler, effectively lowering the overall dose delivered to the patient and contaminating the device. In addition, most dry powder inhalers available today have no means of providing feedback to the user that they have used the device correctly. Incorrect use may cause poor inhaler performance.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This Summary does not in any way limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to a powder dispersion mechanism that is compact, breath-actuated, provides audio feedback, and that is effective or sufficient at promoting efficient particle dispersion across a range of doses such as from, for example, low microgram doses to doses requiring many milligrams. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a powder dispersion mechanism is disclosed that employs an actuator contained within a dispersion chamber. An actuator is an element in the inhaler that may oscillate, generally linearly in certain embodiments, along an axis of the dispersion chamber when the patient inhales through the device, such that the actuator does not require an energy source other than a patient's inspiratory maneuver to function. This actuator may take various forms or shapes including a sphere, ball, or bead-like shape. However, the actuator is not limited to this and may take any appropriate shape that results in oscillation. In some embodiments, the powder dispersion mechanism may include a predominantly straight flow path, and may be breath-actuated. This may be referred to as &#x201c;passive&#x201d; actuator activation or actuation. During actuator oscillation the actuator may make an audible sound that could provide feedback for the user of the inhaler. However, the present disclosure is not so limiting. For example, actuator activation may be &#x201c;active,&#x201d; where an external energy source is coupled with the patient's inhalation flow stream to induce actuator oscillation. One or more features of the inhaler may be such that a flow profile is generated within the dispersion chamber that prevents or at least minimizes unintended deposition or accumulation of powder within the chamber.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an aspect, a dry powder inhaler is disclosed.

The dispersion chamber may hold an actuator that is movable within the dispersion chamber along a longitudinal axis. The dry powder inhaler may include an outlet channel through which air and powdered medicament exit the inhaler to be delivered to a patient. A geometry of the inhaler may be such that a flow profile is generated within the dispersion chamber that causes the actuator to oscillate along the longitudinal axis, enabling the oscillating actuator to effectively disperse powdered medicament received in the dispersion chamber for delivery to the patient through the outlet channel.

id="p-0046" num="0045">The present disclosure relates to the field of pulmonary drug or medicament delivery, and more specifically to dry powder inhalers that deliver a powder or medicament into the lungs of a patient. Such a powder dispersion mechanism may comprise of an actuator positioned within a chamber that is arranged and configured to induce a sudden, rapid, or otherwise abrupt expansion of a flow stream upon entering the chamber. During actuator oscillation the actuator may make an audible sound or response that could provide feedback to the user of the inhaler. Characteristics of the audible response may be adjusted based on various geometric properties of an inhaler, as well as material selection. Additionally, at least the chamber may be formed to exhibit one or more features that prevent or at least minimize the accumulation or build-up of powder in the chamber with the actuator. This may advantageously prevent the delivery of a macro dose of powder to a patient that may occur when, an unintended deposit or residue of powder is broken-up or released during use. An actuator is an element in the inhaler that may oscillate, generally linearly in certain embodiments, along an axis of the dispersion chamber when the patient inhales through the device, such that the actuator does not require an energy source other than a patient's inspiratory maneuver to function. This actuator may take various forms or shapes including a sphere, ball, or bead-like shape. However, the actuator is not limited to this and may take any appropriate shape that results in oscillation.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Embodiments provide dry powder inhalers configured to produce an audible sound or feedback while delivering acceptable aerosol performance. The audible feedback is sufficiently loud that a user of the inhaler may be alerted when inhalations meet or exceed a minimum amount of flow. Suitable audio sound may be obtained by configuring a ratio (d<sub>inlet</sub>/d<sub>chamber</sub>) Of an internal diameter of an inlet (d<sub>inlet</sub>) of the inhaler to an internal diameter of a dispersion chamber of the inhaler (d<sub>chamber</sub>) to be within a certain range, by configuring a ratio (l<sub>chamber</sub>/d<sub>bead</sub>) of a length of the dispersion chamber (l<sub>chamber</sub>) relative to a diameter of the actuator or bead (d<sub>bead</sub>) of the inhaler to be within a certain range or by certain combinations of both (d<sub>inlet</sub>/d<sub>chamber</sub>) and (l<sub>chamber</sub>/d<sub>bead</sub>). These ratios may be specifically selected so that they provide an acceptable audio sound while also ensuring proper aerosol performance (so that the powder can reach the deep lung).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a cross-section of a first example tubular body <b>100</b> having an inlet <b>102</b> and a dispersion chamber <b>104</b> is shown according to the principles of the present disclosure. In this example, a fluid flow path of the inlet <b>102</b> is defined by a first internal diameter <b>106</b>, and a fluid flow path of the chamber <b>104</b> is defined by a second internal diameter <b>108</b>. Although shown approximately constant in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at least one of the first internal diameter <b>106</b> and the second internal diameter <b>108</b> may vary in dimension as defined with respect to a longitudinal axis L of the tubular body <b>100</b>. Further, one or more apertures may be formed within the tubular body <b>100</b> at particular locations to allow a secondary air supply to enter the tubular body <b>100</b> during use to prevent or at least minimize the unintended accumulation or build-up of powder within the tubular body <b>100</b> for example the apertures <b>1310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more internal surfaces of the tubular body <b>100</b> may be formed to exhibit rounded or curved features to prevent or at least minimize the unintended accumulation or build-up of powder within the tubular body <b>100</b>. In addition to providing desirable fluid flow characteristics, as discussed further below, such configurable internal features or dimensions of the tubular body may be defined so as to provide for a draft angle for injection molding. In some embodiments, an injection molding technique or process may be used to fabricate at least the tubular body <b>100</b> of the present disclosure, including like features or elements discussed in further detail below. Other embodiments are possible.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, the first internal diameter <b>106</b> may taper inwardly, towards and as measured with reference to the longitudinal axis L, beginning approximately at a reference point L<b>1</b> of the longitudinal axis L and ending approximately at a reference point L<b>2</b> of the longitudinal axis L. Other embodiments are, possible. For example, the first internal diameter <b>106</b> may taper inwardly towards the longitudinal axis L beginning approximately at the reference point L<b>2</b>, and ending approximately at the reference point L<b>1</b>. In another embodiment, the second internal diameter <b>108</b> may taper inwardly towards the longitudinal axis L beginning approximately at the reference point L<b>3</b> and ending approximately at the reference point L<b>2</b>. Still other embodiments are possible.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, it is contemplated that an internal structural profile of at least one of the inlet <b>102</b> and the chamber <b>104</b> may be defined, as desired, such as to obtain or otherwise realize particular fluid flow characteristics within the tubular body <b>100</b>. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the tubular body <b>100</b> may be arranged and configured such that a sudden flow stream expansion may occur when the relatively &#x201c;small&#x201d; cross-sectional fluid flow path of or defined by the inlet <b>102</b> opens abruptly into a &#x201c;larger&#x201d; cross-sectional fluid flow path of or defined by the chamber <b>104</b>. In this example, high-energy forces may develop within the chamber <b>104</b>. In one aspect, this may be due to relatively &#x201c;low&#x201d; pressure regions induced by relatively &#x201c;high&#x201d; velocity fluid entering the chamber <b>104</b>, where a portion of the flow stream detaches and recirculation eddies may occur. Other mechanisms may contribute to the development of high-energy fluid flow within the chamber <b>104</b> as well. Further, such high-energy fluid flow, along with mechanical impact forces, may disrupt and aerosolize medicament powder agglomerates within the chamber <b>104</b> to provide for more effective deposition of medicament into the lungs of a patient. Still other embodiments of the example tubular body <b>100</b> are possible as well. For example, in some embodiments, a difference between the reference point L<b>1</b> of the longitudinal axis L and the reference point L<b>2</b> may approach zero (0). In this example, the tubular body <b>100</b> may consist only of the chamber <b>104</b>. Here, instead of an &#x201c;inlet tube,&#x201d; the tubular body <b>100</b> may consist of an &#x201c;inlet hole&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The geometry of the inlet to the dispersion chamber plays a critical role in the resistance of the inhaler. The resistance (R) is a relationship between the pressure drop across the device at a given flow and is defined as</p><p id="p-0052" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>R</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <msqrt>     <mtext> </mtext>    </msqrt>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mi>&#x394;</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mi>P</mi>   </mrow>   <mi>Q</mi>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0053" num="0000">where &#x394;P is the pressure drop across the device (cm H<sub>2</sub>O) and Q is the flow (LPM) at the given &#x394;P. One embodiment includes a conical or conical frustrum inlet <b>1002</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Experiments have shown that a conical frustrum inlet significantly reduces the resistance of the inhaler compared to a tube or inlet hole geometry. An experiment was conducted comparing different inlet geometries with the same inlet <b>106</b> and dispersion chamber diameter <b>108</b> as defined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. (1) conical frustrum inlet, (2) tubular inlet, and (3) inlet hole. The inlet diameter <b>106</b> was 2.72 mm and the chamber diameter <b>108</b> was 5.89 mm and a 4 mm spherical bead was used as the actuator. The length of the chamber from L<b>2</b> to L<b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> was 10 mm. The conical frustrum inlet was shown to have a significantly lower resistance than the tubular inlet and inlet hole design as shown in TABLE 1. The geometry of the inlet shape at reference point L<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can be non-circular in shape such as: triangular, square, polygon, or elliptical. For example, a first distal shape at L<b>1</b> may taper to a smaller second proximal shape at L<b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the first shape and the second shape may be the same and in other embodiments the first shape and the second shape may be different. A tapering inlet with a square geometry at L<b>2</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref> shows a front view of an inlet chamber <b>1602</b> and a dispersion chamber <b>1604</b> according to one embodiment. A distal opening of inlet chamber <b>1602</b> is shown as a circular opening, but may be any other shape. The inlet chamber <b>1602</b> tapers, as seen in the side cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref>, to a smaller shape <b>1606</b> near the dispersion chamber <b>1604</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>, smaller shape <b>1606</b> may be any shape, such as a square, rectangle, circle, or triangle. Another experiment was conducted comparing the resistance of several different tapering inlets with varying geometries at reference point L<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The geometry at reference point L<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> was a circle while the geometry at reference point L<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> was varied to include an equilateral triangle, square, ellipse, and circle. The inlet area was held constant to match that of a circular inlet diameter of 3.30 mm which results in an open area of 8.55 mm<sup>2</sup>. A 4 mm spherical bead was used as an actuator in the chamber, the chamber diameter <b>108</b> was 5.89 mm, and the length of the chamber was 10 mm for this test. The results are shown in TABLE 2, the square inlet had 10% lower resistance than the circular inlet. It was noted that the square inlet produced a similar audio sound from the actuator in terms of volume to the circular inlet. There may be added benefits to non-circular inlet shape designs to the dispersion chamber such as increased turbulence for better dispersion of powders. Lowering the resistance of the chamber is important because it increases the flow through the chamber for a given pressure drop. Increasing the flow may in turn increase the speed and/or frequency of the actuator oscillations which could be an important characteristic for efficient powder dispersion.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="133pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Geometry</entry><entry>Resistance (cm H<sub>2</sub>O)<sup>0.5</sup>/LPM</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Conical Frustrum</entry><entry>0.178</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Tubular</entry><entry>0.242</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Inlet hole</entry><entry>0.238</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0055" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="133pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Inlet shape</entry><entry>Resistance (cm H<sub>2</sub>O)<sup>0.5</sup>/LPM</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Circle</entry><entry>0.131</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Equilateral triangle</entry><entry>0.284</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Square</entry><entry>0.115</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Ellipse</entry><entry>0.122</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0056" num="0051">Referring now additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the tubular body <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is shown in multiple views. In particular, the tubular body <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is shown in perspective view <b>202</b>, side view <b>204</b>, and cross-section view <b>206</b>. In this example, the cross-section view <b>206</b> is taken along an axis A-A of the side view <b>204</b>. Additionally, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the fluid flow path of or defined by the inlet <b>102</b> is coaxially aligned with the fluid flow path of or defined by the chamber <b>104</b>. This is in contrast with a substantially &#x201c;off-axis&#x201d; alignment of the inlet <b>102</b> and the chamber <b>104</b>, illustrated conceptually in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> by a finite angle B defined with respect to the longitudinal axis L. A coaxial alignment may provide a number of advantages over such an &#x201c;off-axis&#x201d; alignment, such as facilitating or otherwise assisting in the development of high-energy forces within the chamber <b>104</b>. The coaxial alignment may further enable the efficient transfer of powder into the chamber <b>104</b>. However, other embodiments are possible. For example, in some embodiments, a central longitudinal axis of the inlet <b>102</b> may be at least slightly offset, yet parallel to a central longitudinal axis of the chamber <b>104</b>. Other benefits and/or advantages associated with the alignment of the inlet <b>102</b> and the chamber <b>104</b> may be understood from the preceding description provided in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, and from the following description provided in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>14</b></figref>. Although the inlet may be &#x201c;off-axis&#x201d; in alignment, the principal component of flow is in the axial direction. Furthermore, swirling or centrifugal flow into the inlet is detrimental to the oscillation of the bead. An experiment was performed using an embodiment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>. This embodiment has air inlets that are tangential to flow through the chamber <b>104</b> and they are shaped to induce a swirling or tangential flow which promotes capsule emptying. A grid is in place <b>2406</b> and it acts as a flow straightener similar to a honeycomb flow straightener. Two different grids were tested (1) a tightly-spaced grid <b>2800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>A</figref> and (2) simple 2-piece grid structure <b>2802</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>B</figref>. The tightly-spaced grid <b>2800</b> straightens and aligns the flow in axial direction similar to a honeycomb flow straightener used in wind tunnels. The tightly-spaced grid <b>2800</b> aligns the flow along the axis <b>204</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The simple 2-piece grid <b>2802</b> provides little to no straightening of the flow. It was found that using the simple 2-piece grid <b>2802</b> prevented a spherical bead from oscillating under any flow conditions. The bead remained hovering near the inlet and did not oscillate.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0052">For example, referring now additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an actuator which could be shaped as a spherical bead <b>302</b> may be positioned within the chamber <b>104</b> of the tubular body <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>. In this example, the bead <b>302</b> may be approximately spherical, at least on the macroscale, and oscillate in a manner similar to that described in U.S. application Ser. No. 13/469,963, filed 11 May 2012, and entitled &#x201c;Bead-Containing Dry Powder Inhaler,&#x201d; the complete disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. In some embodiments the actuator may be aspherical, or other shapes which may improve oscillation characteristics of the actuator. Further, a relationship between the diameter <b>304</b> of the actuator or bead <b>302</b>, the first internal diameter <b>106</b> of the inlet <b>102</b>, and the second internal diameter <b>108</b> of the chamber <b>104</b> may be of the form: (d<sub>bead</sub>)<sup>2</sup>=(d<sub>inlet</sub>)(d<sub>chamber</sub>) where d<sub>bead </sub>and d<sub>inlet </sub>and d<sub>chamber </sub>are of similar order of magnitude. For example, in one embodiment d<sub>bead </sub>may be about 4.00 mm, d<sub>chamber </sub>may be about 5.89 mm, and d<sub>inlet </sub>may be about 2.72 mm within manufacturing tolerance. In this example, a length of the chamber <b>104</b>, l<sub>chamber</sub>, such as defined by a distance approximately between the reference point L<b>2</b> and the reference point L<b>3</b> of the longitudinal axis L (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), may be 2 to 3.5 times the diameter <b>304</b> of the bead <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0053">In some embodiments, a diameter of the bead <b>302</b> may be within a range of about 0.5 mm to about 15 mm. In some embodiments, a preferred diameter of the bead <b>302</b> may be within a range of about 1.5 mm to about 6 mm. Still other embodiments are possible. In some embodiments, a preferred ratio of the internal diameter <b>106</b> of the inlet <b>102</b> to that of the chamber <b>104</b> (d<sub>inlet</sub>/d<sub>chamber</sub>) may be within a range of about 0.40 to about 0.66 with a preferred range of 0.46-0.60, and even more preferred range of 0.50-0.60 or 0.53-0.60. In some embodiments, it may be preferred that the length of the chamber <b>104</b>, l<sub>chamber</sub>, is about 2 times to about 5 times the diameter of the bead <b>302</b>. In other embodiments, it may be preferred that the length of the chamber <b>104</b>, l<sub>chamber</sub>, is about 2 to about 3.5 times the diameter of the bead <b>302</b>. In other embodiments, it may be preferred that the length of the chamber <b>104</b>, l<sub>chamber</sub>, is about 2 to about 2.5 times the diameter of the bead <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0054">In example embodiments, the length of the chamber <b>104</b> may determine whether the actuator <b>302</b> freely oscillates, without physical interaction with ends of the chamber <b>104</b>. Actuator oscillation that frequently impacts the chamber ends may not be desirable as it may generate particulate matter which can inhaled by the patient. In this manner, the length of the chamber <b>104</b> may facilitate free oscillation of the actuator <b>302</b>. A substantially &#x201c;freely&#x201d; oscillating actuator <b>302</b> may even more effectively disrupt and aerosolize powder agglomerates within the chamber <b>104</b>, as passed from the source, to provide for more effective deposition of medicament into the lungs of a patient.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0055">For example, a study was performed to evaluate the length of the chamber <b>104</b> and to determine whether a particular length of chamber <b>104</b> would allow the actuator, a spherical bead <b>302</b>, to &#x201c;freely&#x201d; oscillate within the chamber <b>104</b>. In particular, using a device similar to the device <b>400</b>, a spherical bead actuator of fixed diameter, about 4 mm, was used across the study. The length of the chamber however was varied as 1.5&#xd7;, 2.0&#xd7;, 3.0&#xd7;, 3.5&#xd7;, 4.0&#xd7;, and 9.8&#xd7; diameter of the bead. In this manner, the study included evaluating at least six different device configurations. In general, it was found that oscillation of the bead within the chamber was similar for lengths up to and including 3 5&#xd7; diameter of the spherical bead, yet varied for lengths 4.0&#xd7; and 9.8&#xd7; diameter of the bead. For example, a similar flow rate through the device was needed to allow the spherical bead to &#x201c;freely&#x201d; oscillate within the chamber at least for chamber lengths of 2.0&#xd7; and 3.0&#xd7; diameter of the bead. However, a &#x201c;higher&#x201d; flow rate was needed to allow the bead to &#x201c;freely&#x201d; oscillate within the chamber for a chamber length of 4.0&#xd7; diameter of the bead. Further the spherical bead did not appear to &#x201c;freely&#x201d; oscillate within the chamber for a chamber length of 9.8&#xd7; diameter of the spherical bead, for any flow rate through the device. At this chamber length, the spherical bead may not be fully influenced by the negative pressure field formed at the inlet of the device by the airflow through the sudden diameter expansion. Other mechanisms may be possible as well.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0056">In another example, a study was performed to evaluate the length of the chamber <b>104</b> and to determine whether a particular diameter of the spherical bead actuator <b>302</b>, for a fixed length of the chamber <b>104</b>, would allow the actuator <b>302</b> to &#x201c;freely&#x201d; oscillate within the chamber <b>104</b>. In particular, using a device similar to the device <b>400</b>, a chamber of fixed length and diameter, about 10 mm length and about 6 mm diameter, was used across the study. The diameter of the spherical bead however was varied as 3.7 mm, 4 mm, and 4.7 mm. In this manner, the study included evaluating at least three different bead configurations. In general, it was found that oscillation of the bead within the chamber for a 4 mm bead did &#x201c;freely&#x201d; oscillate within the chamber at a first particular flow rate. At this flow rate for this device configuration, a distinct audible sound produced by oscillation of the bead within the chamber may be observed. Operation and characteristics of the device <b>400</b> having a 4 mm bead diameter is discussed in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0057">Further, it was found that oscillation of the spherical bead within the chamber for a 3.7 mm bead did &#x201c;freely&#x201d; oscillate within the chamber <b>104</b> at or about the first particular flow rate. However, a flow rate greater than the first particular flow rate was needed to observe an audible sound similar to the distinct audible sound produced by oscillation of the spherical bead within the chamber for the 4 mm bead. Here, a greater flow rate may be required to produce the audible sound due to a reduced effective cross-sectional area of the 3.7 mm bead, as compared to the 4 mm bead. Other mechanisms may be possible as well. Further, it was found that oscillation of the bead within the chamber for a 4.7 mm bead did not &#x201c;freely&#x201d; oscillate within the chamber at or about the first particular flow rate. Here, the effective cross-sectional area of the 4.7 mm bead may be too large such as to prohibit &#x201c;free&#x201d; oscillation within the chamber. Other mechanisms may be possible as well.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0058">As described above, the actuator when oscillating can make an audible sound. The sound resulting from the oscillation of the actuator can be utilized as feedback to the user of the inhaler to confirm they have performed the inhalation maneuver correctly. In general the volume of actuator sound increases with flow, which can encourage the user to perform a deep forceful inhalation. The sound of the actuator is strongly related to the length of the chamber and the preferred range is 2.0-3.5&#xd7; the bead diameter, with 2 to about 2.5<b>33</b>  the diameter of the actuator <b>302</b> being most preferred. Experiments have, shown that for chamber lengths less than 2.0&#xd7; the actuator diameter the actuator oscillates freely but does not produce any significant sound. An experiment was performed to compare the sound from an oscillating bead with a chamber length of 1.5&#xd7; and 2.5&#xd7; bead diameter. The chambers for both used d<sub>bead</sub>=4 mm, d<sub>inlet</sub>=2.72 mm d<sub>chamber</sub>=5.89 mm. The sound of 1.5 and 2.5&#xd7; chamber length was recorded using a microphone and analyzed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. The 2.5&#xd7; chamber length produced an audible sound from bead oscillation from 1-4 kPa. The audible sound level in general increased with the pressure and flow through the chamber. The 1.5&#xd7; chamber length showed minimal increase in audible sound from 1-4 kPa compared to the 2.5&#xd7; chamber length. A further experiment was performed to evaluate the sound of a bead using different (d<sub>inlet</sub>/d<sub>chamber</sub>) ratios. Two chambers were tested with d<sub>chamber</sub>=5.89 mm, and l<sub>chamber</sub>=10 mm, one had an inlet diameter of 2.72 mm and the other 3.10 mm resulting in 0.46 and 0.53 (d<sub>inlet</sub>/d<sub>chamber</sub>) ratios respectively. The level of the audible sound resulting from the oscillating bead was recorded at 1, 2, and 4 kPa using a microphone. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B</figref>, the sound profile vs. time over roughly 20 seconds from the larger inlet (d<sub>inlet</sub>/d<sub>chamber</sub>=0.53) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref> was both louder and more consistent at 1, 2, and 4 kPa. The smaller inlet to chamber ratio (0.46) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref> showed significant periods of little sound resulting in an intermittent sound. A louder and more consistent sound is desirable for the audio feedback to the user. An intermittent sound such as that exhibited by (d<sub>inlet</sub>/d<sub>chamber</sub>)=0.46 may provide confusing feedback to the user as the sound is intermittent. The sound from bead oscillation could be used to provide valuable user feedback alerting the user that they have achieved the flow necessary for aerosol delivery. In some embodiments the sound of the bead could be analyzed by a microphone incorporated in the inhaler to determine if the patient reached a minimum flow rate for a period of time. This sound from the microphone could be processed and provide useful information to the patient and train them to achieve the necessary flow rate and time of inhalation for proper use of the inhaler. Furthermore this mechanism could be utilized as a patient compliance monitoring system to report when the inhaler was used and if the patient achieved the flow rate and volume necessary for powder delivery.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0059">Continuing with the above dimensional example, the length of the chamber <b>104</b> may thus be about 10 mm for a 4 mm diameter bead. In this example, and when the ratio relationship between the diameters of the bead <b>302</b>, the inlet <b>102</b>, and the chamber <b>104</b> is observed, the bead <b>302</b> may oscillate within the chamber <b>104</b> generally without experiencing continuous physical collisions with either end of the chamber <b>104</b>. An experiment was performed to determine the frequency of bead collision with the ends of the chamber. Two clear chambers were machined from acrylic for use with a 4 mm bead (d<sub>chamber</sub>=5.89 mm, l<sub>chamber</sub>=10 mm, d<sub>inlet</sub>=2.72 mm and 3.10 mm) and the bead motion was recorded at 1200 frames/second for 5 seconds using a high speed camera. The video was analyzed, to track the bead through the entire video. The center of the bead was plotted for all frames as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref> show pressure drops of 1, 2, and 4 kPa, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-C</figref> show pressure drops of 1, 2, and 4 kPa, respectively. A polygon (<b>1900</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and <b>2000</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-C</figref>, respectively) was drawn such that if the center of the bead was inside the polygon no contact is made with the ends of the chamber. It was found through high speed video observation bead never made contact with either end of the chamber from 1-4 kPa pressure drop for either inlet size. Such an arrangement may further facilitate development of high energy forces within the chamber <b>104</b> to more efficiently disrupt and aerosolize medicament powder agglomerates within the chamber <b>104</b> for more effective deposition of medicament into the lungs of a patient. Such an arrangement may further facilitate development of high energy forces within the chamber <b>104</b> to more efficiently disrupt and aerosolize medicament powder agglomerates within the chamber <b>104</b> for more effective deposition of medicament into the lungs of a patient.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0060">In general, high-energy forces may refer to dispersive forces that may strip drug from the bead <b>302</b>, and deaggregation or deagglomeration forces that may break-up or break-apart aggregates in powder fed into the chamber <b>104</b>. Here, the terms deaggregation or deagglomeration, and aggregation or agglomeration may be used interchangeably. The high-energy forces may be generated by the bead <b>302</b> when rapidly oscillating within the chamber <b>104</b> via formation of turbulence and eddies within the chamber <b>104</b>, compression and decompression zones within the chamber <b>104</b>, and the like. In some instances the bead may be spinning on its axis as well as oscillating along the axial length of the chamber. This may more effectively disrupt and aerosolize powder agglomerates within the chamber through the Magnus effect exerted by the spinning bead. The Magnus effect is a generation of a sidewise force on a spinning cylindrical or spherical solid immersed in a fluid (liquid or gas) when there is relative motion between the spinning body and the fluid.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0061">When a DPF (Dry Powder Formulation) is passed through the chamber <b>104</b> containing the bead <b>302</b>, which is oscillating &#x201c;rapidly&#x201d; such as, for example, at a frequency greater than ab out 10 Hz, these high frequency oscillations of the bead <b>302</b> may produce high-energy forces within the chamber <b>104</b>. This may disrupt agglomerates of drug particles that may be held together at least by cohesive forces, such as by van der Waals forces, static electrical forces, etc. Additionally, physical collisions between the bead <b>302</b>, when rapidly oscillating, and potentially aggregated or agglomerated powder particles as they pass through the chamber <b>104</b> may promote de-aggregation of the agglomerates. The oscillation frequency may typically be between about 1 to about 1,000 Hz, and may preferably be between about 10 to about 500 Hz, although other frequencies may also occur. However, in some cases, the oscillation frequency could be up to about 2,000 Hz.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0062">As mentioned above, the example bead <b>302</b> disposed within the example chamber <b>104</b> may oscillate in a manner similar to that described in U.S. application Ser. No. 13/469,963, filed 11 May 2012, entitled &#x201c;Bead-Containing Dry Powder Inhaler.&#x201d; However, in accordance with the present disclosure, the bead <b>302</b> may not include a pre-coated powder on its surface. Rather, powder may be separately introduced into the chamber <b>104</b> from a receptacle or powder storage element, such as dose containment or dosing chamber which can include but is not limited to capsules, reservoir, and blisters, or other temporary holding compartment or region, or from another dry powder inhaler, as described further below. With this configuration, the powder may be initially placed into a dose containment chamber. When a patient inhales from a mouthpiece, air may be drawn through the dose containment chamber which moves the powder into the chamber <b>104</b>, where it encounters the bead <b>302</b> oscillating primarily along the longitudinal axis L (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0063">In some embodiments, however, the bead <b>302</b> may be coated with drug. This may act as a detachment platform for the drug coated on its surface, as well as a dispersion mechanism for drug formulation located and introduced upstream of the bead. For example, for a combination drug product, such as delivering two or more drugs in a single inhalation maneuver, where one drug is delivered in a larger dose, such as an inhaled corticosteroid, than the other drug, such as a long-acting beta-agonist, the lower dose drug may be coated onto the surface of the bead <b>302</b>, while the larger dose drug is located in a dose containment container, such as a capsule, blister, reservoir, etc., upstream of the chamber <b>104</b> containing the drug-coated bead. Thus, during inhalation, oscillation of the bead <b>302</b> may serve as a detachment platform to the drug adhered to its surface, and as a dispersion mechanism to the powder that is located upstream.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0064">Additionally, the bead <b>302</b> may be coated with a layer of durable material. An example of such a material may include, but is not limited to, gelatin, sugars, any pharmaceutically acceptable film coating materials, including polymers, metallic coatings, anti-static coatings, plasma coatings, etc. This may be beneficial for example when bead material can erode or fragment. In this example, the layer thickness may depend on the density of the material to be added, such that the addition of the coated layer does not eliminate or substantially impair or inhibit the ability of the bead <b>302</b> to oscillate within the chamber <b>104</b>. The bead may have various surface finish ranging from Ra (&#x3bc;m) 0.012-50, where R<sub>a </sub>is the average surface roughness. The surface finish may affect bead motion and in turn may improve the dispersion and aerosolization of powder agglomerates within the chamber.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0065">Using the bead <b>302</b> as a dispersion mechanism may provide a number of advantages. For example, by employing the oscillating bead in a chamber in the capacity of a dispersion engine, large doses such as, for example, about 1 mg to about 25 mg or greater, may be delivered by delivering them in capsule or blister or reservoir dose containers. However, it will be appreciated that smaller doses may also be delivered. For example, doses greater than about 1 &#x3bc;g of active drug may be delivered. In some cases, the active drug may be blended with a carrier, such as lactose. Also, when the bead <b>302</b> is not coated with drug and used as a dispersion mechanism, there is no retention mechanism required to hold the bead <b>302</b> tightly within the inhaler, decreasing the complexity of the DPF. Still further, using the bead <b>302</b> as a dispersion mechanism may require no additional or complicated processing steps for the DPF formulations, as the powder may be produced by traditionally employed methods, particle engineered formulations may also be used.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0066">Additionally, the bead <b>302</b> in the present disclosure may oscillate generally within the center of the chamber <b>104</b>, along the longitudinal axis L, where physical contact between the bead <b>302</b> and inner walls of the chamber <b>104</b>, and possibly ends of the chamber <b>104</b>, may occur infrequently, if at all. This type of dispersion mechanism may be beneficial as collisions between walls of the chamber <b>104</b> and the bead <b>302</b> could serve to rub powder onto either the surface of the bead <b>302</b> or inner walls of the chamber <b>104</b> when powder is caught there during a physical collision, thereby decreasing an amount of powder available for transfer into the lungs of a patient. Alternatively the frequent collision of the bead <b>302</b> with the walls of the chamber <b>104</b> may act to scrub off any drug adhered to the wall(s), thus increasing an amount of powder available for transfer into the lungs of a patient.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0067">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, and as mentioned above, alignment of the inlet <b>102</b> and the chamber <b>104</b>, may provide significant advantages over inhalers having an &#x201c;off-axis&#x201d; alignment. In particular, the tubular body <b>100</b> of the present disclosure may produce an approximately symmetrical flow stream expansion that drives oscillation of the bead <b>302</b>. Such a configuration may enable a powder dispersion device, or dry powder inhaler, incorporating aspects of the tubular body <b>100</b>, to be constructed with minimal bulk. For example, the chamber <b>104</b> in example embodiments of the present disclosure may be modeled as a cylinder of the dimensions detailed above (e.g., d<sub>chamber</sub>&#x2dc;5.89 mm, l<sub>chamber</sub>&#x2dc;10 mm) for a similar 4 mm bead. Accordingly, a maximum volume occupied by the chamber <b>104</b> is about 272 cubic mm based on the expression'v<sub>cylinder</sub>=&#x3c0;r<sup>2</sup>l.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0068">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, an example powder dispersion device or inhaler <b>400</b> is shown in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure.

Additionally, although not expressly shown, the bead <b>302</b> may be positioned within the chamber <b>104</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The device <b>400</b> may further include a second housing <b>404</b> comprising a sheath flow channel <b>406</b> that surrounds and is not in fluid connection with a primary or main powder flow channel <b>408</b>. In some embodiments, the first housing <b>402</b> may be integrally formed with the second housing <b>404</b>. In one embodiment, the chamber <b>104</b> and the main powder flow channel <b>408</b> may have at least one common structural dimension, such as internal diameter for example. Additionally, the second housing <b>404</b> may itself comprise of, be coupled to, or otherwise incorporated within, a mouthpiece adapted to be placed within the mouth of a patient, or in a nasal adapter adapted to conform to the nostrils of a patient. The device <b>400</b> may further include a plurality of flow bypass channels <b>410</b> that are formed within the second housing <b>404</b>. The flow bypass channels <b>410</b> may be in fluid connection with the sheath flow channel <b>406</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0069">The device <b>400</b> may further include a dosing chamber <b>412</b>, a retaining member <b>416</b>, and a piercing member <b>418</b> disposed at an end of the chamber opposite the inlet <b>102</b>. The piercing member <b>418</b> may puncture or otherwise perforate a capsule, blister, or powder reservoir <b>414</b> as arranged or positioned within the dosing chamber <b>412</b>. In general, the retaining member <b>416</b> may include at least one opening or aperture sized to permit air and powdered or otherwise aerosolized medicament to pass through the retaining member <b>416</b>, and to prevent the possibility of the bead <b>302</b> from exiting the chamber <b>104</b>. At least one opening or aperture may, in some embodiments, be arranged and configured (e.g., diameter, pattern, symmetry, etc.) to maintain desired air flow characteristics with the device <b>400</b>, such that the bead <b>302</b> may disrupt and aerosolize medicament powder agglomerates within the chamber <b>104</b> to provide for more effective deposition of medicament into the lungs of a patient.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0070">In one example, referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a patient may prime the device <b>400</b> by puncturing the capsule, blister, or transfer of a dose from a powder reservoir <b>414</b>, and then inhale, drawing air through the chamber <b>104</b> which in turn draws the DPF from the dosing chamber <b>412</b> into the adjacent chamber <b>104</b> via the inlet <b>102</b>, where the bead <b>302</b> is rapidly oscillating, creating high-energy forces that may strip drug from the surface of carrier particles in the DPF, or when the bead <b>302</b> is drug-covered, and/or de-agglomerate drug powder aggregates and drug-on-drug aggregates. Drug particles may then be deposited in lungs and airways of a patient from the primary or main powder flow channel <b>408</b> based on direction of air flow through the device such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Such a &#x201c;self-dosing&#x201d; scenario may be useful for effectively dispensing both traditional binary or ternary DPF formulations, drug and carrier/excipient particles, and pure drug-powder formulations where there are no carrier particles are present. Other embodiments having similar effects are possible, as discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0071">In general, the resistance to flow of the device <b>400</b> may be adjusted by altering the geometry and/or arrangement of at least one of the inlet <b>102</b>, the bead <b>302</b>, the sheath flow channel <b>406</b>, the main powder flow channel <b>408</b>, and the flow bypass channel(s) <b>410</b>. Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the flow bypass channels <b>410</b> may be located radially around the body of the second housing <b>404</b>, and fluidly connected to the sheath flow channel <b>406</b>. In some embodiments however, the device <b>400</b> may not include any flow bypass channels. In one embodiment, the flow bypass channels <b>410</b> may comprise a bypass channel where air is drawn into it via multiple individual side holes or channels located radially around the body of the second housing <b>404</b>. However, other embodiments are possible. For example, the flow bypass channels <b>410</b> may comprise of different numbers and diameters of individual channels and entry points into the sheath flow channel <b>406</b>. Further, one or more of the flow bypass channels <b>410</b> may be parallel through the main powder flow channel <b>408</b>, or may be in fluid connection with, and then diverge from, the main powder flow channel <b>408</b>. Still other embodiments are possible.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0072">One or more of the bypass channels <b>410</b> may be &#x201c;opened&#x201d; or &#x201c;closed&#x201d; such as by removal or insertion of a resilient material therein, to &#x201c;unplug&#x201d; or &#x201c;plug&#x201d; the same. This may result in changes in the overall resistance of the device <b>400</b>, thereby influencing flow rate through the device <b>400</b>. For example, a person may inhale through a &#x201c;high&#x201d; resistance inhaler with a lower inspiratory flow rate than they would through a &#x201c;low&#x201d; resistance inhaler, despite inhaling with the same inhalation effort. In this manner, the device <b>400</b> may be &#x201c;tuned&#x201d; to respond &#x201c;optimally&#x201d; to the needs of a patient. In other words, the device <b>400</b> in accordance with the present disclosure may be tailored to suit particular patient needs. For example, resistance of the device <b>400</b> may be approximately inversely proportional to diameter of the bead <b>302</b>. Thus, for a &#x201c;larger&#x201d; diameter bead <b>302</b>, one or more of the flow bypass channels <b>410</b> may be &#x201c;closed&#x201d; to increase resistance of the device such that a patient may receive a proper dose of medicament irrespective of possibly diminished inhalation capacity. Further, it is contemplated that the flow bypass channels <b>410</b> when &#x201c;opened&#x201d; may at least partially prevent or at least minimize the accumulation or build-up of powder in areas where non-laminar flow, such as flow eddies for example, may be present. Various other possible configurations or arrangements for such housing apertures are described in further detail below in connection with at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0073">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a second view of the device <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is shown in cross-section. In this example, the device <b>400</b> is coupled to a mouthpiece <b>604</b> of an inhaler <b>602</b> by a coupling <b>606</b>, thereby allowing powder to flow through the inhaler <b>602</b> as during &#x201c;normal&#x201d; operation, and then into the chamber <b>104</b> containing the bead <b>302</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).

Here, it may be preferred that the material has surface properties that minimize the attraction of powder particles. The coupling <b>606</b> may be permanently fastened to, such as being integrally formed therewith, at least one of the inhaler <b>602</b> and the device <b>400</b>, or may be removable fastened with least one of the inhaler <b>602</b> and the device <b>400</b>. For example, the coupling <b>606</b> may be fastened to the inhaler <b>602</b> by one of a &#x201c;snap-fit&#x201d; or a &#x201c;pressure-fit&#x201d; or a &#x201c;twist-to-fit&#x201d; mechanism, etc., such as in a &#x201c;quick&#x201d; connect/disconnect implementation.

In this example, a coupling <b>702</b> is shown that is removably coupled to the first housing <b>402</b> of the device <b>400</b>. The coupling <b>702</b> includes an inlet <b>704</b> that is removably coupled to an air source <b>706</b>. In one embodiment, an individual other than a patient may prime the device <b>400</b> by puncturing a capsule, blister, or reservoir <b>708</b> of the coupling <b>702</b> using a piercing member <b>710</b>. The source <b>706</b> may then be employed to force air through the device <b>400</b>, drawing powder from the reservoir <b>708</b> into the adjacent chamber <b>104</b> via the inlet <b>102</b>, where the bead <b>302</b> is rapidly oscillating, creating high-energy forces that may strip drug from the surface of carrier particles (e.g., when the bead <b>302</b> is drug-covered), and/or de-agglomerate powder aggregates.

For example, the device <b>400</b> may enable a responder to administer treatment agent to the lungs of a patient. Additionally, the second housing <b>404</b> may itself comprise of, be coupled to, or otherwise incorporated within, a mouthpiece adapted to be placed within the mouth of a patient, or in a nasal adapter adapted to conform to the nostrils of a patient. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the second housing <b>404</b> of the device <b>400</b> may be securely positioned within or on the mouth or nasal passages of a patient.

In this example, the source <b>706</b> corresponds to the lungs of an individual. Other embodiments are possible.

For example, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a scenario is illustrated in which the example device <b>400</b> is coupled to, or fitted onto, an internal feature of a dose containment system or powder source. In particular, the device <b>400</b> may replace a powder dispersion mechanism internal to an existing inhaler. An example of an existing inhaler may include the HandiHaler&#xae;, Twisthaler&#xae;, Turbuhaler&#xae;, Novolizer&#xae;, Plastiape RS01&#xae;, Turbospin&#xae; dry powder inhalers and others. Other embodiments are possible.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0079">For example, a typical dose containment system or powder source <b>712</b> may generally include a dose module <b>714</b> that holds a portion of DPF, a powder dispersion module <b>716</b>, and a mouthpiece module <b>718</b> that would in practice be used to deliver a dose of the DPF to a patient. In general, the powder dispersion module <b>716</b> may exhibit a tortuous path the DPF needs to navigate between its introduction into the flow path and release from the mouthpiece module <b>718</b>. The tortuous path may possibly deaggregate DPF aggregates to some degree, but may also add flow resistance. In accordance with the principles of the present disclosure, the dose containment system or powder source <b>712</b> may be modified to replace the powder dispersion module <b>716</b> with the device <b>400</b>, or subassemblies of the device <b>400</b>, including an inlet, chamber with a bead, and an outlet similar to the device <b>400</b>. Further, this may or may not include the second housing <b>404</b> of the device <b>400</b>, where an existing element of an inhaler being modified may instead be used. In this example, the device <b>400</b> may enhance the efficiency of de-aggregation of DPF of the dose containment system or powder source <b>712</b>, and may lower the resistance to flow within the dose containment system or powder source <b>712</b>. Other benefits and advantages are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0080">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a simplified, conceptual, example schematic diagram of the example device <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in multiple configurations is shown. In particular, the chamber <b>104</b> of the device <b>400</b> is shown in a series configuration <b>902</b> with another chamber <b>104</b>, and in a parallel configuration <b>904</b> with another chamber <b>104</b>. In this example, it is contemplated that multiple drugs in each their own (e.g., two or more) dispersion chambers (e.g., in addition to other elements of the example device <b>400</b> as desired) configured in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure may be coupled in series or parallel. Further, it is contemplated that any desired series/parallel combination may also be formed. For example, the series configuration <b>902</b> may be coupled in series with the parallel configuration <b>904</b>. In another example, the parallel configuration <b>904</b> may be coupled in series with, a single particular chamber <b>104</b>, and etc.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0081">In addition, it is contemplated that the type and configuration of the bead <b>302</b> may vary in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. For example, when multiple ones of the chamber <b>104</b> are connected in series and/or parallel, one or more of the respective dispersion chambers may have similar bead sizes, different bead sizes, similar bead materials, different bead materials, and etc. Further, it is contemplated that any desired series/parallel combination may be formed. In general, type and configuration of the bead <b>302</b> may vary as desired.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0082">Such an implementation may be beneficial in many respects. For example, for combination therapies, one drug may pass through a particular dispersion chamber and another other drug may pass through a separate dispersion chamber, or both drugs can pass through the same dispersion chamber. Additionally, &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; of the dispersion chambers may merge into a single dispersion chamber, or be kept separate throughout the length of the device <b>400</b>, such that the powders do not mix until they are emitted from the device. Still other benefits and/or advantages are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0083">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a cross-section of a second example tubular body <b>1000</b> having an inlet <b>1002</b> and a dispersion chamber <b>1004</b> is shown according to the principles of the present disclosure. In many aspects, the second example tubular body <b>1000</b> is similar to at least the tubular body <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, a fluid flow path of the inlet <b>1002</b> is defined by a first internal diameter <b>1006</b> that varies or tapers along a longitudinal axis L, and a fluid flow path of the dispersion chamber <b>1004</b> is defined by a second internal diameter <b>1008</b>. Further, one or more apertures <b>1010</b> are formed within the tubular body <b>1000</b> at particular locations to allow a secondary supply of air or air flow <b>1012</b> (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;chase air&#x201d;) to enter the tubular body <b>1000</b> during its use, to prevent or at least minimize the unintended accumulation or build-up of powder within the tubular body <b>1000</b>. In particular, it will be appreciated that air flowing through the one or more apertures <b>1010</b> may advantageously prevent or at least minimize the unintended accumulation or build-up of powder within internal edges or corners <b>1014</b> of the tubular body <b>1000</b> that are substantially adjacent the inlet <b>1002</b>, because the force of that air would push powder away from the corners <b>1014</b> into the primary air stream <b>1016</b> for subsequent deposition into the lungs of a patient in a manner similar to that as discussed above. Among other things, this may advantageously increase the efficiency of powder deposition into the lungs of a patient, prevent build-up of powder that can dislodge in subsequent uses of the chamber as a multi-dose inhaler device resulting in a super-dose to be delivered to the patient, and/or prevent undesired waste of powder.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0084">Additionally, or alternatively, the corners <b>1014</b> of the tubular body <b>1000</b> may be formed to exhibit rounded or curved surfaces to prevent or at least minimize the unintended accumulation or build-up of powder within the tubular body <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> in particular shows the corners <b>1014</b> of the tubular body <b>1000</b> formed to exhibit rounded or cursed surfaces, without the apertures <b>1010</b>.

Further, apertures <b>1017</b> are formed within the tubular body <b>1000</b> near or adjacent the corners <b>1015</b>. It is contemplated that any feature or element discussed as being near or adjacent the inlet <b>1002</b> may additionally, or alternatively, be formed on an end of the tubular body <b>1000</b> opposite of the inlet <b>1002</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. This principle is applicable to each respective tubular body discussed in the context of the present disclosure. Further, the configuration and particular geometry of the corners <b>1015</b> and/or the apertures <b>1017</b> need not necessarily be the same as that exhibited by the corners <b>1014</b> and/or apertures <b>1010</b>. For example, the tubular body <b>1000</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> may have a first portion <b>1019</b> configured similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, whereas a second portion <b>1021</b> may be configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. Still many other embodiments are possible.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0085">It will be appreciated that such rounded or curved surfaces may more effectively prevent powder from accumulating or adhering to portions of the corners <b>1014</b> when compared to other profiles that have a sharp transition between surfaces, such as the stepped-edge profile shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In addition to providing desirable fluid flow characteristics, one or both of the apertures <b>1010</b> and the rounded corners <b>1014</b> may further facilitate efficient and effective fabrication of the tubular body <b>1000</b> by injection molding for example.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0086">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the secondary air flow <b>1012</b> comprises air flowing through the apertures <b>1010</b> and into the dispersion chamber <b>1004</b> in a substantially or approximately parallel direction to the primary air stream <b>1016</b>.

In general, it is contemplated that the notches <b>1312</b> may be defined as desired so that the apertures <b>1310</b> exhibit a specific shape, pattern, and/or symmetry that facilitates deposition of powder into the lungs of a patient, in tandem with preventing or at least minimizing the accumulation or build-up of powder in or near internal surfaces of the mated assembly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, and in particular the dispersion chamber <b>1304</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0090">The features or aspects of the present disclosure may be beneficial and/or advantageous in many respects. For example, to help minimize the buildup or accumulation of powder within at least the above-described dispersion chambers, it is contemplated that the outside corners of the inlet surface of the chamber may be formed so that &#x201c;small&#x201d; amounts of air are allowed to flow into the outermost corner via a gap/holes at the outermost edge of the inlet surface and the chamber cylinder. The dimension of the gap or gaps may be critical so as to allow sufficient air to flow into the outermost corner to minimize or prevent powder buildup, essentially sweeping away or causing the powder trapped there by the eddies not to build up in the first place. The flow though still is low enough not to alter the linear oscillation characteristics of the bead, and the negative pressure field that is present in the chamber that draws the bead back toward the inlet when air flows into the main inlet to the chamber, and is above the level needed to make the bead oscillate. The &#x201c;corner air flow&#x201d; can be via holes in the corner, or via a designed-in gap caused by the design of the mating parts that make up the cylinder. It is contemplated that less than about 25% of the main flow, less than about 10% of the main, less than about 5% of the main flow, or less about than about 1% of the main flow may prevent powder buildup in the corners, depending on the characteristics of the powder deposited in the corners and the physical properties and components thereof.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0091">Additional features could further improve the disruption and dispersion of powder agglomerates within the chamber by the bead. The additional features may include ribs <b>2102</b> in the chamber of inhaler <b>2100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> that would restrict the circumferential movement of the bead limiting the bead to axial movements. This may increase the speed and frequency of the bead oscillation in the chamber. In addition the retention feature <b>2216</b> that keeps the bead from exiting the chamber could be constructed from a wing as shown in cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>. The wing as a retention feature <b>2216</b> could have several benefits to the design such as lowering inhaler resistance and increasing bead speed and or frequency among other possible benefits. In some embodiments, two or more beads <b>2304</b> may be placed in a single chamber as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, this may improve the disruption and dispersion of powder agglomerates within the chamber.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0092">A specific embodiment of the inhaler <b>2400</b> has been created using the Plastiape RS01 dry powder inhaler (Plastiape S.p.a, Italy) as the dose containment and delivery system. This embodiment utilizes the capsule piercing and dose delivery system from a Plastiape RS01 to feed powder into the chamber with the oscillating actuator, a spherical bead as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>-<b>25</b></figref>. After piercing a capsule <b>2402</b>, air flows through inlet passages <b>2404</b> and the pierced capsule <b>2402</b> is lifted from the piercing chamber <b>2408</b> and rotates about its axis to efficiently empty the capsule <b>2402</b>. The aerosolized powder exiting the rotating capsule <b>2402</b> flows through a grid that serves as a flow straightening element <b>2406</b> and is fed into the chamber with the oscillating spherical bead. The design utilizes a conical frustum inlet from the Plastiape RS01 inhaler to the inlet diameter <b>106</b>. Experiments using a Next Generation Impactor (NGI) with this design have shown an emitted fine particle fraction (% FPF, with a fine particle cutoff &#x3c;5.3 &#x3bc;m) greater than 70% with several different active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Emitted fine particle fraction (% FPF) is defined as the fraction of emitted mass below a cutoff diameter divided by the emitted mass from the inhaler. An experiment was performed testing this embodiment at 2 and 4 kPa with 20 mg 20% Vardenafil (HCl)<sub>2 </sub>in a lactose blend. This inhaler <b>2400</b> used d<sub>bead</sub>=4.00 mm, d<sub>inlet</sub>=2.72 mm, d<sub>chamber</sub>=5.89 mm, l<sub>chamber</sub>=10 mm, with 2 bypass channels open which resulted in a resistance=0.104(cm H<sub>2</sub>O<sup>0.5</sup>/LPM). Results show that this embodiment achieved similar aerosol performance at 2 and 4 kPa as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0093">Typically drug powder deposition on the inhaler device components in dry powder inhalers changes with air flow rate. An experiment was conducted using the embodiment exhibited in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>. This inhaler used d<sub>bead</sub>=4.00 mm, d<sub>inlet</sub>=2.72 mm, d<sub>chamber</sub>=5.89 mm, l<sub>chamber</sub>=10 mm, with 2 bypass channels which resulted in a resistance=0.104(cm H<sub>2</sub>O<sup>0.5</sup>/LPM). The inhaler was loaded with 20 mg of 20% Vardenafil (HCl)<sub>2 </sub>and the amount of drug deposited in the capsule containment <b>2400</b>, dispersion chamber <b>104</b> and bead <b>304</b>, and mouthpiece <b>406</b> components as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>. The inhaler was tested at 60 and 150 LPM (4 and 24 kPa respectively). Surprisingly the drug deposition by % mass was largely unchanged in the dispersion chamber <b>104</b>, bead <b>304</b>, and mouthpiece <b>408</b> sections despite a 250% increase in inhaler flow as shown in TABLE 4.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Inhaler portion</entry><entry>60 LPM</entry><entry>150 LPM</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Capsule containment</entry><entry>14.6%&#x2002;</entry><entry>8.1%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Chamber and bead</entry><entry>2.1%</entry><entry>1.7%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mouthpiece</entry><entry>6.2%</entry><entry>6.3%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0100" num="0094">Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above.
