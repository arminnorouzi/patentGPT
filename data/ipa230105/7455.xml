More particularly, the subject matter described herein relates to methods, systems, and computer readable media for resource cleanup in 5G and subsequent generation communications networks.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In telecommunications networks, a service endpoint is an address on a network node that uniquely identifies an entity that provides service to service consumers. The service endpoint can include an Internet protocol (IP) address or a combination of IP address and transport layer port number, which is also referred to as an IP endpoint.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In fifth generation (5G) telecommunications networks, the network node that provides service is referred to as a producer network function (NF). A network node that consumes services is referred to as a consumer NF. A network function can be both a producer NF and a consumer NF depending on whether it is consuming or providing service.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A given producer NF may have many service endpoints. Producer NFs register with a network function repository function (NRF). The NRF maintains an NF profile of available NF instances and their supported services. Consumer NFs can subscribe to receive information about producer NF instances that have registered with the NRF.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to consumer NFs, another type of network node that can subscribe to receive information about NF service instances is a service communications proxy (SCP). The SCP subscribes with the NRF and obtains reachability and service profile information regarding producer NF service instances. Consumer NFs connect to the service communications proxy, and the service communications proxy load balances traffic among producer NF service instances that provide the required service or directly routes the traffic to the destined producer NF.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One problem with the existing 3GPP service architecture is protocol data unit (PDU) session binding information maintained in a PDU session binding database at a binding support function (BSF) may become stale or inactive. For example, after user equipment (UE) registers with the network, the UE triggers (via a session management function (SMF)) the creation of a PDU session in order to exchange data with the network. As part of the PDU session creation process, a policy control function (PCF) is assigned to the session to generate policy rules for the session to control quality of service and charging for the session. The PCF assigned to the session registers with a BSF, and the BSF creates a binding record for the session in its database. NF service consumers seeking to discover the PDU session binding for a UE may do so by querying the BSF using a discovery application programming interface (API) provided by the BSF. After a binding record becomes inactive or stale, the PCF may send a delete binding record request or other message for deleting the stale binding record. However, if stale binding records at the BSF are not deleted or cleaned up, resources can be wasted and/or other inefficiencies can occur. For example, if stale PDU session binding information contains inaccurate information, a consumer NF may receive PDU session binding information for a PCF that is out of service or no longer operational. The consumer NF may then seek to contact the non-operational PCF, fail to receive a response, and then initiate discovery with an NRF to obtain alternate PCF session binding information for the UE. Requiring consumer NFs to contact the BSF, contact the non-operational PCF, contact the NRF, and then contact the alternate PCF assigned to a PDU session can result in delays in providing of services to UEs.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In light of these and other challenges, there exists a need for improved resource cleanup in communications networks.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Methods, systems, and computer readable media for resource cleanup in communications networks are disclosed.

In 5G communications networks, the binding support management service (also referred to as the Nbsf_Management service) as defined by 3GPP, is provided by a binding support function (BSF). The Nbsf_Management service allows the BSF to provide protocol data unit (PDU) session binding functionality, which can ensure that an application function (AF) request for a certain PDU session can reach the relevant policy control function (PCF) having the PDU session information.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Generally, a PCF may delete or cleanup binding records (also referred to herein as bindings) at the BSF when the binding records become stale (e.g., inactive or unneeded). While stale binding records are generally deleted, various scenarios exist that can result in stale binding records being left at the BSF. For example, these scenarios may involve a PCF or another network function (NF) failing to send a delete binding record request to a BSF, a BSF experiencing issues or being unavailable when a PCF or other node attempts to delete an existing binding record, or a PCF experiencing context data loss (e.g., loss of resource mapping records) in response to a PCF crash or failure and therefore not trigger a cleanup at the BSF because the PCF is unaware of the binding records. Moreover, e.g., in scenarios where a BSF has stale binding records due to context data loss at a PCF, it may be possible or even likely that PCF session related information (e.g., regarding bindings or related resources) are stale at other NFs, e.g. a unified data repository (UDR), a charging function (CHF), a session management function (SMF), a network data analytics functions (NWDAF), etc.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">While various NFs may be configured to detect stale sessions and/or related records and perform cleanup operations as needed, detecting stale session/records may not be easy to implement in every NF and various issues can arise. For example, a network may include or utilize NFs (e.g. SMFs, UDRs, CHFs, BSFs, PCFs, etc.) from multiple different vendors with each having various capabilities and, as such, some NFs may lack support for stale session/record detection and cleanup. Moreover, e.g., to cross-verify if a detected session/record is stale, a producer NF may need a callback API with consumer NFs so that the consumer NFs can check if a session is still valid. For example, when an SMF creates a session at a PCF, the SMF may provide its notification uniform resource locator (URL) to the PCF for update/terminate notifications. However, callback API support may not be available for all interfaces on which a PCF is creating or using resources (e.g., sessions and/or subscription). Thus, NFs that lack callback API support may lack efficient or effective stale session detection or verification techniques.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with some aspects of the subject matter described herein, methods, systems, mechanisms, and/or techniques are disclosed for resource cleanup in a communications network. For example, a PCF in accordance with various aspects described herein can initiate, using a context data associated with a stale binding record from a BSF, resource cleanup at one or more network entities. In this example, a BSF in accordance with various aspects described herein can detect a potentially stale binding record and send a notification comprising context data (e.g., a cookie containing URLs for communicating with one or more NFs) about the binding record to the PCF, e.g., via a PUT operation. After receiving the binding record and confirming that the binding record is stale, the PCF may use the context data to identify various NFs associated with the stale binding record and communicate with the NFs to trigger resource cleanup associated with the stale binding record.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with some aspects of the subject matter described herein, methods, systems, mechanisms, and/or techniques are disclosed for providing context data (e.g., as vendor specific extension attributes or JSON data objects) to a BSF during creation and/or update of a binding record. In some embodiments, context data may include mandatory and optional data and may be stored in a cookie or abstract data object. Example mandatory data may include a version number for indicating the version of the context data format, a callback address (e.g., a &#x201c;notificationURL&#x201d; value) for allowing a BSF to notify a relevant PCF, and/or a time or timestamp value (e.g., a &#x2018;bindingCreateUpdateTime&#x2019; value) for indicating when a related binding record was created or updated (e.g., most recently). Example optional data may include information elements for one or more NFs that are associated with the binding record or a related session and may include information about other subscriptions or resources that PCF might have created at those NFs. For example, an optional SMF information element may include a URL (e.g., a &#x201c;notificationURL&#x201d; value) or other identifier (ID) usable for notifying or communicating with a SMF, e.g., regarding resource cleanup. In another example, an optional UDR information element may include a URL (e.g., a &#x201c;resourceURL&#x201d; value) or other ID usable for notifying or communicating with a UDR, e.g., regarding resource cleanup. In another example, an optional CHF information element may include a URL or other ID (e.g., a &#x201c;resourceUrl&#x201d; value) usable for notifying or communicating with a CHF, e.g., regarding resource cleanup.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Advantageously, by utilizing one or more techniques, systems, and/or methods described herein, a PCF, a BSF, or other entity may perform various aspects associated with verifying stale binding records, performing resource cleanup associated with stale binding records, and/or using context data associated with the stale binding records. For example, an example BSF in accordance with various aspects described herein may utilize a received URL (e.g., from a PCF) to communicate with the PCF so that the BSF can audit and/or confirm whether binding records are stale. In another example, an example BSF in accordance with various aspects described herein may utilize a received URL (e.g., from a PCF) to communicate with the PCF so that the BSF can provide context data associated with a binding record to the PCF, e.g., after a PCF failure resulting in context data loss. In another example, an example BSF in accordance with various aspects described herein may utilize a PCF notification about a potentially stale binding record and related context data to initiate resource cleanup at one or more NFs associated with the binding record. In some embodiments, by utilizing one or more aspects described herein, an example BSF and/or PCF may facilitate resource cleanup at various NFs including NFs that lack logic to independently detect of stale information (e.g., record, resource, or session information) and perform cleanup procedures, thereby improving resource cleanup and/or resource management (e.g., resource utilization) in a communications network. Moreover, by utilizing one or more aspects described herein, an example BSF and/or PCF in accordance with various aspects described herein may be fully backward compatible, may not impact NFs from various vendors, and may not require changes to existing 3GPP defined 5G core call flows.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments of the subject matter described herein, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
