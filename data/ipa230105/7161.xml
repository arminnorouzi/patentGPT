Each pixel may include a digital counter that accumulates a digital number, which indicates whether a change is detected by the pixel. The counter may count in one direction for a portion of an exposure and count in an opposite direction for another portion of the exposure. The imaging device may be configured to collect and transmit key frames at a lower rate, and collect and transmit delta or event frames at a higher rate. The key frames may include a full image of a scene, captured by the pixel array. The delta frames may include sparse data, captured by pixels that have detected meaningful changes in received light intensity. High speed, low transmission bandwidth motion image video can be reconstructed using the key frames and the delta frames.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="109.81mm" wi="144.86mm" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="190.16mm" wi="117.69mm" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="216.75mm" wi="162.05mm" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="186.94mm" wi="162.05mm" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="223.27mm" wi="158.50mm" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="228.52mm" wi="151.30mm" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="219.20mm" wi="151.30mm" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="130.39mm" wi="141.73mm" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="178.05mm" wi="162.39mm" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="186.01mm" wi="124.88mm" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="194.99mm" wi="160.95mm" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="173.06mm" wi="128.69mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="178.22mm" wi="170.77mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="228.26mm" wi="141.31mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="222.42mm" wi="150.37mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00015" num="00015"><img id="EMI-D00015" he="207.60mm" wi="132.16mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00015.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00016" num="00016"><img id="EMI-D00016" he="220.81mm" wi="163.83mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00016.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00017" num="00017"><img id="EMI-D00017" he="212.85mm" wi="125.39mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00017.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00018" num="00018"><img id="EMI-D00018" he="217.76mm" wi="150.96mm" file="US20230007162A1-20230105-D00018.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application No. 62/800,685 filed on Feb. 4, 2019 and titled &#x201c;Multi-Function Time Multiplexed Camera,&#x201d; the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

In such imaging arrays, photocurrent generated by illumination of a photodiode accumulates charge on a capacitor at each pixel of the array. At the end of an exposure period, the amount of charge stored on the pixel' s capacitor is read out of the array for subsequent image processing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, digital focal plane arrays have been developed as a different approach to imaging.

An example of a computational pixel imaging device <b>100</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. According to some embodiments, a computational pixel imaging device <b>100</b> can include a substrate <b>104</b> on which is formed an array of detectors <b>110</b> and an array of pixel integrated circuits <b>120</b> that are arranged to receive signals from the corresponding detectors. A detector <b>110</b> and its corresponding pixel integrated circuit <b>120</b> can form a pixel of a computational pixel imaging device <b>100</b>, and may both be located on a same substrate <b>104</b> in some embodiments. The arrays depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> are two-dimensional and may comprise tens, hundreds, thousands, or even millions of pixels when implemented in a device. In some cases, the arrays may be one-dimensional (e.g., for a device that is scanned).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts an embodiment of a computational pixel imaging device <b>102</b> in which the detectors <b>110</b> are formed on a first substrate <b>106</b> in a detector array and the pixel integrated circuits <b>120</b> are formed on a second substrate in a pixel integrated circuit array. In some embodiments, the detectors <b>110</b> on the first substrate <b>106</b> can be directly connected to receiving pixel integrated circuits <b>120</b> on the second substrate <b>108</b> (e.g., by flip-chip or bump-bonding processes that may include solder bumps or posts).

The interposer may provide some signal rerouting so that the array of pixel integrated circuits <b>120</b> on the second substrate may be larger than the array of detectors <b>110</b> on the first substrate. However, in some cases the pixel size for a pixel integrated circuit <b>120</b> may be the same or smaller than a pixel size for a detector <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first substrate <b>106</b> may be made from a first material that can be the same or different from a second material used to form the second substrate <b>108</b>. For example, the first substrate <b>106</b> may be made from a first semiconductor material (e.g., indium phosphide (InP)) and the second substrate may be made from a second semiconductor material (e.g., silicon (Si)). Other materials from which the substrates in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> may be formed and/or that may be included on the substrates include, but are not limited to, II-VI semiconductors such as cadmium telluride (CdTe) and mercury-cadmium telluride (HgCdTe), III-V semiconductors such as gallium nitride (GaN) and compositions including GaN, gallium arsenide (GaAs) and compositions including GaAs, and group TV semiconductors such as Si, germanium (Ge), or silicon-germanium (SiGe).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Various types of detectors <b>110</b> may be used in a computational pixel imager <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the detectors <b>110</b> may comprise p-n or p-i-n junction photodiodes or phototransistors or photoconductors. Barrier detectors (e.g., barrier photodiodes, barrier phototransistors, etc.) may also be used in some cases and provide high detection sensitivity. In some cases, the detectors <b>110</b> may comprise avalanche photodiodes for sensing low light levels. In yet other embodiments, the detectors <b>110</b> may comprise microbolometers. According to some embodiments, the detectors <b>110</b> may be cooled to reduce background noise and/or to enhance responsivity of the detectors. For example, the computational pixel imager <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may be mounted on a thermoelectric cooler or placed in thermal contact with a chilled heat sink or located in a dewer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A computational pixel imager <b>201</b> may be included in an imaging system <b>200</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, according to some embodiments. An imaging system <b>200</b> can include a camera <b>202</b> that may house collection optics <b>210</b> and a computational pixel imager <b>201</b>. The imaging system <b>200</b> may also include a controller <b>250</b> that can connect to the camera <b>202</b> and computational pixel imager <b>201</b> by a wired or wireless data-communication link. The collection optics <b>210</b> may include one or more lenses and/or mirrors that act to form an image of a viewed scene on detectors <b>110</b> in the computational pixel imager <b>201</b>. The detectors <b>110</b> may be located in an imaging plane of the collection optics <b>210</b> and an array of pixel integrated circuits <b>120</b> may be located in the imaging plane or adjacent to the imaging plane. In some embodiments, some component(s) of the collection optics <b>210</b> may be moved controllably and automatically, the imager <b>201</b> may be moved controllably and automatically, and/or the entire camera <b>202</b> may be moved controllably and automatically (e.g., rotated by motors or actuators) to scan and image a large field of view.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The imaging system <b>200</b> may be adapted as a visible imaging system, an infrared imaging system (e.g., a night-vision system), an ultraviolet imaging system, or an x-ray imaging system. The choice of detector design and material can determine the responsivity of the detector to various wavelengths of radiation. For example, Si-based photodiodes can be used for a visible imaging system (e.g., wavelengths from about 380 nm to about 740 nm), whereas CdTe photodiodes may be used for ultraviolet or x-ray imaging systems. As another example, indium arsenide or HgCdTe photodiodes may be used for an infrared imaging system. In some cases, strained-layer superlattice detectors formed from III-V materials can be used for infrared imaging. In some cases, detector design and material can be chosen to detect radiation within a spectral range that lies within a portion of an infrared wavelength range between 750 nm or approximately 750 nm and 5 microns or approximately 5 microns. For example and in some implementations, a detector can be selected to detect radiation in an infrared spectral range between 0.75 micron and 3 microns or between approximately these end values. In some implementations, a detector can be selected to detect radiation in an infrared spectral range between 3 microns and 5 microns or between approximately these end values.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some implementations, the controller <b>250</b> can be implemented in various ways and forms. For example, the controller <b>250</b> may be embodied as a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a mainframe computer, or anything in between such as a microcontroller, a microprocessor, one or more application-specific integrated circuits, a digital signal processor, a laptop computer or desktop computer, a tablet computer, a smart phone, etc. In some cases, the controller <b>250</b> can be embodied as combinations of different controlling devices. Part of the control components can include code as software and/or firmware that adapts the controller <b>250</b> to execute functionalities that control operation of the imaging system <b>200</b> and receive, store, transmit, and process image data acquired by the camera <b>202</b>. Controller components may also include custom logic and/or analog circuitry as well as memory that can be used by the computational pixel imager. The controller <b>250</b> may be configured to initiate the transfer of digital signals from the pixel integrated circuits <b>120</b> and to control the shifts, counts, and accumulation times that can permit the pixel integrated circuits <b>120</b> to perform digital-signal-processing functions on-chip. In some cases, some control functions may be incorporated into the pixel integrated circuits <b>120</b> (e.g., hardwired or implemented as firmware). Such an integration may permit an array of pixel integrated circuits <b>120</b> to operate autonomously and perform on-chip, digital-signal-processing functions relatively free of external control.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">An imaging system <b>200</b> in accordance with the present embodiments may be used, for example, in industrial inspection, surveillance, process control, biological research, chemical research, pharmaceuticals, medical imaging, remote sensing, and astronomy. An implementation that comprises a computational pixel imager <b>201</b> and single-chip controller <b>250</b> may be incorporated in a variety of cameras, including portable, consumer, still and motion cameras, for example. A camera may be configured to operate in the visible region of the optical spectrum or in other wavelength regions by selecting appropriate detectors <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, a computational pixel imager <b>201</b> and controller <b>250</b> may be incorporated into a vision system for autonomous vehicles or robotic instruments.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the infrared range, an imaging system <b>200</b> may be adapted for operation as an infrared camera and used for industrial sensing (e.g., monitor heat emission from industrial components and/or machines), security, or firefighting, for example. An infrared camera may also be employed to provide an infrared image of a scene ahead of and/or around a vehicle. In some implementations, the imaging capability of the camera can extend beyond the human visible range of a scene illuminated by vehicle headlights. An acquired infrared image may be displayed, for example in a &#x201c;heads up&#x201d; display or overlaid on a windscreen of the vehicle to assist the vehicle operator. Potential hazards that are not visible to the unaided eye can become visible to a human operator through the camera and display.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, an imaging system <b>200</b> can include a cryogenically cooled infrared detector array, with connections between the detector array and the pixel integrated circuit array made via indium bump bonding, for example. In such an embodiment, the detector array may be suitable for low-light-level, low noise sensing in the infrared region of the spectrum (2-20 microns). Cooling may also be employed for detectors used in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the optical spectrum.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">An example of a pixel integrated circuit <b>120</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. According to some embodiments, a pixel integrated circuit <b>120</b> can include a first transistor <b>306</b>, a capacitor C<sub>0</sub>, which may be included in a current-to-frequency converter <b>310</b>, and at least one digital counter <b>330</b>-<b>1</b>. In some cases, a second transistor <b>307</b> may be included between the first transistor <b>306</b> and current-to-frequency converter <b>310</b>. The second transistor <b>307</b> can provide additional isolation between node <b>308</b> or input to the current-to-frequency converter <b>310</b> and the source of the first transistor <b>306</b>. The second transistor <b>307</b>, connected in cascade, can help dampen noise arising from reset actions performed on node <b>308</b>. In some implementations, there can be two or more counters <b>330</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>330</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>330</b>-M as illustrated in the drawing. The current-to-frequency converter <b>310</b> can be arranged to receive as input an analog signal and output a pulse every time a current exceeds a threshold value. The pulses can be counted by the counters <b>330</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>330</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>330</b>-M. When located above or below a detector <b>110</b> in a pixel, an area occupied by a pixel integrated circuit <b>120</b> may be approximately the same size or smaller than an area occupied by the detector. In some implementations, a voltage-to-frequency converter may be used instead of a current-to-frequency converter. For example, a voltage-to-frequency converter may sense a voltage appearing on a node <b>308</b> of a capacitor C<sub>0 </sub>and output a pulse every time a voltage exceeds a threshold value.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In further detail, a detector (which may be embodied as a photodiode <b>305</b>) can generate a photocurrent I<sub>p </sub>when exposed to radiation. In some embodiments, the detector (photodiode <b>305</b>) may receive a stable bias from a bias source. For example, biasing circuity can be included to apply a bias the photodiode <b>305</b> from a voltage source. The circuitry may include a large inductor on a bias line to block time-varying signals from the photodiode and pass a DC bias voltage. It may be advantageous to maintain a stable bias on the detector, and the second transistor <b>307</b> can help reduce bias variations that might otherwise occur due to resetting action at node <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some implementations, passage of the photocurrent I<sub>p </sub>to a capacitor C<sub>0 </sub>of the current-to-frequency converter <b>310</b> may be controlled by the first transistor <b>306</b> (and/or second transistor <b>307</b>) with the application of a digital control signal D<sub>in </sub>(and/or B<sub>in</sub>), for example. According to some embodiments, the control signal D<sub>in </sub>(and/or may determine an exposure period for a pixel of the computational pixel imager. For example, when the control signal D<sub>in </sub>(and B<sub>in</sub>) is at a logic &#x201c;HIGH&#x201d; or &#x201c;1&#x201d; level, photocurrent I<sub>p </sub>can flow and accumulate charge on capacitor C<sub>0 </sub>raising the voltage at node <b>308</b>. Toggling the first transistor <b>306</b> and/or second transistor <b>307</b> to a logic &#x201c;LOW&#x201d; or &#x201c;0&#x201d; level can block further photocurrent flow to the capacitor C<sub>0</sub>, and can terminate an exposure period. The exposure period can be repeated for video imaging and can be any suitable duration. In some embodiments, the exposure period may be any duration of time between 1 nanosecond (1 ns) for high levels of radiation on the detector and tens of minutes for low levels of radiation or for high-dynamic range sensing. Each exposure period can form an image frame with signals received from all pixels in the imager's array.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In other implementations, the first transistor <b>306</b> (or transistors as described further below) may be used to provide gain and at least one of the transistors <b>306</b>, <b>307</b> may be biased to operate in a sub-threshold region. In such embodiments, the first transistor(s) may or may not be used to shutter an exposure period. In some cases, shutter action for exposure periods can be accomplished by control signals (or clock signals) provided to the counters <b>330</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>330</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>330</b>-M that instruct one or more counters when to start and stop accumulating counts.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although the input transistor(s) <b>306</b>, <b>307</b> can be arranged as a switch (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) for direct photocurrent injection, in some cases the input transistor(s) may be arranged in other configurations and two or more transistors may be used to receive photocurrent from the photodiode <b>305</b>. For example, one or more transistors may be arranged to amplify a signal from the photodiode <b>305</b>. Input transistor(s) may he connected as a source-follower, a transimpedence amplifier, or configured for buffered direct injection of the photocurrent I<sub>p</sub>. In some implementations, a current mirror circuit may be included in an input transistor arrangement, wherein the current mirror circuit provides current gain in a circuit branch that runs parallel to the branch containing the photodiode <b>305</b> and first transistor <b>306</b>. The amplified current can be provided to the capacitor C<sub>0 </sub>and current-to-frequency converter <b>310</b>. Although the input transistor(s) <b>306</b>, <b>307</b> are depicted as a field-effect transistor (FET), bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and other types of transistors may be used in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The capacitor C<sub>0 </sub>may have one terminal connected to an output of the first transistor <b>306</b> (or second transistor <b>307</b>, if present) and a second terminal connected to a reference potential (e.g., ground as illustrated). The capacitance of capacitor C<sub>0 </sub>can be small (e.g., between 1 femtoFarad (1 fF) and 1 nanoFarad (1 nF). Higher or lower capacitance values may be used in other embodiments. In some cases, capacitor C<sub>0 </sub>can be embodied as parasitic capacitance of a discrete circuit device (e.g., parasitic drain capacitance of the first transistor <b>306</b> or second transistor <b>307</b>, if present), and may not be a separate discrete component in the integrated pixel circuit <b>120</b>. The capacitor C<sub>0 </sub>can determine the least significant bit value for a signal level from a pixel. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> depicts one polarity for applying (sourcing) current to the current-to-frequency converter <b>310</b>, in some cases it may be beneficial to reverse the orientation of the photodiode <b>305</b> or detector and sink current from the current-to-frequency converter <b>310</b>. The use of appropriate types (n-MOS or p-MOS) of transistors can allow a pixel integrated circuit to accommodate a current source or current sink photodetection strategy. Current applied to the current-to-frequency converter <b>310</b> may charge or discharge a capacitor C<sub>0</sub>. For example, in some cases a reset of the capacitor may comprise applying a non-zero voltage to node <b>308</b>, which can leave a potential across the capacitor C<sub>0 </sub>that is discharged, at least in part, by subsequent exposure of the photodiode <b>305</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The current-to-frequency converter <b>310</b> can include comparator circuitry <b>315</b> and reset circuitry <b>320</b>, according to some embodiments. Comparator circuitry <b>315</b> can be embodied as a Schmitt trigger, comparator, or high-gain amplifying transistor that toggles between two output states: for example, from a low level to high, or high level to low, when an input voltage exceeds (or falls below) a reference voltage V<sub>ref</sub>. In some implementations, the reference voltage may be hardwired to a fixed value or may be a threshold voltage of a transistor. In other cases, the reference voltage V<sub>ref </sub>may be programmable by an external control signal to two or more values. For example, an integrated pixel circuit <b>120</b> may further include transistors (and resistive elements in some cases) arranged to provide programmable voltage values. Reset circuitry <b>320</b> may be embodied as one or more transistors arranged to discharge the capacitor C<sub>0 </sub>(e.g., shunt the capacitor's terminal connected to node <b>308</b> to the reference voltage connected to the other terminal of the capacitor. For example, a toggling of an output from the comparator circuitry <b>315</b> can activate the reset circuitry <b>320</b> to discharge the capacitor C<sub>0</sub>, which can cause the comparator circuitry <b>315</b> to toggle back to a prior state of the two states. In some implementations, the current-to-frequency converter <b>310</b> may be embodied as described in connection with FIG. 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 10,348,993, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As a result of toggling of the comparator circuitry <b>315</b> and resetting of the capacitor C<sub>0</sub>, an output of pulses <b>325</b> can be provided to one or more counters <b>330</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>330</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>330</b>-M during an exposure period. The number of pulses during an exposure period will depend upon and be proportional to an amount of radiation incident on the detector (photodiode <b>305</b> in the illustrated embodiment). A higher level of radiation will produce a larger number of pulses during the exposure period. One or more of the counters <b>330</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>330</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>330</b>-M can accumulate counts for the pulses received during the exposure period. At the end of the exposure period, the number of counts can be read out of a counter as a digital signal level for the pixel.

In some implementations, counting direction may be changed by a programmable control signal at any time during an exposure period. Additionally or alternatively, the counters may be programmed with an initial count value for the start of each exposure period.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Embodiments described herein are not limited to one current-to-frequency (or voltage-to-frequency) converter per pixel. Two or more converters may be used per pixel integrated circuit <b>122</b>, as illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. According to some embodiments, one or more pixels of a computational pixel imager can include two or more current-to-frequency converters <b>310</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>310</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>310</b>-N arranged to receive an output from the pixel's detector (photodiode <b>305</b> in the illustrated example). In some cases, there can be N second transistors <b>307</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>307</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>307</b>-N, where N is a positive integer. The N second transistors can be used to provide added isolation of the pixel's detector from resetting actions occurring in the current-to-frequency (or voltage-to-frequency) converters. Additionally, the N second transistors <b>307</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>307</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>307</b>-N can be used to select one or more of the converters <b>310</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>310</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>310</b>-N for processing of the signal from the photodiode <b>305</b>. The converters can be as described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, and their description need not be repeated.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to some embodiments, outputs from the converters <b>310</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>310</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>310</b>-N may connect to a multiplexer <b>340</b> that can be controlled with a digital input signal M<sub>in </sub>applied to a control port. The control signal Min can select which input port connects to an output port of the multiplexer. In some implementations, the multiplexer <b>340</b> can be a N:<b>1</b> multiplexer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates an example case in which the pixel's counters <b>330</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>330</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>330</b>-M can be shared by (e.g., dynamically assigned to) any of the converters <b>310</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>310</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>310</b>-N. In some cases, a multiplexer <b>340</b> may not be used for some or all converters and one or more of the converters may have separate counter(s) that are dedicated or statically assigned to each converter. Other circuit arrangements are also possible. For example, a first group of counters or a single counter in a pixel may be dedicated to one converter or shared by a first group of converters, and a second group of counters or a second single counter in a pixel may be dedicated to one converter or shared by a second group of converters.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Adding additional converters can provide redundancy in pixels and improve fabrication yields. For example, if one of the converters fails in a pixel due to microfabrication processes, another converter can be selected for the pixel so that all pixels in the array of pixel integrated circuits can be used. In some implementations, the converters <b>310</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>310</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>310</b>-N within a pixel can be configured differently (to exhibit different gain, frequency characteristics, power consumption, capacitance value for capacitor C<sub>0</sub>, etc. This can provide improved coverage with the same computational pixel imager for different signal conditions and operating conditions including but not limited to gain, noise, power, and maximum detectable frequency modulations.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Adding additional converters and counters can also support multi-thread processing operations described herein. For example, a signal from a pixel's detector (e.g., photodiode <b>305</b>) can be processed by one, two, or more converters and two or more counters (which may be in separate groups of counters), such that different functional operations are perfoimed on parallel computational threads with the pixel's counters. Some of the functional operations can include hit operations such as, but not limited to, add, subtract, complement, shift, compare, and rotate.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts some additional data-handling circuitry that can be included with a computational pixel imager. A computational pixel imager <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may include circuitry that permits the orthogonal transfer of accumulated counts on counters throughout the array <b>406</b> of pixel integrated circuits. The orthogonal transfer of count values can be accomplished by shifting count values from a pixel's counter(s) to any one of the pixel's four nearest-neighbor pixels' counters, as described further below. For illustrative purposes, each shaded rectangle <b>402</b> within the array <b>406</b> depicts approximately an area occupied by a pixel, though in an actual device there can be thousands to millions of pixels. According to some implementations, digital counts can be transferred through column-transfer data lines <b>420</b> and/or through row-transfer data lines <b>430</b> to other pixels or to the data handlers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b>. In some implementations, multiplexers can be included to serialize data from multiple column-transfer data lines <b>420</b> and/or row-transfer data lines <b>430</b> that is sent to the data handlers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> and/or off chip. For example, one or more M:1 multiplexers (where M can be any integer value of 2 or greater) can be used to serialize data from multiple row-transfer data lines <b>430</b> onto single data lines that provides pixel data to one or more of the data handlers.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">By shifting data along rows or columns, any result or count value from a counter within the array <b>406</b> may be transferred to another counter in a different pixel within the array <b>406</b> or to the data handlers. Such transfer capability along with programmability of the counters (increment, decrement) and control of count accumulation times can allow digital signal processing operations to be performed within the array <b>406</b>. Digital signal processing operations that may be performed within the array can include, but are not limited to, threshold filtering, high-pass filtering, low-pass filtering, edge-detection filtering, match filtering, spatial filtering, temporal filtering, or spatio-temporal filtering, smoothing, differentiation, data compression, time-domain integration, image correlation, and convolution.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, match filtering may be implemented by developing a filter kernel for cross correlation with objects in an imaged scene (e.g., a person's iris in a personal identity system, a facial image, a target object). Convolution of a kernel with an image can be implemented as a series of count accumulations (which may increment and decrement counts) and counter value orthogonal transfers. A correlated or convolved image can then be thresholded by compare logic for detections (e.g., detection of an iris or target object). Data transmitted from the array could be raw cross-correlation or convolution results, or may be only data associated with the detections alone which could reduce the amount of data transmitted and subsequently processed. In another aspect, a signal from a steering and/or motion-sensing mechanism may be used to shift accumulated counts in an array synchronously with the overall motion of an imaging system to enable time-domain integration. Similar control of shifting counts can also enable image stabilization for environments where the imaging system may undergo unwanted vibrations. In some embodiments, non-uniformity correction for an imaging array may be performed by counting down for a frame period while viewing a flat, extended source (e.g., a mechanical shutter). After the background scene is acquired, the counters can be configured to count up while the scene data is acquired. After a frame period, only signal and noise data will be present and any systematic non-uniformity of the imager will be cancelled. Non-uniformity correction may employ a 50% duty cycle for scene and background image acquisition.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, there may be more than one column-transfer data line <b>420</b> and more than one row-transfer data line <b>430</b> per pixel so that data from multiple counters within a pixel can he transferred in parallel to multiple counters in adjacent pixels. For example, a count value from a first counter in a first pixel can be transferred to a first counter in an adjacent pixel while a count value from a second counter in the first pixel can be transferred to a second counter in an adjacent pixel. In some cases, data serializers may be included in each pixel integrated circuit to send count values from multiple counters within the pixel serially over a signal row and/or column-transfer data line.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Data handlers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> may comprise additional transistor circuitry that is configured to provide additional data-processing operations and/or control of data transfer and programming of the pixel integrated circuits <b>120</b>. For example, data handlers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> may include additional registers and data serializers to read data from and onto row and column data-transfer lines <b>430</b>, <b>420</b>. Data handlers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> may also include logic gates to enable control of the exposure period duration, counter direction, and/or threshold voltage reference V<sub>ref</sub>. In some implementations, data handlers can be configured to perform threshold detection, compare, match filtering, and data selection functions. In some cases, data handlers can be configured to determine a read-out time for selected rows and/or columns (as may be used in connection with infinite dynamic range pixels described below, for example). Data handlers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> may also include input/output data lines I/O<sub>1</sub>, I/O<sub>2</sub>, I/O<sub>3</sub>, and I/O<sub>4 </sub>that can be used to send processed or unprocessed signals, for example, to an external analyzer or processor for further data processing and analysis. In some implementations, one or more of the data handlers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> may be located on a same chip as the array <b>406</b> of pixel integrated circuits.

According to some embodiments, the array <b>406</b> of pixel integrated circuits and data handlers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> can be manufactured using complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) microfabrication processes.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates one example of how multiple counters <b>530</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>530</b>-<b>2</b> in one pixel <b>502</b> of a computational pixel imager may be connected to counters in adjacent pixels. Although only two counters are illustrated within the pixel <b>502</b>, a pixel can include more than two counters in some implementations. Additional counters can be connected in a same way to counters in adjacent pixels. In some implementations, the counters can be ripple counters, though other types of counters can be used in other embodiments. In some cases, counters may be implemented with D flip-flops for each bit and the flip-flops can be connected in series with an output of one flip-flop connected to an input of a next flip-flop.

No. 9,768,785 as described in connection with FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 in that patent, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to some embodiments, multiple counters are connected to neighboring counters in a way such that counters operated in a particular manner for image acquisition or performing a signal-processing function can shift count values to other counters anywhere in the array that are operated in the same manner. In some implementations, the shifting of counter values may be through nearest neighbor shifts. For example, a first counter <b>530</b>-<b>1</b> operated in a first manner in a first pixel <b>502</b> may shift its count value to a first counter operated in a same manner in a first nearest neighbor pixel, whereas a second counter <b>530</b>-<b>2</b> operated in a second manner in a first pixel <b>502</b> may shift its count value to a second counter operated in a same manner in a second nearest neighbor pixel. The first nearest neighbor pixel can be the same or different than the second nearest neighbor pixel. An example of a first manner of counter operation may be raw image acquisition where the corresponding first counters continuously count up during an exposure period. An example of a second manner of counter operation may be temporal filtering to detect changes in pixel values by modulated signals or moving objects where a count value is incremented for half an exposure period and then decremented for half an exposure period. Other manners of counter operation are possible as described above and below. By repeated nearest neighbor shifts, along rows and columns, a value on one counter can be shifted to another corresponding counter anywhere in the array.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the counters can be configured to function as both counters and shift registers. Further counter values from multiple counters <b>530</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>530</b>-<b>2</b> in a pixel <b>502</b> can be passed over separate data lines (e.g., row data-shift lines <b>551</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>552</b>-<b>2</b>) to multiple corresponding counters in an adjacent pixel. Counter values can be passed to adjacent pixels in either direction within a row or column along different data-shift lines (e.g., data-shift lines <b>551</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>551</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>551</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>551</b>-<b>4</b>). The data-shift lines may also be referred to as row or column buses. Additionally, counter values for pixels at an edge of the array can be passed to edge logic for read-out and/or data processing via the data-shift lines. The data-shift lines may be parallel data lines (such that count values are passed in parallel) or serial data lines. For serial transmission of count values, b:1 multiplexers for b-bit counters may be included in the pixel after the counter output to place count values serially onto data-shift lines. In some embodiments, shift multiplexers <b>540</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>540</b>-<b>2</b> can be included in each pixel, connected to counter outputs, and controlled by signals applied to inputs M<b>1</b><sub>in</sub>, M<b>2</b><sub>in </sub>from edge logic to direct counter values to one of the neighboring pixels. Similarly, input multiplexers <b>510</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>510</b>-<b>2</b> can be connected to data inputs of the counters <b>530</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>530</b>-<b>2</b> to receive and place count values from neighboring pixels' counters on counters <b>530</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>530</b>-<b>2</b> within the pixel. Input multiplexers <b>540</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>540</b>-<b>2</b> may also be controlled by signals applied to inputs M<b>3</b><sub>in</sub>, M<b>3</b><sub>in </sub>from edge logic.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Another example of inter-pixel counter connections is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. In some embodiments, values from multiple counters within a pixel can be multiplexed onto a same row or column data-shift line with counter-output multiplexers <b>560</b>. The counter-output multiplexers <b>560</b> can be M:1 multiplexers, where M is an integer value of 2 or greater and corresponds to the number of independently controlled counters within the pixels. Additionally, data received from adjacent pixels can be received by a single input multiplexer <b>510</b>. The input multiplexer <b>510</b> can be a 4:M multiplexer, where M is an integer value of 2 or greater and corresponds to the number of independently controlled counters within the pixels.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example method of multi-thread processing <b>600</b> that can be performed with an array <b>406</b> of pixel integrated circuits having multiple programmable counters in each pixel and arranged to shift values to counters in adjacent pixels as described above. According to some embodiments, a method <b>600</b> can include acts of initiating (act <b>610</b>) an exposure of a detector array of a computational pixel imager to generate image data. During an exposure period (e.g., a signal acquisition period that can be used to form an image frame), multiple counters in each of a plurality of pixels can accumulate (act <b>620</b>) count values. The count values for at least some of the counters can be accumulated independently of count values accumulated by other counters and can differ from count values accumulated by other counters, even within a same pixel. In some implementations, the counters within a same pixel can be programmed to operate differently. For example, two counters within a pixel may be programmed to increment and decrement counts periodically at a same frequency but with phases shifted by 90 for in-phase and quadrature (I-Q) detection of a modulated optical signal whereas a third counter can be programmed to increment counts for one-half of an exposure period and to decrement counts for one-half of an exposure period to detect non-stationary objects in an imaged scene. Accumulation of counts in counters can terminate when and exposure is terminated (act <b>630</b>) ending the exposure period. In some cases, one or more counters within a pixel can be programmed to accumulate counts in response to exposure of the pixel's detector, whereas one or more other counters within the pixel can be programmed to perform other operations on data previously accumulated or provided to the counter(s) (e.g., shift operations, bit rotation operations, ones complement, addition, subtraction, compare, read-out, data receive, etc.) Such different in-pixel operations on the counters can be in response to multiple threads that execute simultaneously on the system.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">After counts have been accumulated in multiple counters, two or more independent data-processing operations can be executed on multiple threads simultaneously with the pixel integrated circuit array. For example, first image data (first counter values) acquired with first counters from the pixels can be processed (act <b>640</b>-<b>1</b>) using shift operations and/or any of the above counter operations to perform a first signal-processing function (e.g., spatial filtering). Additionally, second image data (second counter values) acquired with second counters from the pixels can be processed (act <b>640</b>-<b>2</b>) using shift operations and/or any of the above counter operations to perform a second signal-processing function (e.g., temporal filtering). In some implementations, the different signal-processing functions can be performed, at least in part, while count values are being accumulated in a subsequent exposure period (as may be the case for convolution, correlation, time domain integration for a deterministically moving camera, or image stabilization functions). In some cases, raw count values may be accumulated as new image data on one or more counters in a pixel while signal processing operations are being performed with other counters, such that the computational pixel imager has essentially no dead time in imaging a scene or successive scenes.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the multiple execution threads (acts <b>640</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>640</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>640</b>-N) can execute simultaneously. For imaging systems in which outputs and inputs of multiple counters are connected across pixels with separate, parallel data-shift lines (e.g., lines <b>551</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>552</b>-<b>2</b>) as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, at least some signal-processing operations for different counters performing different functions can occur at a same time (e.g., on same clock cycles that drive data transfer or arithmetic operations). For imaging systems in which outputs and inputs of multiple counters are connected across pixels using multiplexers to serialize counter data onto shared data-shift lines as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, at least some signal-processing operations for different counters performing different functions may be interleaved in time and occur on alternating clock cycles. In either case, multiple execution threads (acts <b>640</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>640</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>640</b>-N) can execute concurrently on a pixel integrated circuit chip. When one or more of the multiple execution threads are completed, data for the corresponding counters can be read out of the array <b>406</b> of pixel integrated circuits over column-transfer data lines <b>420</b> and/or row-transfer data lines <b>430</b> for display, analysis, storage, and/or further signal processing.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, a computational pixel imaging device <b>100</b> of the above-described embodiments can include counters that are configured for infinite dynamic range sensing. The dynamic range of an image sensor describes the difference between the brightest and dimmest object that can be detected and discerned in an image. Conventional digital imaging approaches typically cannot achieve high dynamic ranges over three or four orders of magnitude, for example. Digitizing in-pixel, as is done for a computational pixel imaging device <b>100</b>, can improve the dynamic range capability over conventional digital imaging sensors. However, digitizing in the pixel for high dynamic ranges presents challenges when trying to implement with small pixel sizes. To achieve a high dynamic range, the size of counters must be increased. An advanced CMOS process node may be used to reduce transistor and counter size, but such advanced microfabrication processes may be prohibitively expensive in some instances. Other approaches to reducing the size of digital-pixels (e.g., to the 10 &#x3bc;m size or smaller) is desirable to reduce the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of imaging sensors and imaging devices. The inventors have recognized and appreciated the finite-bit counters (e.g., an 8-bit counter) can be configured for unlimited dynamic range.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">An example of circuitry for an infinite dynamic range counter <b>710</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, according to some embodiments. As depicted in the drawing, circuitry for an infinite dynamic range counter <b>710</b> can include a b-bit counter, read/store logic <b>730</b> that is in communication with the counter, and memory <b>750</b>. The counter <b>710</b> can comprise any type of counter described above, such as a ripple counter or synchronous counter or other types of counters. The read/store logic <b>730</b> may be embodied as processing logic that could be located on-chip or off-chip and that is configured to determine when to read the most significant bit or group of most significant bits of one or more counters of a computational pixel imaging device <b>100</b> and store in memory <b>750</b> information indicating that counters have rolled-over in count value one or more times. In some cases, read/store logic <b>730</b> can be implemented as on-chip logic gates or field-programmable gate arrays located within each pixel, or located at an edge of an array <b>406</b> of pixel integrated circuits (e.g., in one or more of data handlers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to some embodiments, an infinite dynamic range counter <b>710</b> can comprise a b-bit counter in which the most significant bit (MSB) <b>720</b>-<i>b </i>is interrogated differently than the lower bits <b>720</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>720</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>720</b>-<i>a</i>. The size of the counter (value of b) can be any integer value of 2 or greater. In some implementations, the size of the counter is between 3 bits and 25 bits, though larger counters may be used in some cases. In various embodiments, the MSB <b>720</b>-<i>b </i>is interrogated at a higher read-out rate than the lower bits. For long exposure periods and/or high signal levels, counters in some pixels can reach their maximum count value and roll-over to a value of 0 and continue counting up. If the roll-over is undetected, signal information is lost. By reading out the MSB or group of MSBs value(s) at a higher rate than the lower bits, roll-over events can be detected and recorded, so that subsequent image data read out for all bits of counters can be corrected to reflect accurate signal levels. A group of MSBs may be a counter's MSB and the next N lower bits (e.g., bits b, b-1, b-2, b-N) where N is a positive, non-zero integer.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some implementations, outputs from counters can be connected in parallel across corresponding counters in an array <b>406</b> of pixel integrated circuits, as described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. In some cases, bit values for counters may be connected in parallel across corresponding counters in an array <b>406</b>. For example, the data-shift lines may comprise parallel data lines <b>730</b>, <b>740</b> with the number of parallel data lines equaling the number of counter bits. Additional multiplexers may be used for each of the parallel data lines. As such, a MSB from each counter in a row or column may be connected to a same data-shift line. In some cases, values of MSBs can be read from shared data-shift lines using a synchronous cadence read-out, for example. In other embodiments, the counter may be configured to pass bits between each counter unit that is used to record a bit, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, for example, for as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,768,785. In such cases, bit values for counters may not be connected in parallel across corresponding counters in an array <b>406</b>. Instead, bit values may be shifted sequentially onto a same data-shift line.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In operation and according to some embodiments, an infinite dynamic range counter can work as follows. While counters accumulate count values during an exposure period, the values (logic levels) of the counters' MSBs (or groups of MSBs) can be read and monitored by read/store logic <b>730</b> over MSB data lines <b>740</b>. In some implementations, when a counter's MSB toggles to a logic 1 state (or group of MSBs toggle to a predetermined value), the value may be signaled to and/or detected by read/store logic <b>730</b> by placing the value on one or more data lines (e.g., placing a MSB's value on data line <b>740</b>). In some cases, a bit's value may be placed on a data line <b>740</b> by in-pixel logic, such as an AND gate, for example). In some cases, all MSB bit values (or groups of MSBs values) for all counters in the array <b>406</b> may then be destructively read out so that the MSB values that have toggled to 1 (or a predetermined value) are read and reset to 0. A toggling of the MSB (or group of MSBs) can indicate a roll-over of the b-1 bits (or b-N-1) and an upcoming roll-over for the b-bit counter. A record of a counter's toggling or roll-over and address can be stored in memory <b>750</b> by the read/store logic <b>730</b>. The address can be determined from the read address used to access the counter when all counters in the array are read or all counters in a row or column are read. In some cases, the address may be determined based upon clock cycles used to read counters in a row and/or column. Read/store logic may reset counters' MSB value(s) over control lines (e.g., control line <b>742</b>). The counters are then allowed to continue accumulating count values until a next MSB or group of MSBs toggles. The number of togglings or roll-overs for each counter can be accumulated in memory <b>750</b>, where each toggling represents a count of 2<sup>(b-1) </sup>(or 2<sup>(b-N-1)</sup>). For count down operation, roll-over events may be detected by detecting a logic 0 level, or by inverting the MSB output and detecting a logic 1 level.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, in-pixel logic or edge logic may be configured to detect, for example, a falling edge or negative edge of the b<sup>th </sup>bit. For example, a monitor flip-flop may be configured to latch a logic 1 value to its output when the MSB value rolls over from 1 to 0. Additional in-pixel logic may assert output of the monitor flip-flop on a data line that can be detected and read. The monitor flip-flop can then be reset to detect a next falling edge of the MSB. In such embodiments, each detected logic 1 level from the monitor flip-flop indicates 2<sup>b </sup>counts and the MSB does not need to be reset.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, instead of reading the entire array of counters after detecting a logic 1 on an MSB data line <b>740</b>, only MSB values of counters (or monitor flip-flop outputs) in a row and/or column containing the counter that has toggled may be destructively read. Such a strategy may reduce read-out times and avoid reading of counters that have not yet had an MSB toggle. In yet other embodiments, time-gated row and column monitoring may be performed by read/store logic to detect and determine the location and address in the array <b>406</b> of a counter whose MSB value has toggled, and only that counter (or monitor flip-flop) will be destructively read.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In alternative embodiments, read-out times of counters' MSB values may be predicted based on prior count accumulations. For example, a first exposure over a first time period may be performed for a short duration in which none of the counters' MSB values roll over. First count values can accumulate on the counters during this exposure period. In some cases, times for reading and resetting MSB values from one or more counters may be determined from the (b-1)<sup>th </sup>hit value (or other hit's value) of a relevant counter in the array. For example, when the (b-1)<sup>th </sup>bit value (or other bit value) of a first counter in the array toggles to a logic 1 level and the duration of the exposure period is known, a count rate for the counter can be determined. The count rate can be used to predict, on a subsequent longer exposure, when the counter's MSB value will toggle to a logic 1 level, e.g., and must be read (e.g., accumulate a roll-over count in memory <b>750</b>) and/or reset. Accordingly, the count rates for all counters in an array <b>406</b> can be determined and used to predict when one or more counter's in the array will roll over. The information can then be used to determine, for longer exposures of a same scene, when to read the MSBs of the counters, either globally (reading all counters' MSBs sequentially in a read-out) or individually.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some embodiments, the duration of the first exposure may be estimated based on prior images, or several exposure periods may be tried and linearity of increasing counts between at least two successive exposures checked to determine whether any of the counters have rolled over. If all counters have increased linearly or nearly-linearly in two successive exposures, then either exposure results may be used to estimate when roll-overs could occur.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some implementations, a first exposure' s duration may be determined and terminated automatically. For example, a counter's MSB value may be asserted on a row or column data-shift line as soon as the MSB toggles to a logic 1 level. The value may be asserted by in-pixel logic. Edge logic may detect the logic level and terminate the exposure period. Read/store logic <b>730</b> may then read-out all counters and process their count values to determine count-accumulation rates for each counter. The count-accumulation rates can then be used to determine when to read MSB values from one or more counters during a subsequent longer exposure period of a scene during which at least some counters' values would roll over.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In yet further embodiments of an infinite dynamic range counter, each counter may be divided equally or unequally into two bit groupings and each grouping may be used to accumulate counts. In such embodiments, the bit groupings may be read at different times and total counts accumulated in memory located outside the array of pixels. For example, a first of the two bit groupings (e.g., bit <b>1</b> to bit (b-N-<b>1</b>)) can be read and reset at a first time, and subsequently the second of the bit groupings (bit b-N to bit b) can be read and reset a second time, and the process repeated multiple times during an exposure period for an image. In some cases, the reading and resetting may alternate between the two bit groups for each successive read. In other cases, the read and reset rates may differ for the two groups. The read and reset rate for a bit group may be determined by any of the above-described methods for an infinite dynamic range counter.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">For computational pixel imagers that employ infinite dynamic range counting, additional operations may be executed on count accumulations that have been recorded in memory <b>750</b>. For example, when on-chip data processing or data-shift operations occur (such as for filtering), then such operations can be mirrored or complied with using the count accumulation data in memory. For example, if counter values are shifted in the array <b>406</b> of a computational pixel imager, then addresses associated with off-array count accumulations may be updated to reflect the on-array shift of counter data.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further details of example circuitry for a counter configured for infinite dynamic range operation are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>. In some implementations, a b-bit counter <b>710</b> may be configured as series-connected D or JK flip-flops <b>725</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>725</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>725</b>-<i>a</i>, <b>725</b>-<i>b </i>with reconfigurable data inputs D and reconfigurable clock inputs CLK. Each flip-flop can be used to store one bit. For count accumulation corresponding to a received signal, the flip-flop clock inputs can be reconfigured on-the-fly, so that the series of flip-flops operates as a ripple counter. For example, pulses <b>325</b> from the current-to-frequency converter <b>310</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) can be applied to the clock input of the first flip-flop <b>725</b>-<b>1</b> (least significant bit) and used to toggle the output of that flip-flop. The output of each flip-flop may then drive the clock of the next flip-flop to form a ripple counter. For read-out, the clocks of each flip-flop may be connected to a same read-out clock and the data inputs D connected to the data outputs Q of the preceding flip-flop, so that data can be shifted across and out of the counter <b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">For any of the above-described embodiments of counters, a tri-state buffer <b>770</b> may be used to place the output value Q of the flip-flop <b>725</b>-<i>b </i>corresponding to the MSB on a data line <b>740</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>. In some cases, additional tri-state buffers may be used for other flip-flops. For configurations where a counter is adapted for infinite dynamic range counting and wherein a toggling of the MSB to a logic 1 level can be automatically sensed, an AND gate <b>775</b> (or analogous logic circuitry) can be used to monitor the output of the MSB flip-flop <b>725</b>-<i>b </i>and activate the tri-state buffer <b>770</b> when the MSB toggles to a logic 1 level. An advantage of using the tri-state buffer <b>770</b> is that a flip-flop's output Q can be isolated from the data line when the output Q is at a logic 0 level. In some implementations, the data line <b>740</b> may be a separate and dedicated data line for monitoring only the value of the MSB (e.g., separate from a data line that is used to read out the entire counter value or to provide orthogonal shifting of counter values in the array <b>406</b>). In other implementations, the data line <b>740</b> may be a same data line that is used to read out the entire counter value or to provide orthogonal shifting of counter values.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Counters configured for infinite dynamic range counting may be included in computational pixel imagers having multiple counters in each pixel as described above (e.g., for multi-thread signal processing). Counters configured for infinite dynamic range counting may also be included in computational pixel imagers configured for down-sampling of modulated signals, as described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Example read-out rates for MSB values are plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> for various count accumulations rates from 1 MHz to 20 MHz and counter bit depths. The plotted MSB read-out rates correspond to rates required to avoid missing a roll-over event. The lines of count accumulations rates are, from top to bottom, 20 MHz, 10 MHz, 5 MHz, 2 MHz, and 1 MHz.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">By monitoring, reading out MSB values of counters, and recording roll-over events in memory <b>750</b>, long exposure durations can be performed and/or scenes with high intensity sources can be viewed and captured with high dynamic range. Counters may roll over multiple times during a high-dynamic range exposure period, and the number of roll-over events for a counter accumulated in memory <b>750</b>. The number of roll-over events stored in memory <b>750</b> are in quanta of 2<sup>(b-1) </sup>counts. At the end of a high-dynamic range exposure period, the number of counts for a counter indicated in memory <b>750</b> are combined with the final count value for the counter to obtain the total number of counts. By using the above approach for predicted read rates, the inventors have shown in simulations that total counts in excess of 10<sup>6 </sup>can be accurately recorded for an 8-bit counter used in a pixel. The count accumulation rate was 10 MHz and the MSB read-out rate was 80 kHz. In this way, the dynamic range of a sensor can be increased to essentially any value, which is limited by the exposure duration or size of off-array memory <b>750</b>. Memory <b>750</b> may be off chip in some cases or on-chip in circuitry located around an edge of the array <b>406</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Additional aspects are possible with a computational pixel imaging device <b>100</b>. For example, pixel integrated circuits <b>120</b> (which can include multiple counters as describe above and/or infinite dynamic range counter circuitry) can be configured for digital pixel down-sampling in some implementations. For some applications, it can be desirable to detect the frequency or measure the phase of an intensity-modulated light source that is present in a scene or used to illuminate objects in a scene viewed by a computational pixel imaging device <b>100</b>. For example, the phase of amplitude-modulated light returned from an object can contain information regarding the distance of the object from the observer. In-pixel digitization with two counters may be used to determine phase of amplitude-modulated light. For example, the two counters can be controlled to cyclically count up and down at a same frequency as the modulated source, but one counter's phase is shifted by 90&#xb0; with respect to the other counter (e.g., in-phase and quadrature detection). A limitation of using amplitude-modulated light to measure distance is that relatively high modulation frequencies (e.g., MHz to GHz frequencies) may be needed to achieve high distance resolution. The use of high modulation frequencies can challenge the ability of current-generation, up/down counting, digital-pixel electronics. In addition, the power requirements for detecting high-frequency modulations can be unacceptably high for some embodiments. The inventors have recognized and appreciated that apparatus and methods can be employed to adapt sensors of computational pixel imaging devices to down-sample the modulated signals so that relatively low frequency up/down counters can be used to detect phases of modulated signals at much higher frequencies.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an example of a pixel integrated circuit <b>920</b> adapted for digital down-sampling.

In some embodiments, a detector <b>905</b> of a computational pixel imager may be adapted to be biased with a modulated supply <b>910</b> that can provide, for example, a modulated bias or supply voltage to the detector. The modulated supply <b>910</b> may be located off-chip and provided to one or more pixels' detectors via bias lines.

The object <b>904</b> can be in a field of view that is imaged onto an array of detectors in a computations pixel imager. In some implementations, the light source <b>902</b> may comprise a laser, one or more laser diodes, one or more light-emitting diodes, etc. that is (are) driven by a second modulated supply <b>912</b>.

In such embodiments, a computational pixel imager may include one or both of the difference-frequency source and high-frequency source. Further, an output from the difference-frequency source can be used to drive count-up and count-down cycles of one or more counters instead of an output from a mixer.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The difference (&#x394;f) between the two modulation frequencies f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2 </sub>call be significantly smaller than the value of either frequency. For example, the difference can be tens or hundreds of kilohertz (e.g., between 10 kHz and 500 kHz) whereas the modulation frequencies can be in the megahertz to multi-gigahertz range. Modulation of the bias on the detector can change the sensitivity of the detector and/or effectively gate the detector on and off. The detector <b>910</b> can then act as a mixer and demodulate the received modulated optical signal so that the counters <b>330</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>330</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>330</b>-M can detect at the difference frequency &#x394;f. Using this technique, no loss of information from the modulated light source <b>902</b> will occur, and high-resolution distance determination and depth imagery can be achieved with low-frequency counters in pixel integrated circuits. For example, digital up-down counting during an exposure period can be performed at the difference frequency for in-phase/in-quadrature phase determination as described above. In some cases, the first and second frequencies f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2 </sub>can be provided to a mixer <b>915</b> (which may be included with a computational pixel imaging system). An output from the mixer can be used to generate a clock signal with clock generation circuitry <b>917</b>.

A benefit to this technique is that pixel and device power can remain low while still measuring the return phase of a reflected signal.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some implementations, an optical element (lens, diffractive optical element, etc.) can be placed in front of the optical source <b>902</b> to project a pattern of light onto the object. The pattern may be, for example, an array of spots or lines. Distortion of the pattern and/or distances to each portion of the pattern can be detected with a computational pixel imager, even though returned light from the pattern may be dim or not visible to the naked eye due to other illumination of a field of view. Analysis of the pattern distortion can be used to determine three-dimensional geometry of the object as well as one or more distances to the object.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The inventors have recognized and appreciated that a computational pixel imaging device, for example, the computational pixel imaging device <b>100</b> of the above-described embodiments can be adapted for event-based imaging . Instead of or in addition to capturing and digitizing intensity data, a pixel integrated circuit can be configured to detect changes in received light intensity and return a null signal or not report a signal when no changes arc detected. A meaningful change in detected light intensity (e.g., a change greater than a predetermined amount or threshold value) may be referred to as an &#x201c;event.&#x201d; Such changes may be of interest in certain imaging applications (e.g., to emphasize detection of moving objects in an imaged scene). Unlike conventional event-based vision devices, a computational pixel imaging device adapted for event-based imaging can provide event images, each of which may include data about multiple events detected by pixels in an array during an image acquisition period, which may include an exposure period as described above. An image acquisition period for a computational pixel imager may comprise time associated with signal acquisition (e.g., during an exposure period) and time associated with on-chip signal processing to prepare image data for read out. The data associated with each event in an event image may indicate the address of the pixel that detected the event and/or the magnitude of the change detected by the pixel. Additionally, only data associated with pixels that have detected an event may be transmitted for further processing rather than an entire frame of data containing information from every pixel in an imaging array. An event-based computational pixel imaging device that transmits sparse pixel data, at least part of the time, can reduce latency and power, and improve data rate and dynamic range over conventional event-based vision devices.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an example method <b>1000</b> of event-based imaging that can be performed with an event-based computational pixel integrated circuit, according to some embodiments.

In the normal imaging mode, the counter may count in a single direction, for example, either incrementing counts or decrementing counts, during an exposure period like the counters <b>330</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>330</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . <b>330</b>-M such that a digital number output by the counter indicates the intensity of radiation captured by a detector coupled to the counter (e.g., a photodiode <b>305</b>).

For example, the counter configured for event-based imaging may be configured to decrement a digital number and then increment the digital number. As another example, the first and second portions of the exposure period may be divided into sub-portions. In some embodiments, the counter configured for event-based imaging may be configured to switch between incrementing and decrementing a digital number between the sub-portions, without resetting or otherwise processing the digital number between the sub-portions of the exposure period.

In some embodiments, the first portion and the second portion of the exposure period may be of a same duration (e.g., one half of the exposure period, one-quarter of an exposure period, one-twentieth of an exposure period, etc.). An advantageous aspect of the computational pixel imager is that the incrementing and decrementing portions can be programmed to any suitable value. Smaller values can allow for event detection of more rapidly changing events.

Conventional inter-frame video compression is processed down-stream, after collecting full frames, and by comparing successive full frames and generating change detection masks. A computational pixel imager is capable of on-imager, inter-frame video compression that can reduce down-stream processing by providing compressed image data directly off the imaging device.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In some embodiments, a multi-mode, computational pixel imaging device may collect key frames in a normal imaging mode and transmit the key frame data off the imager at a low frame rate. The imager can also collect delta frames in the event-based imaging mode, as described above, and transmit delta frame data off the imager at a higher frame rate but a much lower data rate that transfer of full frame data. Full high-rate motion video may be reconstructed using the key frames and delta frames. Unlike conventional event-based vision cameras that output asynchronous events, inter-frame video compression on a computational pixel imager can retain all context of a scene by augmenting the key frames with delta frames. Inter-frame video compression using a computational pixel imager can produce high-speed, low transmission bandwidth motion image video for various applications, such as those requiring rapid decision making.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows example images associated with inter-frame video compression and reconstruction, according to some embodiments. In various embodiments, a computational pixel imager can acquire two types of image data: key frame image data (for which data from one frame is rendered as a static key frame image <b>1701</b> depicted in the drawing), and event or delta frame image data (for which data from one frame is rendered as a static delta frame image <b>1702</b> depicted in the drawing). The key frames can be collected at a first frame rate (16 Hz in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>), and the delta frames can be collected at a second frame rate (0.5 kHz in the example) that is faster than the first frame rate. Other frame rates can be used. The key frames can be collected by a computational pixel imaging device having counters in each pixel operating in a normal imaging mode. The delta frames can be collected by the computational pixel imaging device having counters in each pixel operating in any of the event-based imaging modes described above. An overlay of a key frame with delta frames is depicted as an overlay image <b>1704</b>. Because the delta frames contain small amounts of data, the overlaid images are dominated by the key frame. However, motion of a tossed ball is visible in the overlaid image <b>1704</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The key frame and delta frame image data, as acquired, can be packaged for transmission off chip as temporally compressed video-image data. However, the acquired data may be filtered and/or processed on-chip, as described above, to improve signal and image quality. In some cases, the key frame and delta frame image data may be transmitted off the imager for down-stream processing by, for example, a controller <b>250</b> or other device. The compressed video-image data can be reconstructed into a video <b>1706</b> (illustrated as a static image) by a device adapted to render a video on a display, such as a television, computer, or smart phone. A video may be reconstructed by rendering a key frame and then updating pixels in the key frame in accordance with changes detected by the delta frames. The frame rate of the reconstructed video may be at the delta frame rate, which can be a much higher frame rate than conventional frame rates, since the delta frames contain significantly less data. Such compression and reconstruction enables transmitting and rendering of high-speed video with lower transmission bandwidth.
