As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail below, with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Overview of System Configuration</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">First, overview of a configuration of a tracking system <b>1</b> is described according to one or more exemplary embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of an example of the tracking system according to the present embodiment. In this disclosure, the case in which electricity, which is an example of energy, is used as an example of an asset is described. In this disclosure, the asset is an item that has value. The ownership of the asset and the production method of the asset are managed using asset information described later. The asset information is information on the asset, such as an ownership of the asset. Since the electricity, as an example of energy, is used as the asset in this example, the asset information may be referred to as energy information. Further, as described below, the transaction information is generated to generate or change the asset information. Since the transaction information is used to track ownership of the asset, the transaction information may be referred to as tracking information.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Explanation on Each Entity</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the tracking system <b>1</b> is used by a producer Aa of electricity, a producer Ab of electricity, a consumer Ca of electricity, an intermediary agent Da, and a certification authority E.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Producer Aa, an example of a supplier, is an entity that produces electricity from solar light, as one example of an entity that produces electricity from renewable energy resource (referred to as &#x201c;green power&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Producer Ab, an example of a supplier, is an entity that produces electricity from oil as an example of fossil fuel. The supplier may be a union that purchases assets (items) from each producer and resells the assets (items).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The consumer Ca, an example of a user, is an entity that consumes electricity supplied from the producer Aa or Ab. In case the asset is not consumed like electricity, such as in the case of a real estate property, the user may be an owner who currently owns the asset.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The intermediary agent Da is an entity that intermediates transfer of ownership of electricity between different entities.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The certification authority E is a public institution such as a national or local public entity that certifies a certain type of electricity production method. Electricity production methods can be determined based on, for example, a type of energy resource used to produce electricity. Assuming that the electricity production method is defined by a type of energy resource, examples of electricity production method include a production method using solar (such as solar light or solar heat), a production method using wind (such as wind power), a production method using biomass, a production method using geothermal power, a production method using hydroelectric resources, a production method using heat in the atmosphere, and a production method using nuclear power. Of those various types of electricity production methods, the electricity production methods using renewable energy resources, such as solar light, solar heat, wind power, biomass, geothermal power, hydropower, and heat in the atmosphere are grouped into a production method using renewable energy. The electricity production methods using petroleum, coal, and liquefied natural gas are grouped into a production method using conventional energy such as fossil fuel. Compared to the production method using conventional energy, the production method using renewable energy emits almost no CO<sub>2</sub>, which is a cause for global warming. That is, renewable energy is an energy resource that is environmentally friendly. In this disclosure, as examples of renewable energy resource, solar light or heat, wind power, biomass, geothermal power, hydropower, and heat in the atmosphere are referred, for the descriptive purposes. Further, as examples of conventional energy resource, fossil fuel, such as oil, coal, and liquefied natural gas are referred, for the descriptive purposes.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The intermediary agent Da intermediates processing on behalf of the customer Ca.

The transaction history management table manages transaction history information, specifically, the transfer date and time, the transaction amount, the production method type, and the total transaction amount by production method type, in association. In this example, a type of resource (an energy resource) used to produce asset can be referred to as a &#x201c;production method type&#x201d; indicating that a method of producing asset using a predetermined type of resource. For example, when the asset is electricity, the &#x201c;production method type&#x201d; corresponds to a method of producing electricity from such as solar light. Although this embodiment describes a case in which one type of production method uses solar light and another type of production method uses oil, any other type of production method may be used, such as a type of production method using wind power or a type of production method using coal. Further, the above-described types of production method may be classified into one or more groups, such as the group of production method types using renewable energy or the group of production method types using fossil fuel.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Of the transaction history information, the same data items stored in the tables of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, such as the user ID, are each designated with the same item name. In this example, the transfer date and time indicates the date and time when ownership of asset is transferred, specifically, the date and time when the intermediary server <b>5</b> transfers the ownership of the asset acquired from the supplier, such as the producer, to the user such as the consumer Ca. The transaction amount indicates an amount of asset that the intermediary server <b>5</b> acquires its ownership from the supplier and provides the acquired ownership to the user. The amount of asset is represented by, for example, electric energy (kWh). The total transaction amount indicates a total amount of assets, which are produced by a specific production method and allocated to a user such as the consumer Ca for a certain duration of time (or a certain period of time), and is expressed in total electric energy (kWh), for example. The intermediary server <b>5</b> refers to the transaction history management DB <b>5004</b> to determine a production method type of asset to be allocated to the user such as the consumer Ca. For example, when a ratio of electricity having been produced using renewable energy is set to 40 by the consumer Ca, the intermediary server <b>5</b> refers to the total transaction amount in the transaction history management DB <b>5004</b>, to determine a production method type of asset to be provided to the consumer Ca.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Since the planned usage amount (for example, 20 kWh) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a planned usage amount for every hour, the transaction amount will be half the planned usage amount (for example, 10 kWh), when transferring the ownership of asset is performed every 30 minutes.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Although this embodiment describes a case in which one type of production method uses solar light and another type of production method uses oil, any other type of production method may be used, such as a type of production method using wind power or a type of production method using coal. Further, the above-described types of production method may be classified into one or more groups, such as the group of production method types using renewable energy or the group of production method types using fossil fuel.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Furthermore, the production method type is based on a type of asset production process. The type of asset production process indicates a case in which any one of processes in producing the asset such as electricity differs. In one example, even when the same energy resource, such as solar, is used to produce electricity, there are one method for producing electricity using solar light and other method for producing electricity using solar heat. In another example, as another type of production method of asset, there are one method for producing electricity using a turbine, and other method for producing electricity without using a turbine.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Each Functional Unit of Intermediary Server</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Next, each function unit of the intermediary server <b>5</b> is described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.

Accordingly, the transaction processing unit <b>96</b> continues processing to generate the third transaction information. The second transaction information additionally includes the transfer date and time when transfer of asset information is intermediated, a new owner of asset as a result of transfer, an asset ID for identifying the asset information that is transferred (transaction), and a consumed amount of asset (in this example, electricity) received at S<b>90</b>.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">Then, at S<b>105</b>, the asset processing unit <b>97</b> changes the first asset information as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. The asset processing unit <b>97</b> changes the &#x201c;available amount&#x201d; in the first asset information to the &#x201c;consumed amount&#x201d;, and changes the owner from the &#x201c;intermediary agent Da&#x201d; in the first asset information to the &#x201c;consumer Ca&#x201d;. Furthermore, since the consumed amount of asset can no longer be allocated, the asset processing unit <b>97</b> changes the transaction status from &#x201c;not transferred&#x201d; in the first asset information to &#x201c;transferred&#x201d;. However, what is different from the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is that there is a remaining amount after the transfer (NO at S<b>101</b>). Therefore, the transaction processing unit <b>96</b> calculates a remaining available amount (S<b>106</b>). In this case, the remaining available amount (here, &#x201c;4&#x201d;) can be obtained by subtracting the consumed amount (here, &#x201c;6&#x201d;) from the previous available amount (here, &#x201c;10&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">Subsequently, in order to newly generate asset information to manage remaining available amount, the transaction processing unit <b>96</b> generates third transaction information as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. Then, the transaction processing unit <b>96</b> adds a block containing the third transaction information to the chain of blocks containing the second transaction information, which is stored in the storage unit <b>9000</b> (S<b>107</b>). The asset processing unit <b>97</b> generates second asset information according to the third transaction information, and stores the second asset information in the storage unit <b>9000</b> (S<b>108</b>).</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">The processing of S<b>107</b> and S<b>108</b> is described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. The following describes an example case in which, after the intermediary server <b>5</b> changes the owner of the asset to the consumer Ca (the first asset information is changed based on the second transaction information and the third transaction information is generated), the intermediary server <b>5</b> newly stores the remaining available amount (the second asset information is generated based on the third transaction information), to manage the asset information (ownership of asset) on the remaining available amount as a subject to transfer to be intermediated by the intermediary agent Da.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">At S<b>107</b>, the transaction processing unit <b>96</b> generates the third transaction information as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. This third transaction information includes the same data items as the first transaction information, although specific values may be different from those of the first transaction information. The third transaction information includes a unique transaction ID and &#x201c;generate asset information&#x201d; as a transaction type. The third transaction information includes information on a supplier of the asset information, the provision date and time that the asset information is provided from the supplier, the available amount of asset, the production method type, and the owner of asset.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">Then, at S<b>108</b>, the asset processing unit <b>97</b> generates the second asset information as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. This second asset information have same data items as those of the first asset information, but specific values of the items may be different from those of the first asset information. Specifically, the second asset information differs from the first asset information, such that the available amount has a value calculated at S<b>106</b> (here, &#x201c;4&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">As described above, when there is a remaining available amount of asset, new asset information is generated, which indicates the remaining available amount.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">The processing then returns to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> to perform processing as described above referring to S<b>93</b> and <b>94</b>, such that description thereof is omitted.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">Intermediating Processing of Production Method Certificate</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, processing of intermediating procedure for obtaining a production method certificate is described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a sequence diagram illustrating processing of intermediating procedure for obtaining a production method certificate of asset. The consumer Ca transmits a request for obtaining a production method certificate from the certification authority E, to the intermediary agent Da. The production method certificate certifies that electricity consumed by the consumer Ca has been produced from renewable energy, such as a solar light. The following describes this processing in detail.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, according to operation of the consumer Ca on the smartphone <b>2</b><i>c</i>, the transmission and reception unit <b>21</b><i>c </i>transmits a request for obtaining a production method certificate of asset via the communication network <b>100</b> (S<b>201</b>). Accordingly, the transmission and reception unit <b>51</b> of the intermediary server <b>5</b> receives the request. This request includes a user ID for identifying the consumer Ca as the user, and transaction period information indicating a transaction time period during when transaction of asset is being carried out. For example, the consumer Ca requests for a production method certificate for a specific transaction time period, for example, from Jan. 1, 2020 to Jan. 31, 2020.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">Next, the transmission and reception unit <b>51</b> of the intermediary server <b>5</b> transmits a request for transaction information and asset information to the node <b>9</b> of the blockchain network <b>90</b> (S<b>202</b>). This request includes information on a certificate of the user (here, consumer Ca) that the intermediary server <b>5</b> previously acquires from the smartphone <b>2</b><i>c</i>, information indicating the user as the owner (here, consumer Ca), and a transaction time period. Accordingly, the transmission and reception unit <b>91</b> of the node <b>9</b> receives the request.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">The certificate of the intermediary server <b>5</b> has the same contents as that of the certificate transmitted at S<b>82</b>. Further, the transaction period information has the same contents as that of the transaction period information received at S<b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">Next, the verification unit <b>93</b> of the node <b>9</b> verifies the certificate received at S<b>202</b> (S<b>203</b>). The certificate verification is a process of determining whether or not the received certificate is a certificate of the server that is registered in advance in the node <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">The following describes the example case in which the verification result indicates that verification is successful.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">Next, the storing and reading unit <b>99</b> reads out the transaction information and the asset information in which the consumer Ca is set as the owner, within a specific transaction time period indicated by the transaction period information received at S<b>202</b> (S<b>204</b>). In this case, the storing and reading unit <b>99</b> reads out particular transaction information having the transaction date and time that falls within the specific transaction time period and the new owner of the consumer Ca. Further, the storing and reading unit <b>99</b> reads the asset information having the asset ID, which is indicated by the particular transaction information that is read.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">Then, the transmission and reception unit <b>91</b> of the node <b>9</b> transmits the requested transaction information and asset information to the intermediary server <b>5</b> (S<b>205</b>). Accordingly, the transmission and reception unit <b>51</b> of the intermediary server <b>5</b> receives the transaction information and the asset information.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">Next, at the intermediary server <b>5</b>, the creation unit <b>58</b> creates an application form to be submitted by the intermediary agent to the certification authority E, based on the transaction information and the asset information received at S<b>205</b> (S<b>206</b>). This application form is used to apply for a production method certificate to prove the type of production method for the asset.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">Subsequently, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the intermediary agent Da sends the application form created at S<b>206</b> to the certification authority E by mail or the like (S<b>1</b>). Then, the certification authority E creates a production method certificate of asset, which certifies that 40% of electricity consumed by the consumer Ca has been produced from renewable energy such as solar light, and sends the production method certificate by mail or the like to the intermediary agent (S<b>2</b>). Then, the intermediary agent Da sends the production method certificate to the consumer Ca by mail or the like (S<b>3</b>). If necessary, the certification authority E may acquire transaction information and asset information from the blockchain network <b>90</b> and confirm the contents before issuing the production method certificate.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">The processing of facilitating procedure for obtaining the production method certificate by the intermediary agent Da then ends. After receiving the production method certificate, the consumer Ca is able to use the production method certificate to enhance public image of the company or apply the government for a subsidy based on use of renewable energy.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">According to the embodiment, since quality of assets, such as electricity, provided to the user is the same, it would be difficult to know a type of production method of the asset. In view of this, the node <b>9</b> of the blockchain network <b>90</b> manages asset information indicating a type of production method of asset and ownership of asset, and transaction information from which such asset information is generated, such that a production method of asset can be verified without fraud.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">Moreover, in order to encourage stable consumption of electricity, it is necessary to adjust the consumed electricity and the produced electricity in real time to make them equal. Since the blockchain is a decentralized ledger system, it takes a certain amount of time to confirm consistency of each ledger information via the network. Therefore, it is not suitable to apply the blockchain technology to track use of such asset, which requires responsiveness in realtime. In view of this, in the embodiment, the intermediary server <b>5</b> is configured to transmit, to the blockchain network <b>90</b>, a request for changing the ownership of the asset information on the blockchain network <b>90</b> from the original owner to the user (consumer Ca), not at a time when the consumer Ca starts using the asset such as electricity, but after the consumer Ca has consumed the asset (S<b>89</b>). Through this processing, which allows processing like deferred payment, the blockchain technology can be applied to an immediate exchange of asset, requiring real-time processing, to manage transfer of ownership of asset. Moreover, since the intermediary server <b>5</b> changes the asset information managed by the blockchain network <b>90</b> on behalf of the supplier (producer Aa, etc.) and the user (consumer Ca, etc.), the supplier (producer Aa, etc.) and the user (consumers Ca, etc.) can exchange electricity, without any need to consider whether the asset information has been changed.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">Further, the intermediary server <b>5</b> is able to transfer the ownership of particular asset produced with a specific production method, and it can be applied to intermediate exchange of electricity produced from renewable energy such as solar light.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0240" num="0239">In any one of the above-described embodiments, the asset information includes information on the owner of the asset, however, the asset information may not include such information on the owner. For example, when the user is consuming electricity produced by the user, such that the user is the producer of the asset, there is no need to transfer the asset to another person (another company), as long as a type of production method can be verified.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">Further, in any one of the above-described embodiments, electricity is used as an example of asset. Examples of asset include any other asset that physically exists (or exists in reality), and any other asset that does not physically exist (or not exit in reality).</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">Examples of asset that physically exists (or exists in reality) include, but are not limited to, foods such as grains, vegetables, fruits, meats, marine products or processed foods.
