The system may include the online gaming platform, a registry server, a real-world information server, and/or other components. The system may include one or more processors configured by machine-readable instructions. The system may be configured to execute, within the online gaming platform, an instance of a game to facilitate presentation of the game to players, and implement in-game actions in the instance of the game in response to in-game action instructions for the in-game actions by the players. Presentation of the game is based on views of the game that are determined during execution of the instance of the game. The players may include a first player and a second player. The system may be configured to manage player accounts associated with the players. The player accounts may include a first player account associated with the first player and a second player account associated with the second player. The first player account may include a first account inventory of a first set of virtual items. The second player account may include a second account inventory of a second set of virtual items. The first player controls the first set of virtual items in the first account inventory. The second player controls the second set of virtual items in the second account inventory. The first account inventory may include a first unique digital article that is associated with a first in-game player-controllable character configured to be used in the instance of the game. The second account inventory may include a second unique digital article that is associated with a second in-game player-controllable character configured to be used in the instance of the game. The system may be configured to generate and transfer sets of instructions to record and/or modify a first set of usage information pertaining to the first unique digital article and a second set of usage information pertaining to the second unique digital article. The system may be configured to implement a permanent registry. The system may be configured to receive and execute (i) a first set of instructions to record, on the permanent registry, the first set of usage information that controls usage by the first player of the first unique digital article, and (ii) a second set of instructions to record, on the permanent registry, the second set of usage information. The second set of usage information controls usage by the second player of the second unique digital article. The first set of usage information controls a first eligibility of the first unique digital article to receive a first distribution of a first benefit. The second set of usage information controls a second eligibility of the second unique digital article to receive a second distribution of a second benefit. The system may be configured to record, on the permanent registry, executable code configured to (i) receive real-world information from a real-world information server, and (ii) perform one or more evaluations whether to distribute the benefits based on the received real-world information. The benefits may include the first benefit and the second benefit. The one or more evaluations are based on the first eligibility and the second eligibility. The system may be configured to determine the real-world information based on events that have occurred in the real world, external to the real-world information server and the system. The system may be configured to transfer the real-world information to at least one of the registry server and the permanent registry. The system may be configured to effectuate execution of the executable code to perform the one or more evaluations. The system may be configured, responsive to the one or more evaluations, to distribute the first benefit. The system may be configured, responsive to the one or more evaluations, not to distribute the second benefit.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another aspect of the present disclosure related to a method of distributing benefits to unique digital articles based on real-world information, wherein the unique digital articles are associated with in-game player-controllable characters usable in instances of games within an online gaming platform. The method may include executing, within the online gaming platform, an instance of a game to facilitate presentation of the game to players, and implementing in-game actions in the instance of the game in response to in-game action instructions for the in-game actions by the players.

As used herein, the terms &#x201c;real world&#x201d; and &#x201c;real-world information&#x201d; refer to the physical world external to system <b>100</b> (and external to online gaming platform(s) <b>105</b>, administration server(s) <b>115</b>, registry server(s) <b>111</b>, and real-world information server(s) <b>119</b>), as well as information obtained therefrom and/or otherwise based thereon. By way of non-limiting example, real-world information may refer to quantifiable and/or deterministic data about events and/or activity that have/has occurred in the real world. By way of non-limiting example, results from competitions including sports are real-world information. Weather data, traffic information, stock prices, election results, results of real-world measurements, box office returns, financial market data, and thousands of other types of data may be real-world information. As used herein, the term &#x201c;benefit&#x201d; may represent anything of value or use in system <b>100</b>, or online gaming platform <b>105</b>, or registry servers <b>111</b>, or anything that can be exchanged or otherwise traded for something of such value or use, whether tangible or not, whether physical and/or virtual. As a preliminary and non-limiting example, by virtue of the systems and methods described in this disclosure, an individual player who owns a particular unique digital article (that is linked or otherwise sensitive to specific real-world information such as, say, results of one or more Oakland Athletics baseball games) may receive a particular benefit (e.g., an in-game benefit such as an in-game currency within online gaming platform <b>105</b>) responsive to the Oakland A's winning. The real-world event of this baseball game may be used as a basis to provide and/or distribute certain benefits to certain unique digital articles.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As used herein, the term &#x201c;unique digital article&#x201d; may refer to digital articles that are uniquely identified and/or uniquely identifiable, e.g., by an identifier or by identifying information. For example, in some implementations, an identifier or identifying information may include or be based on a combination of different types of information, including but not limited to information regarding the type of a digital article, a serial number and/or other numerical identifier of the digital article, and/or other types of information. As used herein, rights pertaining to unique digital articles may be tracked, recorded, and/or otherwise registered on one or more permanent registries. As such, a unique digital article may be a registry-tracked unique digital article. In some cases, this accessibility may include ownership.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Individual unique digital articles may be associated and/or correlated with another entity (which may be referred to as a &#x201c;correlated entity&#x201d;) by virtue of technology provided and/or supported by the one or more permanent registries on which the rights pertaining to the individual unique digital articles is tracked (including but not limited to smart contracts and/or other executable code on the one or more permanent registries). Accordingly, rights pertaining to a unique digital article may correlate to the provision of one or more rights (e.g., accessibility) with respect to the correlated entity (e.g., control and/or other accessibility). Transactions involving a unique digital article recorded on a permanent registry may correlate to certain transactions (or modifications) of the correlated entity, and/or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some implementations, correlated entities may be (or include) virtual items configured to be used within online-gaming platform <b>105</b> (such as, for example, a player-controllable in-game virtual character that is usable within an instance of a game within online gaming platform <b>105</b>). Other types and/or combinations of correlated entities are envisioned within the scope of this disclosure, including but not limited to physical and/or virtual objects, items, rights, memberships, grants, etc. The use of the singular &#x201c;entity&#x201d; or &#x201c;correlated entity&#x201d; is not intended to be limiting, as multiple different objects, items, rights, memberships, grants, etc. may be correlated to a single unique digital article. By way of non-limiting example, a correlated entity may be an art work, a ticket to an event, a subscription to certain media content, a bundle of rights related to captured audio and/or video information, ownership of or accessibility to distribution gains, and so forth. As used herein, the term &#x201c;non-fungible token&#x201d; or &#x201c;NFT&#x201d; may be used to refer to a combination of a particular unique digital article and a particular correlated entity that is correlated to the particular unique digital article.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">System <b>100</b> may include one or more online gaming platforms <b>105</b>, registry server(s) <b>111</b>, administration server(s) <b>115</b>, real-world information server(s) <b>119</b>, client computing platform(s) <b>104</b>, user interface(s) <b>125</b>, server(s) <b>102</b>, external resource(s) <b>138</b>, and/or other components.

As used herein, exchanges refer to individual players winning, losing, auctioning, selling, purchasing, trading, bartering, wagering, staking, and/or otherwise exchanging virtual items (directly, without a store or store interface under control of online gaming platform <b>105</b>) to other individual players or with other individual players (including exchanging virtual items through player-to-player challenges). Due to an exchange, ownership rights of a digital article may transition from an original owner to a new owner (even if there may, in some implementations, be one or more intermediary and/or temporary owners during the process of performing the exchange). In some implementations, unique digital articles may be associated and/or correlated with other rights than ownership rights, such as, by way of non-limiting example, distribution rights.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some implementations, distribution rights of (unique) digital articles may reflect rights held by the individual ones of the players <b>123</b> to receive certain distributions of benefits upon exchanges involving the particular digital articles. For example, individual players <b>123</b> may own rights related to particular digital articles that guarantee them benefits upon (future) exchanges involving those digital articles regardless of whether the individual players <b>123</b> own those digital articles. In some implementations, the distribution gains may result from a particular action or activity (such as, e.g., a sale of a particular digital article), e.g., within the online gaming platform <b>105</b>, of a particular digital article. As used herein, a distribution gain resulting from a particular action or activity may include one or more of a portion of the proceeds of the particular action or activity, a fee related to the particular action or activity, a minimum payment triggered by the occurrence of the particular action or activity (or a set of particular actions or activities), and/or another arrangement for payment and/or compensation, including but not limited to combinations of fixed fees, minimum fees, percentages of sales, percentages of profits, and/or other arrangements. The term &#x201c;portion&#x201d; does not imply or require a percentage or ratio, but rather is intended to signify that beneficiaries (i.e., the players that hold the distribution rights) may receive something of value and/or use. The distribution gains may include one or more virtual currencies such as virtual tokens, virtual stars, virtual points, virtual real-world currencies (e.g., US Dollars), and/or other gains that are based on the particular digital articles.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some implementations, (unique) digital articles, correlated entities, and/or other virtual items may include and/or be virtual items that are not fungible and may be usable within online gaming platform <b>105</b>. In some implementations, these may represent (three-dimensional) in-game player-controllable characters that can interact with other (in-game) virtual items within online gaming platform <b>105</b>. In some implementations, virtual items may include one or more of weapons, toys, characters, abilities, skills, tools, pets, clothing, vehicles, game levels, missions, assignments, chapters, tasks, mini-games, restricted areas within a virtual space, restricted modes of gameplay, access rights within an online game, and/or other virtual items. In some implementations, virtual items may refer to any item or object within online gaming platform <b>105</b> for which a player may use, own, sell, trade, destroy, and/or otherwise effectuate a change of ownership or control (including exchanges through challenges).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, a digital article is fungible if it is functionally and/or physically indistinguishable from another digital article. For example, a payment token such as a Bitcoin is fungible. A digital article may be non-fungible if it is unique, or one-of-a-kind. For example, a specific individual Crypt&#xae; Kitty&#x2122; may be non-fungible. A digital article may be semi-fungible if there is a set of a limited number of similar but distinguishable digital articles. For example, a limited-edition Blanko&#x2122; or another in-game character may be semi-fungible. For example, one of a limited number of 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional in-game virtual items may be semi-fungible. For example, a digital ticket to a show, concert, exhibition, and/or other event may be semi-fungible. For example, a piece of art or jewelry (e.g., as a virtual item or as representing a physical item) may be semi-fungible. As used herein, semi-fungible digital articles are considered as unique, &#x201c;not fungible&#x201d;, or non-fungible digital articles. In some implementations, digital articles may be usable within one or more games.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Registry server(s) <b>111</b> (e.g., registry server <b>111</b><i>a</i>, registry server <b>111</b><i>b</i>, and so forth) may be used to implement one or more permanent registries, including but not limited to blockchain <b>117</b><i>a</i>, blockchain <b>117</b><i>b </i>(partially visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and so forth.

In some implementations, a distributed computing platform may be implemented by a set of client computing platforms and/or servers (including, for example, one or more registry servers <b>111</b>). The distributed computing platform may support a virtual machine (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The distributed computing platform and/or the virtual machine may form a runtime environment for smart contracts and/or other executable code. A distributed computing platform may include electronic storage configured to store part or all of blockchain <b>117</b><i>a</i>. For example, the smart contracts may be stored on blockchain <b>117</b><i>a</i>, blockchain <b>117</b><i>b</i>, and/or another permanent registry. In some implementations, the distributed computing platform may be the EOSIO platform. In some implementations, the distributed computing platform may be similar to or based on the EOSIO platform.

The private permissioned permanent registry may be configured to record information. The recorded information may include information pertaining to unique digital articles that are associated and/or correlated with in-game player-controllable characters that are configured to be used in an instance of a game. The recorded information may include rights pertaining to the unique digital articles. Implementing the in-game actions in the instance of the game may include, for at least some of the in-game actions implemented in the instance of the game, effectuating modifications to the recorded information pertaining to the unique digital article. For example, ownership rights and/or other accessibility may be modified. In some implementations, a unique digital article may be removed from one permanent registry and added or recorded on another permanent registry. In some implementations, at least one of the permanent registries implemented by registry servers <b>111</b> is a public permanent registry (e.g., a public blockchain). The public permanent registry may be configured to be part of either EOSIO mainnet, Ethereum mainnet, Ethereum 1.5, Ethereum 2.0, a derivative of Ethereum 2.0 that is configured to perform transactions of Ether (ETH) between accounts, or a derivative of EOSIO that is configured to perform transactions of EOS between different accounts.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Elements of blockchain <b>117</b><i>a </i>or another permanent registry may be grouped together in units that are referred to as blocks. For example, an individual block may include one or more digital articles (or digital assets) and one or more transactions. For example, an individual block may be linked to one or more other individual blocks. Individual blocks may be linked or chained together to form a structure of blocks and/or a hierarchy of blocks, such as, e.g., a chain of blocks. An individual block may include one or more digital articles, one or more transactions, smart contracts, and/or other information.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some implementations, one or more permanent registries implemented by registry servers <b>111</b> may be publicly accessible. In some implementations, one or more permanent registries implemented by registry servers <b>111</b> may be private and/or permissioned. In some implementations, one or more permanent registries implemented by registry servers <b>111</b> may be append-only. In some implementations, existing blocks of one or more permanent registries implemented by registry servers <b>111</b> can substantially not be altered or deleted, unless multiple copies are altered. This is unlikely to happen provided that the multiple copies are stored on different computing platforms, e.g., in different geographical locations. Permanent registries may be replicated on multiple computing platforms, preferably in multiple different geographical locations. Additionally, individual blocks may be linked together in a manner that prevents tampering, such as, e.g., using a hash chain and/or digital signatures. In particular, hash values may be generated using fixed-output-length one-way hashing functions that take variable-length input, and may be effectively impossible (or, at least, computationally infeasible) to reverse. As such, a hashing function may provide one-way encryption. By way of non-limiting example, the hashing function may be SHA-256, BLAKE2, SHAKE256, and/or another hashing function. Contents of individual blocks, transactions, and/or articles may be digitally signed in a manner that proves integrity and/or prevents tampering, e.g., by providing authentication, as well as non-repudiation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, registry server <b>111</b><i>a </i>may include one or more of electronic storage <b>130</b><i>b</i>, processor(s) <b>132</b><i>b</i>, machine-readable instructions <b>106</b><i>b</i>, (node of) blockchain <b>117</b><i>a</i>, and/or other components.

For example, a particular player may subscribe a unique digital article to one or more games (or all regular season games, or all play-off games, or the championship game, etc. etc.) of his favorite team (say, Oakland Athletics). If the team wins, the particular unique digital article receives a benefit, as described elsewhere in this disclosure. In some implementations, if the team loses, nothing happens, and the particular unique digital article simply does not receive a benefit. In some implementations, players may be able to turn subscriptions on and off. In some implementations, players may modify subscriptions (e.g., select a different team). In some implementations, the specifics of a subscription may be modifiable and/or otherwise configurable by administrative users, or changes in a subscription may occur as part of a game within online gaming platform <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some implementations, only a limited number of a particular type of subscriptions (say, to play-off games by Oakland Athletics in a specific season) may be available, so not every unique digital article that could potentially be eligible for this specific subscription can actually be eligible at the same time. For example, assume only a particular type of unique digital article could potentially be eligible for a particular type of subscription. Assume there are 1000 of these unique digital articles in the hands of players, but only 10 available subscriptions of this particular type at any given time. Assuming the potential benefit is valuable, the value of a first unique digital article with such a subscription may be significantly higher than the value of a second unique digital article without such a subscription, even if these unique digital articles are otherwise similar. In some implementations, a subscription may expire at some predetermined moment or after some predetermined duration. Assuming the potential benefit is valuable, the value of a first unique digital article with an unexpired subscription for the next 18 months may be significantly higher than the value of a second unique digital article with an unexpired subscription for the next 3 months, even if these unique digital articles and their subscriptions are otherwise similar except for expiration and/or duration. In some implementations, availability and/or status of a subscription for a particular unique digital article may be used to modify the depiction of a player-controllable character associated with the particular unique digital article in a view of interactive gameplay (e.g., the view may be depicting a topography of a simulated space included in an instance of a game). As such, the modification may indicate and/or otherwise represent to players in the instance of the game the current availability and/or status of this subscription (e.g., whether the subscription is activated or deactivated, as well as particulars regarding expiration and/or duration).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some implementations, eligibility component <b>116</b> may be configured to determine whether particular players are eligible to receive one or more participation rewards or attendance awards for either a particular unique digital article participating in an online event or attending an online event (e.g., during a particular time-limited duration, or between a begin time and an end time of the online event). Alternatively, and/or simultaneously, eligibility component <b>116</b> may be configured to determine whether particular players are eligible to receive one or more participation rewards or attendance awards for participating in a real-world event or attending a real-world event (e.g., during a particular time-limited duration).

In some implementations, grants to use a particular unique digital article in accordance with a particular in-game action instruction may be granted based on one or more determinations by eligibility component <b>116</b>. For example, grants may be granted for certain requested in-game actions, but not for others. For example, particular requested in-game actions may be performed if requested by a first player, but not a second player. In some implementations, performance component <b>118</b> may permit and/or perform some types of requests, but not other types of requests. In some implementations, grants and/or performance may be prevented for certain types of requests, unless the pertinent (required) combination of unique digital articles is currently recorded on a particular permanent registry as being owned by a particular player or account.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some implementations, grants and/or performance by performance component <b>118</b> may require not only a particular type of request, but additionally may require the pertinent unique digital article (or other digital article that is not fungible) currently be recorded on a particular permanent registry (or a particular type of permanent registry). For example, a requirement for grants or performance may include recordation on a private permissioned permanent registry. In some implementations, actions by performance component <b>118</b> may be performed responsive to particular actions or results from other components of system <b>100</b>, including but not limited to eligibility component <b>116</b> and/or registry-analysis component <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Registry-analysis component <b>120</b> may be configured to determine whether one or more unique digital articles are recorded (on a particular permanent registry) as being owned by a particular player and/or account. For example, registry-analysis component <b>120</b> may determine whether a first unique digital article is currently recorded on a private permissioned permanent registry. In some implementations, registry-analysis component <b>120</b> may be configured to analyze recordations and other transactions on one or more permanent registries, e.g., by retrieving recorded information from the one or more permanent registries and analyzing whether any of the recorded transactions pertain to a particular unique digital article, or a set of unique digital articles. In some implementations, determinations by registry-analysis component <b>120</b> may be performed responsive to particular actions or results from other components of system <b>100</b>, including but not limited to eligibility component <b>116</b>. In some implementations, registry-analysis component <b>120</b> may be configured to determine whether rights pertaining to a particular unique digital article has ever been recorded on a public permanent registry. For example, actions by other components of system <b>100</b>, including but not limited to distribution component <b>124</b>, may be responsive to determinations by registry-analysis component <b>120</b>. In some implementations, determinations by registry-analysis component <b>120</b> may occur in real-time or near-real-time as needed for a particular in-game action instruction or request. In some implementations, determinations by registry-analysis component <b>120</b> may occur as needed when rights pertaining to (unique) digital articles is modified, and results of such determinations are stored for later use by, e.g., online gaming platform <b>105</b>, e.g., to be used when responding to a future in-game action instruction and/or a future request.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Notification component <b>122</b> may be configured to notify players. For example, notification component <b>122</b> may notify players <b>123</b> in response to events, distributions, in-game action instructions, and/or other activities in system <b>100</b>. In some implementations, a player may be notified responsive to a requested in-game action (as requested through an in-game action instruction) not being permitted or not being performed (e.g., as determined by performance component <b>118</b>). In some implementations, actions by notification component <b>122</b> may be performed responsive to particular actions, results, determinations, and/or decisions from other components of system <b>100</b>, including but not limited to eligibility component <b>116</b>, performance component <b>118</b>, and/or registry-analysis component <b>120</b>. For example, notification component <b>122</b> may respond to a particular in-game action instruction (by a particular player, and pertaining to a particular unique digital article) with a particular response such that, responsive to a particular determination, the particular response notifies the particular player accordingly.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Distribution component <b>124</b> may be configured to distribute and/or otherwise provide one or more of information, benefits, access to in-game content, access to game-specific communication channels, certificates, rewards, awards, prizes, distribution gains, and/or virtual items to players <b>123</b>.

In some implementations, distributions may be based on and/or responsive to actions by other components of system <b>100</b>, including but not limited to registry server <b>111</b>, a particular permanent registry, and/or registry-analysis component <b>120</b>. For example, online gaming platform <b>105</b> may determine a particular player is eligible to receive one or more rewards or awards. Distribution component <b>124</b> may distribute the one or more rewards or awards in accordance with the determined eligibility. For example, a reward may be a participation reward. For example, an award may be an attendance award. For example, a certificate may be a certificate of completion or accomplishment, which may be specific to actions within the instance of the game. For example, a prize may be for effort, time, and/or resources spent, specifically in the instance of the game. For example, particular unique digital articles may be associated with distribution rights, and the particular player who owns those distribution rights may receive distribution gains in accordance with those distribution rights. For example, distribution gains may result from a particular action or activity (such as, e.g., a sale of a particular digital article), e.g., within the online gaming platform <b>105</b>, involving the particular digital article.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Adjustment component <b>126</b> may be configured to adjust and/or modify distributions, including (planned or expected) distributions by distribution component <b>124</b>.
