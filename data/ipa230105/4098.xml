INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to an external additive for a toner, and a toner that are used in an image-forming method such as an electrophotographic method.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The fields of using image forming apparatuses that utilize an electrophotographic system have expanded and become more diverse in recent years, from printers and copiers to commercial printing machines. In response to this, higher speeds and higher quality are required in image forming apparatuses.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The charging characteristics, flowability, durability and so forth of the toner used in image forming apparatuses are ordinarily controlled by an external additive that is present on the toner surface, whereby characteristics optimized for the process of the electrophotographic system are obtained. Inorganic fine particles typified for instance by silica and titanium oxide are used as the external additive.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, silica exhibits excellent flowability, but tends to be susceptible to charge-up, has low environmental stability, and has low charge performance stability. By contrast, titanium oxide has high conductivity and is therefore excellent in charging performance stability; however, titanium oxide is prone to suffer from charge leakage, and tends to yield a small electrification charge amount. Moreover, the external additive tends to become embedded into the toner particle over long-term use, on account of low flowability of titanium oxide, so that degradation of toner proceeds readily. Inorganic oxides such as silica used as the external additive have hydroxyl groups on the surface, and accordingly are hydrophilic, and characteristically absorb moisture readily. This has therefore a significant impact on electrification charge amount and conductivity, which are electrical characteristics, since hydroxyl groups on the surface dissociate on account of the absorbed moisture.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">External additives having a sufficient electrification charge amount, exhibiting excellent charging performance stability, and having high flowability are thus required, and surface treatment methods of various external additives have been proposed in which silica or titanium oxide is utilized. Japanese Patent Application Publication No. S59-52255 discloses titanium oxide hydrophobized with an alkyltrialkoxysilane having an alkyl group from C6 to C8, an external additive, with a view to improving the flowability of a toner. Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2017-134157 discloses an external additive in which titania fine particles are caused to adhere to the surface of a silica core, and the titania fine particles being coated with a thermosetting nitrogen resin. Further, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2018-163209 discloses an external additive that utilizes concomitantly a powder of silica particles having, on the surface, an alkyl group from C8 to C16, an amino group, and titania particles having amino groups on the surface.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The external additive disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. S59-52255 contains titanium oxide. Titanium oxide powders ordinarily has a volume resistivity of 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>(&#x3a9;&#xb7;m) to 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>(&#x3a9;&#xb7;m). Titanium oxide has high conductivity, and accordingly a toner using an external additive that contains titanium oxide exhibits a lower electrification charge amount and a lower charge attenuation characteristic, which makes transfer defects likely to occur.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2017-134157, composite particles of silica particles and titania particles are used as an external additive, but the silica particles and the titania particles are not chemically bonded to each other. Moreover, it is extremely difficult to uniformly disperse titania particles on the surface of silica particles having identical polarity sign as that of titania particles. Furthermore, titania has high conductivity, and accordingly the volume resistivity of the toner is lower. There is accordingly room for improvement in terms of ensuring both of electrification charge amount and stability.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the external additive disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2018-163209 is used, since the volume resistivity of the toner becomes readily lower, in relative terms, than the volume resistivity of a printing intermediate transfer member or a transfer roller that utilizes the toner, the electrification charge amount of the toner drops, and transfer derived from Coulomb forces is less likely to occur. Therefore, the external additive disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2018-163209 is prone to suffering from transfer defects, similarly to Japanese Patent Application Publication No. S59-52255, and has room for improvement.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure is directed to provide an external additive, and a toner, having a sufficient electrification charge amount, exhibiting excellent charging performance stability, and having high flowability.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure relates to an external additive for a toner comprising a silica particle surface-treated with a polyhydric acid metal salt particle,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">wherein the polyhydric acid metal salt particle is particle of a salt of a polyhydric acid and a titanium compound.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure also relates to a toner comprising a toner particle, and an external additive for a toner on the surface of the toner particle,</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">wherein the external additive for a toner is the above external additive for a toner.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure allows providing an external additive, and a toner, having a sufficient electrification charge amount, exhibiting excellent charging performance stability, and having high flowability.

Unless otherwise specified, the description of &#x201c;from XX to YY&#x201d; or &#x201c;XX to YY&#x201d; indicating a numerical range means a numerical range including a lower limit and an upper limit which are end points. When a numerical range is described step by step, the upper and lower limits of each numerical range can be arbitrarily combined.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present disclosure relates to an external additive for a toner comprising a silica particle surface-treated with a polyhydric acid metal salt particle,</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">wherein the polyhydric acid metal salt particle is a particle of a salt of a polyhydric acid and a titanium compound.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, the present disclosure relates to a toner comprising a toner particle, and the above external additive for the toner.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The inventors found that by using particles of a salt of a polyhydric acid and a titanium compound, as a surface modification agent of silica particles, it becomes possible to provide an external additive for a toner, and a toner, having a sufficient electrification charge amount, being excellent in charging performance, and being capable of ensuring high flowability. The inventors surmise the following concerning the underlying reasons for this.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Silica particles have high volume resistivity, but are hydrophilic on account of hydroxyl groups (silanol groups) on the surface, and accordingly silica particles exhibit the characteristic of readily absorbing moisture. When silica particles absorb moisture, the hydroxyl groups become dissociated on account of such moisture; as a result, this has a significant impact on electrification charge amount and conductivity, which are electrical characteristics. The inventors considered that electrification charge amount and charging stability can be ensured by subjecting the surface of the silica particles to a chemical surface treatment using a titanium-based material, which is excellent in charging stability.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Titanium oxide is ordinarily exemplified as a titanium-based material used in external additives for a toner, but chemical interactions with silica particles and titanium oxide are difficult to achieve. Moreover, a conceivable method may involve relying on hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions, to chemically bond a titanium alkoxide to the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the silica particles. However, titanium alkoxides exhibit high reaction rates in aqueous systems, and the reactions are difficult to control, which makes titanium alkoxides problematic for instance in terms of dispersibility. That is because water coordinates with the titanium alkoxide, with subsequent formation of Ti&#x2014;OH that reacts with the titanium alkoxide of other molecules, to form as a result metalloxane bonds (Ti&#x2014;O&#x2014;Ti bonds). A further conceivable reason is that this reaction occurs continuously, giving rise to a polytitanoxane structure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Therefore, the inventors found that interactions with silica particles can be achieved stably and uniformly, with controlling the reaction rate, by using particles of a polyhydric acid metal salt as a surface treatment agent, which are particles of a salt of a polyhydric acid and a titanium compound.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Polyhydric acids accept electron pairs and readily become negatively charged. Furthermore, titanium is a group 4 element and is most stable when the oxidation number thereof is +4. The titanium compound forms as a result a crosslinked structure with the polyhydric acid, such that the movement of electrons is promoted by the crosslinked structure; this allows improving the charge rising property, while suppressing occurring charge-up, and allows ensuring excellent charging stability. Further, the reaction products of the polyhydric acid and titanium which is a group 4 element afford good environmental stability through blocking of water molecules by the crosslinked structure. It is deemed that the polyhydric acid metal salt particles, which are particles of a salt of a polyhydric acid and a titanium compound, react with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the silica particles, forming metalloxane bonds (Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;Ti bonds) as a result. In consequence, external additive particles can be obtained that integrate together characteristics of silica and characteristics of metal particles. The hydroxyl groups on the surface of the silica particles react with the polyhydric acid metal salt particles, to form metalloxane bonds, so that the number of hydroxyl groups that dissociate on the surface of the silica particles decreases as a result. Electrification charge amount ordinarily drops, on account of leakage currents, in a case where conductivity is too high, i.e. in a case where volume resistivity is too low. Further, charge-up occurs in a case where the conductivity is too low, i.e. in a case where volume resistivity is too high. When the silica particles are surface-treated with polyhydric acid metal salt particles, by contrast, the movement of electrons is controlled as described above, thanks to which proper conductivity (volume resistivity) can be obtained as a result. In consequence, leakage current can be controlled, capacitance can be increased, and a charging rising property and occurrence of charge-up can be suppressed, and then improved charging performance stability.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">By using thus polyhydric acid metal salt particles as a surface treatment agent, while ensuring high flowability through the use of the of silica particles as cores, it is possible to obtain an external additive for a toner that allowed ensuring charge amount combined with charging stability. There has never been an external additive for a toner with the above configuration; the inventors have thus been first in successfully obtaining an external additive for a toner having the above configuration, and a toner that utilizes the external additive for a toner.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The method for surface-treating the polyhydric acid metal salt particles on the surface of the silica particles is not particularly limited, and may be one of the following methods. For instance, a method may involve adding a polyhydric acid and a titanium compound to a dispersion of silica particles, with mixing of the whole, to thereby cause the polyhydric acid metal salt particles to react, and obtain a reaction product, while at the same time the dispersion is stirred, to elicit adhesion to and reaction with the surface of the silica particles, and yield in turn surface-treated silica particles. Another method may involve adding polyhydric acid metal salt particles, generated beforehand, to a dispersion of silica particles, and mixing the whole, to elicit adhesion to and reaction with the surface of the silica particles, and yield surface-treated silica particles.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A conventionally known polyhydric acid can be used, without particular limitations, as the polyhydric acid. Concrete examples of polyhydric acids include inorganic acids such as phosphoric acid (trivalent), carbonic acid (divalent) and sulfuric acid (divalent); and organic acids such as dicarboxylic acids (divalent) and tricarboxylic acids (trivalent). Concrete examples of organic acids include dicarboxylic acids such as oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid; and tricarboxylic acids such as citric acid, aconitic acid and trimellitic anhydride.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The polyhydric acid preferably comprises an inorganic acid. Inorganic acids have a more rigid molecular skeleton than organic acids, and accordingly exhibit smaller changes in properties upon long-term storage. Stable characteristics can therefore be obtained even after long-term storage. The polyhydric acid more preferably comprises at least one selected from the group consisting of phosphoric acid, carbonic acid and sulfuric acid, and yet more preferably is phosphoric acid. In a case where the polyhydric acid is phosphoric acid, a stronger and more stable surface layer can be formed, by virtue of the fact that a pyrophosphate skeleton becomes formed, as a crosslinked body, between the polyhydric acid and the titanium compound, at the time of formation of metalloxane bonds (Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;Ti bonds) as a result of a reaction between particles of a salt of phosphoric acid and a titanium compound with hydroxyl groups on the surface of the silica particles. Further, the manner of addition to an aqueous medium may involve addition of the polyhydric acid itself, or addition of water-soluble polyhydric acid metal salt particles to an aqueous medium, with dissociation in the aqueous medium.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A known titanium compound can be used as the titanium compound, without particular limitations, so long as the titanium compound yields a polyhydric acid metal salt through reaction with polyhydric acid ions. Concrete examples of the titanium compound include at least one selected from the group consisting of titanium lactate, titanium tetraacetylacetonate, an ammonium salt of titanium lactate, titanium triethanolaminate, and the like. Preferred among the foregoing are titanium chelates, since these the reaction is readily controlled, and titanium chelates react quantitatively with polyhydric acid ions. A lactic acid chelate such as titanium lactate is more preferable from the viewpoint of solubility in an aqueous medium.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Concrete examples of the polyhydric acid metal salt particles include particles of a salt of a polyhydric acid such as phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, carbonic acid or oxalic acid, and a titanium compound. Examples include titanium phosphate compounds, titanium sulfate compounds, titanium carbonate compounds and titanium oxalate compounds. The polyhydric acid preferably comprises at least one selected from the group consisting of sulfuric acid, carbonic acid and phosphoric acid; more preferably, the polyhydric acid is phosphoric acid. Phosphate ions afford high strength derived from cross-linking across metals, and are superior also in charge rising performance by virtue of having ionic bonds within the molecule; accordingly, the polyhydric acid metal salt particles more preferably include particles of a salt of phosphoric acid and a titanium compound.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;Ti bonds are formed by the polyhydric acid metal salt particles, in the surface-treated silica particles. The silica particles having been surface-treated with the polyhydric acid metal salt particles preferably form metalloxane bonds (Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;Ti bonds) between the hydroxyl groups (silanol groups) on the surface of the silica particles and the polyhydric acid metal salt particles. As a result, capacitance increases (that is, relative dielectric constant increases), so that a sufficient electrification charge amount can be ensured. Moreover, the amount of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the silica particles is reduced, and therefore the conductivity decreases (i.e. the volume resistivity increases), it becomes possible to suppress drops in the electrification charge amount derived from leakage current, and to ensure a sufficient electrification charge amount. Preferably, a crosslinked body between the polyhydric acid and the titanium compound is formed in the polyhydric acid metal salt particles. By virtue of this crosslinked body, electron movement is promoted and appropriate conductivity is achieved such that the charging rising property on toner can be improved, occurrence of charge-up can be suppressed, and excellent charging stability can be ensured. Moreover, environmental stability is improved by virtue of the fact that the polyhydric acid metal salt particles can block water molecules thanks to the crosslinked body.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The number-average particle diameter of the primary particles of the polyhydric acid metal salt particles can be observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The number-average particle diameter of the primary particles of the polyhydric acid metal salt particles is preferably 2.0 to 10.0 nm and more preferably 2.0 to 5.0 nm to increase the attachment force (van der Waals force) between the silica particles and the toner particle. The polyhydric acid metal salt particles may be present on the silica particles in a partially aggregated state, and the height of the aggregate with respect to the normal direction of the silica particles is preferably 50 nm or less.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The primary particle diameter and aggregated state of the polyhydric acid metal salt particles can be controlled by the shear energy of the stirring device and the addition rate and concentration of the titanium compound.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The content of the polyhydric acid metal salt particle in the silica particle is preferably 0.01 to 1.00 mass %, and more preferably 0.05 to 0.20 mass %. In a case where the content is 0.01 to 1.00 mass %, a certain amount of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the silica particles reacts with the polyhydric acid metal salt particles to form metalloxane bonds, such that conductivity drops, volume resistivity increases, and relative dielectric constant increases, thanks to which occurrence of charge-up is suppressed and a sufficient electrification charge amount is obtained. The content of the polyhydric acid metal salt particles in the silica particles can be controlled on the basis of the addition amounts of the silica particles, the polyhydric acid, the titanium compound or the polyhydric acid metal salt particles, the specific surface area of the silica particles, and the type of the polyhydric acid metal salt particles.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The number-average particle diameter of the silica particle is preferably 7 to 600 nm, more preferably 10 to 500 nm. In a case where the number-average particle diameter is smaller than 7 nm, van der Waals force become dominant in the silica particles, and there increases non-electrostatic attachment force between toner particles, or between a toner and a developing roller or intermediate transfer member. The flowability, durability and transferability of the toner tend to decrease on account of this non-electrostatic attachment force. In a case where the number-average particle diameter of the silica particles exceeds 600 nm, an external force readily acts on the silica particles that are externally added to the toner during stirring of the toner, and the silica particles are prone to become embedded or to migrate. As a result, the toner surface becomes inhomogeneous, and is likely to cause fogging and reduced image density.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For the same reason, the number-average particle diameter of the silica particle surface-treated with a polyhydric acid metal salt particle is preferably 9 to 604 nm, more preferably 14 to 504 nm.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The BET specific surface area of the silica particles is preferably from 6 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 290 m<sup>2</sup>/g, more preferably from 7 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 210 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The larger the BET specific surface area of the silica particles, the smaller becomes the number-average particle diameter of the silica particles, whereas the smaller the BET specific surface area of the silica particles, the larger becomes the number-average particle diameter of the silica particles. In a case where the BET specific surface area exceeds 290 m<sup>2</sup>/g, van der Waals force becomes dominant in the silica particles, and there increases non-electrostatic attachment force between toner particles, or between toner and a developing roller or intermediate transfer member. The flowability, durability and transferability of the toner tend to decrease on account of this non-electrostatic attachment force. In a case where the BET specific surface area of the silica particles is smaller than 6 m<sup>2</sup>/g, external force readily acts on the silica particles that are externally added to the toner during stirring of the toner, and the silica particles are prone to become embedded or to migrate. As a result, the toner surface becomes inhomogeneous, and is likely to cause fogging and reduced image density.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The silica particles are not particularly limited, and may be silica particles obtained in accordance with a wet method, such as sol-gel method silica particles, gel method silica particles, aqueous colloidal silica particles, alcoholic silica particles; or fused silica particles; or silica particles obtained in accordance with a vapor-phase method, such as deflagration-method silica particles. Preferred among the foregoing are sol-gel silica particles obtained in accordance with a sol-gel method. In the sol-gel method, an alkoxysilane is subjected to hydrolysis and condensation reactions, in an organic solvent in which the water is present, to obtain a silica sol suspension from which the solvent is then removed, with drying, to yield silica fine particles. The sol-gel silica particles have numerous hydroxyl groups (silanol groups) on the surface, and accordingly a uniform surface treatment is more readily achieved through a reaction between the hydroxyl groups and the polyhydric acid metal salt particles. Moreover, the sol-gel silica particles have high circularity and a sharp particle size distribution, and hence the characteristics of the sol-gel silica particles as an external additive do not fluctuate readily.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The relative dielectric constant of the external additive for a toner at the frequency at which a dielectric loss tangent tans is minimal is preferably from 2.10 to 2.20.

A slurry of high-purity metatitanic acid [TiO(OH)<sub>2</sub>] was thus obtained. This slurry was filtered and was baked at 180&#xb0; C. for 2 hours, followed by repeated deagglomeration using a jet mill, until no aggregates of fine particles were left. This titanium oxide was dispersed in ethanol, and then 4.6 mass % of isobutyltrimethoxysilane and 4.6 mass % of trifluoropropyltrimethoxysilane were added dropwise and mixed, relative to 100 parts by mass of titanium oxide solids, to elicit a reaction, while under sufficient stirring so as to preclude coalescing of particles. The pH of the slurry was adjusted to 6.5 while under sufficient stirring. The slurry was then filtered and dried, and was then heat-treated at 170&#xb0; C. for 2 hours, followed by repeated deagglomeration using a jet mill, until no aggregates of titanium oxide were left.

The temperature was lowered to 25&#xb0; C., and thereafter the solid fraction was retrieved by centrifugation. Thereafter, a process of re-dispersion in ion-exchanged water and retrieval of the solid fraction by centrifugation was repeated thrice, to remove ions such as sodium.

Toner was removed from the cyan cartridge, which was then respectively filled with Toners 1 and 4 to 20, and the following evaluations were carried out.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0190">Evaluation of Fogging</p><p id="p-0175" num="0191">Performance by charge amount control of the external additive was evaluated on the basis of a fogging evaluation. In an environment at 15&#xb0; C. and humidity 10.0% RH, which is a harsh environment in terms of charge-up, there were outputted 3000 images, followed by output of an image having a white background, whereupon fogging density (%) was calculated on the basis of the difference between the whiteness of the white background portion and the whiteness of evaluation paper, as measured using &#x201c;REFLECTOMETER MODEL TC-6DS: by Tokyo Denshoku Co., Ltd.); fogging was then evaluated in accordance with the criteria below. An amber light filter was used as the filter. A rating of C or better was deemed as good.<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0192">A: 0.5% or lower</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0193">B: from 0.6% to 1.5%</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0194">C: from 1.6% to 2.5%</li>        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0195">D: 2.6% or higher</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0176" num="0196">Evaluation of Transferability</p><p id="p-0177" num="0197">Performance accompanying leakage of the external additive was evaluated through evaluation of transferability. Transferability was evaluated in a high-temperature, high-humidity environment (temperature of 30.0&#xb0; C., relative humidity of 85%), which is assumed to be harsher in terms of transferability. The evaluation paper used was FOX RIVER BOND paper (110 g/m<sup>2</sup>), which is a rough paper. Untransferred toner on a photosensitive member after solid black image transfer was taped using a polyester adhesive tape (No. 31B, width 15 mm) (by Nitto Denko Corporation) and was stripped off. Herein C was the value of Macbeth reflection density on the tape affixed onto the paper, D was the value of the Macbeth density of an instance where the tape was applied to paper with toner on the paper after transfer but before fixing, and E was the value of the Macbeth density of the tape applied to unused paper. As a close approximation, transferability was calculated approximately in accordance with the expression below. The larger the resulting numerical value, the better is the transferability denoted thereby. A rating of C or better was deemed as good.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Transferability (%)={(<i>D&#x2212;C</i>)/(<i>D&#x2212;E</i>)}&#xd7;100<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0198">A: transferability of 95% or higher</li>        <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0199">B: transferability from 90% to less than 95%</li>        <li id="ul0012-0003" num="0200">C: transferability from 85% to less than 90%</li>        <li id="ul0012-0004" num="0201">D: transferability lower than 85%.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0179" num="0202">Evaluation of Image Density</p><p id="p-0180" num="0203">Performance depending on the durability of the external additive was evaluated on the basis of changes in image density. Image density was evaluated in a high-temperature, high-humidity environment (temperature of 30.0&#xb0; C., relative humidity of 80%). As a long-term durability test, an output test for a total of 12000 prints was carried out in a mode where a horizontal line pattern having an image coverage of 1% was set to 1 sheet/1 job, according to a setting such that the equipment stopped between jobs, with the next job starting thereafter. The difference in image density between the first print and the 12000th print was measured. Herein there was used A4 paper for color laser copiers (by Canon Inc., 80 g/m<sup>2</sup>). Image density was measured by outputting a 5 mm&#xd7;5 mm solid black patch image, and by measuring reflection density using an SPI filter in a Macbeth densitometer (by Macbeth Corporation), which is a reflection densitometer. The smaller the difference in image density between the first print and the 12000th print, the better is the durability denoted thereby, with a rating of C or better being deemed as good.<ul
