level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a separator for an electricity storage device and a method for producing it, and more specifically it relates to a modified polyolefin-containing a microporous membrane that can be suitably used as a separator for a lithium ion battery, and to a method for producing it.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Microporous membranes are widely used as membranes for separation or selective permeation and selection of various substances and as isolating materials, and some examples of their uses include as microfiltration membranes, as fuel cell and condenser separators, or as matrices for functional membranes or battery separators, which exhibit new functions by having functional materials packed into their pores. Polyolefin microporous membranes, specifically, are preferred for use as separators for lithium ion batteries that are widely utilized in PC laptops, cellular phones and digital cameras. In order to ensure battery safety, separators must have both an active shutdown function and high membrane rupture temperature. PTL 1, for example, describes adjustment of the higher physical properties of a polyolefin resin as an essential component of a separator for a lithium ion battery. In addition, as described in PTL 2, it is known that heat release due to interior battery short circuiting is inhibited by a shutdown function when the degree of crystallinity and gel fraction are in specific ranges, and that the safety of a battery can be ensured if it has performance such that a membrane rupture will not occur in the battery cell at partial high temperature sections (i.e. breakdown at 170&#xb0; C. or higher). More specifically, in regard to PTLs 1 and 2, it has gradually come to light by experimentation that high-temperature membrane rupture properties can be exhibited by constructing silane crosslinked sections (a gel structure) in a polyolefin separator.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">[PTL 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H09(1997)-216964</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0004">[PTL 2] International Patent Publication No. WO97/44839</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0005">[PTL 3] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H11(1999)-144700</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0006">[PTL 4] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H11(1999)-172036</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0007">[PTL 5] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-176484</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0008">[PTL 6] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-319441</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0009">[PTL 7] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2017-203145</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0010">[PTL 8] International Patent Publication No. WO2010/134585</li>    <li id="ul0001-0009" num="0011">[PTL 9] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2016-072150</li>    <li id="ul0001-0010" num="0012">[PTL 10] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2007-299612</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0013">With the increasing high outputs and high energy densities of lithium ion secondary batteries for mobile devices and vehicles in recent years, there is ongoing demand for smaller battery cell sizes and for stable cycle charge-discharge performance during long periods of use. It is therefore considered necessary for the separators used to be thin-membranes (for example, 15 &#x3bc;m or smaller) with high quality (for example, homogeneous physical properties and free of resin aggregates). Standards have also become more rigorous for battery safety in addition to the performance mentioned above, and as also described in PTLs 1 and 2, there is a need for shutdown functions and high-temperature membrane rupture properties, while expectations are also high for development of separator resin compositions that can be stably produced, and production methods for them. In this regard, the level for shutdown temperature is preferably as far below 150&#xb0; C. as possible, while the membrane rupture temperature is preferably as high a temperature as possible.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0014">In the method described in PTL 3, for example, a crosslinking catalyst master batch is used during the extrusion step to promote silane-modified polyethylene crosslinking reaction in the extruder, but this results in generation of resin aggregates and lowers the homogeneity of the physical properties of the separator. As a solution for this problem, the methods described in PTLs 4, 5 and 6 propose providing a plasticizer extraction step or silane gel crosslinking step, or controlling the gel fraction of the resin membrane, or dewatering after casting of the uncrosslinked resin through hot water. In addition, PTL 7 proposes a polyolefin microporous membrane with modification of the gel fraction, storage elastic modulus, maximum shrinkage factor based on thermomechanical analysis (TMA) and amount of radicals as measured by electron spin resonance (ESR), to provide a heat-resistant resin microporous membrane with low heat shrinkage, low fluidity and excellent meltdown resistance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0015">In addition, from the viewpoint of dimensional stability, and of both maintaining the shutdown function and increasing the membrane rupture temperature for separators for electricity storage devices, it has been proposed to provide an inorganic porous layer containing inorganic particles such as calcined kaolin or boehmite and a resin binder on at least one surface of a polyolefin microporous membrane (PTLs 8 and 9). A separator has also been proposed that has a layer A having a shutdown property and a layer B comprising an aramid resin and an inorganic material, with the ratio of their thicknesses adjusted to within a prescribed range (PTL 10).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0016">However, the method disclosed in PTL 4 is not able to sufficiently promote silane crosslinking reaction, and it is difficult to obtain high-temperature membrane rupture resistance. Crosslinking reaction can be promoted in the plasticizer extraction steps described in PTLs 3 and 4 since they employ a tin(II)-based crosslinking catalyst, but there are concerns regarding post-residue of the crosslinking catalyst.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0017">The heat-resistant resin microporous membrane described in PTL 7 is merely obtained by coating a photopolymerizable coating solution onto a dry porous membrane. In Example 5 of PTL 7 a low-molecular-weight silane coupling agent such as &#x3b3;-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane is added to the porous membrane, but when a low-molecular-weight silane coupling agent is used in a wet porous method, it is expected that the low-molecular-weight silane coupling agent does not bond with the resin of the porous membrane since it tends to react or bond with the pore-forming plasticizer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0018">Moreover, the film layer described in PTL 7 is formed by coating a compound with a polymerizable functional group onto a resin porous membrane followed by crosslinking reaction by external stimulation, and therefore some infiltration into the resin porous membrane is expected to occur during coating of the film layer, and a mixed region is expected to form near the interface between the film layer and the resin porous membrane after the crosslinking reaction has proceeded. This allows satisfactory TMA heat shrinkage performance to be obtained, but is also expected to lead to lower battery cycle characteristics due to blockage of the resin porous membrane, or reduced fuse (shutdown) performance as the resin porous membrane undergoes melting. In addition, small amounts of radical species compounds are detected by ESR and remain in the composite microporous membrane obtained by the method described in PTL 7, and when such a composite microporous membrane has been incorporated into a battery, radical reaction would be expected to take place with the other members and particularly the electrolyte solution, resulting in chain reaction that would decompose the electrolyte solution, thus potentially resulting in notable impairment of the battery performance.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0019">A battery using a separator such as described in PTLs 3 to 7 has poor cycle characteristics, and when used for prolonged periods unpredictable secondary reactions may be induced in the battery, potentially lowering the battery safety. While silane crosslinking is problematic for obtaining a shutdown function and high-temperature membrane rupture properties as explained above, the porous body structure, which is the most important aspect of the separator, cannot be constructed with a silane-grafted polyolefin alone, and therefore the development of resin mixture compositions is also essential.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0020">Furthermore, the microporous membranes and separators described in PTLs 1, 2 and 7 have been poorly studied in terms of placing inorganic porous layers comprising inorganic particles and a resin binder on their surfaces. A conventional separator comprising an inorganic porous layer on a microporous membrane will appear to have an improved membrane rupture temperature in the temperature-resistance curve of an electricity storage device. In practice, however, since the resin often elutes from the microporous membrane into the inorganic porous layer, loss of the membrane and a resulting reduction in stress resistance are to be expected for the separator as a whole. The multilayer porous membranes described in PTLs 8 and 9 are therefore provided with a polyolefin microporous membrane and an inorganic porous layer, but there is still room for investigation regarding both the low temperature shutdown function and high-temperature membrane rupture properties as a separator for an electricity storage device, and regarding improved electricity storage device cycle characteristics and battery nail penetration safety.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0021">With the separators for electricity storage devices described in PTLs 1, 2 and 10, there is still room for improvement from the viewpoint of improving their electricity storage device performance.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0022">In light of these problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a separator that has both a shutdown function and high-temperature membrane rupture properties, and that can improve the electricity storage device output, cycle characteristic and/or safety, as well as a method for producing it.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0023">As a result of much avid research directed toward solving these problems, the present inventors have completed this invention upon finding that they can be solved if crosslinking reaction (gelation) is carried out under specific conditions after completion of a step in which the higher-order structure of the microporous membrane is constructed using a resin composition with a specific resin composition.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0024">Specifically, the present invention provides the following.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000">[1]</p><p id="p-0018" num="0025">A method for producing a separator for an electricity storage device, comprising the following steps:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0026">(1) a sheet-forming step in which a silane graft-modified polyolefin, polyethylene and a plasticizer are extruded into a sheet using an extruder, cooled to solidification and shaped into a molded sheet;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0027">(2) a stretching step in which the molded sheet is subjected to biaxial stretching to a 20-fold to 250-fold area increase to form a stretched sheet;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0028">(3) a porous body-forming step in which the plasticizer is extracted from the stretched sheet to form a porous body;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0029">(4) a heat treatment step in which the porous body is subjected to heat treatment and subjected to stretching and relaxation in the transverse direction to obtain a heat-treated porous body;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0030">(5) an affinity treatment step in which the heat-treated porous body is immersed in an organic solvent that is amphiphilic for water and organic materials, and the liquid affinity of the heat-treated porous body is increased to obtain an affinity-treated porous body impregnated with the organic solvent;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0031">(6) a crosslinking step in which the affinity-treated porous body is contacted with a mixture of an organometallic catalyst and water, or is immersed in a base solution or an acid solution and subjected to silane dehydration condensation reaction to form oligosiloxane bonds, obtaining a crosslinked porous body;

The separator, which must have an insulating property and ion permeability, will usually comprise an insulating material sheet with a porous body structure, a polyolefin nonwoven fabric or a resin microporous membrane. Particularly suited for a lithium ion battery is a polyolefin microporous membrane that allows construction of a compact homogeneous porous body structure with redox degradation resistance of the separator.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0090">A microporous membrane is a membrane composed of a porous body, and its mean pore size is preferably 10 nm to 500 nm and more preferably 30 nm to 100 nm.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0091">When the separator is included in an electricity storage device, the separator is removable from the electricity storage device.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0115" num="0092">The separator according to a first embodiment of the invention comprises a microporous membrane wherein the melted membrane rupture temperature is 180&#xb0; C. to 220&#xb0; C. as measured by thermomechanical analysis (TMA), and the microporous membrane includes a silane-modified polyolefin and silane-unmodified polyethylene. From the viewpoint of high-temperature membrane rupture resistance and electricity storage device safety, the melted membrane rupture temperature of the microporous membrane is 180&#xb0; C. to 220&#xb0; C. and preferably 180&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C., as measured by thermomechanical analysis (TMA). Even when the electricity storage device has generated abnormal heat release due to runaway reaction, the shutdown function of the separator is expected to stop movement of ions, and discharge in the electricity storage device or outside of the electricity storage device that results from it. It is expected that the electricity storage device as a whole is then cooled by a coolant, thus ensuring the safety. On the other hand, if the membrane rupture temperature of the microporous membrane is within the numerical range specified above, then the separator will undergo molten rupture and seep onto both electrodes so that the active materials can be coated, thus even more easily inhibiting heat release even when the electricity storage device as a whole is not sufficiently cooled, or even if an ultra-high temperature range is reached. The membrane rupture temperature of the microporous membrane can be measured by the method described in the Examples, and it can be controlled by changing the stretching temperature and/or stretch ratio during the production process.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0093">From the viewpoint of the production process and of controlling the amorphous part of the microporous membrane to ensure safety, the separator of the first embodiment preferably has the content of scandium, vanadium, copper, zinc, zirconium, palladium, gallium, tin, titanium, iron, nickel or lead controlled to within a range of 0.10 ppm to 200 ppm as the total in terms of atoms, more preferably it has the content of zinc or tin controlled to within the range of 0.10 ppm to 200 ppm as the total in terms of atoms, and even more preferably it has their content controlled to within the range of 1 ppm to 150 ppm.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0094">From the viewpoint of both a shutdown function at relatively low temperature and membrane rupture properties at relatively high temperature, as well as improved cycle characteristics and safety of the electricity storage device, the separator of the first embodiment may also comprise a microporous membrane; and an inorganic porous layer including inorganic particles and a resin binder, disposed on at least one surface of the microporous membrane. The separator may also employ the microporous membrane as a base material, and may consist of a composite of the base material and an inorganic coating layer.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0118" num="0095">The separator according to a second embodiment of the invention comprises a first porous layer (layer A) that has a crosslinked structure and includes a silane-modified polyolefin, and a second porous layer (layer B) that includes inorganic particles. Layer A and layer B are both either single layers or multiple layers. Layer B is formed on only one side or on both sides of layer A.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0096">In a LIB, as a typical electricity storage device, lithium (Li) ions reciprocate between positive and negative electrodes. By situating a separator comprising layer A and layer B between the positive and negative electrodes, therefore, it is possible to cause relatively rapid movement of Li ions between the positive and negative electrodes, while avoiding contact between the positive and negative electrodes.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">(Thickness Ratio)</heading><p id="p-0120" num="0097">Layer A functions as a crosslinkable microporous membrane, while layer B functions as an inorganic porous layer to be formed on the microporous membrane.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0098">The ratio of the thickness (TA) of layer A with respect to the thickness (TB) of layer B (TA/TB) is 0.22 to 14. If the ratio (TA/TB) is 0.22 or greater it will be possible to adequately ensure the presence of layer A in the separator and to thus exhibit the function of layer A. If the ratio (TA/TB) is 14 or lower, it will be possible to adequately ensure the presence of layer B in the separator and to thus exhibit the function of layer B.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0099">By forming layer A and layer B with their respective specific structures and setting the ratio (TA/TB) to be within this range, it is possible to provide a separator that can improve cycle characteristics and safety in an electricity storage device. The separator can be suitably used as a constituent material of a LIB for mounting in a mobile device or a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0100">From the viewpoint of this effect, the ratio (TA/TB) is preferably 0.8 or greater and more preferably 1.0 or greater. The ratio (TA/TB) is also preferably no higher than 5.5 and more preferably no higher than 3.2.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0101">The ratio (TA/TB) may be set to be lower than 2.5, 2.0 or lower, or 1.0 or lower, for example. In this case, the thickness (TA) of layer A is less than 2.5 times the thickness (TB) of layer B, or even smaller than the thickness (TB) of layer B, thus allowing the layer A to be provided as a thinner membrane so that the separator thickness can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0102">The total thickness of layer A and layer B (TA+TB) is preferably 3.0 &#x3bc;m to 22 &#x3bc;m. If the total thickness (TA+TB) is 3.0 &#x3bc;m or greater the membrane strength of the separator will tend to be increased. If the total thickness (TA+TB) is 22 &#x3bc;m or smaller, on the other hand, the ion permeability of the separator will tend to be increased.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0103">From the viewpoint of this effect, the total thickness (TA+TB) is more preferably 3.5 &#x3bc;m or greater and even more preferably 4.0 &#x3bc;m or greater. The total thickness (TA+TB) is also more preferably no greater than 20 &#x3bc;m and even more preferably no greater than 18 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0104">The total thickness (TA+TB) may be set to less than 11 &#x3bc;m, 10 &#x3bc;m or smaller or 8 &#x3bc;m or smaller, for example. Even with such a thin separator it is still possible to improve the cycle characteristics and safety of an electricity storage device, so long as the ranges of the invention are satisfied.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0105">The ratio (TA/TB) and the total thickness (TA+TB) may each be measured by the methods described in the Examples, and they can be controlled by adjusting the thickness (TA) and/or the thickness (TB). Layer A and layer B will now be described.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">(Shutdown Temperature and Meltdown Temperature)</heading><p id="p-0129" num="0106">Layer A preferably has a shutdown temperature (also referred to as the fuse temperature) of 130&#xb0; C. to 160&#xb0; C. and a meltdown temperature (also referred to as the membrane rupture temperature) of 200&#xb0; C. or higher, as measured based on the electrical resistance under pressure of 0.1 MPa to 10.0 MPa (preferably under pressure of 10 MPa).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0107">If the shutdown temperature is 130&#xb0; C. or higher it will be possible to avoid unnecessary operation of the shutdown function during periods of normal reaction in the electricity storage device, and the electricity storage device can be ensured to have sufficient output characteristics. If the shutdown temperature is 160&#xb0; C. or lower, on the other hand, the shutdown function can be suitably exhibited during periods of abnormal reaction in the electricity storage device.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0108">In addition, a meltdown temperature of 200&#xb0; C. or higher will be able to stop abnormal reaction before the ultra-high temperature range is reached during periods of abnormal reaction in the electricity storage device, and can prevent melting membrane rupture of the separator during periods of abnormal reaction of the electricity storage device.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0109">In other words, if the shutdown temperature and meltdown temperature satisfy the conditions specified above, then it will be possible to obtain a separator that is able to provide an electricity storage device which is excellent in terms of heat resistance, pore occlusion property (shutdown function) and melting membrane rupture property (meltdown function), and to ensure the mechanical properties and ion permeability of the separator itself. With a separator whose shutdown temperature and meltdown temperature satisfy the aforementioned conditions, therefore, the electricity storage device can be designed with improved cycle characteristics and safety.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0110">From the viewpoint of this effect, the shutdown temperature is preferably higher than 130&#xb0; C., more preferably 135&#xb0; C. or higher and even more preferably 136&#xb0; C. or higher. The shutdown temperature is also preferably no higher than 150&#xb0; C., more preferably no higher than 148&#xb0; C. and even more preferably no higher than 146&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0111">From the same viewpoint of this effect, the meltdown temperature is preferably 175&#xb0; C. or higher, more preferably 178&#xb0; C. or higher and even more preferably 180&#xb0; C. or higher.

Specifically, the shutdown temperature and meltdown temperature are derived from the alternating-current resistance (alternating-current resistance between electrodes) that increases with increasing temperature of the laminated stack comprising the positive electrode, separator and negative electrode while applying the aforementioned pressure to the laminated stack. For the second embodiment, the shutdown temperature is the temperature at which the alternating-current resistance first exceeds a prescribed reference value (for example, 1000&#x3a9;), and the meltdown temperature is the temperature at which the alternating-current resistance exceeding the reference value falls below the reference value (for example, 1000&#x3a9;) as further heating is continued thereafter.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0114">A hydraulic jack may be used for pressurizing of the laminated stack, but this is not restrictive, and any known pressurizing means other than a hydraulic jack may be used.

More specifically, it may be determined by the method described in the Examples. Moreover, the &#x201c;glass transition&#x201d; refers to the value when a change in heat quantity accompanying the change in state of a polymer test piece in DSC occurs at the endothermic end. The change in heat quantity is observed in the form of a stepwise change in the DSC curve. A &#x201c;stepwise change&#x201d; is a portion of the DSC curve moving away from the previous low-temperature end baseline and toward a new high-temperature end baseline. A combination of a stepwise change and a peak is also included in the concept of &#x201c;stepwise change&#x201d;. The &#x201c;inflection point&#x201d; is the point at which the slope of the DSC curve is maximum in the stepwise change region. If the exothermic end in the stepwise change region is defined as the top end, then this represents the point where the upwardly convex curve changes to a downwardly convex curve. The term &#x201c;peak&#x201d; refers to a portion of the DSC curve that moves away from the low-temperature end baseline and then returns to the same baseline. The term &#x201c;baseline&#x201d; refers to the DSC curve in the temperature zone where no transition or reaction takes place in the test piece.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0264">Examples for the resin binder include the following 1) to 7), for example.

The electrolyte solution described above for the method of producing the separator may also be used in the lithium ion secondary battery. During charge and discharge of the lithium ion secondary battery, ionized lithium reciprocates between the electrodes. The separator is disposed between the electrodes since the ionized lithium must migrate between the electrodes relatively rapidly while contact between the electrodes is inhibited.</p><heading id="h-0047" level="2">&#x3c;Method for Producing Separator for Electricity Storage Device&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0305" num="0281">Another aspect of the invention is a method for producing a separator for an electricity storage device.

The obtained silane-grafted polyolefin molten resin was cooled in water and pelletized, after which it was heat-dried at 80&#xb0; C. for 2 days and the water and unreacted trimethoxyalkoxide-substituted vinylsilane were removed. The residual concentration of the unreacted trimethoxyalkoxide-substituted vinylsilane in the pellets was about 10 to 1500 ppm.</p><p id="p-0451" num="0407">Tables 1 to 3 show silane graft-modified polyethylenes obtained by this method, as &#x201c;Silane-modified polyethylene (B)&#x201d;.</p><heading id="h-0091" level="2">[Membrane Formation Example I]</heading><heading id="h-0092" level="2">(Sheet-Forming Step)</heading><p id="p-0452" num="0408">To 79.2 weight % of polyethylene homopolymer with a weight-average molecular weight of 2,000,000 (polyethylene(A)) there was added 19.8 weight % of silane-grafted polyethylene (silane-modified polyethylene (B)) with an MFR of 0.4 g/min, obtained using a polyolefin with a viscosity-average molecular weight of 20,000 as starting material and modification reaction with trimethoxyalkoxide-substituted vinylsilane (the respective contents of resin compositions (A) and (B) thus being 0.8 and 0.2), and 1 weight % of pentaerythrityl-tetrakis-[3-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionatel as an antioxidant, and these were dry blended using a tumbler blender to obtain a mixture.

polyethylene with a viscosity-average molecular weight of 100,000 as the polyethylene, the polyethylene starting material was melt kneaded with an extruder while adding an organic peroxide (di-t-butyl peroxide) and generating radicals in the polymer chain of the &#x3b1;-olefin, and then it was filled with trimethoxyalkoxide-substituted vinylsilane and addition reaction was carried out to introduce alkoxysilyl groups into the &#x3b1;-olefin polymer, forming a silane-graft structure. A suitable amount of an antioxidant (pentaerythritoltetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tetra-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]) was simultaneously added to the reaction system to adjust the radical concentration in the system, thus inhibiting chain-style chain reaction (gelation) in the &#x3b1;-olefin. The obtained silane-grafted polyolefin molten resin was cooled in water and pelletized, after which it was heat-dried at 80&#xb0; C. for 2 days and the water and unreacted trimethoxyalkoxide-substituted vinylsilane were removed. The residual concentration of the unreacted trimethoxyalkoxide-substituted vinylsilane in the pellets was about 1500 ppm or lower.</p><p id="p-0530" num="0476">Modification reaction of the trimethoxyalkoxide-substituted vinylsilane in this manner yielded a silane-modified polyethylene with an MFR (190&#xb0; C.) of 0.4 g/min.</p><heading id="h-0115" level="2">(Fabrication of Layer A)</heading><p id="p-0531" num="0477">After combining 35 weight % of the previously obtained silane-modified polyethylene with 65 weight % of polyethylene homopolymer having a weight-average molecular weight of 750,000 to obtain a resin blend, 1 weight % of pentaerythrityl-tetrakis-[3-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionatel was added to the blend as an antioxidant, and a tumbler blender was used for dry blending to obtain a mixture. The obtained mixture was supplied to a twin-screw extruder through a feeder, under a nitrogen atmosphere. Also, liquid paraffin (kinematic viscosity at 37.78&#xb0; C.: 7.59&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>m<sup>2</sup>/s) was injected into the extruder cylinder by a plunger pump.</p><p id="p-0532" num="0478">The mixture was melt kneaded with liquid paraffin in an extruder, and adjusted with a feeder and pump so that the quantity ratio of liquid paraffin in the extruded polyolefin composition was 70 weight % (i.e. a polymer concentration of 30 weight %). The melt kneading conditions were a preset temperature of 220&#xb0; C., a screw rotational speed of 240 rpm and a discharge throughput of 18 kg/h.
