This blocking retains the integrity of the coil stacks, transfers lateral and circumferential thermal expansion loads, and provides space for ventilation, among other features. Correct alignment and position of the blocking is necessary for proper functioning of the generator field windings. During both assembly and service of the generator rotor, the blocking can experience significant loading (e.g., force due to assembly of all components, crushing from retaining ring assembly, turning gear cyclic gravity loading, centrifugal loading at 3000-6000 g, thermal expansion loading, etc.). The retention mechanism that holds the blocking in place must be able to handle all of these loads; otherwise the blocking can become loose and shift position.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Existing retention mechanisms for blocking tend to be very expensive to manufacture and install due to complexity in the assembly on the rotor. Further, these retention mechanisms have durability issues due to the loading that the blocking can experience during assembly and service of the generator rotor. An example of one of these existing retention mechanisms can include the use of rivets affixed to the top of the blocking. Specific drawbacks with the use of the rivets include the rivets shearing part of the blocking, inability of the rivets to withstand load, and the rivets tendency to become easily damaged during installation due to forces and strikes. Other retention mechanisms such as the use of tie rods and felt have their own unique issues making them undesirable in certain scenarios.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosed subject matter in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the various embodiments described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the various embodiments. It is not intended to exclusively identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter set forth in the Claims, nor is it intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosure in a streamlined form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The various embodiments are directed to providing solutions that overcome the deficiencies associated with the existing retention mechanisms used to hold in place the blocking deployed in a generator rotor. In particular, the various embodiments utilize a semi-flexible, durable sheet of material that is affixed within a slot formed in the blocking, that extends out from the slot and over a portion of a top surface of the blocking, where it is pinched between the coils and insulation of a retaining ring that is fitted over the endwinding coils. This semi-flexible, durable sheet of material, referred to as a cap, can be folded to take on a shape that fits in the slot such that there is at least one end that can extend beyond a periphery of the top surface of the blocking towards the endwinding coils. The shape of the sheet of material can include a &#x201c;T&#x201d; shape, an &#x201c;L&#x201d; shape, or a &#x201c;dual&#x201d; cap shape where two &#x201c;L&#x201d; shaped-caps are fitted into the slot back to back, such that one of the &#x201c;L&#x201d; shaped-caps extends out and beyond one end of a top surface of the blocking with the other &#x201c;L&#x201d; shaped-cap extending out and beyond an opposing end of the top surface of the blocking. The portion of the cap that is inserted into the slot can have at least one hole that aligns with at least one transverse hole formed on an outer surface of the blocking that extends in a perpendicular direction towards the slot.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A fastener, such as, for example, a pin, is placed in the at least one transverse hole of the blocking and the at least one hole in the portion of the cap in the slot, securing the cap with the blocking. To this extent, there is a vertical engagement between the blocking and the cap, and a horizontal engagement block between the cap and the endwindings. This vertical engagement and horizontal engagement lock the blocking, the cap, and the fastener together. As a result, the contact area of the cap to retention can be significantly increased, thus increasing the tear load to pull the cap out. Further, affixing the cap within the slot, as opposed to the top surface of the blocking, makes the design of the various embodiments less prone to becoming easily damaged during assembly.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The various embodiments have several benefits over the existing retention mechanisms such as those that use rivets to hold in place the blocking deployed in a generator rotor. First, the retention mechanism of the various embodiments is much more durable against hammer blows or any impact on the top of the blocking which can happen during installation. Second, the retention mechanism of the various embodiments has a higher shear/tear strength from lateral loads seen in service of the generator rotor. Third, the assembly of the retention mechanism of the various embodiments can be made of entirely non-metallic components which is beneficial as any loose metallic components can cause electrical shorting in a generator field winding. As a result of these benefits, the solution offered by the various embodiments is cost effective and robust to assembly and operational loading.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, a rotor endwinding blocking member is provided. The rotor endwinding blocking member comprises: a spacer block adapted for radial placement between rotor endwindings disposed on a generator rotor, the spacer block including a spacer body having a radially inboard end, a radially outboard end, a slot extending radially inward a predetermined distance from the radially outboard end towards the radially inboard end, and at least one transverse hole formed on an outer surface of the spacer body, extending in a perpendicular direction towards the slot; a cap that covers at least a portion of a top surface of the radially outboard end of the spacer body of the spacer block, the cap having a radially inward portion received in the slot of the spacer body of the spacer block with at least one hole formed therein aligned with the at least one transverse hole formed on the outer surface of the spacer body of the spacer block, and at least one end extending beyond a periphery of the radially outboard end of the spacer body of the spacer block towards an adjacent endwinding; and a fastener placed in the at least one transverse hole of the spacer body of the spacer block and the at least one hole in the radially inward portion of the cap, securing the cap with the spacer body of the spacer block.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, a generator rotor is provided.

In this example, the tests showed that the cap held to the top of the blocking with rivets broke at around 200 in-lbf (135 lbs&#xd7;1.5 in) with the rivets bent before shearing. In addition, the cap held to the top of the blocking with rivets sheared with 10 hammer blows, with two hammer blows causing shearing at 65 in-lbf (85 lbs&#xd7;&#xbe; in). This example also showed that the cap with rivet configuration also sheared around 45 lbs in the vertical test.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">These testing results show that the various retention mechanisms described herein for use in holding the endwinding blocking have significant (2&#xd7;-3&#xd7;) increase in cap strength than that associated with the cap that utilizes rivets to affix the cap to the top of the blocking. For example, the retention mechanisms of the various embodiments have two times the vertical tear out strength than that of the cap and rivet configuration. Additionally, the retention mechanisms of the various embodiments showed no noticeable damage from hammer tests in contrast to the damage to the rivets that showed in the test performed on the cap and rivet configuration.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">From the description of the illustrated embodiments and the examples, it is evident that the subject disclosure sets forth an endwinding blocking member with a retention mechanism that overcomes the drawbacks associated with the existing retention mechanisms used with the blocking. In particular, the various embodiments utilize a semi-flexible, durable sheet of material that is affixed within a slot formed in the blocking, that extends out from the slot and over a portion of a top surface of the blocking, where it is pinched between the coils and insulation of the retaining ring. This semi-flexible, durable sheet of material, referred to as a cap, can be folded to take on a shape that fits in the slot such that there is at least one end that can extend beyond a periphery of the top surface of the blocking towards the endwinding coils. The shape of the sheet of material can include a &#x201c;T&#x201d; shape or an &#x201c;L&#x201d; shape. The portion of the cap that is inserted into the slot can have at least one hole that aligns with at least one transverse hole formed on an outer surface of the blocking that extends in a perpendicular direction towards the slot.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A fastener, such as, for example, a pin, is placed in the at least one transverse hole of the blocking and the at least one hole in the portion of the cap in the slot, securing the cap with the blocking. To this extent, there is a vertical engagement between the blocking and the cap, and a horizontal engagement block between the cap and the endwindings. This vertical engagement and horizontal engagement lock the blocking, the cap, and the fastener together. As a result, the contact area of the cap to retention can be significantly increased, thus increasing the tear load to pull the cap out. Further, affixing the cap within the slot, as opposed to the top surface of the blocking, makes the design of the various embodiments less prone to becoming easily damaged during assembly. The retention mechanism of the endwinding blocking member can be enhanced by applying a bonding material such as an adhesive to one or more locations that can include in the semi-flexible, durable sheet of material used to form the cap, between the cap and the blocking and on the fastener.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">There are several technical effects associated with the various embodiments. First, the retention mechanism of the endwinding blocking member of the various embodiments used to hold in place the blocking deployed in a generator rotor is much more durable against hammer blows or any impact on the top of the blocking which can happen during installation. Second, the retention mechanism of the various embodiments has a higher shear/tear strength from lateral loads seen in service of the generator rotor. Third, the assembly of the retention mechanism of the various embodiments can be made of entirely non-metallic components which is beneficial as any loose metallic components can cause electrical shorting in a generator field winding. As a result of these benefits, which are apparent in comparison to retention mechanisms that use rivets, the solution offered by the various embodiments is cost effective and robust to assembly and operational loading.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Other technical effects of the various embodiments of the present invention include a cost effective design. As a result of this design, the cycle time to procure parts to form the endwinding blocking member described herein and install in a generator rotor will be short. With the endwinding blocking member of the various embodiments less prone to becoming damaged due to a more robust retention mechanism, the likelihood of it becoming loose is diminished. As a result, there will be less operational issues associated with the service of the generator rotor. Further, because there is less complexity associated with the retention mechanism, the endwinding blocking member can be replaced without much difficulty. As a result, the service of the generator rotor can be performed directly by the operators of the rotor, obviating the need to rely on special service vendors to perform the work. In addition, another advantage associated with the retention mechanism of the endwinding blocking member that is due to its minimal complexity is that the generator rotor can easily be modified or retrofitted according to any of the various embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The above description of illustrated embodiments of the subject disclosure, including what is described in the Abstract, is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the disclosed embodiments to the precise forms disclosed.
