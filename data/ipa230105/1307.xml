For example, a video game player known in a community of game players may live stream videos of himself or herself playing video games, and may want to invite other users to join in a game session. However, it can be difficult for a game player to invite others to join a game session. For example, in some cases, a game player may announce that they will be online at a particular time for other users to join in a game session. In another example, a game player may obtain a username (or gamertag) associated with a player, add the player on a messaging or social networking system (e.g., as a friend), and use the messaging or social networking system to communicate with the player to set up a future game session. It is generally difficult to organize these game sessions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide new methods, systems, and media for coordinating multiplayer game sessions.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods, systems, and media for coordinating multiplayer game sessions are provided.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, a method for coordinating multiplayer game sessions is provided, the method comprising: determining that a first user associated with a first user device is viewing game content created by a second user associated with a second user device;

For example, the mechanisms can determine whether the first user is eligible to join a multiplayer game session with the second user based on any suitable criteria. For example, in some embodiments, the criteria can include an indication that the first user has previously subscribed to and/or sponsored a channel of content associated with the second user (e.g., a channel of content corresponding to video content associated with game content played by the second user, and/or any other suitable channel of content). In another example, in some embodiments, the criteria can include an indication that the first user has previously provided monetary support or recurring monetary support for the second user in a gaming service. In yet another example, in some embodiments, the criteria can include an indication that the first user has previously sponsored game content associated with the second user in a gaming service (e.g., a particular gaming session being played and presented by the second user). In yet another example, in some embodiments, the criteria can include whether the first user has user entitlements to play a particular game associated with the multiplayer game session (e.g., based on whether the first user has previously purchased and/or rented the game being played in the multiplayer game session, based on whether the first user is older than a particular age, based on whether the first user is within a particular location, based on whether the first user is using a particular web browsing application, and/or any other suitable allowability criteria). In some embodiments, the mechanisms can cause the selectable input element to join a multiplayer game session with the second user to be presented on a user device associated with the first user in response to determining that the first user has met one or more of the suitable criteria to join the multiplayer game session. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the selectable input element may be presented in the video window on the page associated with the video account of the second user and may be de-activated in response to determining that the first user does not meet the criteria.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, based on queue state information, the mechanisms can transmit an invitation to the first user using a first user device, where the invitation causes the first user of the first user device to join a multiplayer game session with the second user. In response to determining that the invitation has not been accepted by the first user of the first user device within a particular time window, the mechanisms can return the first user to the queue of players. In some embodiments, in response to determining that the invitation has not been accepted by the first user of the first user device a particular number of times, the mechanisms can remove the first user from the queue of players. In some embodiments, in response to determining that the invitation has not been accepted by the first user of the first user device a particular number of times, the mechanisms can inhibit the selectable input element from being activated (e.g., for a particular content creator, for a particular duration of time, for a particular numbers of sessions, etc.).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can then add users from a queue of players to join a multiplayer game session with the second user.

For example, the second user can activate a selectable input element (e.g., a &#x201c;queue to play&#x201d; button) and provide one or more criteria for determining whether a first user or other joining users is eligible to participate in a multiplayer game session with the second user, where the selectable input element is presented in connection with one or more content items associated with the second user (e.g., a home page corresponding to an account of the second user, one or more video content items uploaded by the second user, etc.).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">It should further be noted that, in some embodiments, the criteria or player eligibility information for activating the selectable input element can be set by any suitable entity (e.g., an entity associated with the game may require that players in a multiplayer game session involving the game be over the age of <b>18</b> and within the United States).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">At <b>208</b>, in response to determining that the first user has selected the selectable input element to join a multiplayer game session with the second user, process <b>200</b> can add the first user to a queue of players for participating in a multiplayer game session with the second user. In some embodiments, any suitable other users can be included in the queue (e.g., other users who have selected selectable input elements to join a multiplayer game session with the second user, users that are currently involved in a multiplayer game session and have indicated that they wish to play in a subsequent multiplayer game session with the second user, and/or any other suitable users). It should be noted that there can be any suitable number (e.g., ten, fifty, one hundred, and/or any other suitable number) of users in the queue of players. Note that, in some embodiments, any suitable information associated with the queue of players waiting to join a multiplayer game session associated with the second user can be stored on any suitable device. For example, in some embodiments, a server associated with a game service or a game system (and/or any other suitable server) can store information, such as usernames associated with each user in the queue, a position within the queue of each user in the queue, a time each user joined the queue, and/or any other suitable information.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">It should be noted that, in some embodiments, in response to determining that the second user is no longer available to participate in a multiplayer game session (e.g., the second user is offline or otherwise not authenticated with a gaming service or a content hosting service) and in response to determining that the second user has returned within a particular period of time (e.g., the second user is available to participate in multiplayer game sessions and five minutes has elapsed), process <b>200</b> can recover the queue and, to the extent the users remain available, replace the users within the queue at the previously known position.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, process <b>200</b> can allow the second user to modify the queue of players. For example, in some embodiments, the second user can provide an indication to remove a particular player from the queue of players (e.g., block a player from joining a multiplayer game session). In another example, in some embodiments, the second user can activate a criterion (e.g., a sponsorship criterion) that, upon satisfying the criterion, can advance particular players within the queue of players. In yet another example, in some embodiments, the second user can select an option to initiate a subsequent multiplayer game session with the same users in the current multiplayer game session, thereby not accepting additional players from the queue of players.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Note that, in some embodiments, the selectable input element described above in connection with <b>206</b> can be updated in response to the first user being added to the queue. For example, in some embodiments, the selectable input element can be modified to a selectable input element that, upon selection, causes the first user to leave the queue. As another example, in some embodiments, the selectable input element can be modified to indicate a current position of the first user within the queue (e.g., position #<b>10</b>, three more multiplayer game sessions until the first user can join a multiplayer game session, etc.). Note that, in some such embodiments, the selectable input element can be modified over time as the first user changes position within the queue (e.g., as the first user moves up in the queue).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Additionally or alternatively, the selectable input element can be deactivated or otherwise rendered to be not selectable on a first user device associated with the first user to inhibit the first user from entering the queue at multiple times.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">At <b>210</b>, in response to determining that the second user has initiated a new multiplayer game session, process <b>200</b> can begin adding users from the queue to the new multiplayer game session. In some embodiments, process <b>200</b> can add users from the queue to the new multiplayer game session in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, process <b>200</b> can add users from the head of the queue to the multiplayer game session. Note that, in some embodiments, any suitable number (e.g., five, ten, twenty, and/or any other suitable number) of users can be added to the new multiplayer game session from the queue. In some embodiments, a number of users added to the multiplayer game session from the queue can be specified by any suitable entity, such as the second user, a manufacturer of the game associated with the multiplayer game session, a game system or game service associated with the multiplayer game session, and/or any other suitable entity. More detailed techniques for adding a user from the queue to the multiplayer game session are described below in connection with blocks <b>212</b>-<b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">At <b>212</b>, in response to determining that the first user has moved to the head of the queue, process <b>200</b> can cause an invitation to join a multiplayer game session on a user device associated with the first user. In some embodiments, process <b>200</b> can cause the invitation to join the multiplayer game session to be presented in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the invitation can be a push notification presented on the user device. As another example, in some embodiments, the invitation can be a pop-up message presented within a window or application in which the user selected the selectable input element as described above in connection with <b>206</b>. As yet another example, in some embodiments, the invitation can be a notification within a browser window open on the user device (e.g., a browser window in which the user is viewing the live-streamed content as described above in connection with <b>202</b>). An example of a notification presented on a user device associated with the first user is shown in and described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">At <b>214</b>, process <b>200</b> can determine whether the first user has accepted the invitation to join the multiplayer game session within a predetermined time range. In some embodiments, the predetermined time range can be any suitable time range (e.g., sixty seconds, two minutes, and/or any other suitable time range). In some embodiments, process <b>200</b> can determine whether the first user has accepted the invitation based on any suitable information, such as whether the invitation has been selected on the user device.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">If, at <b>214</b>, process <b>200</b> determines that the first user has not accepted the invitation to join the multiplayer game session within the predetermined time range (&#x201c;no&#x201d; at <b>214</b>), process <b>200</b> can return the first user back to the queue at <b>216</b>. For example, in an instance where the first user was first in the queue at <b>212</b>, and where there are <b>200</b> users in the queue, process <b>200</b> can move the first user to the <b>201</b>st position in the queue or the end of the queue. Note that, in some embodiments, process <b>200</b> can loop back to <b>212</b> and can wait until the first user is once again at the head of the queue. In another example, in an instance where the first user was first in the queue at <b>212</b>, and where there are <b>200</b> users in the queue, process <b>200</b> can return the first user to the top position of the queue for the next multiplayer game session (e.g., until process <b>200</b> has determined that the first user has not accepted a predetermined number of invitations to join the multiplayer game session).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Additionally, note that, in some embodiments, process <b>200</b> can remove the first user from the queue in response to determining that the user has not accepted a presented invitation a predetermined number of times (e.g., three time, five times, and/or any other suitable number). That is, in some embodiments, process <b>200</b> can limit a number of times that the first user is moved to the end of the queue or any other position in the queue at block <b>216</b> in response to determining that the first user has not accepted the invitation to join the multiplayer game session.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">If, at <b>214</b>, process <b>200</b> determines that the first user has accepted the invitation to join the multiplayer game session within the predetermined time range (&#x201c;yes&#x201d; at <b>214</b>), process <b>200</b> can initiate the multiplayer game session with at least the first user and the second user at <b>218</b>. Process <b>200</b> can begin the multiplayer game session in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, process <b>200</b> can begin the multiplayer game session in response to determining that the second user has initiated a new game (e.g., based on determining that the second user has selected a selectable input element to begin a new game, and/or based on any other suitable information). As another example, in some embodiments, process <b>200</b> can cause game content associated with the multiplayer game session to be presented on user devices of all users participating in the multiplayer game session. An example of a user interface that includes game content that can be presented on user devices of users participating in the multiplayer game session is shown in and described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. As a more particular example, in some embodiments, the game content can include live video content showing interactions of users participating in the multiplayer game session.

For example, in an instance where the selectable input element to join a multiplayer game session was presented in an application or a user interface associated with a video sharing service (e.g., a video sharing service hosting content associated with the second user viewed by the first user, as described above in connection with <b>202</b>), process <b>200</b> can cause the multiplayer game session to begin on the user device associated with the first user in connection with a window or an application associated with a game service or a game system. As a more particular example, in some embodiments, in response to the new multiplayer game session beginning, process <b>200</b> can cause an application associated with a game system or a game service to automatically be opened on the user device associated with the first user. In some such embodiments, process <b>200</b> can cause a window or an application associated with a video sharing service to execute in a background of the user device associated with the first user.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Note that, in some embodiments, process <b>200</b> can remove all users from the queue in response to adding the users to the multiplayer game session.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, as mentioned above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref>, a video content item can be generated from the multiplayer game session.
