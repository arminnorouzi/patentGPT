In other embodiments, the protective layer covering the sidewalls of the channel regions and the sidewalls and top surfaces of the second doped regions may also be formed through a deposition process.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">By thermally oxidizing the sidewalls of the channel regions II and the second doped regions III exposed, the channel regions II and the second doped regions III are partially converted into the protective layer <b>116</b>. The orthographic projections of the channel region II and the second doped region III on the base <b>11</b> are both smaller than the orthographic projection of the first doped region I on the base <b>11</b>. Thus, the channel regions II and the second doped regions III can be formed with a smaller sectional area in section perpendicular to the direction Z from the initial bit line <b>124</b> to the semiconductor channel <b>105</b>, without the need for an etching process. In this way, subsequently formed word lines can better control the channel regions II, thereby facilitating the control of the on or off of the GAA transistors.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In this embodiment, the part of the protective layer <b>116</b> on the top surfaces of the remaining parts of the second doped regions III is removed in a subsequent process.

The word lines <b>107</b> only surround the sidewall of the part of the insulating layer <b>106</b> located on the sidewalls of the channel regions II. The initial word lines may be formed through a deposition process, and the material of the initial word line includes at least one of polysilicon, titanium nitride, tantalum nitride, copper or tungsten.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The initial word lines fill up the sixth intervals k in a self-aligned manner, which is conducive to forming the word lines <b>107</b> with an accurate size in a self-aligned manner.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">After the word lines <b>107</b> are formed, forming the third isolation layer, forming the initial transition layer, metalizing the initial transition layer and the initial bit lines to form the metal contact layer and the bit lines, and forming the third dielectric layer are the same as those mentioned in above examples, and will not be repeated here.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, capacitor structures (not shown in the drawings) are formed on a surface formed by the metal contact layer <b>108</b> and the third dielectric layer <b>133</b>. In other embodiments, the metal contact layer may not be formed. After the part of the insulating layer located on the top surfaces of the second doped regions is removed, the capacitor structures are directly formed on the surface formed by the second doped regions and the third dielectric layer.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In summary, the first dielectric layer <b>113</b> and the second dielectric layer <b>123</b> are formed, and the first dielectric layer <b>113</b> is etched by using the second dielectric layer <b>123</b> as a mask to form void structures with a specific shape. The word lines <b>107</b> are formed with an accurate size in the void structures in a self-aligned manner through a deposition process. There is no need to design the size of the word line <b>107</b> through an etching process, thereby simplifying the forming the word lines <b>107</b>. In addition, by adjusting the size of the void structure, the small-sized word line <b>107</b> can be obtained. In addition, by metalizing the initial bit lines <b>124</b> and the initial transition layer <b>128</b>, the resistance of the finally formed bit lines <b>104</b> and the metal contact layer <b>108</b> is reduced. Thus, an ohmic contact is formed between the metal contact layer <b>108</b> and the capacitor structures to avoid direct contact between the capacitor structures and the semiconductor material to form a Schottky barrier contact. Such a design reduces the contact resistance between the second doped regions III and the capacitor structures and reduces the energy consumption during the operation of the semiconductor structure, thereby improving the electrical performance of the semiconductor structure.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In the description of the specification, the description with reference to terms such as &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;an exemplary embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;some implementations&#x201d;, &#x201c;a schematic implementation&#x201d; and &#x201c;an example&#x201d; means that the specific feature, structure, material, or characteristic described in combination with the implementation(s) or example(s) is included in at least one implementation or example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In this specification, the schematic expression of the above terms does not necessarily refer to the same implementation or example.
