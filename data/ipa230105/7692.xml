A lower layer performs an LBT procedure, and according to an LBT result, when a channel is determined to be occupied, no transmission is performed. When the lower layer performs the LBT procedure before the transmission and the transmission is not performed, that is, when uplink transmission is blocked due to an LBT failure, the lower layer indicates the LBT failure to a higher layer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It should be noted that the above description of the background is merely provided for clear and complete explanation of this disclosure and for easy understanding by those skilled in the art. And it should not be understood that the above technical solution is known to those skilled in the art as it is described in the background of this disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In New Radio (NR-U) systems on unlicensed bands, a consistent LBT failure detection and recovery mechanism for uplink transmissions is introduced.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A radio resource control (RRC) layer may configure a consistent LBT failure recovery procedure for a higher layer, such as an MAC entity of an MAC layer. Consistent LBT failure detection is performed on each uplink BWP (bandwidth part). For this purpose, a counter and a timer are introduced. When an uplink LBT failure occurs, the timer is started or restarted. Whenever the higher layer (such as the MAC layer) receives an uplink LBT failure indication from the lower layer (such as a physical layer), the counter is incremented by 1, and when a count value of the counter exceeds a preset value, consistent LBT failure is triggered. Furthermore, when the timer expires, the counter is reset. This procedure may be regarded as a consistent (uplink) LBT failure detection procedure or a part or a step of a consistent (uplink) LBT failure detection procedure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It was found by the inventors that according to an existing mechanism, in order to realize a consistent LBT failure detection mechanism of uplink transmission of a higher layer, a lower layer needs to provide an indication for an MAC layer, that is, the lower layer notifies or indicates to the higher layer when any uplink transmission is blocked due to the LBT failure or a channel access failure occurs.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, at the lower layer, uplink transmission including data, control information and a reference signal may occur at any time, and when the lower layer notifies or indicates to the higher layer whenever the uplink transmission is blocked due to the LBT failure, the interaction between the lower layer and the higher layer will be greatly increased, and power consumption of a terminal equipment will also be increased.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to solve one or more of the above problems, embodiments of this disclosure provide a method and apparatus for indicating an LBT failure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first aspect of the embodiments of this disclosure, there is provided an apparatus for indicating an LBT failure, applicable to a terminal equipment, the apparatus including: a first indicating unit configured to, in a case where a lower layer or a higher layer determines that a first condition and/or a second condition are/is satisfied, when uplink transmission is blocked due to an LBT failure, notify or indicate the LBT failure by the lower layer to the higher layer, or start to notify or indicate the LBT failure by the lower layer to the higher layer; and/or a second indicating unit configured to, in a case where the lower layer or the higher layer determines that the first condition and/or a third condition are/is not satisfied, when uplink transmission is blocked due to an LBT failure, not notify or indicate the LBT failure by the lower layer to the higher layer, or stop notifying or indicating the LBT failure by the lower layer to the higher layer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a second aspect of the embodiments of this disclosure, there is provided an apparatus for indicating an LBT failure, applicable to a network device, the apparatus including: a configuring unit configured to configure a higher layer parameter for a terminal equipment, the higher layer parameter being used by the terminal equipment for determining whether a lower layer notifies or indicates an LBT failure to a higher layer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a third aspect of the embodiments of this disclosure, there is provided a terminal equipment, including the apparatus described in the first aspect of the embodiments of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a fourth aspect of the embodiments of this disclosure, there is provided a network device, including the apparatus described in the second aspect of the embodiments of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a fifth aspect of the embodiments of this disclosure, there is provided a communications system, including the terminal equipment described in the third aspect of the embodiments of this disclosure and/or the network device described in the fourth aspect of the embodiments of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a sixth aspect of the embodiments of this disclosure, there is provided a method for indicating an LBT failure, applicable to a terminal equipment, the method including: in a case where a lower layer or a higher layer determines that a first condition and/or a second condition are/is satisfied, when uplink transmission is blocked due to an LBT failure, notifying or indicating the LBT failure by the lower layer to the higher layer, or starting to notify or indicate the LBT failure by the lower layer to the higher layer;
