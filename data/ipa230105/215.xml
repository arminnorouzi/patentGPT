INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a buckle device, especially to a buckle device that is utilized to a bag, a backpack, a box, a suitcase, etc. The buckle device is detachably connected to two components and can be applied to various locks.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Arts</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">One of the defects of a conventional buckle device, such as a lock or a suitcase, is that to insert a male part into a female part of the buckle device, the user has to precisely align the male part to the female part and then insert the male part into the female part of the buckle device with a certain force, which is not convenient. Especially, when locking up the buckle device, one hand of the user may not be available, and therefore the buckle device cannot be locked up with ease.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To overcome the shortcomings, the present invention provides a magnetic buckle device to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The main objective of the present invention is to provide a buckle device which can be fastened with ease.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The magnetic buckle device has a first base, a second base, a first component, a second component, and a lock mechanism. The first component is mounted to the first base. The second component is mounted to the second base. A magnetic attraction force is generated between the first component and the second component to move the first base and the second base toward each other. The lock mechanism is connected to the second base and has a locked status and an unlocked status. The lock mechanism has an engaging component and an unlocking component. In the locked status, the first base and the engaging component engage with each other such that the first base and the engaging component are inseparable. In the unlocked status, the unlocking component is capable of being operated to allow the first base and the engaging component to disengage from each other.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When connecting the first base to the second base and the two bases are close to each other, the magnetic attraction force between the first component and the second component facilitates guiding the first and second bases to connect so that the first and second bases can be connected with ease. The magnetic attraction force also helps the engaging component of the lock mechanism to engage with the first base such that the first base, the second base and the lock mechanism are connected together. Then, the lock mechanism can be set to a locked status to ensure the first base cannot separate. After switching the lock mechanism to the unlocked status (via inserting a key or input correct combination, for example), the first base and the engaging component can be disengaged by operating (pressing or rotating, for example) the unlocking component of the lock mechanism, thereby allowing the first base to be separated.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The magnetic attraction force facilitates guiding the first and second bases to connect, and the magnetic attraction force also helps to maintain connection. Therefore, the present invention does not require excessive structure for connection, thereby requiring less force from the user to connect and greatly improve ease of use,</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other objectives, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a first embodiment of a magnetic buckle device in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> are exploded perspective views of the magnetic buckle device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a sectional top view of the magnetic buckle device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> are side sectional views of the magnetic buckle device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, showing different operating statuses of the magnetic buckle device;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a side view showing the magnetic buckle device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> used on a box,</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of a second embodiment of the magnetic buckle device in accordance with the present invention, showing the magnetic buckle device used in a chain lock;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the magnetic buckle device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> to <b>12</b></figref> are side sectional views of the magnetic buckle device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, showing different operating statuses of the magnetic buckle device;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a perspective view of a third embodiment of the magnetic buckle device in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a perspective view showing different operating statuses of the magnetic buckle device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref> are exploded perspective views of the magnetic buckle device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref> are top sectional views of the magnetic buckle device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, showing different operating statuses of the magnetic buckle device;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is an end sectional view of the magnetic buckle device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a schematic top view of the magnetic buckle device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, showing the magnetic buckle device used in a zipper; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a schematic top view of the magnetic buckle device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, showing the magnetic buckle device used in connecting two strips.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>15</b></figref>, a magnetic buckle device in accordance with the present invention comprises a first base <b>10</b>, a second base <b>20</b>, a first component <b>41</b>, a second component <b>42</b>, and a lock mechanism <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first component <b>41</b> is mounted to the first base <b>10</b>, and the second component <b>42</b> is mounted to the second base <b>20</b>.
