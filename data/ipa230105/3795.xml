In order to detect electronic components, chips, integrated circuits, and other devices, in some technologies, a plurality of devices under test (DUTs for short) can be placed at a plurality of test locations of a daisy chain test platform <b>20</b> at the same time. For example, DUT<b>1</b>-DUT<b>8</b> plotted as examples in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are placed at test locations W<b>1</b>-W<b>8</b> provided by the test platform <b>20</b>, respectively. Afterwards, the signal source <b>10</b> inputs the test signal via a test signal input interface W<b>0</b> on the test platform <b>20</b>, and given that the plurality of test locations on the test platform <b>20</b> are all connected to the interface W<b>0</b>, the DUT disposed at each test location can receive the same test signal. At this time, the batch detection of devices can be realized by detecting whether the plurality of DUTs receive test signals, allowing for a higher detection efficiency.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, a plurality of test locations can be set on the test platform, and the distance between each of the test location and the signal source varies, such that when the signal source <b>10</b> sends a test signal to the test platform <b>20</b> at time TO in an example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a certain delay exists between the time when the test signal is actually received by the DUT disposed at each test location and time TO. This time delay indicates the time loss caused by the transmission of the test signal across the transmission path on the test platform <b>20</b>. The farther the test location on the test platform <b>20</b> is from the signal source <b>10</b>, the greater the time delay of the test signal received by the DUT. For example, DUT<b>1</b> and DUT<b>5</b> disposed on at test locations W<b>1</b> and W<b>5</b> closest to the signal source <b>10</b> will receive the test signal at time T<b>1</b> after T<b>0</b>; and similarly, the DUT<b>4</b> and DUT<b>8</b> disposed on at test locations W<b>4</b> and W<b>8</b>, which are farthest from the signal source <b>10</b>, will not receive the test signal until time T<b>4</b> after T<b>0</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, since each test location on the test platform is fixed, after the time delays T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b> generated when the test signal is received at each of test locations are determined, time offset can be conducted via the offset device <b>30</b> regarding such time delay caused by the transmission distance. For example, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the offset device <b>30</b> may be connected to the signal source <b>10</b> and the test platform <b>20</b>, and can control the DUT disposed at each test location on the test platform <b>20</b>. The offset device <b>30</b> may be a computer, a server or chip or other electronic device capable of performing related data processing and control functions. Once the time delays T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b> generated at each test location on the test platform <b>20</b> are determined, the offset device <b>30</b> can control each DUT on the test platform <b>20</b>. When the signal source <b>10</b> sends a test signal at time T<b>0</b>, the offset device <b>30</b> controls the DUT<b>1</b> disposed at the test location W<b>1</b> to receive the test signal at time T<b>1</b>, and the DUT<b>2</b> disposed at the test location W<b>2</b> to receive the test signal at time T<b>2</b>, and so on.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the test signal received by the DUTs at different test locations on the test platform according to an embodiment. Upon time offset by the offset device <b>30</b>, when the signal source sends out the test signal L<b>0</b> at time TO, all DUTs on the test platform <b>20</b> can accurately receive the test signals L<b>1</b>-L<b>4</b> with the same waveform as L<b>0</b>, thus ensuring the smooth completion of the subsequent test.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">However, in actual tests, even if time offset is performed for a DUT on the test platform <b>20</b> by the offset device <b>30</b>, some cases in which the DUT cannot accurately receive the test signal may still occur occasionally. Observation shows that, on the transmission path of the test signal from the signal source <b>10</b> to the corresponding DUT on the test platform <b>20</b>, in addition to the time loss caused by the transmission path, there still exists a time delay caused by the impedance matching of DUTs on the test platform <b>20</b>. The impedance matching of the DUT at each test location varies, where the time delay is caused by the impedance matching between impedance of the DUT at the test location and impedance on the signal transmission line at the test location (1) and/or between impedance of the DUT at the test location and impedance of another DUT at other test locations (2), which will lead to a certain time delay in the transmission of the test signal. As a result, the DUT cannot receive the test signal accurately even at the time offset by the offset device <b>30</b>, which affects the accuracy of the test platform for testing DUTs and other devices.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the test signal received by the DUTs at different test locations on the test platform according to another embodiment. When the signal source sends the test signal L<b>0</b> at time TO, even after the time offset carried out by the offset device <b>30</b>, a certain time delay (Propagation Delay, referred to as Tpd<b>2</b>) still exists in waveform L<b>2</b>&#x2032; received by the DUT<b>2</b> and DUT<b>6</b> at the test locations W<b>2</b> and W<b>6</b>, as compared with ideal waveform L<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Similarly, the waveforms received by the DUT<b>3</b> and DUT<b>7</b> at the test locations W<b>3</b> and W<b>7</b> have a time delay Tpd<b>3</b>, and the waveforms received by DUT<b>4</b> and DUT<b>8</b> at the test locations W<b>4</b> and W<b>8</b> have a time delay Tpd<b>4</b>. Moreover, given that the impedance at each test location varies, and the impedance on the transmission path between the signal source and each test location is different, the impedance matching at each test location varies, resulting in different time delay caused by impedance matching at each test location. At the same time, the impedance at the test locations with different distances from the signal source varies on the transmission path, and the impedance at the test locations with the same distance from the signal source is regarded as the same. Consequently, the time delay caused by the matching impedance of the test locations with the same distance from the signal source is the same. Finally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the time delay caused by the impedance matching between the impedance of the DUT itself and the impedance on the propagation path and the impedance of the DUT at other locations will stop the DUT from accurately receiving the test signal, which in turn affects the subsequent test results against the DUT.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Therefore, the present application provides a time offset method and device for a test signal, which can implement time offset for the time delay caused by the impedance matching in each DUT on the test platform, so as to overcome the technical problem of time delay caused by the impedance matching to the test signal, which in turn improves the accuracy of the test platform for testing DUTs and other devices. The technical solution of the present application will be described in detail below with reference to specific embodiments. The following specific embodiments may be combined with each other, and the same or similar concepts or processes may not be repeatedly described in some examples.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart of a time offset method for a test signal according to an embodiment of the present application. The method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be applied to the scenario shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and is implemented by the offset device <b>30</b>, where the method includes:</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">S<b>101</b>: When the offset device <b>30</b> sends the test signal from the signal source <b>10</b> to the DUTs at a plurality of test locations on the test platform <b>20</b>, the offset device <b>30</b> acquires the time parameters of each DUT.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Specifically, when offsetting the impedance on a transmission path of test signals, the offset device <b>30</b> first needs to determine the time delay Tpd caused by impedance matching at each test location. In order to obtain an accurate time delay Tpd caused by impedance matching at each test location, and to reduce the influence of differences between different chips at different test locations on the detection results of time delay Tpd, methods adoptable in some embodiments of the present application are to place the same DUT at different locations on the test platform, and then collect the time delay Tpd caused by the corresponding impedance matching at different locations at the time when the DUT receives test signals at the different test locations.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a test state according to the present application. As shown in this figure, a DUT<b>0</b> is selected and sequentially placed at each of test locations W<b>1</b>-W<b>8</b> on the test platform <b>20</b>, and then the time parameters of the DUT<b>0</b> at each test location are collected.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the location of the DUT<b>0</b> may be adjusted by using the offset device <b>30</b> to control a slide rail, a mechanical arm, etc., to place the DUT<b>0</b> at different test locations according to the test requirements, and then the time parameters can be obtained.

At this moment, a signal source <b>10</b> can send a test signal to an input interface W<b>0</b> of the test platform <b>20</b>, and at the same time, the signal source <b>10</b> also sends the DUT<b>0</b> separately a TCK signal which may be determined in advance as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The connection relationship where the signal source <b>10</b> sends a TCK signal to the DUT<b>0</b> disposed at the test location W<b>1</b> is not shown in this figure. The DUT<b>0</b> can receive the TCK signal and the test signal at the same time, that is, the test signal can be received according to the TCK signal, for example, a receiving action is triggered at the rising edge or falling edge of the TCK signal.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Furthermore, when the DUT<b>0</b> receives the test signal, an important parameter is the TIS (TIS for short) at which the DUT<b>0</b> receives the test signal, where, when the DUT receives the test signal under the trigger of the TCK signal, the test signal should reach the DUT before the trigger of the TCK signal, such that the test signal received is stable when the DUT is triggered by the TCK signal and begins to receive the test signal, which is equivalent to the operation of providing a certain time (hence the name &#x201c;TIS&#x201d;) for the test signal to become stable in advance. If the time difference between the test signal and the TCK signal is less than the TIS, the test signal received by the DUT under the trigger of the TCK signal is not stable yet, which will cause the failure of the DUT to receive the test signal. Therefore, upon detection of time delay Tpd caused by impedance matching at the test location, the time delay Tpd can be quantified according to the TIS at which the DUT placed at the test location receives the test signal, and based thereupon, subsequent time offset is carried out.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, SHMOO testing can be conducted on DUTs disposed at each test location, thus acquiring time characteristic diagrams of the TIS at each test location.

Each sub-parameter can be understood as a three-dimensional array, including three parameters, namely, the frequency of the TCK signal, the TIS, and the state of sub-information.

In order to obtain this location relationship, the period of the test signal can be moved backward or the cycle of the TCK signals forward. These TCK signals and test signals should be understood as the same signals, arranged at different times on a regular basis. When the TCK signal triggers the DUT<b>0</b> at the test location W<b>1</b> to receive test signals at time T<b>11</b>, the test signal has already started being sent at time T<b>20</b> before T<b>11</b>, such that when the DUT<b>0</b> starts to receive the test signal at time T<b>11</b> under the trigger of the TCK signal, the test signal has already reached a stable state.
