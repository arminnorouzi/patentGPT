PEM fuel cells (also known as polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells or solid polymer fuel cells) employ an ion exchange membrane as the electrolyte. Such fuel cells often comprise a membrane electrode assembly (&#x201c;MEA&#x201d;) consisting of a membrane electrolyte disposed between two porous, electrically conductive electrodes, with each electrode comprising a suitable catalyst disposed at the membrane/electrode interface to induce the desired electrochemical reactions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Fuel is supplied to the anode and oxidant to the cathode. In fuel cells employing hydrogen as the fuel and oxygen-containing air (or substantially pure oxygen) as the oxidant, the anode reaction produces hydrogen ions (protons) from the fuel supply. The ion exchange membrane electrolyte facilitates the migration of protons from the anode to the cathode. In addition to conducting protons, the membrane isolates the hydrogen-containing fuel stream from the oxygen-containing oxidant stream. At the cathode, oxygen reacts with protons that have crossed the membrane and electrons to form liquid water as the reaction product. The anode and cathode reactions in hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells are shown in the following equations:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>H<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;2H<sup>+</sup>+2e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;Anode reaction:<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>1/2 O<sub>2</sub>+2H<sup>+</sup>+2e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>&#x2192;H<sub>2</sub>O &#x2003;&#x2003;Cathode reaction:<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">In conventional fuel cells, the MEA is disposed between two electrically conductive flow field plates via which the fuel and oxidant are directed to the respective electrodes, namely, the anode on the fuel side and the cathode on the oxidant side. The plates act as current collectors, provide support for the electrodes, provide access channels for the fuel and oxidant to the respective anode and cathode surfaces, and provide channels for the removal of water formed during operation of the cell. Two or more fuel cells can be connected electrically, generally in series but sometimes in parallel, to increase the overall power output of the assembly. In series arrangements, one side of a given plate can serve as an anode plate for one cell and the other side of the plate can serve as the cathode plate for the adjacent cell. Such a series connected multiple fuel cell arrangement is referred to as a fuel cell stack. The stack typically includes manifolds and inlet ports for directing the fuel and the oxidant to the anode and cathode flow field channels. The stack also usually includes a manifold and inlet port for directing the coolant fluid, typically water, to interior channels within the stack to absorb heat generated by the exothermic reaction of hydrogen and oxygen within the fuel cells. The stack also generally includes exhaust manifolds and outlet ports for expelling the unreacted fuel and oxidant gases, each carrying entrained water, as well as an exhaust manifold and outlet port for coolant exiting the stack.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">Most ion-exchange membranes that are typically used as electrolytes in PEM fuel cells are hydrated, or saturated with water molecules, in order for adequate proton transport to occur. For example, it is generally accepted that perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes transport protons via a &#x201c;water pumping&#x201d; phenomenon. Water pumping involves the transport of protons in conjunction with water molecules, thus proton conductivity through ion exchange membranes often requires the presence of water molecules in the membrane. Adequate membrane humidification of the membrane electrolyte during fuel cell operation can be achieved by humidification of the oxygen-containing oxidant stream prior to supplying it to the fuel cell cathode(s). Sometimes the fuel stream is also humidified prior to supplying it to the fuel cell anode(s).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">In some cases, the fuel and/or oxidant gases are humidified by flowing the respective gas on one side of a water exchange membrane and by flowing deionized water on the opposite side of the membrane. Use of deionized water can reduce or prevent membrane contamination by undesired ions from the water used for humidification. In such membrane-based humidification arrangements, water is transferred across the membrane to the fuel and/or oxidant gas. Nafion&#xae; (which is also used as a membrane electrolyte in PEM fuel cells) is a suitable and convenient perfluorosulfonic-acid-based humidification membrane in fuel cell humidifiers, but other commercially available water exchange membranes can be used for this purpose. Alternatively, other non-membrane-based humidification techniques can be employed, such as exposing the reactant gas directly to water in an evaporation chamber to permit the gas to absorb water vapor, or passing the gas through a water bubbler.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">In some PEM fuel cell humidifiers the warm, moist exhaust stream from the cathode is used to humidify the incoming oxidant (e.g. air) stream, by flowing the streams on opposite sides of a water transfer membrane in a humidifier, the water transfer membrane allowing water from the cathode exhaust stream to pass through the membrane (for example, as liquid and/or as vapor) and humidify the incoming oxidant stream. The humidifier can be a separate device positioned upstream of a fuel cell stack, or can be integrated into a fuel cell stack (e.g. between the stack end-plates, along with the stacked fuel cell assemblies)</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">The high efficiency of PFSA-based membranes for proton transport in PEM fuel cells can be compromised through absorption into the membrane of break-through &#x201c;contaminants&#x201d; that can neutralize the acidity of the acidic PFSA-based membrane. In general, there are at least two types of contaminants that tend to neutralize acidic membranes, namely ionic and alkaline contaminants. Ionic contaminants, such as sodium chloride (e.g. arising in applications in coastal locations) can neutralize PFSA-based membranes to produce a sodium sulfonate salt, and dramatically reduce the solvation rate of water in the membrane. Alkaline compounds, such as ammonia, a non-ionic weak base, can convert sulfonic acidic functional groups in an acidic membrane into ammonium sulfate, and significantly reduce the solvation of water, for example, by 2-3 times. These contaminants are known to reduce performance of PFSA-based membranes as electrolytes in PEM fuel cells, although in some cases subsequent performance recovery can occur as a result of electrochemical reactions with hydrogen, oxygen, and platinum.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">Water transfer rates in fuel cell humidifiers with PFSA-based membranes are more susceptible to both ionic and alkaline contaminants based on a reduced number of total moles of acid present in a water transfer membrane-based humidifier (based on the area of membrane in a fuel cell stack relative to the area of membrane in a humidifier for a fuel cell stack), and the inability of the humidifier to benefit from any electrochemical-based cleaning or regeneration of the membrane. For example, for a fuel cell stack containing approximately 6-11 square meters of an 18-micron thick PFSA-based membrane such as Nafion&#xae; (which yields a range of 0.3-0.6 moles of sulfonic acid per stack), a suitable humidifier with a PFSA-based water transfer membrane may incorporate only 2 square meters of a 5-micron thick membrane. In this case the humidifier would have approximately 15-30 times less sulfonic acid groups than the fuel cell stack, resulting in the humidifier having greater susceptibility to ionic or alkaline contamination than the fuel cell stack. Predicting the lifetime of a water transfer membrane-based humidifier is difficult as it is based on a number of factors, such as but not limited to, (i) the concentration of contaminants in the local air, and other sources of contaminants within the system, e.g. leaching from components etc., (ii) the efficiency and effectiveness of filtration through an intake air filter, and (iii) the rate of absorption of contaminants by the PFSA-based membrane in a water transfer membrane-based humidifier, to name a few.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">In addition to contamination, PFSA-based membranes can also undergo self-condensation reactions leading to the formation of sulfono-anhydrides, which can also reduce water transfer rates through the membrane.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">There are two main approaches that have been used to address the degradation mechanisms of PFSA-based water transfer membranes, namely, (i) the use of neutral hygroscopic materials, or (ii) use of low-water-content polymers (e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or hydrocarbon polymers) that have been converted into microporous films or into hollow-tubes that rely on capillary action to condense water while water vapor is passing through capillary tubes within the hollow fiber membranes, and then allow evaporation of water to provide water vapor to a drier stream. These approaches can help address the problems of membrane contamination via ionic and alkaline compounds, while also addressing degradation associated with the formation of sulfono-anhydrides, and accumulation of mechanical stress associated with hydration-dehydration cycles.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">There can be a tendency for mold to form in the moist, dark, and sometimes warm conditions inside a membrane-based humidifier. PFSA-based water transfer membranes are usually somewhat resistant to mold formation due to their inherent acidity which reduces the tendency for bacteria to grow on or near the membrane, however they can suffer from other degradation mechanisms that adversely affect their performance as discussed above. Humidifiers that use non-acidic water transfer membranes are typically more susceptible to problems with mold. Mold can accumulate on the surface of the membrane and impede water access to the membrane surface and transport of water across the membrane from one gas stream to the other. Filters can be used to filter the gas stream(s) entering the humidifier, but such filters are generally not 100% effective. This can lead to breakthrough of bacteria which can cause porous layers adjacent to the water transfer membrane to become obstructed and/or cause the surface of the membrane to be fouled with mold.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0014">In some embodiments of a method of operating a fuel cell system, the fuel cell system comprises a humidifier and a fuel cell stack.

The methods and apparatus described herein can be used individually or in various combinations.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">A first approach is to eliminate oxygen or reduce the oxygen concentration to sufficiently low levels in a fuel cell humidifier when the humidifier is not in use (e.g. during an OFF state) that mold growth is inhibited or prevented.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0046">A second approach involves promoting the in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide within a fuel cell humidifier.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">A third approach involves the incorporation of acidic gas transport layers, for example, adjacent to the membrane in a fuel cell humidifier.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">Each of these approaches is described in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">In many PEM fuel cell systems, fuel cell humidifiers serve the purpose of humidifying and heating the oxidant supplied to a fuel cell stack (e.g. the air inlet stream) through recovery of heat and humidity from the oxidant exhaust stream (e.g. air outlet stream). In some embodiments, this is accomplished by flowing the oxidant inlet stream and oxidant exhaust streams on opposite sides of a water transfer membrane in the humidifier. Such fuel cell humidifiers generally operate passively, have no moving parts, and rely on the relative humidity of the streams and temperature gradients to drive the net transfer of heat and water vapor from one stream to the other. In some embodiments, the cathode exhaust stream (warm, wet side) can saturate the membrane, and the dry oxidant inlet stream sets up a humidity gradient that facilitates the transfer of moisture from the exhaust stream into the inlet stream. In some embodiments, the water transfer membrane is hygroscopic, and the net water vapor transfer rate is dependent on the water concentration gradient, among other things. Overall, there can be a number of rates to consider in the humidifier, including, but not limited to:</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">(i) the rate of transport of water vapor from the wet water transfer membrane to the dry oxidant inlet stream;</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">(ii) the rate of internal transfer of water through the bulk water transfer membrane from the wet side to the dry side membrane-gas interface; and/or</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">(iii) the rate of water uptake into the water transfer membrane from the moist oxidant exhaust stream on the wet side.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">The term &#x201c;water transfer membrane&#x201d; as used herein, includes water vapor transport (WVT) membranes or materials, water permeable membranes or materials, and other porous or non-porous membranes or materials that under suitable conditions can allow water molecules to pass through them from a first fluid stream to a second fluid stream to increase the humidity or water vapor concentration of the second fluid stream.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">Polymer chemistry and morphology can have a significant influence on water transfer rates through water transfer membranes, with ultra-thin PFSA polymers generally achieving the highest water transfer rates, mainly due to the acidity of the polymer driving the water uptake rate through solvation. Generally, non-acidic polymers have lower water transfer rates, as their chemical functional groups tend to have a lower solvation. For reference, solvation differs from solubility; solvation is measured as an adsorption rate (mol/s), whereas solubility describes an equilibrium concentration (mol/L) of maximum saturation prior to precipitation. When it comes to water transfer membranes, in some embodiments both aspects can be important, as solubility relates to the water content and solvation relates to the rate of internal transfer and absorption, up to the solubility maximum. Non-acidic hygroscopic polymers include, but are not limited to, for example, nylon, acrylonitrile butadiene styrenes (ABS), acrylics, polyethylene terephthalates (PET), polybutylene terephthalates (PBT), polyurethanes, polycarbonates. These materials can absorb moisture and release moisture into the air.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing fuel cell system <b>100</b>, including fuel cell stack <b>110</b> and humidifier <b>120</b>, in which the moist oxidant stream exiting the fuel cell stack is used to heat and humidify the inlet oxidant stream being delivered to fuel cell stack <b>110</b>.

In some embodiments, this approach can involve reducing the oxygen concentration in the humidifier to stifle the growth of mold, for example, by providing a hydrogen-rich environment inside the humidifier during OFF states of a fuel cell system.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0060">In some embodiments of fuel cell systems, isolation valves can be positioned between the humidifier and the fuel cell stack on the stack oxidant inlet side, and between fuel cell stack and the humidifier on the stack oxidant outlet side. In some embodiments, upon shutdown of the system, the isolation valves are closed and within the fuel cell stack hydrogen is allowed to permeate through the membrane electrolyte from the anode compartment(s) into the cathode compartment(s) where oxygen will be consumed, by reaction with the hydrogen, until there is a substantially oxygen-free (anaerobic) environment within fuel cell stack (at least for a period of time, for example until air from the surrounding enters the fuel cell stack via the seals etc.). In at least some embodiments, this arrangement, however, oxygen can remain present in the fuel cell humidifier while the fuel cell system is in an OFF state. The atmosphere inside the fuel cell humidifier can contain one or more types of airborne bacteria that may fall into three general classes: (a) obligate aerobes, (b) obligate anaerobes, and (c) facultative anaerobes. Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can account for much of airborne bacteria, with facultative bacteria being less common. Having oxygen present in the humidifier when it is not operating can lead to mold growth that is most commonly aerobic in nature.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are schematic diagrams showing fuel cell system <b>200</b> in an ON state and in an OFF state, respectively.

In at least some embodiments, humidifier <b>220</b> has wet side <b>222</b> and dry side <b>224</b> separated by water transfer membrane <b>226</b>. In some embodiments, in an ON state (for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), humidifier <b>220</b> contains oxygen (e.g. in the air) on both the wet side <b>222</b> and dry side <b>224</b> of water transfer membrane <b>226</b>, as it passively transfers moisture from the oxidant exhaust stream from fuel cell stack <b>210</b> to humidify the oxidant inlet stream supplied to fuel cell stack <b>210</b> via incoming air filter <b>230</b> and compressor <b>235</b>. In some embodiments, in fuel cell system <b>200</b>, inlet isolation valve <b>240</b> is positioned between compressor <b>235</b> and humidifier <b>220</b> (on the oxidant inlet side, upstream of both humidifier <b>220</b> and fuel cell stack <b>210</b>), and outlet isolation valve <b>245</b> is positioned downstream of humidifier <b>220</b> on the oxidant outlet side.

In this state, hydrogen is allowed to permeate through fuel cell membrane electrolyte <b>216</b> into cathode compartment <b>214</b> (as indicated by the small arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), where oxygen can be consumed, for example, until there is a substantially oxygen-free (anaerobic) environment within fuel cell stack <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0062">In at least some embodiments, with valves <b>240</b> and <b>245</b> located as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, fuel cell humidifier <b>220</b> can also experience an anaerobic environment (or at least an oxygen-depleted environment) after shutdown as hydrogen can diffuse from cathode compartment <b>214</b> of fuel cell stack <b>210</b> into both sides (<b>222</b> and <b>224</b>) of humidifier <b>220</b> (as indicated by the small arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). In at least some embodiments, humidifier <b>220</b> and fuel cell stack <b>210</b> are thus effectively passivated with hydrogen when in an OFF state.

The direct synthesis of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>can be achieved through mixing of hydrogen and oxygen gases over a suitable selective catalyst. The choice of catalyst can be important, so that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is generated rather than water. In fuel cell chemistry, typical platinum-based catalysts used in fuel cells generally lead to a four-electron reduction of oxygen with hydrogen to produce water. However, if a different catalyst is employed, such as a palladium-based catalyst, the reaction can be limited to a two-electron transfer, and result in preferential synthesis of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Hydrogen and oxygen concentrations play a significant role in the synthesis of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. For example, with an equimolar or greater concentration of oxygen, the reaction favors the formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as shown in Equation (1):</p><p id="p-0075" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>O<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>when [O<sub>2</sub>]&#x2265;[H<sub>2</sub>]&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0076" num="0070">However, in a hydrogen-rich environment the reaction generally continues through a hydrogenation reaction to produce water, as shown in Equation (2):</p><p id="p-0077" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;2 H<sub>2</sub>O when excess H<sub>2 </sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0078" num="0071">Therefore, incorporating a catalyst into a humidifier that promotes the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and allowing the slow diffusion of hydrogen into the humidifier, for example, from the anode side of a fuel cell stack when a fuel cell system is in an OFF-state (for example, as described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> above) can be used, at least in some embodiments, to generate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>within the humidifier. The high oxygen to hydrogen concentration ratio that occurs early on during the passivation of the humidifier with hydrogen can produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as shown in Equation (1).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0072">Upon continued hydrogen diffusion into the humidifier, the environment inside the humidifier eventually becomes hydrogen-rich, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>that is generated can undergo further reaction with hydrogen to yield water, as shown in Equation (2).

In at least some embodiments this can improve the performance and prolong the life of the humidifier. Due to the difference in duration between shutdown to a hydrogen-rich environment in the cathode loop (diffusion-controlled) and the re-establishment of an oxygen-rich environment upon flowing air into the humidifier from the compressor via the fuel cell stack at start-up (convection-controlled), the in-situ generated hydrogen peroxide can arrest bacteria growth while not requiring injection of cleaning agents or disassembly of the humidifier for cleaning.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0075">Catalysts that promote generation of hydrogen peroxide can do so by limiting the homolytic bond cleavage reaction that is generally promoted by platinum-based catalysts. Examples of oxygen-reduction catalysts that can promote generation of hydrogen peroxide include bimetallic palladium-based catalysts (e.g. PdAu, PdSn, PdZn) and anthraquinone/Pd catalysts, and also some platinum-based catalysts. In at least some embodiments, catalysts that promote generation of hydrogen peroxide can be incorporated into a humidifier (such as a fuel cell humidifier). In at least some embodiments, such catalysts can be used as a coating or as a dopant on porous gas transport layers in the humidifier (for example, a porous gas transport layers <b>123</b> and <b>125</b> shown in humidifier <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In at least some embodiments, the gas transport layers can also be rendered resistant to mold formation as described below. In some embodiments, the catalyst can be doped into the fibers of a gas transport layer, and/or the gas transport layer can be coated with catalyst-containing coating through dip coating, spray coating and like. In some embodiments, coating can be done during the fiber-making process and/or by coating the finished mat material. Alternatively, or as well, catalysts can be incorporated within the water transfer membrane or in a coating on the membrane, or can be incorporated on the inside of the housing, and/or on other components inside the humidifier.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0076">In some embodiments, catalysts that promote <b>4</b>-electron transfer reduction reactions of hydrogen and oxygen to water promote the homolytic cleavage of oxygen into radical species, *O and/or *OH, which are also strong oxidizing agents.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Acidic Gas Transport Layers</heading><p id="p-0085" num="0077">Porous gas transport layers in membrane-based humidifiers can be used to provide mechanical support for thin film water transfer membranes, while simultaneously acting as diffusion media to facilitate the delivery of gas (e.g. dry and/or moist air) to the surface of the water transfer membrane. In at least some embodiments, porous gas transport layers can be made from a porous electrically conductive or electrically non-conductive material such as glass fiber mat or cloth, polymeric mat, or cloth (e.g. where the polymer is a polycarbonate, a polyamide, or a polyolefin, etc.), or carbon fiber paper or cloth, for example.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0078">In at least some embodiments, when using a humidifier employing one or more porous gas transport layers, having an acidic surface on the gas transport layer can help to inhibit bacterial growth particularly if the humidifier uses a non-acidic water transfer membrane. For example, an acidic surface treatment can be applied to a porous gas transport layer to render it acidic. In at least some embodiments, an acidic gas transport layer can offer other advantages, for example, even when used in combination with an acidic water transfer membrane or a non-acidic water transfer membrane, it can reduce formation of mold on the gas transport layer. Also, an acidic gas transport layer can act as a secondary filter (downstream of the intake air filter) to further protect the membrane electrolyte in the fuel cell stack from breakthrough ionic and alkaline compounds. In some embodiments, an acidic gas transport layer can be used on both wet and dry side of the humidifier to inhibit bacterial growth in the humidifier. For example, one method to provide an acidic surface on a gas transport layer includes coating the surface of the material with a non-water-soluble polymer containing acidic functional groups, such as polymers containing sulfonic acid, and/or carboxylic acids.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0079">The approaches described herein can be used individually and/or in various combinations to reduce the tendency for mold formation and accumulation in membrane-based humidifiers used in PEM fuel cell systems. can include reducing the oxygen concentration and/or generating hydrogen peroxide within the humidifier upon shutdown of a fuel cell system. For example, techniques to reduce the oxygen concentration in a fuel cell humidifier when the humidifier is not in use (e.g. during an OFF state) can be used in combination with the use of acidic gas transport layers in a fuel cell humidifier, and/or in combination using a catalyst to promote the generation of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen in a fuel cell humidifier.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0080">While particular elements, embodiments and applications of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be understood, that the invention is not limited thereto since modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present disclosure, particularly in light of the foregoing teachings.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
