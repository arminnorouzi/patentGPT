The electrosurgical instrument may be particularly suited for use in flexible endoscopy, e.g. sized to pass through an instrument channel of an endoscope. However, the invention may find applicability in other types of procedure, e.g. rigid laparoscopy or open surgery.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Surgical resection is a means of removing sections of unwanted tissue associated with organs within the human or animal body, such as the liver or the spleen or the bowel. When tissue is cut (divided or transected) small blood vessels called arterioles are damaged or ruptured. Initial bleeding is followed by a coagulation cascade where the blood is turned into a clot in an attempt to plug the bleeding point. During an operation, it is desirable for a patient to lose as little blood as possible, so various devices have been developed in an attempt to provide blood free cutting.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, the Hemostatix&#xae; Thermal Scalpel System combines a sharp blade with a haemostatic system. The blade is coated with a plastic material and connected to a heating unit which accurately controls the temperature of the blade. The intention is for the heated blade to cauterise the tissue as it is cut.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other known devices that cut and stop bleeding at the same time do not use a blade. Some devices use radiofrequency (RF) energy to cut and/or coagulate tissue. Other devices (known as harmonic scalpels) use a rapidly vibrating tip to cut tissue.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The method of cutting using RF energy operates using the principle that as an electric current passes through a tissue matrix (aided by the ionic contents of the cells), the impedance to the flow of electrons across the tissue generates heat. When a pure sine wave is applied to the tissue matrix, enough heat is generated within the cells to vaporise the water content of the tissue. There is thus a huge rise in the internal pressure of the cell that cannot be controlled by the cell membrane, resulting in the cell rupturing. When this occurs over a wide area it can be seen that tissue has been transected.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">RF coagulation operates by applying a less efficient waveform to the tissue, whereby instead of being vaporised, the cell contents are heated to around 65&#xb0; C. This dries out the tissue by desiccation and also denatures the proteins in the walls of vessels and the collagen that makes up the cell wall. Denaturing the proteins acts as a stimulus to the coagulation cascade, so clotting is enhanced. At the same time the collagen in the wall is denatured from a rod like molecule to a coil, which causes the vessel to contract and reduce in size, giving the clot an anchor point, and a smaller area to plug.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The application of heat energy to biological tissue is also an effective method of killing cells. For example, the application of microwaves can heat and thus ablate (destroy) biological tissue. This method may in particular be used for the treatment of cancer as the cancerous tissue can be ablated in this way.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">At its most general, the present invention provides an electrosurgical instrument which is capable of simultaneously ablating an area of tissue with microwave energy and performing resection with RF energy. The instrument has a distal bipolar energy delivery tip that has pen-like profile to emit a focussed RF field to facilitate accurate cutting of biological tissue.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the invention, there may be provided an electrosurgical instrument comprising: a coaxial transmission line for conveying radiofrequency (RF) energy and microwave energy; an energy delivery tip coupled to a distal end of the coaxial transmission line, wherein the energy delivery tip comprises: a first electrode electrically coupled to an inner conductor of the coaxial transmission line and protruding beyond a distal end of an outer conductor of the coaxial transmission line; a second electrode electrically coupled to the outer conductor of the coaxial transmission line and extending coaxially along a portion of the first electrode; and a dielectric body disposed between the first electrode and second electrode, wherein: the first electrode comprises a projecting nib that protrudes beyond a distal end of the dielectric body; the second electrode and the dielectric body comprise portions that are exposed at the distal end of the energy delivery tip; and the first electrode and second electrode are configured as (i) a bipolar structure for delivering the RF energy conveyed by the coaxial transmission line, and (ii) an antenna for radiating the microwave energy conveyed by the coaxial transmission line.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">With the structure above, the instrument of the invention provides focussed delivery of RF energy at the protruding nib. which facilitates accurate cutting by operating the device as a pen to &#x201c;draw&#x201d; the cut line. Advantageously, the energy delivery unit is also configured to delivery microwave energy to all rapid coagulation in the event of a bleed. The RF and microwave energy may be applied separately or simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to achieve an optimal focus of the RF energy, the energy delivery tip may have a distally facing end surface that comprises an exposed portion of the dielectric body and an exposed portion of the second electrode arranged concentrically around the projecting nib. Viewed from the front, the instrument may thus resemble a bullseye, with the protruding nib at its centre. The instrument may thus have rotational symmetry around a central longitudinal axis (e.g. the axis of the coaxial transmission line) so that the current effect is uniform regardless of the orientation of the instrument.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The distally facing end surface may be profiled to focus the delivered RF energy at the projecting nib. Profiling the distal end face may also assist in visibility, i.e. by ensuring that the protruding nib can be seen by the operator.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one example, the distally facing end surface may be conical, i.e. tapered in a linear manner towards the protruding nib. The angle of the conical surface may be selected to assist with visibility and field focussing. In one example, the distally facing end surface may subtend an angle of 45&#xb0; to a longitudinal axis of the projecting nib.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another example, the distally facing end surface may be rounded, e.g. dome-like or hemispherical. With the protruding nib, this structure may give the energy delivery tip a bottlenose appearance. The exposed portion of the dielectric body preferably project distally further than the distal end of the exposed portion of the second electrode.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first electrode may be formed by a distally extending portion of the inner conductor. In other words, the inner conductor may extend unbroken from the coaxial transmission line through the energy delivery tip to form the protruding nib.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, in other examples, the first electrode may be a separate component from the inner conductor. It may be coupled to the inner conductor via a connector rod. The connector rod may be a further component, or may be formed integrally with the first electrode. An advantage of this configuration is that the dimensions of the connector rod and/or first electrode can be selected independently. This can assist with tuning the impedance of the energy delivery tip for the microwave energy, as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The connector rod may comprise a proximal sheath that is secured to an outer surface of a distal end of the inner conductor. The first electrode may thus be connected as an extension of the inner conductor. The connector rod may be connected to the inner conductor by any suitable technique, although a mechanical connection such as crimping may be preferred.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The second electrode may comprise a conductive sleeve having a proximal portion that overlies a distal portion of the outer conductor. The conductive sleeve may be electrically connected and physically secured to the outer conductor in the proximal portion. For example, the conductive sleeve may be secured to the outer conductor by crimping.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The instrument may further comprise an outer insulating jacket, arranged to cover a distal portion of the coaxial transmission line and a proximal portion of the energy delivery tip. The jacket may protect the coaxial transmission line and energy delivery tip and prevent energy from leaking from the structure except at the distal tip.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The antenna may be configured as an impedance transformer to couple the microwave energy into biological tissue. In other words, the energy delivery tip may be configured to transform the impedance of the coaxial transmission line to a typical tissue impedance for the microwave energy. For example, the first electrode, dielectric body and second electrode may have lengths selected to cause the energy delivery tip to operate as a quarter wavelength transformer for the microwave energy.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The instrument may be dimensioned to fit through the instrument channel of a surgical scoping device. For example, the instrument may have a maximum outer diameter equal to or less than 2.0 mm. In some examples, the instrument can be further miniaturised to have a maximum outer diameter equal to or less than 1.0 mm. The protruding nib may have a diameter equal to or less than 0.2 mm. The protruding nib may have a length equal to or less than 1.0 mm.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term &#x201c;surgical scoping device&#x201d; may be used herein to mean any surgical device provided with an insertion tube that is a rigid or flexible (e.g. steerable) conduit that is introduced into a patient's body during an invasive procedure. The insertion tube may include the instrument channel and an optical channel (e.g. for transmitting light to illuminate and/or capture images of a treatment site at the distal end of the insertion tube. The instrument channel may have a diameter suitable for receiving invasive surgical tools. The diameter of the instrument channel may be 5 mm or less. In embodiments of the invention, the surgical scoping device may be an ultrasound-enabled endoscope.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Herein, the term &#x201c;inner&#x201d; means radially closer to the centre (e.g. axis) of the instrument channel and/or coaxial cable. The term &#x201c;outer&#x201d; means radially further from the centre (axis) of the instrument channel and/or coaxial cable.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;conductive&#x201d; is used herein to mean electrically conductive, unless the context dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Herein, the terms &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; and &#x201c;distal&#x201d; refer to the ends of the elongate probe. In use, the proximal end is closer to a generator for providing the RF and/or microwave energy, whereas the distal end is further from the generator.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this specification &#x201c;microwave&#x201d; may be used broadly to indicate a frequency range of 400 MHz to 100 GHz, but preferably the range 1 GHz to 60 GHz. Preferred spot frequencies for microwave EM energy include: 915 MHz, 2.45 GHz, 3.3 GHz, 5.8 GHz, 10 GHz, 14.5 GHz and 24 GHz. 5.8 GHz may be preferred. The device may deliver energy at more than one of these microwave frequencies.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The term &#x201c;radiofrequency&#x201d; or &#x201c;RF&#x201d; may be used to indicate a frequency between 300 kHz and 400 MHz.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Embodiments of the invention are discussed below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing an electrosurgical apparatus that is an embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic sectional view through an instrument cord of an endoscope that can be used with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a distal end of an electrosurgical instrument that is an embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a distal end of an electrosurgical instrument that is another embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of the electrosurgical instrument of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a distal end of an electrosurgical instrument that is another embodiment of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION; FURTHER OPTIONS AND PREFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an electrosurgical apparatus <b>100</b> that is capable of supplying radiofrequency energy and microwave energy to the distal end of an invasive electrosurgical instrument. In this example, the apparatus may also be configured to deliver fluid, e.g. cooling fluid, but that is not essential. The system <b>100</b> comprises a generator <b>102</b> for controllably supplying radiofrequency (RF) and microwave energy.

The distal energy delivery tip <b>212</b> may be further configured as an antenna to radiate microwave energy into tissue for coagulation or ablation.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The coaxial transmission line <b>202</b> comprises an inner (centre) conductor <b>204</b> that is separated from a concentrically arranged outer conductor <b>208</b> by a dielectric (electrically insulating) layer <b>206</b>. An outer surface of the outer conductor <b>208</b> is covered by a jacket <b>210</b>, which providing protection and electrically insulates the outer conductor <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A distal end of the coaxial transmission line <b>202</b> is connected to the distal energy delivery tip <b>212</b>. The distal energy delivery tip <b>212</b> comprises a dielectric body <b>216</b> that extends in a longitudinal direction towards a distal end of the instrument. The longitudinal direction is aligned with the axis of the coaxial cable at the distal end thereof. The dielectric body <b>216</b> may be generally cylindrical, and may have an outer diameter that is less than the outer diameter of the coaxial transmission line <b>202</b>. The dielectric body <b>216</b> may be made of the same or a different material to the dielectric layer <b>206</b> in the coaxial transmission line <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The dielectric body <b>216</b> has a hollow longitudinally extending passage running therethrough. The passage may be machined to have appropriate dimensions. At a proximal end, the passage in the dielectric body <b>216</b> receives a portion of the inner conductor <b>204</b> that extends beyond a distal end of the dielectric layer <b>206</b>. The inner conductor <b>204</b> is electrically coupled to a first electrode <b>220</b>. The first electrode <b>220</b> comprises a rod element that includes a distal portion disposed in the passage of the dielectric body <b>216</b> and a proximal portion that protrudes (is exposed at) the distalmost end of the energy delivery tip <b>212</b>. In this example, the first electrode <b>220</b> is electrically (and physically) coupled to the inner conductor <b>204</b> by a connector rod <b>218</b>. The connector rod <b>218</b> may be made from an electrically conductive material, e.g. the same material as the inner conductor <b>204</b> and/or first electrode <b>220</b>. The connector rod <b>218</b> may have a proximal sleeve part that is secured (e.g. via crimping <b>224</b>) to a distal part of the inner conductor <b>204</b>. The first electrode <b>220</b> may be integrally formed with the connector rod <b>218</b>, or may be a separate component that is secured to it.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In practice, the distal energy delivery tip <b>212</b> may be manufactured by the following steps:</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">stripping the dielectric layer <b>206</b> and outer conductor <b>208</b> from a distal length of the inner conductor <b>204</b>;</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">securing the connector rod <b>218</b> to the exposed inner conductor <b>204</b>;</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">forming, e.g. by wrapping, moulding or the like, the dielectric body <b>216</b> around the connector rod.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The energy delivery tip <b>212</b> further comprises a second electrode <b>214</b>, which comprises a conductive sleeve mounted around the dielectric body <b>216</b>. The conductive sleeve is electrically coupled to the outer conductor <b>208</b> of the coaxial transmission line. In this example, a proximal portion of the conductive sleeve is both electrically and physically coupled to a distal portion of the outer conductor <b>208</b> via crimping <b>222</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The jacket <b>210</b>, which is made from an insulating material extends beyond the coaxial transmission line <b>202</b> to cover a portion of the conductive sleeve. However, the jacket <b>210</b> stops short of the distal end of the energy delivery tip <b>212</b>, whereby a distal end portion <b>230</b> of the second electrode <b>214</b> is exposed.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The distal end of the energy delivery tip <b>212</b> therefore resembles a bullseye, comprising: a central projecting nib that is part of the first electrode <b>220</b>, an exposed portion <b>232</b> of the dielectric body <b>216</b>, and an exposed portion <b>230</b> of the second electrode <b>214</b> that is separated from the first electrode by the dielectric body <b>216</b>. The distalmost end of the projecting nib <b>220</b> may be rounded, e.g. to prevent snagging on biological tissue in used.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">This structure provides a bipolar structure for delivering RF energy. The first electrode <b>220</b> and second electrode <b>214</b> form active and return poles for the bipolar structure. The bullseye configuration acts to generate a preferential energy flow along the distalmost surface, with an increased energy density at and around the central nib. Such an energy distribution is advantageous for cutting. The instrument may be operated like a pen, because the cutting effect occurs preferentially at the projecting nib. The focussing of the RF energy may occur because the conductive surface area of the projecting nib <b>220</b> is less than the surface area of the exposed portion <b>230</b>. The focussed energy distribution may mean that cutting starts from the projecting nib. The device is therefore intuitive to use.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The distal end of the energy delivery tip <b>212</b> may be profiled in a manner that facilitates energy delivery or operation. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> the bullseye has a pointed (e.g. conical) profile, in which the exposed portion <b>230</b> of the second electrode <b>214</b> and the exposed portion <b>232</b> of the dielectric body <b>216</b> slope towards the projecting nib <b>220</b>. The angle of the slope may preferably be in the range 30-60&#xb0;, preferably 45&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition to delivery RF energy to cut biological tissue, the distal energy delivery tip <b>212</b> can be configured as a microwave antenna to deliver microwave energy for coagulation. The relative dimensions of the connector rod <b>218</b> and first electrode <b>220</b>, the dielectric body <b>216</b> and second electrode <b>214</b> can be selected to ensure that the energy delivery tip <b>212</b> has an impedance suitable for coupling microwave energy into biological tissue. In one example, the energy delivery tip <b>212</b> may be configured as a quarter wave transformer at the frequency of microwave energy conveying by the coaxial transmission line <b>202</b>. This configuration operates to facilitate coupling of microwave energy into tissue.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The structure may have a size that is suitable for insertion through the instrument channel of a surgical scoping device, e.g. an endoscope or the like. For example, the coaxial transmission line <b>202</b> may be a coaxial cable having an outer diameter of 1.6 mm. The second electrode <b>214</b> may have a maximum outer diameter of 2.0 mm. The radial gap between an inner surface of the second electrode <b>214</b> and the first electrode <b>220</b> (or connector rod <b>218</b>), i.e. the minimum radial thickness of the dielectric body <b>216</b> between the first and second electrodes, may be 0.4 mm. The projecting nib <b>220</b> may have a maximum diameter of 0.2 mm.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The instrument may be capable of further miniaturisation. For example, the coaxial cable may have an outer diameter of 0.8 mm, such that the whole device can fit through a passage having a diameter of 1.0 mm.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a distal end of an electrosurgical instrument <b>240</b> that is another embodiment of the invention.
