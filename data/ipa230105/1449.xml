In addition, various types of coatings, such as coatings applied to automotive substrates including vehicles and motorcycles, can be formed from compositions that can be baked and formed at low cure temperatures. Because these compositions can be baked at low cure temperatures, they have been found useful in forming multi-layer coatings which often include a topcoat layer applied over the basecoat layer(s). It is accordingly an objective of the present invention to provide multi-layer coatings that can be dehydrated and cured at comparatively low temperatures to form coatings having various properties, thereby reducing costs and increasing efficiency of coating processes such as in the automotive industry, for example.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a multi-layer coating system that includes: (a) a first basecoat layer formed from a first coating composition including at least one free polyisocyanate having a weight average molecular weight of less than 600 g/mol and hydroxyl functional polymeric core-shell particles, in which a polymeric core and a polymeric shell of the hydroxyl functional core-shell particles each independently comprise an addition polymer derived from ethylenically unsaturated monomers and an amount of the free polyisocyanate having a weight average molecular weight of less than 600 g/mol is 3.5 weight % or greater, based on the total resin solids of the first coating composition; (b) a second basecoat layer applied over at least a portion of the first basecoat layer, the second basecoat layer formed from a second coating composition comprising carboxylic acid functional polymeric core-shell particles in which a polymeric core of the carboxylic acid functional core-shell particles includes an addition polymer derived from ethylenically unsaturated monomers and a polymeric shell of the carboxylic acid functional core-shell particles includes urethane linkages and carboxylic acid functional groups; and (c) a topcoat layer applied over at least a portion of the second basecoat layer, the topcoat layer formed from a coating composition including a free polyisocyanate and a film-forming resin reactive with the free polyisocyanate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention also relates to a process of coating a substrate with a multi-layer coating including: (i) depositing a first coating composition onto at least a portion of the substrate, where the first coating composition includes at least one free polyisocyanate having a weight average molecular weight of less than 600 g/mol and hydroxyl functional polymeric core-shell particles, where a polymeric core and a polymeric shell of the hydroxyl functional core-shell particles each independently comprise an addition polymer derived from ethylenically unsaturated monomers and wherein an amount of free polyisocyanate having a weight average molecular weight of less than 600 g/mol is 3.5 weight % or greater, based on the total resin solids of the first coating composition; (ii) depositing a second coating composition directly onto at least a portion of the first coating composition (1) after the first coating composition is dehydrated or (2) before the first coating composition is dehydrated, where the second coating composition includes carboxylic acid functional polymeric core-shell particles in which a polymeric core of the carboxylic acid functional core-shell particles includes an addition polymer derived from ethylenically unsaturated monomers and a polymeric shell of the carboxylic acid functional core-shell particles includes urethane linkages and carboxylic acid functional groups; (iii) dehydrating: (a) the second coating composition after (ii)(1); or (b) simultaneously the first coating composition and the second coating composition after (ii)(2); and (iv) depositing a topcoat coating composition over at least a portion of the dehydrated second basecoat composition, the topcoat coating composition including a free polyisocyanate and at least one film-forming resin reactive with the free polyisocyanate.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For purposes of the following detailed description, it is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative variations and step sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary. Moreover, other than in any operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing, for example, quantities of ingredients used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term &#x201c;about&#x201d;. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard variation found in their respective testing measurements.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited herein is intended to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of &#x201c;1 to 10&#x201d; is intended to include all sub-ranges between (and including) the recited minimum value of 1 and the recited maximum value of 10, that is, having a minimum value equal to or greater than 1 and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural and plural encompasses singular, unless specifically stated otherwise.

Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is used as the eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1, and two PLGEL MIXED-C (300&#xd7;7.5 mm) columns, manufactured by Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, Calif.), are used for separation at 25&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The free polyisocyanate(s) used in the composition that forms the first basecoat layer can also comprise greater than 9.5 weight %, or greater than 12 weight %, of a uretdione dimer, based on the total resin solids weight of all the free polyisocyanate in the coating composition that forms the first basecoat layer. The free polyisocyanate(s) used in the composition that forms the first basecoat layer can also comprise up to 50 weight %, or up to 45 weight %, or up to 40 weight %, of an uretdione dimer, based on the total resin solids weight of all the free polyisocyanate in the coating composition that forms the first basecoat layer. The free polyisocyanate(s) used in the composition that forms the first basecoat layer can also comprise an amount ranging from greater than 9.5 weight % to 50 weight %, or from greater 9.5 weight % to 40 weight %, or from greater 9.5 weight % to 30 weight %, or from 12 weight % to 30 weight %, of a uretdione dimer, based on the total resin solids weight of all the free polyisocyanate in the coating composition that forms the first basecoat layer.
