Operations of lean burn engines, for example diesel engines, provide the user with excellent fuel economy due to their operation at high air/fuel ratios under fuel lean conditions. However, diesel engines also emit exhaust gas emissions containing particulate matter, unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), wherein NO<sub>x </sub>describes various chemical species of nitrogen oxides, including nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), among others. The two major components of exhaust particulate matter are the soluble organic fraction and the soot fraction. The soluble organic fraction condenses on the soot in layers and is generally derived, from unburned diesel fuel and lubricating oils. The soluble organic fraction can exist in diesel exhaust either as a vapor or as an aerosol (i.e., fine droplets of liquid condensate), depending on the temperature of the exhaust gas. Soot is predominately composed of panicles of carbon.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Oxidation catalysts comprising precious metals, such as platinum group metals dispersed on a refractory metal oxide support, are known for use in treating the exhaust of diesel engines in order to convert both hydrocarbon and CO gaseous pollutants by catalyzing the oxidation of these pollutants to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water. Such catalysts may be contained in diesel oxidation catalysts, which are placed in the exhaust flow path from a diesel-powered engine to treat the exhaust gas stream. Typically, the diesel oxidation catalysts are prepared on ceramic or metallic carrier substrates upon which one or more catalyst coating compositions are deposited.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Diesel soot removal is achieved via either active or passive regeneration of a soot filter. Active regeneration may be carried out by injecting additional diesel fuel at the diesel oxidation catalysts' inlet, and the exotherm released by the fuel combustion significantly raises the temperature at a downstream catalyzed soot filter and initiates soot combustion by O<sub>2 </sub>according to the equation (C+O<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;CO/CO<sub>2</sub>). This reaction typically temperatures in excess of 600&#xb0; C. Passive soot regeneration utilizes NO<sub>2 </sub>rather than O<sub>2 </sub>to oxidize soot according to the equation C+NO<sub>2</sub>CO/CO<sub>2</sub>+NO). This reaction is efficient at temperatures greater than 300&#xb0; C. and can often be accomplished during normal driving without requiring fuel injection, which results in a fuel economy penalty.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to the conversion of gaseous hydrocarbons, CO and the soluble organic fraction of particulate matter, oxidation catalysts that contain platinum promote the oxidation of NO to NO<sub>2</sub>. Platinum (Pt) remains the most effective platinum group metal for oxidizing NO to NO<sub>2</sub>. Platinum group metals can be incorporated in diesel oxidation catalyst compositions in various forms. For example, certain catalyst compositions incorporate platinum group metals in the form of particles (e.g., nanoparticles). See Paulus et al., J. Electroanal, Chem., 134, 495 (2001); Yoo et al., J. Catalysis, 214, 1-7 (2003); and Jain et al., Acc. Chem. Res., 41, 1578-1586 (2008). For example, Pt nanoparticles with controlled size and shape provide great opportunities for developing high-performance industrial Pt catalysts. See Zhao et al., Adv. Mater., 11, 217-220 (1999); Oishi et al., React, Funct. Polym. 67, 662-668 (2007); and Peng et al., Nano Lett., 9, 3704-3709 (2009). Where platinum group metals are incorporated within a catalyst composition in the form of particles (e.g., nanoparticles), particle growth at elevated temperature (i.e., sintering), leading to a decrease in surface area, is a primary deactivation route for the catalyst composition. Particularly, NO oxidation has been widely reported to be structure-sensitive on Pt; i.e., turn-over frequency (TOF) is strongly dependent on the Pt particle size (Weiss et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2009, 30, 13331-13340). In addition, a fully reduced metallic Pt)(Pt<sup>0 </sup>surface is most active for NO oxidation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The phenomenon of particle sintering, e.g., within platinum group metal-containing catalyst compositions, is believed to proceed by one of two limiting mechanisms, namely, Ostwald ripening or particle migration and coalescence. See, e.g., Hansen et al., Acc. Chem. Res, 2013, 46(8): 1720-30, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Under the Ostwald ripening mechanism, it is assumed that metal particles are immobile and sintering occurs solely due to the migration of atoms or clusters from small particles to large particles. Under the particle migration and coalescence sintering mechanism, particles are understood to be mobile in a Brownian-like motion on the support surface, with subsequent coalescence leading to particle growth. By either or both mechanisms, significant (often up to 50%) loss of NO oxidation activity may be observed upon aging of conventional Pt-based diesel oxidation catalysts.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">While addition of palladium (Pd) to Pt-based diesel oxidation catalysts may inhibit sintering of Pt and improve CO and hydrocarbon oxidation performance after high temperature aging, a high Pd concentration may decrease the activity of Pt to convert hydrocarbons and/or oxidize NO, especially when used with hydrocarbon storage materials, and may also make the catalyst more susceptible to sulfur poisoning. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a catalyst composition comprising Pt that is not as susceptible to surface area loss to allow for continued high catalytic efficiency under high temperature conditions of use.

Capillary action draws the solution into the pores of the refractory metal oxide support.

In addition to the catalyst composition, the slurry may optionally contain various additional components. Additional components may include, for example, binders as described herein above, additives to control, e.g., pH and viscosity of the slurry. Additional components can include hydrocarbon storage components (e.g., zeolites), associative thickeners, and/or surfactants (including anionic, cationic, non-ionic or amphoteric surfactants).

To coat the wall flow substrates with the catalyst material of some embodiments, the substrates can be immersed vertically in a portion of the catalyst slurry such that the top of the substrate is located just above the surface of the slurry. In this manner, slurry contacts the inlet face of each honeycomb wall, but is prevented from contacting the outlet face of each wall. The sample may be left in the slurry for about 30 seconds. The substrate may be removed from the slurry, and excess slurry may be removed from the wall flow substrate first by allowing it to drain from the channels, then by blowing with compressed air (against the direction of slurry penetration), and then by pulling a vacuum from the direction of stiffly penetration. By using this technique, the catalyst slurry may permeate the walls of the substrate, yet the pores are may not be occluded to the extent that undue back pressure will build up in the finished substrate.

Following drying and calcining, the final washcoat coating layer can be viewed as essentially solvent-free. After calcining, the catalyst loading can be determined through calculation of the difference in coated and uncoated weights of the substrate. As will be apparent to those of skill in the art, the catalyst loading can be modified by, for example, altering the slurry rheology.
