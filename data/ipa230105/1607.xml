The imprint technique is a technique in which a mold (to be also referred to as a template) including a pattern having a nanometer-scale concave-convex structure formed using an electron beam drawing apparatus, an exposure apparatus, or the like is brought into contact with a formable material (imprint material) on a substrate to transfer the pattern. A photo-curing method is one example of the imprint technique. An imprint apparatus employing the photo-curing method forms, using a mold, a photo-curable imprint material supplied in a shot region on a substrate, cures the imprint material by light irradiation, and separates the mold from the cured imprint material, thereby forming a pattern on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Further, there is conventionally known a technique (planarization technique) for planarizing a step of a substrate by forming a coating film on the substrate using a coating device such as a spin coater. However, the planarization technique using the coating device is insufficient to planarize the step of the substrate on a nanoscale. Thus, in recent years, it is proposed to planarize the substrate using the imprint technique. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2011-529626 describes that a composition is dropped based on the step of a substrate and the composition is cured in a state in which a plate is in contact with the dropped composition, thereby achieving the improved planarization accuracy.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The planarization using the imprint technique can include a step of curing the composition by light irradiation in the state in which the plate serving as a pressing member is in contact with the composition on the substrate. Therefore, a material such as silica glass that transmits light is used for the plate. Since the purpose is planarization, the surface of the plate to be in contact with the composition on the substrate is a flat surface which has no physical object such as a convex-concave pattern and no feature. Further, the surface on the opposite side of the flat surface is also a flat surface. Accordingly, there is a problem that it is difficult to visually judge the upper surface/lower surface state of the plate. If the plate in a wrong state is loaded to a planarization apparatus, a trouble can occur in the planarization apparatus. For example, if the plate in a turn-over state is loaded to the planarization apparatus, the surface of the plate to be in contact with the composition on the substrate can be scratched and damaged during the conveyance in the planarization apparatus, and the plate can become unusable. Further, scratches or dust adhering to the plate may damage the pattern formed on the substrate during the planarization process.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a technique advantageous in reducing troubles caused by loading a pressing member in a wrong state to a planarization apparatus that forms a planarized film on a substrate using the pressing member.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention in its one aspect provides a conveyance apparatus that loads a pressing member to a planarization apparatus that forms a planarized film made of a material on a substrate by bringing a flat surface of the pressing member and the material on the substrate into contact with each other, the pressing member including a first surface including the flat surface, and a second surface on an opposite side of the first surface, the conveyance apparatus comprising a determiner configured to perform determination as to whether a determination surface of the pressing member is the first surface or the second surface, and a controller configured to control the conveyance of the pressing member based on a result of the determination by the determiner.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments (with reference to the attached drawings).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view showing the arrangement of planarization apparatus;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref> are views for explaining a planarization process;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view for explaining conveyance of a plate by a plate conveyer;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>D</figref> are views for explaining a method of performing plate front/back determination;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an operation of the planarization apparatus;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating another operation of the planarization apparatus;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A to <b>7</b>C</figref> are views showing an example of an inclined portion formed in a plate outer edge portion;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A to <b>8</b>E</figref> are views for explaining a plate front/back determination method according to the second embodiment;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A to <b>9</b>C</figref> are views showing a modification of the arrangement of a measurement device; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A to <b>10</b>C</figref> are views for explaining a plate front/back determination method according to the third embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Hereinafter, embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. Note, the following embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the claimed invention. Multiple features are described in the embodiments, but limitation is not made to an invention that requires all such features, and multiple such features may be combined as appropriate. Furthermore, in the attached drawings, the same reference numerals are given to the same or similar configurations, and redundant description thereof is omitted.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of a planarization apparatus <b>100</b> according to an embodiment. In the specification and the drawings, directions will be indicated on an XYZ coordinate system in which a horizontal surface is defined as the X-Y plane. In general, a substrate <b>1</b> serving as an object to be processed is placed on a substrate stage <b>3</b> such that the surface of the substrate <b>1</b> is parallel to the horizontal surface (X-Y plane). Therefore, in the following description, the directions orthogonal to each other in a plane along the surface of the substrate <b>1</b> are the X-axis and the Y-axis, and the direction perpendicular to the X-axis and the Y-axis is the Z-axis. Further, in the following description, directions parallel to the X-axis, the Y-axis, and the Z-axis of the XYZ coordinate system are referred to as the X direction, the Y direction, and the Z direction, respectively, and a rotational direction around the X-axis, a rotational direction around the Y-axis, and a rotational direction around the Z-axis are referred to as the &#x3b8;X direction, the &#x3b8;Y direction, and the &#x3b8;Z direction, respectively.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The underlying pattern on the substrate has a concave-convex profile derived from a pattern formed in the previous step. More particularly, a process substrate may have a step of about 100 nm along with a multilayer structure of a recent memory element. The step derived from the moderate undulation of the entire surface of the substrate can be corrected by the focus tracking function of a scan exposure apparatus used in the photo process. However, the fine concave/convex portions having a pitch small enough to fall within the exposure slit area of the exposure apparatus may fall outside the DOF (Depth Of Focus) of the exposure apparatus. As a conventional method of planarizing the underlying pattern of the substrate, a method of forming a planarized layer, such as SOC (Spin On Carbon) or CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing), is used. However, the conventional technique undesirably cannot obtain sufficient planarization performance, and the concave/convex difference of the underlayer by multilayer formation tends to increase.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to solve this problem, studies have been conducted on a planarization apparatus that planarizes a substrate by using an imprint technique. The planarization apparatus locally performs planarization within a substrate plane by bringing a flat surface of a member or a member (flat template) on which no pattern is formed into contact with an uncured composition supplied to the substrate in advance. Subsequently, the composition is cured while the composition is in contact with the flat template, and the flat template is separated from the cured composition. This forms a planarized layer on the substrate. Since the planarization apparatus using the imprint technique is configured to drop a composition in an amount corresponding to the step of the substrate, it is expected to improve the planarization accuracy as compared with the existing methods.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The planarization apparatus <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can be embodied by a forming apparatus that forms a composition on the substrate <b>1</b> using a plate <b>9</b> serving as a pressing member. The planarization apparatus <b>100</b> cures the composition in a state in which the material on the substrate <b>1</b> and the plate <b>9</b> are in contact with each other, and separates the plate <b>9</b> from the cured composition, thereby forming a planarized layer made of the material on the substrate <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The substrate <b>1</b> can be, for example, a silicon wafer, but is not limited thereto. The substrate <b>1</b> can be formed of a material arbitrarily selected from aluminum, a titanium-tungsten alloy, an aluminum-silicon alloy, an aluminum-copper-silicon alloy, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, and the like. Note that a substrate on which an adhesion layer has been formed by surface treatment such as silane coupling treatment, silazane treatment, film formation of an organic thin film, or the like to improve the adhesiveness to the composition may be used as the substrate <b>1</b>. Note that the substrate <b>1</b> typically has a circular shape with a diameter of 300 mm, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The plate <b>9</b> can be formed of a light transmissive material in consideration of the light irradiation step. Such a material can be, for example, glass, quartz, PMMA (Polymethyl methacrylate), a phototransparent resin such as a polycarbonate resin, a transparent metal vapor deposition film, a flexible film such as polydimethylsiloxane, a photo-curable film, a metal film, or the like. Note that the plate <b>9</b> preferably has a circular shape with a diameter larger than 300 mm and smaller than 500 mm, but is not limited thereto. The thickness of the plate <b>9</b> is preferably 0.25 mm or more and less than 2 mm, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The composition can be a curable composition cured by light irradiation, for example, a UV-curable liquid. As the UV-curable liquid, typically, a monomer such as acrylate or methacrylate can be used. The curable composition may be referred to as a formable material. In the following description, the formable material will be simply referred to as the &#x201c;material&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the planarization apparatus <b>100</b> includes a substrate chuck <b>2</b>, the substrate stage <b>3</b>, a base plate <b>4</b>, support columns <b>5</b>, a top plate <b>6</b>, guide bars <b>7</b>, support columns <b>8</b>, a plate chuck <b>11</b>, a head <b>12</b>, and an alignment shelf <b>13</b>.

The plate <b>9</b> has, for example, a circular or rectangular outer shape, and includes a first surface including a flat surface <b>10</b> to be in contact with the material arranged on the substrate, and a second surface on the opposite side of the first surface. The size of the flat surface <b>10</b> is equal to or larger than that of the substrate <b>1</b>. The plate chuck <b>11</b> is supported by the head <b>12</b>, and has a function of correcting the &#x3b8;Z-direction position (an inclination about the Z-axis) of the plate <b>9</b>. Each of the plate chuck <b>11</b> and the head <b>12</b> includes an opening through which light (ultraviolet light) applied from the light source <b>20</b> via a collimator lens passes. The plate chuck <b>11</b> functions as a holder that mechanically holds the plate <b>9</b>. For example, the plate chuck <b>11</b> holds the plate <b>9</b> by chucking the second surface in a state in which the second surface of the plate <b>9</b> faces upward. The head <b>12</b> mechanically holds the plate chuck <b>11</b>. The plate chuck <b>11</b> and the head <b>12</b> form a forming device <b>50</b> that performs a forming process of a planarized film. The head <b>12</b> forms a driving mechanism (not shown) for positioning the spacing between the substrate <b>1</b> and the plate <b>9</b> upon bringing the plate <b>9</b> into contact with the material on the substrate <b>1</b> and separating the plate <b>9</b> from the material, and moves the plate <b>9</b> in the Z direction. The driving mechanism of the head <b>12</b> can be formed by, for example, an actuator such as a linear motor, an air cylinder, or a voice coli motor. A load cell for measuring the pressing force (imprinting force) of the plate <b>9</b> against the material on the substrate can be arranged in the plate chuck <b>11</b> or the head <b>12</b>. A plate deforming mechanism (plate deforming device) includes a sealing member <b>14</b> that makes a space region A, which is formed by the space existing inside the plate chuck <b>11</b> and the internal space surrounded by the plate <b>9</b>, a sealed space. The plate deforming mechanism also includes the pressure regulator <b>15</b> which is installed outside the plate chuck <b>11</b> and regulates the pressure in the space region A. The sealing member <b>14</b> is formed by a light transmissive flat plate member such as silica glass, and partially includes a connection port (not shown) of a tube <b>16</b> connected to the pressure regulator <b>15</b>. The pressure regulator <b>15</b> can increase the amount of convex deformation of the plate <b>9</b> toward the substrate side by increasing the pressure in the space region A. Further, the pressure regulator <b>15</b> can decrease the amount of convex deformation of the plate <b>9</b> by decreasing the pressure in the space region A.

The controller <b>200</b> functions as a processor that comprehensively controls the respective units of the planarization apparatus <b>100</b> to perform a planarization process. Here, the planarization process is a process of planarizing a material by bringing the flat surface <b>10</b> of the plate <b>9</b> into contact with the material on the substrate to make the flat surface <b>10</b> follow the surface shape of the substrate <b>1</b>. Note that the planarization process is generally performed on a lot basis, that is, for each of a plurality of substrates included in a single lot.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref>, the planarization process will be described.

Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the material IM on the substrate <b>1</b> and the flat surface <b>10</b> of the plate <b>9</b> are brought into contact with each other. When the plate <b>9</b> presses the material IM, the material IM spreads over the entire surface of the substrate <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows a state in which the entire surface of the flat surface <b>10</b> of the plate <b>9</b> is in contact with the material IM on the substrate <b>1</b> so that the flat surface <b>10</b> of the plate <b>9</b> follows the surface shape of the substrate <b>1</b>. Then, in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, light is applied from the light source <b>20</b> to the material IM on the substrate <b>1</b> via the plate <b>9</b>, and this cures the material IM. After this, the plate <b>9</b> is separated from the cured material IM on the substrate <b>1</b>. Thus, the layer (planarized layer) of the material IM having a uniform thickness over the entire surface of the substrate <b>1</b> is formed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows a state in which a planarized layer made of the material IM is formed on the substrate <b>1</b>. In the following description, bringing the flat surface <b>10</b> of the plate <b>9</b> and the material IM on the substrate into contact (tight contact) with each other or separating them from each other are simply represented as bringing the plate <b>9</b> and the material IM on the substrate into contact (tight contact) with each other or separating them from each other, respectively.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, plate conveyance will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view exemplarily showing the components related to the plate conveyer <b>22</b> (conveyance apparatus). Transfer of the plate between the inside and the outside of the planarization apparatus <b>100</b> is performed via a load port <b>25</b>. The load port <b>25</b> is an interface unit for moving the substrate in an FOUP into and out of the planarization apparatus <b>100</b>. In this embodiment, the plate is stored in the FOUP. Note that the plate <b>9</b> to be replaced after performing the planarization process is also unloaded from the load port <b>25</b> to the outside of the apparatus. A conveyance hand <b>26</b> grasps and conveys the plate <b>9</b>. The conveyance hand <b>26</b> may include an edge clamp and a vacuum suction mechanism using a pad for holding the plate <b>9</b>. The conveyance hand <b>26</b> obtains the plate <b>9</b> loaded from the load port <b>25</b> and conveys it to a determiner <b>27</b>. The determiner <b>27</b> determines whether the upper surface (determination surface) of the plate placed on a predetermined placement surface is the first surface (the surface to be in contact with the substrate <b>1</b>, which is also referred to as the &#x201c;front surface&#x201d;) including the flat surface <b>10</b>, or the second surface (the surface to be in contact with the plate chuck <b>11</b>, which is also referred to as the &#x201c;back surface&#x201d;) on the opposite side of the first surface (this determination is also referred to as &#x201c;front/back determination&#x201d; below). In accordance with the result of the determination by the determiner <b>27</b>, the plate <b>9</b> can be conveyed to a reversing device <b>28</b> by the conveyance hand <b>26</b>. The reversing device <b>28</b> turns over the plate <b>9</b> (reverses the plate <b>9</b>). The reversing device <b>28</b> can include a grasping mechanism for grasping the plate <b>9</b>, and a pivot mechanism that causes the grasping mechanism to pivot 180&#xb0;. The reversing device <b>28</b> can further include a holding mechanism <b>29</b> for temporarily holding the reversed plate. The plate <b>9</b> normally placed on the holding mechanism <b>29</b> such that the lower direction of the plate becomes the first surface (front surface) and the upper direction of the plate becomes the second surface (back surface) can be obtained by the conveyance hand <b>26</b> and conveyed to an adjuster <b>30</b>. The adjuster <b>30</b> adjusts the prealignment state of the plate <b>9</b>. For example, the adjuster <b>30</b> performs alignment regarding the center position and rotational direction of the plate <b>9</b> such that the feeding position upon conveying the plate <b>9</b> to the plate chuck <b>11</b> is kept constant. Therefore, the adjuster <b>30</b> may be called a prealigner. The adjuster <b>30</b> can include a driving stage, a plate chuck, and a measurement device. The driving stage can include driving mechanisms for the X direction, the Y direction, the Z direction, the &#x3b8;X direction, the &#x3b8;Y direction, and the &#x3b8;Z direction, respectively. The plate chuck chucks and holds the plate <b>9</b> by a chuck pad or the like. Note that as the chucking method, vacuum suction, electrostatic attraction, or another chucking method may be used. The alignment (prealignment) of the plate can be performed by obtaining the positional information of the plate outer peripheral portion by the measurement device while rotating the plate. Note that the measurement device can include, for example, an image capturing device such as a CCD camera, and a processing device that processes an image and detects the position of an object on the image.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The conveyance hand <b>26</b> obtains the plate <b>9</b> whose prealignment state has been adjusted by the adjuster <b>30</b>, and conveys it to the plate chuck <b>11</b> in the forming device.

As shown in FIG. <b>8</b>A, two displacement sensors <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> as measurement devices are arranged at positions vertically facing each other with respect to the plate <b>9</b>. The two displacement sensors <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> are arranged equidistant from the plate <b>9</b>. The plate <b>9</b> held by a conveyance hand <b>26</b> is conveyed into the measurement range of the two displacement sensors <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. It is desirable that the two displacement sensors are arranged at identical positions in the horizontal direction (X and Y directions). The determiner <b>27</b> performs the front/back determination by detecting the inclined portion based on the measurement results of the two displacement sensors <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> upon scanning the plate <b>9</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> shows a measurement graph in a case of measuring the distance while the plate <b>9</b> is inserted between the two displacement sensors <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. The abscissa represents the plate movement distance, and the ordinate represents the measured plate distance. The measured value (distance) of the plate outer peripheral portion measured by each of the two displacement sensors <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> changes in accordance with the inclination angle of the inclined portion of the plate <b>9</b>. The smaller the inclination angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b>, the larger an inclination &#x3b1; of a graph <b>60</b> regarding the plate movement distance and the measured plate distance. To the contrary, the larger the inclination angle &#x3b8;<b>2</b>, the smaller an inclination &#x3b2; of a graph <b>61</b>. The distances to the plate outer peripheral portion are simultaneously measured using the two displacement sensors <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> and, if &#x3b1;&#x3e;&#x3b2;, it can be determined that the upper surface of the plate <b>9</b> is the first surface (front surface) and the lower surface is the second surface (back surface). To the contrary, if &#x3b1;&#x3c;&#x3b2;, it can be determined that the upper surface of the plate is the back surface and the lower surface is the front surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> shows a case in which the two displacement sensors <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> are arranged at different distances from the plate <b>9</b>. Also in this arrangement, the front surface/back surface can be determined based on the difference in inclination. Each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>D and <b>5</b>E</figref> is a graph showing the plate movement distance and the measured plate distance in a case of moving the plate in the direction away from the two displacement sensors <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> by the conveyance hand <b>26</b>. Also in this case, the front/back determination can be performed based on the inclination between the plate movement distance and the measured plate distance.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Accordingly, the front/back of the plate <b>9</b> can be determined in both cases of loading and unloading the plate <b>9</b> with respect to the two displacement sensors <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> by the conveyance hand <b>26</b>. Note that the positions of the two sensors <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> may not be equidistant from the plate <b>9</b>. For example, by measuring, in advance, the difference between the distances of the both sensors from the plate <b>9</b> and using the difference as a correction value in the determination, the both sensors need not be arranged equidistant from the plate <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> shows a modification of the arrangement of the measurement devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, photoelectric sensors <b>35</b> are arranged at predetermined positions from the upper surface and the lower surface of the plate outer peripheral portion, respectively. The inclined portion in the plate outer peripheral portion is irradiated with light from the photoelectric sensor <b>35</b>. The front/back determination of the plate <b>9</b> is performed based on the refraction angle of the light entering from the inclined portion and transmitted through the plate <b>9</b>. For example, a projector of the photoelectric sensor <b>35</b> is arranged above the plate, and the light transmitted through the plate <b>9</b> enters the receiver-side sensor arranged on the side of the plate lower surface.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> is a view schematically showing the optical path of the light emitted to the inclined surface of the plate upper surface. The light travels with an incident angle &#x3b1;<b>1</b> at the boundary surface between the air and the plate, which becomes a refraction angle &#x3b1;<b>2</b> in the plate. The light having travelled in the plate has an incident angle &#x3b1;<b>3</b> at the boundary surface between the plate <b>9</b> and the air, and is emitted into the air at a refraction angle &#x3b1;<b>4</b>.

The light travels with an incident angle &#x3b2;<b>1</b> at the boundary surface between the air and the plate, which becomes a refraction angle &#x3b2;<b>2</b> in the plate. The light having traveled in the plate has an incident angle &#x3b2;<b>3</b> at the boundary surface between the plate <b>9</b> and the air, and is emitted into the air at a refraction angle &#x3b2;<b>4</b>. The light having the refraction angle &#x3b2;<b>4</b> is not received by the light receiving side sensor. Thus, when the measurement is performed with the plate <b>9</b> in the turn-over state, due to the different inclination angles of the inclined portions, the light emitted from the light projecting side cannot be received by the light receiving side sensor. Therefore, the front/back of the plate <b>9</b> can be determined based on whether the light can be received. Note that in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the light projecting side sensor is arranged above the plate and the light receiving side sensor is arranged below the plate, but the arrangement may be reversed.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0064">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A to <b>10</b>C</figref>, a plate front/back determination method according to the third embodiment will be described. In the third embodiment, a coating film is formed on the first surface of a plate <b>9</b>, and the intensity distribution of reflected light upon emitting light toward the upper surface of the plate is measured. A determiner <b>27</b> performs the front/back determination based on the measurement result.

The determiner <b>27</b> is formed by a plate chuck (not shown) and a displacement meter <b>44</b> serving as a measurement device. The plate chuck holds the plate <b>9</b>. The displacement meter <b>44</b> can include, for example, a spectral interferometer (spectacle interference laser displacement meter). Alternatively, the displacement meter <b>44</b> can include a multi-layer film thickness measurement device. The displacement meter <b>44</b> is arranged above the plate <b>9</b>, and is configured to emit light toward the upper surface of the plate <b>9</b>. The plate <b>9</b> is coated with a coating material <b>45</b> for the purpose of protecting the surface from damage and facilitating a separation of the plate <b>9</b> from a cured material. The thickness of the coating material <b>45</b> is sufficiently smaller than the thickness of the plate <b>9</b>.

With this, the arrangement of the plate <b>9</b> and the coating material <b>45</b> can be determined.
