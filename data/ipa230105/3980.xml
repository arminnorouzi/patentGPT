In a rifle application for example, a deviation between a gun-barrel orientation and a pointing-device orientation, including a reticle, from a boresight offset specification is termed &#x201c;boresight error&#x201d;. For example, when a gun-barrel orientation and a pointing-device orientation coincide in elevation, azimuth, and roll angles, the gun-barrel and pointing device include no boresight error.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">If a reticle is positioned in front of a magnification changer of the variable magnification optical system, there is no effect on aiming capabilities. Though, if the reticle is positioned behind the magnification changer, aiming error is created between the reticle and the image of the target. For this reason, common practice for variable magnification optical systems demands that the reticle be placed in a first focal plane, that is, in front of the magnification changer. Yet, placing the reticle in a second focal plane, that is, behind the magnification changer, has important advantages, such as maintaining constant size of the reticle pattern when magnification varies, and the lack of need to correct relay for aberrations as a separate unit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The boresight errors, created by the moving parts within magnification changers, are especially critical for larger magnifications which are used to sight remote targets. This applies for all magnification changers having movable optical lens groups, including both zooms and tumblers. Thus, there is a need to mechanically track induced boresight errors when magnification varies and correct the reticule position.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In at least one aspect, the application describes a variable magnification optical system with boresight error correction.

The variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> may be used in an optical system, such as a telescopic sight in a firearm, telescope, a microscope, medical imaging device, or the like. The variable magnification optical system may include an optical axis <b>102</b>, which defines a path through which light propagates within the variable magnification optical system <b>100</b>. The optical axis <b>102</b> may pass through a center of curvature of one or more optical components within the variable magnification optical system <b>100</b>. The optical axis <b>102</b> may coincide with an axis of rotational symmetry of the variable magnification optical system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A focusing lens <b>104</b> may be disposed at a first portion of the variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> such that it receives light before other optical components within variable magnification optical system <b>100</b>. In another implementation, the focusing lens <b>104</b> may be disposed within a magnification changer <b>110</b>, as explained below. The focusing lens <b>104</b> may be disposed along optical axis <b>102</b>. The light emanating along the optical axis <b>102</b> may be aligned at one or more foci of the focusing lens <b>104</b>. The focusing lens <b>104</b> may include a curved mirror or lens. For example, the focusing lens <b>104</b> may include a convex or concave lens. Alternatively, the focusing lens <b>104</b> may include a flat mirror or lens, though it should be understood that any lens or mirror may be suitable for implementations described herein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The focusing lens <b>104</b> may be configured to create an image of the target or optical components upstream of variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> at a focal plane <b>108</b>. In this regard, the focusing lens <b>104</b> may align parallel, converging, or diverging: light emanating from a target or optical components upstream of variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> in a specific direction, such as downstream optical axis <b>102</b> and toward a user, such that light emitted from the focusing lens <b>104</b> converges as it propagates. The focusing lens <b>104</b> may include a converging lens including a positive focal length defined by the distance at which a beam of collimated light from a target or optical components upstream of variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> will be focused to a single spot or plane.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In other implementations, the focusing lens <b>104</b> may diverge light emitted therefrom as it propagates. The focusing lens <b>104</b> may include a diverging lens including a negative local length defined by the distance to the point from which a collimated beam appears to be diverging after passing through the focusing lens <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other implementations the focusing lens <b>104</b> may create an image of the target or optical components upstream of variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> at infinity. In this regard, light emitted from the focusing lens <b>104</b> may include no divergence or convergence. Thus, as the distance light travels from the focusing lens <b>104</b> increases, spherical wavefronts of the light may become flatter and closer to plane waves, which may be perfectly collimated. Because parallel light does not converge, the focusing lens <b>104</b> in such an example creates an infinite image of the target or optical components upstream of variable magnification optical system <b>100</b>. It should be understood that the focal length of the focusing lens <b>104</b> may vary based on a required collimation, convergence, or divergence.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> may include a light source <b>105</b> configured to emit a pilot beam <b>106</b>. The light source <b>105</b> may include a coherent light source, such as a laser and/or a laser diode. The light source <b>105</b> may be configured to emit a pilot beam <b>106</b> invisible to the human eye, such as liar example a near-infrared (NIR) pilot beam <b>106</b>. For example, the light source <b>105</b> may emit light defining the pilot beam <b>106</b> including wavelengths varying between 750 nanometers to 2,500 nanometers.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In other implementations light source <b>105</b> may include an incoherent or partially coherent light source, such as a light emitting diode. In this regard, the light source <b>105</b> may be configured to emit a pilot beam <b>106</b> visible to the human eye such as for example a visible light pilot beam <b>106</b>. For example, light source <b>105</b> may emit light defining the pilot beam <b>106</b> including wavelengths approximately varying between 600-700 nanometers. Though implementations where light source <b>105</b> is configured to emit visible light pilot beam <b>106</b> may distract the operator of the variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> or obstruct an observed scene or target.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In other implementations, light source <b>105</b> may be configured to emit a pilot beam <b>106</b> including medium wave infrared (MWIR), long wave infrared (LWIR), ultraviolet waves, or other electromagnetic radiation, like, for example, microwaves (especially THz waves).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> may include a magnification changer <b>110</b> disposed along the optical axis <b>102</b>. Diverging or converging light from a direction of a target or upstream variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> may be received by the magnification changer <b>110</b>. The magnification changer <b>110</b> may thereafter emit converging light, diverging light, or light with no divergence or convergence. Like the focusing lens <b>104</b>, the magnification changer <b>110</b> may also be configured to create an image of the target or optical components upstream of variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> at a focal plane <b>108</b>. In this regard, the magnification changer <b>110</b> may align parallel, converging, or diverging light emanating from a target or optical components upstream of variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> in a specific direction, such as downstream optical axis <b>102</b> and toward a user, such that light emitted from the magnification changer <b>110</b> converges as it propagates. The magnification changer <b>110</b> may include a converging lens including a positive focal length defined by the distance at which a beam of collimated light from a target or optical components upstream of variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> will be focused to a single spot or plan.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The magnification changer <b>110</b> may include one or more lenses or lens systems. For example, the magnification changer <b>110</b> may include one or more zoom lenses. The one or more zoom lenses may be disposed on, within, configured with, or otherwise affixed to an optomechanical drive system to adjust an optical magnification setting of the one or more zoom lenses. In this regard, the one or more zoom lenses may be fixed in motion on a rail, track, pole, or similar system. Alternatively, the one or more zoom lenses may be configured for mechanical motion, such as to slide axially along the rail, track, pole, or similar system, controlled manually or with a computer. In another implementation, the one or more zoom lenses may be arranged along a gear and cams system disposed within the magnification changer <b>110</b>. It should be understood that other optomechanical drive systems may be implemented such as to shift the position of the one or more zoom lenses relative the optical axis <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The one or more zoom lenses as described above may include one or more converging or diverging lenses or lens systems. The one or more converging or diverging lenses or lens systems may be disposed along the optical axis <b>102</b>. The one or more converging or diverging lenses or lens systems may include one or more curved mirrors or lenses such as convex or concave lenses. Alternatively, the one or more converging or diverging lenses or lens systems may include a flat mirror or lens. The one or more converging or diverging lenses or lens systems may align light along the optical axis <b>102</b> in a specific direction, such as downstream optical axis <b>102</b> away from a target and toward a user. The one or more converging or diverging lenses or lens systems may be disposed toward an exit of the magnification changer <b>110</b>, such that the one or more afocal zoom elements receive light beforehand.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The one or more zoom lenses as described above may include one or more afocal zoom elements. For example, the zoom lenses may include one or more converging lenses and one or more diverging lens disposed sequentially, the one or more diverging lenses including an absolute focal length equal to that of the one or more converging lenses. When the one or more diverging lenses and one or more converging lenses shifts, the overall angular magnification of the variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> varies, changing the effective focal length of the magnification changer <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The magnification changer <b>110</b> may include an image inverting prism duster. The image inverting prism cluster may revert, invert, rotate, derotate, displace a line of sight, or deviate a line of sight of light propagating therethrough. The image inverting prism cluster may be disposed along the optical axis <b>102</b>. As such, the image inverting prism cluster may alter light comprising an image of a target or optical components upstream of variable magnification optical system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the one or more zoom lenses moves in magnification changer <b>110</b> along the optomechanical drive system, boresight errors may be introduced. This is because the optomechanical drive system may not adjust the one or more zoom lenses along the optical axis precisely enough. For example, the optomechanical drive system may shift the one or more zoom lenses transverse or perpendicular to the optical axis <b>102</b>, rotationally around the optical axis <b>102</b>, or in another unintended fashion. As such, the one or more zoom lenses may experience a deviation in mechanical motion or centration.

The image inverting prism cluster <b>302</b> may revert, invert, rotate, derotate, displace a line of sight, or deviate a line of sight of light propagating therethrough.

Variable magnification optical system <b>400</b> differs from variable magnification optical system <b>100</b> in that variable magnification optical system <b>400</b> includes an optical system with a first focal plane <b>402</b> and a second focal plane <b>404</b> instead of a single focal plane <b>108</b>. The first focal plane <b>402</b> of the variable magnification optical system <b>400</b> may be generated by the focusing lens <b>104</b> whereas the second focal plane <b>404</b> may be generated by the magnification changer <b>110</b>, or one or more lenses disposed along the optical axis <b>102</b>. In this way, lens <b>104</b> generates first focal plane <b>402</b>, and then, lens <b>110</b> reimages focal plane <b>402</b> into second focal plane <b>404</b>.

This is because of boresight errors, explained above, generated by the magnification changer <b>110</b>. For example, where the reticle is disposed in the first focal plane <b>402</b>, boresight errors equally effect the reticle position and the image of a target or an image of an optical component upstream of variable magnification optical system <b>400</b>. Spatial relationship between the reticle and, for example, the image of a target is maintained, where the reticle is disposed in the first focal plane <b>402</b>. Aiming error may be produced with boresight errors where the reticule is disposed in the second focal plane <b>404</b> due to lack of spatial relationship between the reticle and, for example, the image of a target.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The present disclosure allows for the reticle to be disposed in the second focal plane <b>404</b>.

Thereafter, an image inverting relay lens <b>302</b> may be employed to reimage the first focal plane <b>402</b> into the second focal plane <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to the illustrative example, the image inverting relay lens <b>302</b> has constant magnification (no moving lens groups) so that it can always be much shorter than a variable magnification relay. According to the illustrative example, inserting a magnification changer in front of first focal plane <b>402</b> does not require extra space, as the objective optics of a telescope (rifle scope) can always have a long focal length, and there can always be sufficient empty space between the objective optics and the first focal plane <b>402</b>. It should be noted that inserting, a magnification changer in front of a reticle can result in producing boresight errors when changing magnification. So, while the entire scope can be much shorter (which is, a feature which is appreciated by operators of the device) the shooting accuracy will be greatly degraded.
