Fluid enters the centrifugal pump at an intake port, where the impeller is located. A driver is utilized to rotate a shaft that is connected to the impeller, thereby controlling the rotation of the impeller. The rotational motion of the impeller generates a centrifugal force that increases the velocity of the fluid so that the fluid flows through the pump casing to an outlet. At start up, a centrifugal pump has a flooded suction line surrounding the impeller with sufficient fluid to create a pressure differential and thus pumping the fluid.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">While the main force acting on the impeller is the rotational force provided by the shaft of the pump, an axial thrust load may also be caused by unequal distribution of pressure between the front and back shrouds of the impeller. A radial impeller rotating in liquid produces a centrifugal effect, creating a discharge pressure. The difference between the discharge pressure and suction pressure causes axial thrust force to act on the impeller. In a multistage pump, axial thrust force may increase with the number of stages.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure generally describes an impeller locking collar to hold an impeller of a pump assembly in place axially by loading the collar against a ring element.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to some examples, an impeller locking collar for a pump may include a first portion configured to be fitted around a shaft of the pump proximal to a base of an impeller of the pump, the first portion comprising a first set of threads facing the shaft; a second portion configured to be fitted around the shaft and partially between the first portion and the shaft, the second portion comprising a second set of threads facing the first portion and an indentation distal to the base of the impeller; and a ring element fitted around the shaft within the indentation of the second portion, the ring element configured to receive a thrust load of the impeller during an operation of the pump.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to other examples, the impeller locking collar may further include at least one set screw fitted into a hole within the second portion, the at least one screw configured to secure the second portion to the shaft.

The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented herein. The aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the Figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">This disclosure is generally drawn, inter alia, to methods, apparatus, systems and/or devices related to holding an impeller of a pump assembly in place axially with an impeller locking collar by loading the collar against a ring element.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Briefly stated, technologies are generally described for holding an impeller of a pump assembly in place axially with an impeller locking collar by loading the collar against a ring element. In a centrifugal pump assembly, one side of the shaft has a larger diameter for the impeller to abut against. The other side of the shaft may be fitted with an impeller locking collar comprising two portions that can be threaded together and hold the impeller in place by tightening against a ring element such as a split ring or spiral lock. Anti-rotation to avoid loosening of the impeller locking collar may be achieved by providing counter threads against a shaft rotation. Secondary anti-rotation may be provided by one or more set screws in the impeller locking collar.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example single-stage, radially-split pump with an impeller, where an impeller locking collar may be implemented in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example pump <b>100</b> may include a pump casing <b>102</b>, a bearing housing <b>110</b>, a shaft <b>104</b>, an intake port <b>108</b>, and an output port <b>106</b>. In an operation, an external driver (not shown) coupled to the shaft <b>104</b> may rotate the shaft <b>104</b>, which, in turn, may rotate an impeller inside the pump casing <b>102</b> transferring fluids from the intake port <b>108</b> to the output port <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Centrifugal pumps are used to transport fluids by the conversion of rotational kinetic energy to the hydrodynamic energy of the fluid flow. The rotational energy typically comes from an engine or electric motor (external driver). The fluid enters the pump impeller along or near to the rotating axis and is accelerated by the impeller, flowing radially outward into a diffuser or volute chamber (casing), from which it exits. A portion of the energy goes into kinetic energy of the fluid. Fluid enters axially through eye of the casing, is caught up in impeller blades, and is whirled tangentially and radially outward until it leaves through circumferential parts of the impeller into the diffuser part of the casing. The fluid gains both velocity and pressure while passing through the impeller.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">An impeller is a rotating component of a centrifugal pump which transfers energy from the motor that drives the pump to the fluid being pumped by accelerating the fluid outwards from the center of rotation. The velocity achieved by the impeller transfers into pressure when the outward movement of the fluid is confined by the pump casing. A centrifugal pump may be single-stage or multi-stage. A pump containing two or more impellers is called a multi-stage centrifugal pump. The impellers may be mounted on the same shaft or on different shafts. At each stage, the fluid is directed to the center before making its way to the discharge on the outer diameter. For higher pressures at the outlet, impellers can be connected in series. For higher flow output, impellers can be connected in parallel.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">An example centrifugal pump according to the present disclosure may include impeller locking collar assembly that holds the impeller in place axially by loading the impeller locking collar against a split ring. The impeller locking collar may be threaded to allow for installation and adjustment against the split ring. Anti-rotation to avoid loosening of the impeller locking collar during operation may be achieved by providing counter threads against the shaft rotation. Secondary anti-rotation may be provided by one or more set screws in the impeller locking collar.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional cutaway view of a single-stage pump with an impeller.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As illustrated, an example single-stage pump <b>200</b> may include a port <b>202</b> (intake or output), a casing <b>204</b>, a first bearing housing <b>206</b>, a shaft <b>208</b>, an impeller <b>210</b>, cavities <b>212</b> within the casing <b>204</b>, wear rings <b>214</b>, and second bearing housing <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an operation, fluids may enter axially through an intake port <b>202</b>, and pushed tangentially and radially outward until leaving through circumferential parts of the impeller <b>210</b> into the diffuser part of the casing <b>204</b>. The fluids may gain both velocity and pressure while passing through the impeller <b>210</b>. In some case, the first bearing housing <b>206</b> may contain radial bearings and the second bearing housing <b>216</b> may include axial (thrust) bearings. The wear rings <b>214</b> may be used to stabilize the impeller <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In operation, the impeller <b>210</b> is subject to different forces. While an ideal impeller would only receive rotational force from the shaft <b>208</b>, axial thrust caused by unequal distribution of pressure between the front and back shrouds of an impeller (difference between the discharge pressure and suction pressure) may result in the impeller being pushed transversally to the shaft axis. The axial thrust load may result in vibration and loss of power transmission, as well as reduce expected life of pump bearings (and/or shaft). Some pump systems may include an impeller locknut secured through threads on the shaft near the impeller, which may result in reliability issues due to bending moment and stress. The threads may form a stress concentration that may lead to premature fatigue failure of the shaft <b>208</b>. Other systems may load the impeller with a thrust load to push the impeller against the shaft <b>208</b>, but this approach may involve custom machined parts (wear rings), etc. adding to pump assembly complexity and thereby reducing reliability.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional cutaway view of a two-stage pump with an impeller locking collar, arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The example two-stage pump <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes a port <b>302</b> (intake or output), a casing <b>304</b>, a first bearing housing <b>310</b>, a shaft <b>308</b>, a first stage impeller <b>314</b>, a second stage impeller <b>312</b>, cavities <b>306</b> within the casing <b>304</b>, a head <b>320</b> portion of the casing <b>304</b>, a second bearing housing <b>316</b>, and impeller locking collar <b>318</b>. The first bearing housing <b>310</b> may be a radial bearing housing and include deep-row radial ball bearings near the impeller. The second bearing housing <b>316</b> may be axial (thrust) bearing housing and include back-to-back mounted angular contact bearings on the thrust side. Although called thrust bearing, bearings at the thrust location in pumps may typically absorb loads in both the axial and radial directions.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Major components of a centrifugal pump assembly according to some examples, may include the casing <b>304</b>, an impeller (e.g., impeller <b>314</b>) positioned within a first cavity of the casing, and a shaft coupled to the impeller and configured to rotate the impeller to transfer a fluid between an intake opening of the pump assembly and an output opening of the pump assembly. The impeller may be configured to transfer the fluid between the intake opening of the pump assembly and the output opening of the pump assembly. The pump assembly may also include an impeller locking collar <b>318</b>.

A ring element may be fitted around the shaft within the indentation of the second portion. The first and second portions may hold the impeller in place by tightening against the ring element, which is configured to receive a thrust load of the impeller during an operation of the pump assembly.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, a diameter of the shaft on an opposite side of the impeller relative to the side with the impeller locking collar may be larger than a diameter of the shaft on the side of the impeller with the impeller locking collar such that the impeller can abut the larger diameter shaft portion. A direction of the threads on the first and second portions of the impeller locking collar may be selected such that the first portion and the second portion move toward each other (tighten and not loosen) in response to a vibration of the shaft during an operation of the pump assembly.

The split ring may include two complementary parts configured to surround the shaft.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A direction of the first set of threads and the second set of threads may be selected such that the first portion and the second portion move away from each other (tighten) in response to a vibration of the shaft during an operation of the pump. At least a segment of the first portion <b>404</b>, the second portion <b>402</b>, and the ring element <b>414</b> may be within a cavity of a head <b>418</b> portion distinct from a waterway cavity <b>406</b> of a pump casing to avoid exposure of the impeller locking collar parts and gaps associated with those to high speed fluids being transferred by the impeller. The separation may increase life expectancy and reliability of the pump by reducing a likelihood of failure due to solids in the pumped fluid getting stuck in gaps and reducing effectiveness of the impeller locking collar.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In assembling an example pump, the first portion <b>404</b> of the impeller locking collar may be fitted around the shaft <b>416</b> proximal to the base of the impeller <b>410</b> with the first set of threads facing the shaft first. Next, the second portion <b>402</b> of the impeller locking collar with its second set of threads facing the first portion may be fitted around the shaft <b>416</b> and partially between the first portion <b>404</b> and the shaft <b>416</b> by threading in the second portion <b>402</b>. The ring element <b>414</b> may be positioned around the shaft <b>416</b> within the indentation of the second portion <b>402</b> distal to the base of the impeller <b>410</b> and the second portion <b>402</b> may be threaded out to push against the ring element <b>414</b> such that the ring element (e.g., split ring) receives the thrust load of the impeller <b>410</b> during an operation of the pump. Furthermore, at least one set screw <b>412</b> may be inserted into a hole within the second portion <b>402</b> to secure the second portion <b>402</b> (and thereby, the entire impeller locking collar) to the shaft <b>416</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Disclosed herein are methods and devices to maintain an impeller in axial position in the presence of axial thrust forces during an operation of a pump. The benefits of the presently disclosed pump assembly configurations are numerous. For example, the methods and devices employed herein enable pump life expectancy to be enhanced without modification of the thrust profile of the impeller with different diameter wear rings or similar approaches. Furthermore, dual anti-rotation measures of counter-thread direction and set screws ensure preservation of the thrust load mitigation in the presence of rotational and vibrational forces.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present disclosure is not to be limited in terms of the particular embodiments described in this application, which are intended as illustrations of various aspects.

For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; or &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and indefinite articles such as &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;a&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;an&#x201d; should be interpreted to mean &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; or &#x201c;one or more&#x201d;); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of &#x201c;two recitations,&#x201d; without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, and C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general, such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, and C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase &#x201c;A or B&#x201d; will be understood to include the possibilities of &#x201c;A&#x201d; or &#x201c;B&#x201d; or &#x201c;A and B.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For any and all purposes, such as in terms of providing a written description, all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible subranges and combinations of subranges thereof.
