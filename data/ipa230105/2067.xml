Unit quaternions may also be called rotation quaternions as they may represent a 3D rotation group as described below. In 3-dimensional space, according to Euler's rotation theorem, any rotation or sequence of rotations of a rigid body or coordinate system about a fixed point may be treated as equivalent to a single rotation by a given angle about a fixed axis (called the Euler axis) that runs through the fixed point. An Euler axis may typically be represented by a unit vector u&#x2192;. Therefore, any rotation in three dimensions may be represented as a combination of a vector u&#x2192; and a scalar. Quaternions may provide a simple way to encode this axis-angle representation in four numbers, and may be used to apply the corresponding rotation to a position vector, representing a point relative to the origin in R<sup>3</sup>.

Quaternions used in quaternion aircraft control may be any of the quaternions discussed herein. Quaternion control may be useful in the field of aircraft control as a quaternion is a 4-dimensional vector used to describe the transformation of a vehicle in 3-dimensions. The use of quaternions may be favored over other descriptors due to their non-singularity properties at any aircraft attitude. Traditional aeronautic transformations (Euler angles) may be hindered by a phenomenon known as gimbal lock. Gimbal lock may cause a loss of degree of freedom (DOF) which could lead to controller instability.

For example, and without limitation, some filtering may be required to reduce noise in the data collected over series of least squares analysis. Least squares may be employed in regression analysis to approximate a solution of overdetermined systems (sets of equations in which there are more equations than unknowns) by minimizing a sum of the squares of the residuals made in the results of every single equation. Least squares may be used in data fitting. A best fit in the least-squares sense may minimize a sum of squared residuals (a residual being: the difference between an observed value, and the fitted value provided by a model). When a problem has substantial uncertainties in an independent variable and/or variable set (the x variable), then simple regression and least-squares methods may be insufficient; in such cases, methodology employed for fitting errors-in-variables models may be considered instead of that for least squares. Least-squares problems may fall into two categories: linear or ordinary least squares and nonlinear least squares, depending on whether or not the residuals are linear in all unknowns. Linear least-squares problem may occur in statistical regression analysis; it has a closed-form solution. Nonlinear problem may be solved by iterative refinement; at each iteration a system may be approximated by a linear one, and thus a core calculation may be similar in both cases. Polynomial least squares may describe a variance in a prediction of a dependent variable as a function of an independent variable and deviations from a fitted curve.

For the purposes of this disclosure, an &#x201c;inertia compensator&#x201d; is one or more computing devices, electrical circuits, processors, or the like configured to compensate torque output signals for massive flight components.

Mixer <b>132</b> is configured, in general, to output signals and command propulsors to produce a certain amount of torque; however, real-world propulsors contain mass, and therefore have inertia. &#x201c;Inertia&#x201d;, for the purposes of this disclosure, is a property of matter by which it continues in its existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless that state is changed by an external force. Specifically, in this case, a massive object requires more force or torque to start motion than is required to continue producing torque.

Inertia compensator may adjust vehicle torque limits for certain periods of time wherein, for example, output torque commands may be allowed to overspeed a propulsor to start the propulsor's rotating physical components and then quickly step down the torque as required to maintain the commanded torque.

With feedforward control, the disturbances are measured and accounted for before they have time to affect the system.

Feed-forward control may be effective where effects of the disturbances on the system must be accurately predicted.
