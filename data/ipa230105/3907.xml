Moreover, there are also interactions between the location server and the base station (eNodeB) via the LPP, to some extent supported by interactions between the eNodeB and the WD via the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following positioning techniques are considered in LTE as set forth by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Technical Standard (TS) 36.305 V15.4.0:</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Enhanced Cell ID.

The carrier phase measurements of a receiver are very accurate, but the number of integer wavelengths to the satellite is unknown. However, based on assistance data with observations, the WD can determine the integer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Then, the WD obtains observations, associated to one or more reference station(s), and the WD uses the observations to determine satellite time and receiver position.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Navpedia provides the following generic description of the phase measurement, the integer ambiguity N and the error contributions:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3d5;=&#x3c1;&#x2212;<i>I+Tr+c</i>(<i>b</i><sub>Rx</sub><i>&#x2212;b</i><sub>Sat</sub>)+<i>N&#x3bb;+&#x3b5;&#x3d5;</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0015" num="0000">where:<br/>I is the signal path delay due to the ionosphere;<br/>Tr is the signal path delay due to the troposphere;<br/>b<sub>Rx </sub>is the receiver clock offset from the reference (GPS) time;<br/>b<sub>Sat </sub>is the satellite clock offset from the reference (GPS) time;<br/>c is the vacuum speed of light;<br/>&#x3bb; is the carrier nominal wavelength;<br/>N is the ambiguity of the carrier-phase (integer number);<br/>&#x3b5;<sub>&#x3d5;</sub> are the measurement noise components, including multipath and other effects;<br/>&#x3c1; is the geometrical range between the satellite and the receiver, computed as a function of the satellite (x<sub>Sat</sub>,y<sub>Sat</sub>,z<sub>Sat</sub>) and<br/>receiver (x<sub>Rx</sub>,y<sub>Rx</sub>,z<sub>Rx</sub>) coordinates as:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>&#x3c1;</mi>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <msqrt>       <mrow>        <msup>         <mrow>          <mo>(</mo>          <mrow>           <msub>            <mi>x</mi>            <mi>Sat</mi>           </msub>           <mo>-</mo>           <msub>            <mi>x</mi>            <mi>Rx</mi>           </msub>          </mrow>          <mo>)</mo>         </mrow>         <mn>2</mn>        </msup>        <mo>+</mo>        <msup>         <mrow>          <mo>(</mo>          <mrow>           <msub>            <mi>y</mi>            <mi>Sat</mi>           </msub>           <mo>-</mo>           <msub>            <mi>y</mi>            <mi>Rx</mi>           </msub>          </mrow>          <mo>)</mo>         </mrow>         <mn>2</mn>        </msup>        <mo>+</mo>        <msup>         <mrow>          <mo>(</mo>          <mrow>           <msub>            <mi>z</mi>            <mi>Sat</mi>           </msub>           <mo>-</mo>           <msub>            <mi>z</mi>            <mi>Rx</mi>           </msub>          </mrow>          <mo>)</mo>         </mrow>         <mn>2</mn>        </msup>       </mrow>      </msqrt>      <mo>.</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>2</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0017" num="0013">Receivers then form the double difference equation.
