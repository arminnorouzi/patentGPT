present invention relates to the field of ventilation, heating and/or air conditioning for motor vehicles, and more particularly relates to an electric heating device such as an electric heater.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such electric heating devices sometimes use a high-voltage power supply network, in particular in the case of electric or hybrid vehicles. The electric heaters are, for example, supplied with power at a high voltage in order to deliver a high level of thermal power so as to be used as an additional heat source or even as a main heating device when the power delivered is sufficient to heat the air in the ventilation, heating and/or air-conditioning system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such electric heating devices are, for example, intended to be supplied with power by a direct or alternating current at a voltage higher than 60 V, in particular between 60 V and 1000 V, more particularly between 180 V and 600 V, and/or allowing heating power to be released into the air, or having electrical power consumption of more than 2 kW, in particular between 2 kW and 10 kW.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These electric heating devices, such as electric heaters, generally comprise a heating body provided with heating elements which are, for example, arranged so as to be directly exposed to an air flow through the electric heating device. The heating elements comprise, for example, PTC (positive temperature coefficient) ceramic or stone. These are elements whose resistance varies greatly as a function of temperature. More precisely, the ohmic value of the PTC resistive elements increases very rapidly beyond a predetermined temperature threshold.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Particularly in the case of an electric heating device supplied with power at a high voltage, this device may be a main heating device of the vehicle which may be very powerful, which involves having to deliver very high levels of electrical power, in particular of the order of 1 kW to 8 kW. In the event of overheating, the device may reach at at least one point a temperature limit for the correct operation of said device. By its nature, PTC stone or ceramic provides protection against excessive overheating which could, for example, start a fire, thereby ensuring passenger safety.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, such heating devices generally comprise a control unit capable of controlling the current flowing through the heating elements via, in particular, an electrical power supply circuit on a control circuit board, such as a printed circuit board (PCB). The electrical and electronic components of such a control unit generally operate at a low voltage. The low voltage may, for example, be of the order of 12 V to 48 V.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, certain components of the low-voltage network, such as transmission cables used, for example, to send information from a measurement sensor to a control unit or a processing unit or any other component of the low-voltage network located close to the high-voltage components, may be more sensitive and be negatively affected or even damaged under certain conditions, for example in the case of extended exposure to a high electromagnetic field. It is therefore important to protect components operating at a low voltage from the influence of components supplied with power at a high voltage in order to prevent their potential deterioration over time.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The objective of the invention is to at least partially mitigate these drawbacks of the prior art by providing a straightforward and economical solution.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To that end, the subject of the invention is an electric heating device, in particular for a motor vehicle, said device comprising a heating body supplied with power at high voltage, a control unit supplied with power at low voltage, the control unit being configured to receive a low-voltage electrical signal, the control unit comprising at least one printed circuit board with at least one surface configured to accommodate electronic components; at least one transmission cable configured to transmit the low-voltage electrical signal to the control unit, the electric heating device being characterized in that the control unit comprises at least one positioning element configured to position the transmission cable within the control unit and in that the positioning element comprises at least one electrically insulating material.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Such a positioning element made of electrically insulating material protects the transmission cable by preventing current and heat from passing through the material of the positioning element. The positioning element also acts as a barrier to the propagation of the electric and/or magnetic fields generated by the other electronic components arranged on the printed circuit board of the control unit. Thus, at least a portion of the transmission cable is protected from electromagnetic interference which may result in interference in the one or more electrical signals carried by the transmission cable to the control unit. The positioning element guides the transmission cable in such a way as to prevent unwanted movement of the transmission cable with respect to the other components of the control unit. The positioning element thus serves both as a profiled guide and as a protective device for the transmission cable.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Said device may also have one or more of the following features, considered separately or in combination.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">the positioning element is positioned at the edge of the printed circuit board;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">the positioning element is a guide rail;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0014">the at least one positioning element comprises two lateral walls connected to one another by a bottom wall;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0015">the inner surfaces of said lateral walls and of said bottom wall together delimit a housing volume comprising an opening;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0016">the housing volume is configured to accommodate the transmission cable portion therein;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0017">the control unit comprises a casing with an open face;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0018">the positioning element is located on the face of the printed circuit board oriented facing the open face of the casing of the control unit;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0019">the electric heating device comprises a cover arranged on the open face of the casing so as to close said casing;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0020">the cover of the control unit is configured to cover the opening of the housing volume of the positioning element;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0021">at least one of the lateral walls comprises at least one retaining protuberance that protrudes with respect to the inner surfaces of the lateral walls of the positioning element;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0022">the at least one retaining protuberance is arranged at a distance from the bottom wall such that the distance separating the inner surface of the bottom wall from the at least one retaining protuberance is greater than the radius of the transmission cable;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0023">the at least one retaining protuberance is arranged on a free edge of at least one lateral wall;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0013" num="0024">a plurality of retaining protuberances are arranged in a staggered manner on the lateral walls of the positioning element;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0014" num="0025">the at least one retaining protuberance is made as one piece with the positioning element;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0015" num="0026">the at least one retaining protuberance is a part added to the positioning element;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0016" num="0027">at least one of the lateral walls comprises perforated attachment lugs whose perforations are superimposed over the attachment perforations of the printed circuit board within the control unit;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0017" num="0028">the positioning element is bonded to the printed circuit board of the control unit.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0029">Further advantages and features of the invention will become more clearly apparent from reading the following description, given by way of illustrative and non-limiting example, and the appended drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an electric heating device according to an embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the control unit of the electric heating device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the positioning element of the control unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a detail view of the positioning element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0018" num="0034">In these figures, identical elements bear the same reference numerals.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0035">The following embodiments are examples.

In particular, it is a device <b>1</b> for heating a fluid such as an air flow. Such an electric heating device <b>1</b> may be arranged for an air flow to be heated to pass therethrough.

What is meant by &#x201c;high voltage&#x201d;, in this context is a voltage higher than 60 V, in particular between 60 V and 1000 V, more particularly between 180 V and 600 V.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0039">The electric heating device <b>1</b> is, for example, capable of transforming electrical energy drawn, for example, from the motor vehicle into thermal energy which is transferred to the air flow through the heating device <b>1</b>.

The positioning element <b>20</b> thus has, for example, a &#x201c;U&#x201d;-shaped cross section. By way of example, the thickness of the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and of the bottom wall <b>26</b> is, in particular, between one and three millimeters.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0054">The inner surfaces of the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and of the bottom wall <b>26</b> together delimit a housing volume V configured to accommodate therein the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b>. The housing volume V therefore comprises an opening which is not obstructed by the walls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the positioning element <b>20</b>. This opening allows the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> to be inserted into the housing volume V.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0055">According to the embodiment of the positioning element <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the positioning element <b>20</b> is positioned at the edge of the printed circuit board <b>12</b>, so as to run along the walls of the casing <b>51</b> of the control unit <b>5</b>, thereby freeing up space in the center of the latter. In this same figure, the positioning element <b>20</b> is shown in the form of a guide rail placed on the face of the printed circuit board <b>12</b> oriented toward the open face of the casing <b>51</b> of the control unit <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0056">The cover <b>52</b> of the control unit <b>5</b> may, in particular, be configured to cover the opening of the housing volume V of the positioning element <b>20</b>. One face of the cover <b>52</b> is, for example, in contact with the free edges of the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the positioning element <b>20</b>. What is meant by &#x201c;free edge&#x201d; is the edge of a lateral wall <b>22</b> and/or <b>24</b> which delimits the opening of the positioning element <b>20</b>. According to another example, there may be a clearance between said face of the cover <b>52</b> and the free edges of the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the positioning element <b>20</b>. The cover <b>52</b> comprises, for example, a relief whose shape is complementary to the free edges of the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, such that part of the relief covers these free edges. The relief of the cover <b>52</b> makes it possible to prevent the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> from accidentally coming out of the housing volume V. It may also act as a guide for positioning the cover <b>52</b> on the casing <b>51</b>, in particular in a step of assembling the control unit <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0057">When it is inserted into the housing volume V of the positioning element <b>20</b>, the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> conforms to the shape of the positioning element <b>20</b>. The positioning element <b>20</b> comprises, for example, multiple straight portions <b>27</b> connected to one another by bent portions <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The straight portions <b>27</b> may, in particular, have different lengths and the bent portions <b>28</b> have, for example, radii of curvature that are distinct from each other. As a variant, the radii of curvature of some bent portions <b>28</b> may be identical. As a precaution, to avoid exerting mechanical stresses on the transmission cable <b>10</b> which might damage it, the radii of curvature of the bent sections <b>28</b> are at least equal to three times the diameter of the transmission cable <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0058">According to one embodiment of the positioning element <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the positioning element <b>20</b> comprises, for example, three straight portions <b>27</b> of various lengths connected to one another by bent portions <b>28</b>. The general shape of the positioning element <b>20</b> resulting from the alternation between the straight portions <b>27</b> and the bent portions <b>28</b> is, for example, that of a &#x201c;C&#x201d;. The portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> is constrained to follow the geometry of the straight sections <b>27</b> and of the bent sections <b>28</b>, so as to run along the edge of the first face of the printed circuit board <b>12</b> in the casing <b>51</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0059">There may be a lateral clearance between the inner surfaces of the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b>. There may likewise be a clearance between the bottom wall <b>26</b> and the transmission cable <b>10</b> portion. The clearances are tight enough to prevent the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> from accidentally coming out of the housing volume V of the positioning element <b>20</b>, for example under the effect of an impact. However, the clearances are wide enough to avoid squeezing of the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b>. In other words, the walls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the positioning element <b>20</b> are dimensioned in such a way that the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> is guided over the printed circuit board <b>12</b> without being squeezed.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0060">In order to keep the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> inside its housing volume V even in the absence of the cover <b>52</b> of the control unit <b>5</b>, at least one of the lateral walls <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> may comprise at least one retaining protuberance <b>30</b> that protrudes with respect to the inner surfaces of the lateral walls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of the positioning element <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. According to the embodiment of the positioning element <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, both lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the positioning element <b>20</b> comprise multiple retaining protuberances <b>30</b> protruding toward the interior of the positioning element <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0061">The retaining protuberances <b>30</b> are, for example, parallelepipedal in shape, the longest dimension of which extends parallel to the lateral walls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The longest dimension of a retaining protuberance <b>30</b> is, for example, of the same order of magnitude as the gap separating the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. In other words, the longest dimension of a retaining protuberance <b>30</b> is substantially smaller than the longitudinal dimension of the positioning element <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0062">The retaining protuberances <b>30</b> are, in particular, configured to keep the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> inside the housing volume V and to prevent the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> from accidentally coming out of the housing volume V of the positioning element <b>20</b>. With this in mind, the retaining protuberances <b>30</b> are arranged at a distance from the bottom wall <b>26</b>, such that the distance separating the inner surface of the bottom wall <b>26</b> from the retaining protuberances <b>30</b> is greater than the radius of the transmission cable <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0063">More particularly, the retaining protuberances <b>30</b> are, for example, arranged on a free edge of at least one lateral wall <b>22</b> and/or <b>24</b>. In the case where the retaining protuberances <b>30</b> are thus arranged on the free edges of the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, the size of the housing volume V is maximum, thereby allowing a portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> with a large diameter, for example of the order of the gap between the inner surfaces of the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, to be accommodated without risk of squeezing the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0064">A plurality of retaining protuberances <b>30</b> may be arranged in a staggered manner on the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the positioning element <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. In other words, the locations of the retaining protuberances <b>30</b> are shared in alternation between the two lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the positioning element <b>20</b>. Such a staggered arrangement allows a balanced distribution of the retaining protuberances <b>30</b> along the free edges of the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> in order to secure the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> inside the housing volume V. The number of retaining protuberances <b>30</b> is, for example, between three and ten, and is more particularly equal to six.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0065">According to a first embodiment of these retaining protuberances <b>30</b>, the latter are made as one piece with the positioning element <b>20</b>. These retaining protuberances <b>30</b> may thus be obtained in a process of molding or injecting the positioning element <b>20</b>. In the case of a molding production process, openings <b>35</b> are provided in the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> at the locations of the retaining protuberances <b>30</b> so as to allow them to be formed during the production of the positioning element <b>20</b> by molding. Such a process for producing the positioning element <b>20</b> is, for example, a solution that is inexpensive and easy to implement on a production line.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0066">According to a second embodiment (not illustrated) of the retaining protuberances <b>30</b>, they are parts that are added to the positioning element <b>20</b>. In this case, the retaining protuberances <b>30</b> take the form, for example, of parallelepipedal plastic rods which are attached, for example by bonding, to the inner faces of the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the positioning element <b>20</b>, so as to be adjacent to the free edges of the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0067">In the case where the retaining protuberances <b>30</b> are added parts, the openings <b>35</b> in the lateral walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may be omitted, since they are not needed in the production of the positioning element <b>20</b> by molding for this particular embodiment.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0068">To position the positioning element <b>20</b> with respect to the printed circuit board <b>12</b> inside the casing <b>51</b>, at least one of the lateral walls <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> may comprise perforated attachment lugs <b>40</b> whose perforations <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) are superimposed over attachment perforations of the printed circuit board <b>12</b> within the control unit <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). According to one embodiment of the positioning element <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, only the lateral wall <b>22</b> may comprise the attachment lugs <b>40</b>. Each attachment lug <b>40</b> comprises, for example, at least one perforation <b>42</b> configured to accommodate a screw <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) therein allowing the positioning element <b>20</b> to be positioned with respect to the casing <b>51</b> while attaching the positioning element <b>20</b> to the face of the printed circuit board <b>12</b> oriented toward the open face of the casing <b>51</b> of the control unit <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0069">The positioning element <b>20</b> comprises, for example, between two and six attachment lugs <b>40</b> which may be distributed regularly along the positioning element <b>20</b> or be located at strategic locations on the positioning element <b>20</b>. According to the embodiment of the positioning element <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the attachment lugs <b>40</b> are arranged on two very short straight portions <b>27</b> of the positioning element <b>20</b> that are located between two curved portions <b>28</b>, which are themselves located at the corners of the casing <b>51</b> of the control unit <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The attachment lugs <b>40</b> protrude, for example, with respect to the outer face of the lateral wall <b>22</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The attachment lugs <b>40</b> are oriented perpendicular to the outer surface of the lateral wall <b>22</b>. According to one variant of the positioning element <b>20</b> not illustrated in the figures, the attachment lugs <b>40</b> may be positioned on the lateral wall <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0070">The attachment lugs <b>40</b> allow the positioning element <b>20</b> to be positioned and steadied inside the casing <b>51</b> of the control unit <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). This makes it possible, in particular, to prevent the positioning element <b>20</b> from vibrating as caused, for example, when the motor vehicle in which the electric heating device <b>1</b> is installed is driven.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0071">According to another non-illustrated embodiment of the positioning element <b>20</b>, it may be bonded to the printed circuit board <b>12</b> of the control unit <b>5</b>. More particularly, it is permanently attached to the face of the printed circuit board <b>12</b>, thereby making it possible to keep vibrating of the positioning element <b>20</b> to a minimum.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0072">The materials that may be envisaged for producing such a positioning element <b>20</b> are, for example, composite materials comprising glass fibers in a thermoplastic polymer structure, such as PBT GF20 or PA66 GF20-30. The main characteristics of composite materials such as nylons filled with glass fibers are, in particular, very high rigidity, high mechanical strength, a high degree of hardness and solidity as well as very good resistance to creep. Nylons filled with glass fibers also exhibit high dimensional stability, good resistance to fatigue and very good mechanical damping properties.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0073">In general, the materials that may be envisaged for the positioning element <b>20</b> are mechanically compatible with the external environment, namely that of an electric heating device <b>1</b> in this specific case. The positioning element <b>20</b> has, for example, a coefficient of thermal expansion that is compatible with its environment. More precisely, the walls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the positioning element <b>20</b> are, for example, designed in such a way that their thicknesses change little with temperature. In the case of variations in the thickness of the walls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the positioning element <b>20</b> following changes in temperature, these do not result in thermomechanical stresses on the portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> so that it is not squeezed or otherwise damaged.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0074">The material of the positioning element <b>20</b> may, for example, resist heat transfer, thereby limiting exposure of the portion of the transmission cable <b>10</b> to sudden temperature changes or more generally to an undesirable rise in temperature. In addition, the material of the positioning element <b>20</b> may be fireproofed, thereby limiting flame propagation in the event of a fire.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0075">The positioning element <b>20</b> thus protects the at least one portion <b>10</b>A of the transmission cable <b>10</b> both from electromagnetic radiation from surrounding parts of the control unit <b>5</b> and from external mechanical and/or thermal stresses such as vibrations or a rise in temperature that the electric heating device <b>1</b> may experience.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
