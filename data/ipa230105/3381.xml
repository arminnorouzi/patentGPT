include combustion sections configured to generate combustion gases from a receive a flow of compressed air mixed with fuel and ignited in a combustion chamber. This process generates heat and pressure changes that require flows of air to condition the combustion gases for a downstream turbine section, or to limit damage to the combustion section due to the generated heat.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Combustion sections are generally required to produce high-energy combustion gases while also limiting emissions such as oxides of nitrogen, greenhouse gases, unburned hydrocarbons, or smoke. Furthermore, combustion sections are challenged to introduce cooling air to limit damage or deterioration to structures at the combustion section and downstream turbine section. Generally, achieving some of these challenges requires or results in compromises toward achieving other challenges. Furthermore, it is recognized that changes in geometries at a combustion section often have unpredictable effects at the combustion section, such as with regard to limiting emissions, limiting deterioration, or limiting undesired pressure oscillations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, there is a need for improved combustion section structures. Furthermore, there is a need for improved combustion gas dilution structures that limit deterioration of combustion section structures.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects and advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects of the present disclosure are directed to a gas turbine engine and combustor assembly.

Each example is provided by way of explanation of the disclosure, not limitation of the disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present disclosure without departing from the scope or spirit of the disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present disclosure covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any implementation described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations. Additionally, unless specifically identified otherwise, all embodiments described herein should be considered exemplary.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Here and throughout the specification and claims, range limitations are combined and interchanged, such ranges are identified and include all the sub-ranges contained therein unless context or language indicates otherwise. For example, all ranges disclosed herein are inclusive of the endpoints, and the endpoints are independently combinable with each other.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, and &#x201c;third&#x201d; may be used interchangeably to distinguish one component from another and are not intended to signify location or importance of the individual components.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The terms &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; refer to the relative direction with respect to fluid flow in a fluid pathway. For example, &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; refers to the direction from which the fluid flows, and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; refers to the direction to which the fluid flows.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally, the terms &#x201c;low,&#x201d; &#x201c;high,&#x201d; or their respective comparative degrees (e.g., lower, higher, where applicable) each refer to relative speeds within an engine, unless otherwise specified.

For example, a &#x201c;low-pressure turbine&#x201d; may refer to the lowest maximum pressure turbine within a turbine section, and a &#x201c;high-pressure turbine&#x201d; may refer to the highest maximum pressure turbine within the turbine section.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The terms &#x201c;coupled,&#x201d; &#x201c;fixed,&#x201d; &#x201c;attached to,&#x201d; and the like refer to both direct coupling, fixing, or attaching, as well as indirect coupling, fixing, or attaching through one or more intermediate components or features, unless otherwise specified herein.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present subject matter is directed to a combustor for a gas turbine engine. In general, the combustor can include a forward liner segment and an aft liner segment positioned downstream of the forward liner segment relative to a flow of fluid along a longitudinal direction toward an exhaust section. In this respect, the forward and aft liner segments at least partially define a combustion chamber in which a fuel and air mixture is burned to generate combustion gases.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A dilution slot or gap is formed by a longitudinal separation of the forward liner segment and the aft liner segment. The gap allows for up to a substantially 360 degree sheet of dilution fluid, such as compressed air, to enter the combustion chamber for rapid mixing with the combustion gases and improved completion of the combustion process in a lean zone. An annular wall or fence is extended radially into the combustion chamber from the aft liner segment, allowing for improved penetration of the compressed air into the combustion chamber.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In certain embodiments, the forward liner segment is connected to an upstream bulkhead assembly and the aft liner segment is connected to a downstream turbine nozzle. The forward liner segment may be cantilevered from the bulkhead assembly. The aft liner segment may be cantilevered from the turbine nozzle. The dilution slot or gap is formed between the cantilevered ends of the forward liner segment and the aft liner segment.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a particular arrangement, a moveable interface is positioned between forward liner segment and the aft liner segment. The moveable interface may form a floating insert that regulates or controls a longitudinal dimension of the gap and accommodates the independent thermal expansion of the forward and aft liner segments.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Embodiments provided herein allow for reducing emissions, such as oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) in rich-burn combustor configurations. The dilution slot or gap formed by forward and aft liner segments, such as a substantially or fully annular gap, may substantially reduce gas temperatures along the walls of the liners by 500 degrees Fahrenheit or more. Additionally, or alternatively, embodiments provided herein may reduce a circumferential temperature gradient at and downstream of the combustion chamber (i.e., hot spots) and generally improve pattern factor, allowing for improved durability and reduced deterioration of the liners and downstream turbine section. The moveable interface may further allow for adjustment or controllability of the gap relative to changes in liner temperature and provide improved vibration response or dampening.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of one embodiment of a gas turbine engine <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the engine <b>10</b> is configured as a high-bypass turbofan engine. However, in alternative embodiments, the engine <b>10</b> may be configured as a propfan engine, a turbojet engine, a turboprop engine, a turboshaft gas turbine engine, or any other suitable type of gas turbine engine.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the engine <b>10</b> defines a longitudinal direction L, a radial direction R, and a circumferential direction C. In general, the longitudinal direction L extends parallel to a longitudinal centerline <b>12</b> of the engine <b>10</b>, the radial direction R extends orthogonally outward from the longitudinal centerline <b>12</b>, and the circumferential direction C extends generally concentrically around the longitudinal centerline <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In general, the engine <b>10</b> includes a fan <b>14</b>, a low-pressure (LP) spool <b>16</b>, and a high pressure (HP) spool <b>18</b> at least partially encased by an annular nacelle <b>20</b>. More specifically, the fan <b>14</b> may include a fan rotor <b>22</b> and a plurality of fan blades <b>24</b> (one is shown) coupled to the fan rotor <b>22</b>. In this respect, the fan blades <b>24</b> are spaced apart from each other along the circumferential direction C and extend outward from the fan rotor <b>22</b> along the radial direction R. Moreover, the LP and HP spools <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are positioned downstream from the fan <b>14</b> along the longitudinal centerline <b>12</b> (i.e., in the longitudinal direction L). As shown, the LP spool <b>16</b> is rotatably coupled to the fan rotor <b>22</b>, thereby permitting the LP spool <b>16</b> to rotate the fan <b>14</b>. Additionally, a plurality of outlet guide vanes or struts <b>26</b> spaced apart from each other in the circumferential direction C extend between an outer casing <b>28</b> surrounding the LP and HP spools <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and the nacelle <b>20</b> along the radial direction R. As such, the struts <b>26</b> support the nacelle <b>20</b> relative to the outer casing <b>28</b> such that the outer casing <b>28</b> and the nacelle <b>20</b> define a bypass airflow passage <b>30</b> positioned therebetween.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The outer casing <b>28</b> generally surrounds or encases, in serial flow order, a compressor section <b>32</b>, a combustion section <b>34</b>, a turbine section <b>36</b>, and an exhaust section <b>38</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the compressor section <b>32</b> may include a low-pressure (LP) compressor <b>40</b> of the LP spool <b>16</b> and a high-pressure (HP) compressor <b>42</b> of the HP spool <b>18</b> positioned downstream from the LP compressor <b>40</b> along the longitudinal centerline <b>12</b>. Each compressor <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> may, in turn, include one or more rows of stator vanes <b>44</b> interdigitated with one or more rows of compressor rotor blades <b>46</b>.
