Indeed, such tailings typically consist of a slurry of mostly undesirable particles, and yet contain some that have highly-sought physical characteristics, whether chemical, crystalline, mechanical, optical, or others, and therefore hold non-negligible residual economic value. Techniques conventionally used for discriminating particles contained in tailings have different degrees of effectiveness, some techniques having shortcomings that become more apparent in certain industrial applications, such as for the recovery of fine iron particles from the tailings of large-scale iron ore extraction and beneficiation. For instance, equipment relying on centrifugal separation principles (e.g., spiral concentrators) have been widely used in high-volume operations, although with limited economic benefits due to inherent limitations affecting their effectiveness in recovering fine, yet high-value particles present in substantial amounts in certain ore feeds. Relatively recent particle classification technologies leveraging fluidized bed separation and lamella settling principles (e.g., reflux classifiers) have also exhibited limitations when operated at industrial-level throughputs and particularly when used to classify ore feeds containing a high proportion of fine particles. Hence, improvements in this field are desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to one aspect of the present technology, there is provided a particle classification system comprising: a classifier including: a vat defining an interior cavity, a feeder conduit upstream of the interior cavity, an overflow conduit in fluid communication between a top of the interior cavity and outside the vat, an underflow conduit downstream of the interior cavity and a controllable underflow valve fluidly connected to a bottom of the interior cavity, the underflow valve controlled to be either in an open configuration in which the interior cavity is in fluid communication with the underflow conduit or in a closed configuration in which the interior cavity is sealed from the underflow conduit; a feed preparation circuit upstream of the feeder conduit; a rejection circuit downstream of the overflow conduit, and a beneficiation circuit downstream of the underflow conduit.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, the feed preparation circuit includes a plurality of separation devices, each one of the plurality of separation devices having a preparation outlet serially arranged upstream of the classifier and a rejection outlet routed away from the classifier.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the plurality of separation devices includes a screen having a fine particle outlet upstream of the classifier.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the classifier is a first classifier, the system further comprising a second classifier, the screen having a coarse particle outlet separate from the fine particle outlet and upstream of the second classifier.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the plurality of separation devices includes a magnetic separator upstream of the screen.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the screen includes a first screen and a second screen, the fine particle outlet upstream of the first classifier being a first fine particle outlet of the first screen, the coarse particle outlet upstream of the second classifier being a first coarse particle outlet of the first screen, the second screen having a second fine particle outlet upstream of the first screen.

The system <b>100</b> notably comprises a fluid-borne particle classification device <b>10</b>, henceforth referred to as a classifier <b>10</b> for brevity. The classifier <b>10</b> is of a type suitable for use in industrial-scale ore particle beneficiation processes and related methods. As will become apparent from the forthcoming, the classifier <b>10</b> may be used in conjunction with other devices of the system <b>100</b> and operated therewith under certain conditions so as to optimize its yield with respect to ore-specific physico-chemical constraints or economic objectives. Some of the terminology used to describe the classifier <b>10</b> pertains to such beneficiation processes or related methods. For example, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;flow&#x201d; may be used with respect to a substance that is movable by means of a device of the system <b>100</b>, the classifier <b>10</b> for instance, regardless of the substance being a fluid substance, a solid substance or a heterogeneous substance such as a slurry, as the case may be at either step of such processes. Moreover, unless stated otherwise, whenever the terms &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; are used to qualify elements such as equipment or flow, they should be understood to indicate relative position or direction within such processes. Indeed, other devices or elements used in some implementations of such processes may be located upstream or downstream of the classifier <b>10</b> without there being direct communication therebetween, let alone direct fluid communication. For example, as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the ore, once ran out of mine, typically enters processing in what may be referred to as a grinding circuit <b>2</b>, or stage, of the system <b>100</b>, i.e., a circuit of equipment including machinery G such as grinders, crushers or other mill-like devices for reducing a size of the raw ore material. The grinding circuit <b>2</b> may also include transport equipment T, for example a conveyor upstream of the machinery G, and may also include sizing equipment, such as a screen S, at a downstream end of the grinding circuit <b>2</b>. The ore may thus be grinded down and screened until reduced into size fractions finer than, for example, a size threshold of about 1400 &#x3bc;m. Downstream of the grinding circuit <b>2</b>, the reduced ore reports to a portion of the system <b>100</b> referred to as a feed preparation circuit <b>4</b>. The feed preparation circuit <b>4</b> includes at least one piece of particle separation equipment, i.e., a device adapted to separate a flow of mixed ore particles received thereby into at least two downstream flows, such as shown at <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B. A hindered settler, shown at HS, may in some implementations be one such separation device. It should be noted that such mixed flow comprises a wide range of size fractions of particles of both high-value minerals and low-value minerals, such that the former may be described as being in diluted form. In one exemplary case of ore deposit being the object of industrial mining, high-value iron particles may be found in multiple mineral forms, such as hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), a significant percentage of which is present in fine size fractions of 200 &#x3bc;m or finer. Low-value particles, for instance silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>), are also found throughout the range of size fractions. The hindered settler HS may thus be configured so as to split the mixed flow of such particles into an overflow (<b>4</b>A) containing ultrafine ore particles (i.e., particles having a size fraction finer than about 200 &#x3bc;m) from an underflow (<b>4</b>B) containing most of the coarser ore particles, on the basis of differences in density between the high-value and low-value particles. As iron has a density that is higher (&#x3e;5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) than that of silica (&#x3c;3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), large, dense iron particles are flowable downward inside the hindered settler HS to report to the underflow <b>4</b>B, whereas similar sized particles of silica may be flowed upward to report to the overflow <b>4</b>B. The underflow <b>4</b>B reports to a coarse processing circuit <b>6</b> for further concentrating steps such as via one or more spiral concentrators SC. In either of the feed preparation <b>4</b> and coarse processing 6 stages, outputs may either report for further processing in what may be referred to as a beneficiation circuit <b>8</b>, or instead be rejected as generally shown at R, to be collected as tailings which may or may not be ulteriorly be beneficiated. Further processing may in some cases include further concentration steps and/or transformation steps such as pelletizing. However, relative inefficiencies may remain as such stages, as may be observed in the hindered settler HS where coarse, light particles as well as finer, yet heavier particles are both prone to report to the overflow <b>4</b>A, the latter type containing a material amount of the ultrafine, dense iron particles.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As will be described hereinbelow, in presence of a feed containing ultrafine, high-value particles diluted by low-value particles such as the abovementioned overflow <b>4</b>A, the classifier <b>10</b> may allow to split the feed so as to concentrate the ultrafine high-value particles of the feed, i.e., to yield a concentrate of such particles. To wit, a grade of the concentrate, i.e., a percentage of a total dry weight of the concentrate specific to the high-value particles contained by the concentrate, is higher than that of the feed. Further, the present technology may be said to solve some of the shortcomings of conventionally implemented and conventionally used particle classification equipment. Also described as hybrids due to their combined implementation of fluidized bed separators and lamella settlers, such particle classification equipment is typically suitable for the classification of particles of minerals such as coal having a density (&#x3c;2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) lesser than any of the above-mentioned minerals found in iron ore, and for size fraction distributions that do not encompass the ultrafine range that iron ore is known for.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">General Description of the Classifier</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, structural characteristics of the classifier <b>10</b> will now be described. The classifier <b>10</b> generally includes a vat <b>11</b>, an overflow launder <b>40</b> and a lamella settler <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The vat <b>11</b> has a bottom portion forming a receptacle <b>20</b>, and a second portion forming a casing <b>30</b> and extending upwardly therefrom. The receptacle <b>20</b>, the casing <b>30</b> and the overflow launder <b>40</b> may be said to be stacked on top of one another, i.e., the receptacle <b>20</b> is disposed beneath the casing <b>30</b> and the overflow launder <b>40</b> is disposed onto the casing <b>30</b>. The receptacle <b>20</b> and the casing <b>30</b> together define an interior cavity <b>12</b> of the vat <b>11</b>, and are arranged to withstand pressure resulting from substances either flowed to and/or from the interior cavity <b>12</b> or simply contained therein. In other embodiments, the bottom and top portions of the vat <b>11</b> form an integral structure. The receptacle <b>20</b> is mounted to a base <b>21</b> of the classifier <b>10</b> arranged to support a remainder of the classifier <b>10</b> against a ground surface <b>1</b> in a generally vertical orientation. Various other means for supporting and orienting the classifier <b>10</b> are possible, such as frame-like structures that may for example be adapted for mounting the casing <b>30</b> against infrastructure typically provided in ore mining plants such as a foundation, a slab or a wall (not shown). The receptacle <b>20</b> is connected to a fluidization system <b>22</b> of the classifier <b>10</b>. The fluidization system <b>22</b> is provided for selectively and controllably flowing a fluidization substance (i.e., a fluidization flow <b>22</b>&#x2032;) inside the interior cavity <b>12</b> upwardly into the casing <b>30</b> and generally uniformly across a horizontal cross section of the casing <b>30</b>. The fluidization system <b>22</b> includes a plurality of nozzles <b>24</b> arranged for flowing jets <b>24</b>&#x2032; of the fluidization substance so as to form the fluidization flow <b>22</b>&#x2032;. In this exemplary arrangement of the fluidization system <b>22</b>, the nozzles <b>24</b> are supported on a funnel-like nozzle mount <b>26</b> disposed inside the interior cavity <b>12</b>. At least a portion of the nozzle mount <b>26</b> narrows as it extends toward a bottom of the receptacle <b>20</b>. The nozzles <b>24</b> are sized and provided on the nozzle mount <b>26</b> in a quantity and a spatial arrangement suitable for producing a generally even horizontal distribution of the fluidization flow <b>22</b>&#x2032; upwardly of the receptacle <b>20</b>. The nozzles <b>24</b> are fluidly connected to a pressurized source (not shown) via a conduit <b>28</b> to receive the fluidized substance therefrom. The fluidization substance generally consists of a fluid, in this case water. An underflow line <b>16</b> of the classifier <b>10</b> is fluidly connected to an underflow outlet <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the interior cavity <b>12</b> disposed onto the receptacle <b>10</b>. The underflow line <b>16</b> includes an underflow outlet conduit <b>16</b><i>b </i>and an underflow valve <b>16</b><i>c </i>disposed between the interior cavity <b>12</b> and the underflow outlet conduit <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The underflow outlet valve <b>16</b><i>c </i>is configurable via a controller (not shown) of the classifier <b>10</b> between an open configuration to open an underflow passage from inside the interior cavity <b>12</b> to outside the vat <b>11</b> to a closed configuration to close the underflow passage. The receptacle <b>20</b> and the nozzle mount <b>26</b> surround the underflow outlet <b>16</b><i>a </i>and may be said to be arranged to assist in directing an underflow <b>16</b>&#x2032; from inside the interior cavity <b>12</b> to outside the vat <b>11</b> via the underflow outlet <b>16</b><i>a </i>upon the underflow outlet valve <b>16</b><i>c </i>being in the open position. The underflow outlet valve <b>16</b><i>c </i>may be of a type suitable for achieving a tight seal despite the fluid flowing therethrough containing solid particles. For example, the type commonly referred to as a &#x201c;pinch valve&#x201d; may be used, as its inherent characteristics render it particularly effective for sealing around dense, solid particles such as iron ore particles, while being less prone to failure associated with gate valves or other like types based on rigid barrier movable between discrete positions in and out of a flow path.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A feeder line <b>14</b> of the classifier <b>10</b> is fluidly connected to a feed inlet <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the interior cavity <b>12</b> disposed onto the casing <b>30</b> at a location spaced upwardly from the reservoir <b>20</b>. The feeder line <b>14</b> is arranged for flowing feed, i.e., a slurry containing fluid-borne particles, into the interior cavity <b>12</b>. A feed flow <b>14</b>&#x2032; is received by the feeder line <b>14</b> from a feeding apparatus (e.g., a feed pump box, not shown) upstream therefrom. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, this exemplary arrangement of the feeder line <b>14</b> is a manifold of three feeder conduits <b>14</b><i>b </i>that connect to the casing <b>30</b> via three feed inlets <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The feeder line <b>14</b> is arranged for preventing backflow, i.e., for preventing substances from flowing from inside the interior cavity <b>12</b> to inside the feeder line <b>14</b>. The feeder line <b>14</b> may otherwise be provided with a valve (not shown) for selectively closing the feeder line <b>14</b>. Each feeder conduit <b>14</b><i>b </i>extends through a corresponding feed inlet <b>14</b><i>a </i>to inside the interior cavity <b>12</b>, although it does not have to be the case. In other arrangements, the feeder line <b>14</b> may instead end flush with the casing <b>30</b>. In some arrangements, the feeder line <b>14</b> may have more or less than three feeder conduits <b>14</b><i>b </i>connecting to the casing <b>30</b> via a corresponding amount of feed inlets <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The feeder line <b>14</b> connects to the casing <b>30</b> at a portion thereof forming a feed chamber <b>32</b>. This exemplary arrangement of the casing <b>30</b> has distinct feed chambers <b>32</b> respectively fluidly connected to each one of the feeder conduits <b>14</b><i>b</i>. Each feed chamber <b>32</b> is confined along its periphery, other than for the feed inlet <b>14</b><i>a </i>disposed on one of its sides, and is open along its bottom end <b>32</b><i>a </i>so as to be in fluid communication with the reservoir <b>20</b> beneath the casing <b>30</b>. Each feed chamber <b>32</b> is also confined across its top end <b>32</b><i>b</i>. Indeed, the top end <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the feed chamber <b>32</b> defines a partition between the casing <b>30</b> and the overflow launder <b>40</b>. Stated otherwise, the feed chamber <b>32</b> is sealed with respect to the overflow launder <b>40</b>. The casing <b>30</b> defines a mixing chamber <b>34</b> extending from the feed chamber <b>32</b> to the reservoir <b>20</b> and arranged for providing fluid communication therebetween. The mixing chamber <b>34</b> is confined along its periphery, and open both at its bottom end <b>34</b><i>a </i>adjacent the reservoir <b>20</b> and at its top end <b>34</b><i>b </i>adjacent the feed chambers <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the casing <b>30</b> also has overflow chambers <b>36</b> disposed alongside the feed chambers <b>32</b>. In this case, two overflow chambers <b>36</b> are provided, each one disposed between two consecutive feed chambers <b>32</b>. Each overflow chamber <b>36</b> is confined along its periphery, and is open across both its top <b>36</b><i>a </i>and bottom end <b>36</b><i>b </i>so as to be in fluid communication between the overflow launder <b>40</b> and the reservoir <b>20</b> beneath the casing <b>30</b>. The bottom <b>36</b><i>a </i>and top <b>36</b><i>b </i>end of each overflow chamber <b>36</b> are respectively adjacent the top end <b>34</b><i>b </i>of the mixing chamber <b>34</b> and the overflow launder <b>40</b>, respectively. The top end <b>36</b><i>b </i>of each overflow chamber <b>36</b> defines an overflow outlet <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the vat <b>11</b>. The overflow launder <b>40</b> is disposed downstream of the overflow outlet <b>18</b><i>a </i>and arranged for flowing an overflow <b>18</b>&#x2032; received from the overflow outlet <b>18</b><i>a </i>to an overflow outlet conduit <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the classifier <b>10</b>. The overflow launder <b>40</b> may be described as a container arranged for draining flowable substances received thereby. The overflow launder <b>40</b> defines channels <b>40</b><i>a </i>(best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) in fluid communication between the overflow outlet <b>18</b><i>a </i>and the overflow outlet conduit <b>18</b><i>b</i>. The channels <b>40</b><i>a </i>are arranged such that an overflow <b>18</b>&#x2032; received thereby from the casing <b>30</b> via the lamellar settler <b>50</b> reports to the overflow outlet conduit <b>18</b><i>b</i>, in this case gravitationally.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The lamella settler <b>50</b> includes at least one array of plates <b>50</b><i>b </i>spaced from one another and received by the interior cavity <b>12</b> so as to be enclosed by the casing <b>30</b>. In this case, two arrays of plates <b>50</b><i>b </i>are provided, one being received inward each overflow outlet <b>18</b><i>a </i>so as to be enclosed by a corresponding one of the overflow chambers <b>36</b>. The plates <b>50</b><i>b </i>are disposed at an inclined angle to at least one of a vertical axis about which the mixing chamber <b>34</b> is disposed. The plates <b>50</b><i>b </i>define passages between consecutive plates <b>50</b><i>b </i>and between the plates <b>50</b><i>b </i>and the periphery of the overflow chamber <b>36</b>, the passages together defining an overflow conduit <b>50</b><i>c</i>. Each passage, and hence the overflow conduit <b>50</b><i>c</i>, is in fluid communication between the interior cavity <b>12</b>, and hence the feed inlet <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the underflow outlet <b>16</b><i>a</i>, and inside the overflow launder <b>40</b>. In this implementation of the classifier <b>10</b>, the mixing chamber <b>34</b> extends upright from the reservoir <b>20</b> and a remainder of the casing <b>30</b> (i.e., a portion of the casing <b>30</b> having the feed and overflow chambers <b>32</b>, <b>36</b>) is at the inclined angle. Each array of plates <b>50</b><i>b </i>extends from inside its corresponding chamber inside the casing <b>30</b>, to inside the overflow launder <b>40</b> outside the casing <b>30</b>. It is contemplated that in other possible implementations of the classifier <b>10</b>, solely an upper portion of the overflow chambers <b>36</b> located upward of the feed chambers <b>32</b> may be at the inclined angle, the feed chambers <b>32</b> and a remainder of the overflow chambers <b>36</b> extending vertically instead. In yet other possible implementations, the casing <b>30</b> may be arranged with an overflow chamber fitted with an array of plates so as to form a lamella settler having the overflow outlet conduit, the overflow chamber disposed on top of a feed chamber in fluid communication therewith.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In view of the foregoing structural characteristics, operational characteristics of the classifier <b>10</b> will now be described. Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the feed flow <b>14</b>&#x2032; may enter the interior cavity <b>12</b> via the feed inlet <b>14</b><i>a</i>. From the feed chamber <b>32</b>, the feed may gravitationally flow into the mixing chamber <b>34</b> and toward the reservoir <b>20</b>, thereby forming a gravitational flow <b>12</b>&#x2032; (i.e., a downward flow). In the mixing chamber <b>34</b>, the feed may mix with the fluidization substance as fluidization flow <b>22</b>&#x2032; enters the mixing chamber <b>34</b>. Upon the interior cavity <b>12</b> having been filled with feed and fluidisation substances up to a level overflowing from the reservoir <b>20</b> into the mixing chamber <b>34</b>, the fluidization flow <b>22</b>&#x2032; may oppose the gravitational flow <b>12</b>&#x2032; such that downward movement of at least some particles (e.g., high-density particles) of the gravitational flow <b>12</b>&#x2032; is merely hindered and eventually pool into the reservoir <b>20</b>, whereas upward movement is induced to other particles so as to form a forced flow <b>12</b>&#x2033; (i.e., an upward flow). As the feed may contain relatively coarse particle that combine particles of various densities, the forced flow <b>12</b>&#x2033; may also desirably liberate ultrafine, high-density particles, allowing them to report to the gravitational flow <b>12</b>&#x2032; instead and eventually pool into the reservoir <b>20</b>. Further, upon the interior cavity <b>12</b> having been filled with feed and fluidisation substances up to a level overflowing to the overflow launder <b>40</b>, the forced flow <b>12</b>&#x2033; may induce a flow of fluid-borne particles upward inside the overflow chamber <b>36</b> and inside the overflow conduit <b>50</b><i>c</i>. The abovementioned characteristics of the lamellar settler <b>50</b> are arranged such that laminar flow conditions may prevail inside the overflow conduit <b>50</b><i>c </i>and its passages. Under such conditions, particles of different sizes are respectively elutriated at the same hydraulic velocity. For instance, inside the passages, particles having higher density and/or specific gravity higher than that of their surroundings tend to settle against the plate <b>50</b><i>b </i>beneath thereof and slide downwardly therealong. Hence, under certain conditions, the ultrafine, heavy particles may report to the receptacle <b>20</b>, whereas only the coarse, light particles may report to the overflow launder <b>40</b>. The flows to which the ultrafine, heavy particles and the coarse, light particles respectively report may be described as a gravitational elutriated flow <b>36</b>&#x2032; and a forced elutriated flow <b>36</b>&#x2033;. It will be appreciated that the vat <b>11</b> is arranged such that upon the underflow outlet <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the feed inlet <b>14</b><i>a </i>being closed, the overflow conduit <b>50</b><i>c </i>forms a sole passage between inside the interior cavity <b>12</b> and outside the vat <b>11</b>. Stated otherwise, the vat <b>11</b> is arranged such that under such circumstances, particles located inside the interior cavity <b>12</b> cannot flow to outside thereof so as to bypass the lamella settler <b>50</b> and thus without subjecting to its elutriation effect.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The classifier <b>10</b> is arranged such that under certain operational conditions, a media of particles may densify within a horizontal layer of the interior cavity <b>12</b> so as to form what may be called a bed <b>38</b>. The bed <b>38</b> may for instance form inside the mixing chamber <b>34</b> proximate the feed inlet <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The bed <b>38</b> may include particles having a mean density greater and/or a mean size fraction finer than that of substances elsewhere in a remainder of the mixing chamber <b>34</b>. In what may be described as an autogenous process, the bed <b>38</b> may desirably assist in hindering coarse light particles from reporting downward of the bed <b>38</b> via the gravitational flow <b>12</b>&#x2032; and instead flow from the feed inlet <b>14</b><i>a </i>to the bed <b>38</b> and then from the bed <b>38</b> toward the overflow launder <b>40</b>. It will be appreciated that the classifier <b>10</b> is arranged such that the interior cavity <b>12</b> (and thus of the bed <b>38</b>) is fully exposed to the fluidization flow <b>22</b>&#x2032; and/or to the forced flow <b>12</b>&#x2033;. Indeed, this may desirably assist in maintaining the bed <b>38</b> in a fluidized state, i.e., a state in which particles may flow thereto and therefrom. For example, low-density particles flowing away from the receptacle <b>20</b> and toward the bed <b>38</b> via the forced flow <b>12</b>&#x2033; after separating from high-density particles may also eventually flow away from the bed <b>38</b> and toward the overflow chamber <b>36</b> via the forced elutriated flow <b>36</b>&#x2033;. Also, the ultrafine high-density particles of the gravitational elutriated flow <b>36</b>&#x2032; flowing away from the overflow chamber <b>36</b> and toward the bed <b>38</b> may eventually flow away from the bed <b>38</b> and toward the receptacle <b>20</b>. Stated otherwise, the vat <b>11</b> is arranged so as to provide direct flow paths between the receptacle <b>20</b> and the lamella settler <b>50</b>. Such direct flow paths allow, for instance, the fluidizing flow <b>22</b>&#x2032;, the forced flow <b>12</b>&#x2033; and the forced elutriated flow <b>36</b>&#x2033; to succeed one another unhindered, whether along a side of the interior cavity <b>12</b> or at its center.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As the forced elutriated flow <b>36</b>&#x2033; causes some of the particles contained in the interior cavity <b>12</b> having relatively low density and a relatively large size fraction to exit the interior cavity <b>12</b>, a mean density and a mean size fraction of the particles remaining inside the interior cavity <b>12</b> decreases. Conversely, a density of the bed <b>38</b> may be said to increase via the same mechanism. The classifier <b>10</b> includes a means for measuring the density of the bed <b>38</b>, in this case including probes <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b </i>connected to the casing <b>30</b>. The probes <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b </i>(schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) are respectively disposed proximate the bottom <b>34</b><i>a </i>and top <b>34</b><i>b </i>ends of the mixing chamber <b>34</b>, and are arranged for measuring a differential pressure inside the interior cavity <b>12</b>, i.e., a difference between a pressure measured at the bottom end <b>34</b><i>a </i>beneath the bed <b>38</b> and a pressure measured at the top end <b>34</b><i>b </i>proximate the bed <b>38</b>. Based on the measured differential pressure, a relative density value may be calculated. The relative density may be described as a ratio of the density of the media of particles forming the bed <b>38</b> and that of the media of particles located across the mixing chamber <b>34</b>. A controller of the classifier <b>10</b> (not shown) is arranged for receiving a signal indicative of the measured differential pressure and for calculating the relative density. The controller is operatively connected to the underflow outlet valve <b>16</b><i>c </i>and arranged to configure the underflow outlet valve <b>16</b><i>c </i>in the open position upon the relative density attaining a given value. It should also be noted that the relative density can be related to the grade of a media of particles located beneath the mixing chamber <b>34</b>. Thus, the controller may be used to open the underflow outlet valve <b>16</b><i>c </i>upon the relative density attaining a value indicative of a threshold value for a desired grade of the particles, so as to obtain an underflow <b>16</b>&#x2032; of a substance having the desired grade.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As mentioned, ore deposits including a high-density mineral of interest may combine a mineral of a lower value that happens to have a lower density. Feeds of ore obtained from such deposits may also include a vast range of size fractions for both mineral types, as may be the case for the iron and the silica found in certain iron ore deposits. For instance, a distribution of iron and silica particles that may be found in an exemplary feed obtained from such iron ore deposits is provided at Annex <b>1</b>. Known conventional classification technologies have been found to be incapable of yielding concentrates attaining target grade (e.g., &#x3e;60%) and target dry weight recovery (total dry weight of the feed: &#x3e;20%; iron-only dry weight of the feed: &#x3e;45%) values from such feeds.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The classifier <b>10</b> may be operated according to certain operating conditions (i.e., characteristics of the feed, operating parameters of the classifier <b>10</b> and synergies between) so as to yield concentrates attaining or exceeding the target grade and the target dry weight recovery values. Such operating conditions may include a grade of the feed being of at least 20% in some embodiments. In some such embodiments, the grade of the feed may be of at most 55%, for example at least 20%, and preferably within a range of 30% to 43% in some such embodiments. The operating conditions may also include a hindered settler (HS) split value representing the percentage of material that reports to the overflow <b>4</b><i>a </i>downstream of the hindered settler HS and to the classifier <b>10</b> as the feed. The HS split value may be greater than 50% and, in some embodiments, be between 55% and 75%. Configuring the hindered settler HS so as to increase the HS split may increase the reporting of coarser, lower grade material to the overflow <b>4</b>B and may thus decrease the grade of the feed to the classifier <b>10</b>. The operating conditions may also include feed density, i.e., the percentage of solid particles in the feed. The feed density may for example be adjusted upon sensing the density of a substance obtained and by adding a fluid, such as water to the substance resulting in the feed having a desired feed density. Sensing the density of the substance and adding the fluid thereto may for example be performed dynamically, i.e., via a feed box upstream of the classifier <b>10</b>. Also, adjusting the feed density may also be adjusted by controlling a mass rate at which the solid particles of the feed (i.e., solids feed rate) are fed to the classifier <b>10</b>. The solids feed rate value may be of between 10 tonnes per hour (tph) and 200 tph and, in some embodiments, more preferably between 100 tph and 200 tph. In an exemplary embodiment, the feed is flowed at a feed rate of between 31 tph and 44 tph. The feed density value may in some embodiments be between 30% and 55% and, in some such embodiments, preferably be between 40% and 55%. In embodiments, the feed may be obtained at a feed density value of less than 40%, and may preferably be increased to at least 40%. The parameters may also include fluidization flow rate, i.e., a rate at which a volume of the fluidization substance is flowed via the fluidization flow <b>24</b>&#x2032;. The fluidization flow rate value may be of between 10 US gallons per minute (USGPM) and 200 USGPM and, in some embodiments, more preferably between 80 USGPM and 100 USGPM. In an exemplary embodiment, the fluidization fluid is flowed at a fluidization flow rate of between 59 USGPM and 81 USGPM. The parameters may also include a sensed relative density of the substance inside the interior cavity <b>12</b>, and may have a value of between 1800 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>and 3000 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>corresponding to the threshold value. In some embodiments, the relative density may be of between 2000 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>and 2500 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. In an exemplary embodiment, the relative density is of between 2183 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>and 2423 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Values of some of the above feed characteristics and operating parameters according to some exemplary embodiments are provided at Table 2 of Annex <b>1</b>.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Exemplary Embodiments of Particle Classification Systems</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>8</b></figref>, other exemplary embodiments of the system <b>100</b> will now be described.

The feed preparation circuit <b>4</b> may also include a pump box (not shown) upstream of the classifier <b>10</b>, for example between the overflow outlet of the hindered settler HS and the feeder line <b>14</b> of the classifier <b>10</b>.

The screen S may thus be said to be part of the beneficiation circuit <b>8</b> of the system <b>100</b>. Furthermore, the inclusion of the screen Sat this stage of the system <b>100</b> may palliate a variation in the grade of the feed, i.e., compensate an increase in coarse, low-density particles in the feed upstream of the classifier <b>10</b> by screening off some such coarse, low-density particles from the concentrate downstream of the classifier <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may include more than one classifier <b>10</b>.

Depending on the embodiment, the screen S may comprise two screens. For example, a first screen S1 may be provided, having a first fine particle outlet upstream of the first cyclone C1, and a first coarse particle outlet separate from the first fine particle outlet. A second screen S2 may also be provided further upstream, that is, with a second fine particle outlet of the second screen S2 upstream of the first screen S1, and a second coarse particle outlet separate from the second fine particle outlet. The first and second coarse particle outlets may either be routed for rejection or for beneficiation.

In some embodiments, an additional particle separation device may be provided between the third C3 and second C2 cyclones, for example a magnetic separator MS provided for separating particles based on their magnetic properties. In some such embodiments, the magnetic separator MS may be of a high-intensity type configured for targeting fine particles of paramagnetic ore minerals, such as hematite among others. The magnetic separator MS may thus separate a flow reporting thereto from upstream into downstream flows including a nonmagnetic flow to be routed for rejection and a magnetic concentrate to report further downstream toward the classifier <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, it may be appreciated that the system <b>100</b> may, in some embodiments, include additional devices provided for further processing ore-containing substances otherwise routed for rejection.
