num="0002">The present invention relates to a solid-state battery.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, the demand for batteries has been greatly expanded as power supplies for portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and portable personal computers. In batteries for use in such applications, electrolytes (electrolytic solutions) such as an organic solvent have been conventionally used as media for moving ions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The batteries configured as mentioned above have, however, a risk of leaking the electrolytic solutions, and moreover have the problem with the organic solvent and the like as combustible substances for use in the electrolytic solutions. Thus, the use of solid electrolytes instead of the electrolytic solutions has been proposed. In addition, the development of a sintered-type solid-state secondary battery with a solid electrolyte used as an electrolyte and other constituent elements also composed of solids has been advanced.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known is a technique of adding a carbon material as a conductive additive to a negative electrode layer for a solid-state battery from the viewpoint of improving the electron conductivity (Patent Document 1). In such a technique, however, the carbon material has very low sinterability and inhibits sintering for the negative electrode layer at the time of co-sintering, thus causing the problem of decreasing the utilization factor of the negative electrode active material at the time of charge-discharge.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Attempt have also been made to promote sintering for the electrode layer and improve the utilization factor of the negative electrode active material by using a metal material as a conductive additive (Patent Documents 2 and 3).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Document 1: WO 2019/044901</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Document 2: WO 2019/044902</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent Document 3: Japanese Patent No. 5644951</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The inventors of the present invention have found that in such a conventional technique as mentioned above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, if a negative electrode layer 2&#x2032; includes a spherical conductive additive 200&#x2032; made of a metal material, a conductive path p&#x2032; is broken (n&#x2032;), thereby making a continuous conductive path unlikely to be formed, and thus failing to sufficiently improve the utilization factor of the negative electrode active material at the time of charge-discharge. For this reason, the addition of the conductive additive in a larger amount is required in order to easily form the conductive path, but from the viewpoint of improving the energy density of the solid-state battery, it is not preferable to add the spherical conductive additive in a large amount. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic sectional view of a negative electrode layer in a solid-state battery according to the prior art for describing a conductive path of the negative electrode layer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Under such circumstances, the inventors of the present invention have also found that the problem regarding the utilization factor of the negative electrode active material due to the use of the spherical conductive additive made of a metal material as mentioned above is significant when the negative electrode layer contains a negative electrode active material with a Li/V ratio of 2 or more. It has been determined that the use of the negative electrode active material makes balling of the conductive additive particularly likely to proceed at the time of sintering, thereby making the conductive path p&#x2032; particularly likely to be caused. This is believed to be caused by the relatively low wettability between the negative electrode active material with a Li/V ratio of 2 or more and the conductive additive (in particular, metal powder).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An object of the present invention is to provide a solid-state battery in which the utilization factor of a negative electrode active material at the time of charge-discharge is more sufficiently high if the content of a conductive additive is lower.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, another object of the present invention to provide a solid-state battery in which the utilization factor of a negative electrode active material at the time of charge-discharge is more sufficiently high if the negative electrode layer includes the negative electrode active material with a Li/V ratio of 2 or more and has a lower content of conductive additive.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention relates to: a solid-state battery including a positive electrode layer, a negative electrode layer, and a solid electrolyte layer interposed between the positive electrode layer and the negative electrode layer, where the negative electrode layer includes a conductive additive containing a metal material having an elongated shape in a section view at 7% to 28%in area ratio with respect to the negative electrode layer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As a result of studying approaches for forming an appropriate conductive path in the negative electrode layer with the lower content of the conductive additive, the inventors of the present invention have found the following:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It has been determined that the negative electrode layer includes a conductive additive in an elongated shape in section view, made of a metal material (preferably, the negative electrode layer appropriately orientates, in an in-plane direction, a conductive additive in an elongated shape in section view, made of a metal material), thereby allowing a conductive path to be efficiently formed.

The term &#x201c;solid-state battery&#x201d; as used herein refers in a broad sense to a battery that has constituent elements (in particular, an electrolyte layer) composed of solids, and in a narrow sense to an &#x201c;all-solid-state battery&#x201d; that has constituent elements (in particular, all constituent elements) composed of solids. The &#x201c;solid-state battery&#x201d; as used herein encompasses a so-called &#x201c;secondary battery&#x201d; that can be repeatedly charged and discharged, and a &#x201c;primary battery&#x201d; that can be only discharged. The &#x201c;solid-state battery&#x201d; is preferably a &#x201c;secondary battery&#x201d;. The &#x201c;secondary battery&#x201d; is not to be considered unduly restricted by the name of the secondary battery, which can encompass, for example, an &#x201c;electric storage device&#x201d; and the like.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the solid-state battery according to the present invention includes a positive electrode layer <b>1</b>, a negative electrode layer <b>2</b>, and a solid electrolyte layer <b>3</b>, and typically has a laminated structure composed of the positive electrode layer and the negative electrode layer laminated with the solid electrolyte layer interposed therebetween. Each of the positive electrode layer and the negative electrode layer may have two or more layers laminated as long as a solid electrolyte layer is provided between the positive and negative electrode layers. The solid electrolyte layer in contact with the positive electrode layer and the negative electrode layer is sandwiched therebetween. The positive electrode layer and the solid electrolyte layer may have sintered bodies sintered integrally with each other, and/or the negative electrode layer and the solid electrolyte layer may have sintered bodies sintered integrally with each other. Having sintered bodies sintered integrally with each other means that two or more members (in particular, layers) adjacent to or in contact with each other are joined by sintering. In this case, the two or more members (in particular, layers) may be all sintered bodies integrally sintered. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> are both schematic sectional views of a solid-state battery, schematically illustrating a solid-state battery according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the solid-state battery according to the present invention may further include a positive electrode current-collecting layer <b>11</b>, a negative electrode current-collecting layer <b>21</b>, a positive electrode current collector (not shown), a negative electrode current collector <b>22</b>, electrode separation parts <b>15</b> and <b>25</b>, a protective layer <b>5</b>, and end-surface electrodes <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. The solid-state battery in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is the same as the solid-state battery in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> except that the negative electrode layer <b>2</b> has an end-surface current-collecting structure. As will be described in detail later, the end-surface current-collecting structure of the negative electrode layer <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> refers to a structure electrically connected to the negative electrode terminal <b>20</b> via the negative electrode current collector <b>22</b>, in contact with the negative electrode current collector <b>22</b> at the end surface of the negative electrode layer <b>2</b>. In contrast, in the solid-state battery in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the negative electrode layer <b>2</b> has a main-surface current-collecting structure. As will be described in detail later, the main-surface current-collecting structure of the negative electrode layer <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> refers to a structure electrically connected to the negative electrode terminal <b>20</b> mainly via the negative electrode current-collecting layer <b>21</b>, in contact with the negative electrode current-collecting layer <b>21</b> at the main surface of the negative electrode layer <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">(Negative Electrode Layer)</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The negative electrode layer <b>2</b> includes a conductive additive and a negative electrode active material, and may further contain a solid electrolyte. In the negative electrode layer, each of the conductive additive, the negative electrode active material, and the solid electrolyte preferably has the form of a sintered body. For example, when the negative electrode layer includes a conductive additive, a negative electrode active material, and a solid electrolyte, the negative electrode layer preferably has the form of a sintered body in which the conductive additive, the negative electrode active material particles, and the solid electrolyte are joined to each other by sintering, with the negative electrode active material particles bonded to each other by the conductive additive and the solid electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The negative electrode layer contains, as the conductive additive, a conductive additive in an elongated shape in section view at a content of 7% to 28% in terms of area ratio with respect to the negative electrode layer, and from the viewpoint of further improving the utilization factor of the negative electrode active material, to have a content of preferably 7.5% to 25%, more preferably 10% to 23%, still more preferably 15% to 22%. Particularly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the negative electrode layer <b>2</b> contains a conductive additive <b>200</b> in an elongated shape in section view, thereby allowing a conductive path p to be efficiently formed. Thus, the use of the conductive additive in an elongated shape in section view allows the utilization factor of the negative electrode active material to be increased if the content of the conductive additive is relatively low, and as a result, the increased energy density of the solid-state battery can be achieved. If the content of the conductive additive is excessively low, the utilization factor of the negative electrode active material will be decreased. If the content of the conductive additive is excessively high, the energy density of the solid-state battery will be decreased. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic sectional view of a negative electrode layer for describing a conductive path of a negative electrode layer in a solid-state battery according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The content of the conductive additive in an elongated shape in section view with respect to the total conductive additive is not particularly limited, and is typically 35% or more (particularly 35% to 100%) in terms of area ratio with respect to the total conductive additive, and from the viewpoint of further improving the utilization factor of the negative electrode active material, preferably 50% to 95%, more preferably 70% to 90%.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The value of the area ratio of the conductive additive in an elongated shape in section view is used for the content of the conductive additive in an elongated shape in section view. Particularly, the content of the conductive additive in an elongated shape in section view refers to the value of the area ratio of the conductive additive in an elongated shape in section view, identified in the negative electrode layer of an SEM image (photograph) that shows the laminated structure (sectional structure) of the solid-state battery. More particularly, the content of the conductive additive in an elongated shape in section view is expressed as the average of the values measured at arbitrary ten points, which is expressed as an area ratio with respect to the negative electrode layer (that is, the total area of each field of view in the negative electrode layer) or the area ratio of the conductive additive in an elongated shape in section view with respect to the total conductive additive (that is, the area of the total conductive additive in each field of view).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The conductive additive in an elongated shape in section view means a conductive additive that has an elongated shape in a section view of the negative electrode layer. For example, the conductive additive that has an elongated shape in section view has a shape with a length direction in a section view of the negative electrode layer. The term &#x201c;section view&#x201d; as used herein is based on a form as viewed from a direction substantially perpendicular to a thickness direction based on the direction of laminating respective layers constituting the solid-state battery (to put it briefly, a form in the case of cutting along a face parallel to the thickness direction), and includes a sectional view. In particular, the &#x201c;section view&#x201d; may be based on a form in the case of cutting at a face parallel to the thickness direction based on the direction of laminating respective layers constituting the solid-state battery, which is a face perpendicular to the positive electrode terminal and the negative electrode terminal, and examples thereof include such section views as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>. Accordingly, the &#x201c;SEM image that shows the laminated structure (sectional structure) of the solid-state battery&#x201d; for use in various measurements may be an image based on such a section view as described above.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As a conductive additive that may have an elongated shape in section view, for example, a flattened conductive additive, a fibrous conductive additive, or a mixture thereof is used. In the case of using a simple metal powder as the conductive additive, the metal powder is made into balls (in particular, spheroidized) in the negative electrode layer at the time of sintering, thus making it difficult to obtain a sufficient negative electrode active material utilization factor.

powders observed due to connected parts of the spherical conductive additives.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0330">In addition. Examples 1 to 4 have flattened powder ratios decreased due to pans of the flattened powders made into balls at the time of the sintering.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0331">In Comparative Examples 1 to 3 the utilization factor of the active material of the solid-state battery is shown with the varying content of the spherical conductive additive. U has been determined that in the cell with the spherical conductive additive used, the utilization factor of the active material is significantly decreased as the area ratio of the conductive additive is decreased. This is believed to be because an active material that makes no contribution to charge-discharge is present without electrons supplied, due to the disconnected conductive path of the conductive additive in the negative electrode layer.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0332">In contrast, from Example 1 to 4 it has been determined that containing the flattened powder as the conductive additive allows the reversible capacity lo be maintained at a high level if the content of the conductive additive is decreased. This is believed to be because the use of the flattened powder can prevent bails from being made at the time of the sintering, and because the high ability to form the conductive path makes the conductive path in the negative electrode mixture layer more likely to be connected as compared w ith the same content of the spherical powder</p><p id="p-0342" num="0333">In addition, also in the case of containing the flattened powder, the decreased reversible capacity was observed when the area ratio of the conductive additive was 10%. From the foregoing, it has been determined that when the area ratio of the conductive additive is about 12% or more (in particular 15% or more), a particularly high utilization factor can be achieved,

utilization factor of the active material is significantly decreased by employing the end-surface current-collecting structure in Comparative Example <b>5</b>. This is believed to be because the end-surface current-collecting structure has a need for the conductive path also continuously formed in the in-plane direction, thus making the conductive path very long and making the conductive path more likely to be disconnected.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0352">In contrast, it has been determined that in Example 14, in spite of the use of the same negative electrode layer as m Example <b>2</b>. the utilization factor is maintained at a high level with the end-surface current-collecting structure employed. This is believed to be because the use of the flattened powder further facilitates the formation of the conductive path in the negative electrode layer, and because the orientation of the flattened powder in the in-plane direction facilitates the formation of the conductive path in the in-plane direction.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0353">From Examples 14 to 18, it is determined that the utilization factor of the active-material is changed by changing the proportion of the flattened powder at an orientation angle of 30&#xb0; or less. In particular, with the proportion of the flattened powder at an orientation angle of 30&#xb0; or less in the range of 55% to 75%, a preferred result was obtained with the utilization factor of the active material being 90% or more. This is believed to be because the conductive path in the in-plane direction is Jess likely to be obtained when the degree of orientation is lower, whereas the conductive path in the thickness
