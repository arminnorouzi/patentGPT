Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to tree rigging, more particularly, to rope ring.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although rope rings are made of hard materials, such as steel and aluminum alloys, friction between the ring and a rope passing through the ring causes the ring material to gradually wear away. As the material wears away, the ring becomes thinner and less able to handle the stresses it was designed to handle. Eventually, the ring will reach the point where it will fail.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Wear of a ring is currently determined by comparison or by measurement. One can visually compare the used ring to a new ring of the same type or measure the used ring to determine the amount of wear. However, without knowing how much wear is acceptable, these methods is not accurate.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is a rope ring with a wear indicator. The ring has a body with a perimeter that traces a simple closed curve about an axis, typically a circle, and a coaxial hole. The body has an outer wall, opposed side walls, and a hole wall. The outer wall extends around the outside of the body between the side walls. The side walls are generally flat and perpendicular to the axis. The hole wall curves inwardly from the side walls toward the axis. Typically, the curve is a circular and extending over approximately 125&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The wear indicator is a pair of opposed, mirror-image, annular grooves in the side walls. Each groove is spaced from the hole edge. As the ring wears, the hole diameter increases at points along the circumference, causing those points on the edge of the hole to move outwardly toward the groove. There are two methods by which the groove can indicate maximum wear.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the first method, maximum wear occurs when the hole wall edge forms an indentation in the groove. The only parameter affected is the groove spacing, which is set at under the maximum amount of wear by an amount that is visible to the naked eye.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the second method, maximum wear occurs when the hole wall edge severs the groove at one or more points on the groove. The maximum amount of wear is the groove spacing plus the groove width.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Optionally, the groove is filled with a coloring agent to provide greater visibility to the wear indicator. The coloring agent is a material that will completely fill and be retained in the groove. Contemplated materials include enamel paint, epoxy paint, and plastic.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Objects of the present invention will become apparent in light of the following drawings and detailed description of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For a fuller understanding of the nature and object of the present invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a rope ring of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of the rope ring of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the rope ring taken at A-A;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a detailed view from the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a detailed view of one configuration of the wear indicator;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a partial side view of a configuration of the wear indicator with the ring showing wear;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a detailed view of another configuration of the wear indicator; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a partial side view of another configuration of the wear indicator with the ring showing wear.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is a rope ring <b>10</b> with a wear indicator <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The ring <b>10</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, has a body <b>20</b> with a perimeter that traces a simple closed curve, such as a circle, oval, ellipse, or D, about an axis <b>28</b>. A hole <b>22</b> extends coaxially through the body <b>20</b>. In the illustrated configuration, the body <b>20</b> is circular and the hole <b>22</b> is circular.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For the typical ring <b>10</b>, the body <b>20</b> has a diameter <b>40</b> between 26 mm and 40 mm and a thickness <b>44</b> between 10 mm and 13 mm. The diameter <b>42</b> of the hole <b>22</b> is the body diameter <b>40</b> minus twice the thickness <b>44</b>. The side-to-side dimension <b>46</b> of the body <b>20</b> is between 10 mm and 13 mm.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the body <b>20</b> has an outer wall <b>30</b>, opposed side walls <b>32</b>, and a hole wall <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The outer wall <b>30</b> extends around the outside of the body <b>20</b> between the side walls <b>32</b>. The cross-sectional shape of the outer wall <b>30</b> is not important to the present invention. The shape can be round, oval, or another curve or combination thereof. In the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the outer wall <b>30</b> has a flattened distal surface <b>48</b> with a concavely curved surface <b>50</b> on each side of the distal surface <b>48</b> extending to the side walls <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The side walls <b>32</b> as illustrated are generally flat and perpendicular to the axis <b>28</b>. The present invention contemplates that the side walls <b>32</b> do not have to be flat but can be curved.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the hole wall <b>34</b> curves inwardly from the side walls <b>32</b> toward the axis <b>28</b> of the hole <b>22</b> so as to eliminate any sharp edges that can damage a rope passing through the hole <b>22</b>. Typically, the hole wall <b>34</b> is a circular curve extending over an arc <b>38</b> of approximately 110&#xb0; to 190&#xb0;, with the illustrated design being approximately 125&#xb0;. However, the present invention contemplates any shape to the curve, such as parabolic, so that there are no sharp edges. Optionally, the hole wall <b>34</b> has a discontinuous edge <b>36</b> where the hole wall <b>34</b> meets the side wall <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention contemplates that the ring <b>10</b> can be composed of any rigid, robust material. A non-exhaustive list of examples includes metal alloys such as steel and aluminum alloys, hard plastics, rubber, and carbon composites. A preferred material is 7075 aluminum alloy. A less robust material can be used if the ring <b>10</b> is designed to accommodate a lesser amount of stress.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The wear indicator <b>24</b> includes a pair of opposed, mirror-image, annular grooves <b>52</b> in the side walls <b>32</b> of the body <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, each groove <b>52</b> is optionally spaced a distance <b>54</b> from the hole edge <b>36</b>, the groove spacing, as described below. The cross-section of the groove <b>52</b> is preferably, though not necessarily, curved. The curve is typically circular, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, but can be another curved shape, such as parabolic or oval. The groove <b>52</b> in the current design has a width <b>56</b> in the range of from 0.5 mm to 2 mm. The actual width <b>56</b> depends on the particular application, as discussed below. The groove <b>52</b> extends over an arc <b>60</b> of up to 180&#xb0;, with illustrated design being about 150&#xb0;. The depth <b>58</b> of the groove <b>52</b> is in the range of from 0.5 mm to 2 mm. The depth <b>58</b> is only important in that the groove <b>52</b> needs to be deep enough to be visible.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As the ring <b>10</b> wears, the diameter <b>42</b> of the hole <b>22</b> increases in one or more points along the hole edges <b>36</b>, causing those points on the edges <b>36</b> of the hole <b>22</b> to move outwardly toward the grooves <b>52</b>. There are two methods by which the grooves <b>52</b> can indicate maximum wear. The method of wear indication being employed determines and position and parameters of the grooves <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the first method of indicating maximum wear, maximum wear occurs when either of the hole wall edges <b>36</b> reaches into the corresponding groove <b>52</b>, as at <b>80</b>, and is indicated by an indentation <b>82</b> in the groove <b>52</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In other words, wear forms narrower sections of the groove <b>52</b>, so the width <b>56</b> of the groove <b>52</b> is no longer constant around its circumference. The only parameter affected is the groove spacing <b>54</b>, which is set at under the maximum amount of wear by an amount that is visible to the naked eye. For example, if the maximum amount of wear is 5 mm, the groove spacing <b>55</b> can be set at 4 mm so that, when a 1 mm indentation is visible, maximum wear has been reached. The larger the groove spacing <b>54</b>, the more wear will occur before being visible on the groove <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the second method, maximum wear occurs when the one of the hole wall edges <b>36</b> passes completely across the corresponding groove <b>52</b> at one or more points <b>86</b> on the circumference, as at <b>84</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, so that the groove <b>52</b> no longer exists at the points <b>86</b>. In other words, maximum wear is indicated when either groove <b>52</b> is severed at one or more points <b>86</b> on the circumference of the groove <b>52</b>. Both the groove spacing <b>54</b> and groove width <b>56</b> are affected. The maximum amount of wear is the groove spacing <b>54</b> plus the groove width <b>56</b>. The larger the groove spacing <b>54</b> and/or groove width <b>56</b>, the more wear will occur before the groove <b>52</b> is severed. When using this method, it is contemplated that the groove spacing <b>54</b> can be as little as zero, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, where the hole edge <b>36</b> is the edge of the groove <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Optionally, the grooves <b>52</b> are filled with a coloring agent <b>70</b>. The coloring agent <b>70</b> gives greater visibility to the wear indicator <b>24</b>. The coloring agent <b>70</b> is preferably of a color that contrasts with the color of the body <b>20</b> so that it is clearly visible when the ring <b>10</b> wears to the groove <b>52</b>. An example color is red.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The coloring agent <b>70</b> is a material that will completely fill the groove <b>52</b> and be retained in the groove <b>52</b> without coming out during the life of the ring <b>10</b>. Preferably, the color agent material will wear smoothly rather than crack or chip. Contemplated materials include enamel paint, epoxy paint, and plastic. A preferred material is alkyd gloss enamel. Optionally, the floor <b>62</b> of the groove <b>52</b> is textured to help retain the coloring agent <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, it has been shown and described a rope ring with a wear indicator. Since certain changes may be made in the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the present invention, it is intended that all matter described in the foregoing specification and shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
