Applications of a V2X system include a vehicle to vehicle (V2V) application, a vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) application, a vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) application, a vehicle to network (V2N) application, and the like. The applications of the V2X system will improve driving safety, reduce congestion, reduce vehicle energy consumption, improve traffic efficiency, and provide in-vehicle infotainment information. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) formulates a related communication standard for V2X in a long term evolution (LTE) system. V2X is also a hot topic for discussion in a new radio (NR) system. NR-V2X needs to support a more complex scenario, for example, a unicast scenario, a broadcast scenario, or a multicast scenario. With expansion of application scenarios and an increasing service requirement, there is a high requirement for reducing power consumption of a device in V2X and improving communication reliability.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This application provides a sidelink communication method and a communication apparatus, to reduce power consumption of a terminal device and improve communication reliability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect, a sidelink communication method is provided. The method may be performed by a first terminal device or a module (for example, a chip) configured on (or used in) the first terminal device. The following describes the method by using an example in which the method is performed by the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The method includes: The first terminal device determines one or more pieces of first configuration information, where the one or more pieces of first configuration information correspond to one or more sidelinks, each piece of the first configuration information is used to configure a discontinuous reception DRX related parameter of a corresponding sidelink, and the first terminal device is a sending device or a receiving device on the one or more sidelinks. The first terminal device maintains, based on each piece of the first configuration information, a status of the discontinuous reception DRX corresponding to each piece of the first configuration information.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the foregoing solution, when pieces of DRX are configured for a plurality of sidelinks of the terminal device, the terminal device maintains DRX of each sidelink based on configuration information corresponding to the sidelink. This can avoid a communication failure caused by obfuscation of a plurality of pieces of maintained DRX, reduce power consumption, and ensure communication reliability.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, that the first terminal device determines one or more pieces of configuration information includes: The first terminal device determines, based on a first message of each of the one or more sidelinks, the first configuration information corresponding to each sidelink, where the first message of each sidelink includes the first configuration information corresponding to each sidelink. For example, the first message is received by the first terminal device from at least one of the following devices: a sending device on each sidelink, a receiving device on each sidelink, or a network device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, that the first terminal device determines one or more pieces of configuration information includes: The first terminal device determines, based on system pre-configuration information of the first terminal device, the one or more pieces of first configuration information.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the first configuration information includes one or more of the following parameters:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a first cycle of the DRX;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a second cycle of the DRX, where the second cycle is less than the first cycle;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a start time offset of the DRX;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a parameter of a first timer, where the parameter of the first timer indicates DRX active duration in each cycle;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">a parameter of a second timer, where the parameter of the second timer indicates duration in which the receiving device stops receiving transmission of a HARQ process after receiving sidelink control information SCI for scheduling scheduled data of the HARQ process;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">a parameter of a third timer, where the parameter of the third timer indicates maximum DRX active duration of the receiving device for receiving SCI for scheduling retransmitted data of a HARQ process;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">a parameter of a fourth timer, where the parameter of the fourth timer indicates duration in which the receiving device stays in DRX active time after receiving SCI for scheduling newly transmitted data; or</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a parameter of a fifth timer, where the parameter of the fifth timer indicates duration of the DRX in a second cycle.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the foregoing solution, DRX of each sidelink is configured based on configuration information of the DRX corresponding to the sidelink, so that the terminal device maintains the DRX of the corresponding sidelink based on the configuration information of the DRX.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the method further includes: When DRX corresponding to one of the one or more sidelinks applies the first cycle, the first terminal device starts or restarts, based on the first cycle and/or a start time offset of the DRX corresponding to the sidelink, a first timer of the DRX corresponding to the sidelink; or when DRX corresponding to one of the one or more sidelinks applies the second cycle, the first terminal device starts or restarts, based on the second cycle and/or a start time offset of the DRX corresponding to the sidelink, a first timer of the DRX corresponding to the sidelink.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the foregoing solution, the first timer is started at start time of a DRX cycle corresponding to each link, and DRX corresponding to the sidelink is in an active state in a period in which the first timer runs. That is, the power consumption of the terminal device can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the method further includes: After the first terminal device sends or receives first sidelink control information SCI in DRX active time of the sidelink of the one or more sidelinks, the first terminal device starts or restarts a second timer corresponding to a first HARQ process, and/or stops a third timer corresponding to the first HARQ process. For example, the first SCI is used to schedule newly transmitted data or retransmitted data of the sidelink, and the first HARQ process is a HARQ process used by the first terminal device to process the newly transmitted data or the retransmitted data. In a period in which the third timer runs, a receiving device of the sidelink stops receiving data of the first HARQ process.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the foregoing solution, after receiving or sending the SCI for scheduling the data (the retransmitted data or the newly transmitted data), the terminal device starts the second timer, and the receiving device stops receiving the data of the first HARQ process in the period in which the third timer runs. In this way, the power consumption of the terminal device can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the method further includes: After the second timer corresponding to the first HARQ process expires, the first terminal device starts or restarts the third timer corresponding to the first HARQ process. The first terminal device receives or sends the data of the first HARQ process in the period in which the third timer runs.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the first terminal device is a receiving device of the sidelink, and that the first terminal device starts or restarts the third timer corresponding to the first HARQ process includes: When the first terminal device fails to decode data of the first HARQ process, the first terminal device starts or restarts the third timer corresponding to the first HARQ process.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the foregoing solution, if the terminal device does not successfully decode the data of the first HARQ process in a period in which the second timer runs, the terminal device starts the third timer after the second timer expires, to receive the retransmitted data of the first HARQ process. This provides a possibility of successfully decoding the data of the first HARQ process, and the communication reliability can be improved.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the method further includes: After the first terminal device sends or receives second SCI in the DRX active time of the sidelink of the one or more sidelinks, the first terminal device starts a fourth timer corresponding to the sidelink. For example, the second SCI is used to schedule the newly transmitted data of the sidelink. In a period in which the fourth timer runs, the DRX of the sidelink is in the active state.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the method further includes: After the fourth timer corresponding to the sidelink of the one or more sidelinks expires, or after the first terminal device sends or receives third information of the sidelink corresponding to the DRX, if first configuration information corresponding to the sidelink includes the second cycle of the DRX, the first terminal device starts a DRX operation in the second cycle of the sidelink, and starts or restarts a fifth timer corresponding to the sidelink; or if first configuration information corresponding to the sidelink does not include the second cycle, the first terminal device starts a DRX operation in the first cycle of the sidelink. For example, the third information indicates to stop the first timer and/or the fourth timer.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the foregoing solution, a periodic DRX operation is resumed on the sidelink after the fourth timer expires. If a DRX operation with a short periodicity (namely, the second cycle) is configured, the first terminal device starts the DRX operation with a short periodicity. In this way, the power consumption of the terminal device can be reduced, and the communication reliability can be improved.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the method further includes: If the fifth timer corresponding to the sidelink expires, the first terminal device starts the DRX operation in the first cycle corresponding to the sidelink.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the method further includes: After the first terminal device sends or receives first information in the sidelink of the one or more sidelinks, the first terminal device starts the DRX operation in the first cycle corresponding to the sidelink, where the first information indicates that the first terminal device starts the DRX operation in the first cycle.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the method further includes: After the first terminal device sends or receives second information in the sidelink of the one or more sidelinks, the first terminal device starts the DRX operation in the second cycle corresponding to the sidelink, where the second information indicates that the first terminal device starts the DRX operation in the second cycle.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the foregoing solution, after the terminal device stops the active state of the DRX of the sidelink based on an indication of the information, the terminal device continues to perform the DRX operation according to a corresponding rule, so that the power consumption of the terminal device can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the method further includes: When the first terminal device sends or receives at least one of the first information, the second information, or the third information in the sidelink of the one or more sidelinks, the first terminal device stops the first timer and/or the fourth timer.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the foregoing solution, the first timer and/or the fourth timer are/is stopped based on an indication of the information, that is, the DRX of the sidelink enters an inactive state. For example, when no data needs to be sent, the receiving device may be notified of disabling receiving. However, this application is not limited thereto. In this way, the power consumption of the terminal device can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the method further includes: The receiving device of the sidelink is in the DRX active time in one or more of the following cases:</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">in a period in which the first timer corresponding to the sidelink runs;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">in a period in which the fourth timer corresponding to the sidelink runs;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">in a period in which a third timer corresponding to at least one HARQ process in the sidelink runs; or</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">in a time domain range of a configured grant resource of the sidelink.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the foregoing solution, the receiving device and a sending device of the sidelink reach a consensus on the DRX active time of the sidelink, and send or receive data in the DRX active time, so that the communication reliability can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the method further includes: When the first terminal device sends or receives first data on the configured grant resource, the first terminal device starts a third timer corresponding to a second HARQ process, where the first data is data of the second HARQ process in the sidelink.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the first terminal device is a sending device on the one or more sidelinks, and the method further includes: The first terminal device determines a first resource. The first terminal device determines a second terminal device in the receiving device on the one or more sidelinks, where DRX active time of the second terminal device partially or completely overlaps the first resource in time domain. The first terminal device sends data to the second terminal device on the first resource.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference to the first aspect, in some implementations of the first aspect, the first resource is a resource granted by the network device to the first terminal device for sending sidelink data, or the first resource is a resource obtained by the first terminal device from a sidelink resource used for contention.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to the foregoing solution, the terminal device determines the receiving device based on the resource obtained through contention or the resource granted by the network device to the terminal device, where the DRX active time of the receiving device partially or completely overlaps the resource in the time domain. In this way, resource utilization can be improved, and the communication reliability can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to a second aspect, a sidelink communication method is provided.

Broadcast or Multicast Communication Mode of a Sidelink</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Broadcast or multicast means that broadcast or multicast data sent by a sending device can be received by one or more terminal devices. For example, a destination layer-2 identifier (Destination Layer-2 ID) used when service data is transmitted on a PC5 interface is predefined. When the broadcast service data is to be sent, the sending device may directly send the broadcast service data by using a user plane protocol stack, and add the Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to the broadcast service to a media access control (MAC) layer and/or a physical layer (PHY) layer. A terminal device interested in the broadcast service may monitor, at the PHY layer, whether there is service data of the Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to the broadcast service, and perform receiving and parsing. However, this application is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">2. Unicast Communication Mode of a Sidelink</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Unicast is a one-to-one communication mode of terminal devices. A sending device indicates, based on a destination address, a receiving device of unicast data sent by the sending device. The receiving device determines, based on the destination address of the unicast data, whether the unicast data is unicast data sent to the receiving device, and determines, based on a source address of the unicast data, a specific device that sends the unicast data. Optionally, two terminal devices may establish a unicast connection between the two devices by using signaling exchange, and unicast communication may be performed after the unicast connection is established.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">3. Sidelink Transmission Mode 1 (Mode 1)</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">A sidelink mode 1 means that a terminal device determines, based on a sidelink grant sent by a network device, a resource used to send sidelink data. The sidelink grant is used to grant the terminal device a dedicated resource for sending the sidelink data. For example, before sending the sidelink data, the terminal device reports a buffer status report (BSR) to the network device, to notify the network device of an amount of data to be sent. The network device grants a corresponding resource to the terminal device based on the amount of data reported by the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">4. Sidelink Transmission Mode 2 (Mode 2)</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">A sidelink mode 2 means that a network device pre-allocates resources used for a sidelink, and a plurality of terminal devices may contend for a resource in the resources used for the sidelink. When obtaining the resource through contention, the terminal device may send data of the sidelink on the resource obtained through contention. For example, the terminal device selects an unoccupied resource for transmission by measuring whether each time-frequency resource in the resources used for the sidelink is occupied. However, this application is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">The following describes in detail a sidelink communication method provided in embodiments of this application with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a sidelink communication method according to an embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">S<b>210</b>: A first terminal device determines one or more pieces of first configuration information.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">The one or more pieces of the first configuration information correspond to one or more sidelinks, and each piece of the first configuration information is used to configure a discontinuous reception (DRX) related parameter of a corresponding sidelink. The first terminal device performs a DRX operation on the one or more sidelinks, and maintains a status of one or more pieces of DRX. The one or more pieces of DRX are in one-to-one correspondence with the one or more sidelinks, and one sidelink includes one sending device and one receiving device. An identifier of a receiving device and an identifier of a sending device may be used to uniquely identify a sidelink. In other words, the sidelink may be determined based on the identifier of the receiving device and the identifier of the sending device.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Optionally, the identifier of the receiving device and/or the identifier of the sending device may be a layer 2 identifier or a layer 1 identifier. The sending device may identify the receiving device based on a layer 2 identifier or a layer 1 identifier of the receiving device, and the receiving device may identify the sending device based on a layer 2 identifier or a layer 1 identifier of the sending device. The identifier of the sending device and the identifier of the receiving device may be used to identify the sidelink. A sidelink on which the DRX operation is performed may also be referred to as a DRX device group or a DRX device pair.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Optionally, a sidelink type may be identified based on a communication type (for example, may be written as cast-type), and the communication type may include broadcast, multicast, and unicast.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">For example, for broadcast or multicast, a cast-type and an identifier of a sending device may identify sidelinks between the sending device and a plurality of receiving devices for broadcast or multicast. Alternatively, a cast-type and an identifier of a receiving device may identify one sidelink between the receiving device and a sending device for broadcast or multicast. Alternatively, a cast-type, an identifier of a sending device and an identifier of a receiving device may identify one sidelink between the receiving device and the sending device.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The first terminal device may be a sending device in one of the one or more pieces of DRX, or may be a receiving device in one of the one or more pieces of DRX.

In other words, the network device may configure the configuration information of the DRX for the receiving device in the DRX and/or the sending device in the DRX. The message C may be an RRC message or a system message sent by the network device to the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">In another implementation, system pre-configuration information of the first terminal device includes configuration information of the DRX of the one or more sidelinks.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">For example, system pre-configuration information of each terminal device has a set of configuration information of DRX of a sidelink. When each terminal device needs to perform a DRX operation, the terminal device maintains a status of DRX based on the configuration information of DRX of a sidelink preconfigured by the system. That is, the configuration information of the one or more pieces of DRX is the same. However, this application is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">S<b>220</b>: The first terminal device maintains, based on each piece of the first configuration information, a status of the discontinuous reception DRX corresponding to each piece of the first configuration information.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">The first configuration information includes one or more of the following parameters:</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">a first cycle of the DRX;</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">a second cycle of the DRX, where the second cycle is less than the first cycle;</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">a start time offset of the DRX;</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">a parameter of a first timer, where the parameter of the first timer indicates DRX active time in each DRX cycle;</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">a parameter of a second timer, where the parameter of the second timer indicates duration in which a receiving device stops receiving transmission of a HARQ process after receiving sidelink control information SCI for scheduling scheduled data of the HARQ process;</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">a parameter of a third timer, where the parameter of the third timer indicates maximum DRX active duration of a receiving device for receiving SCI for scheduling retransmitted data of a HARQ process;</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">a parameter of a fourth timer, where the parameter of the fourth timer indicates duration in which a receiving device stays in DRX active time after receiving SCI for scheduling newly transmitted data; or</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">a parameter of a fifth timer, where the parameter of the fifth timer indicates duration of the DRX in a second cycle.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">The first terminal device may determine start time of a DRX cycle based on a cycle and/or a start time offset of each piece of DRX, where the time offset may include a start offset and/or a slot offset.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">When DRX corresponding to one of the one or more sidelinks applies the first cycle, the first terminal device determines, based on the first cycle and/or a start time offset of the DRX corresponding to the sidelink, start time of a DRX cycle, and starts or restarts a first timer of the DRX corresponding to the sidelink.

The first terminal device is a sending device in the first DRX. The first terminal device may send data to the second terminal device in a period in which the first timer A runs. In other words, the first terminal device may send, in the period in which the first timer A runs, the data that is on the sidelink and that corresponds to the first DRX.

Optionally, first configuration information corresponding to the sidelink may include the maximum times or the maximum time. Alternatively, the maximum times or the maximum time is explicitly or implicitly configured in the SCI by the sending device. If the sending device does not support automatic retransmission of configured grant data, the receiving device releases the HARQ process 1 after the third timer expires.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0207">If the terminal device A feeds back an ACK, in other words, the terminal devices successfully decodes the newly transmitted data or the retransmitted data scheduled by using the first SCI, after the second timer of the HARQ process 1 expires, the terminal device A does not start or restart the third timer of the HARQ process 1, releases the HARQ process 1, and simultaneously stops the second timer and/or the third timer associated with the HARQ process, so that the HARQ process 1 becomes an empty process and may be used to process other received data.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0208">Optionally, if the first SCI schedules newly transmitted data, the terminal device A and the terminal device B start a fourth timer corresponding to the second DRX.
