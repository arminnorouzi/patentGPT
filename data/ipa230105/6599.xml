The following further relates to a respective computer program for providing protection of a converter of a wind turbine.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Variable speed wind turbines comprise a generator that converts mechanical power provided by the rotating shaft of the wind turbine into electrical power, the frequency of which is adjusted to the grid frequency by means of a power converter (abbreviated as &#x2018;converter&#x2019; herein). For example, wind turbines can be equipped with a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The stator of such DFIG is connected to the grid without any intervening frequency converter (it is generally coupled to the grid via a transformer), whereas the rotor of the DFIG is connected to the grid via the power converter. Such configuration has several benefits. Only a fraction of the produced electrical power needs to be handled by the power converter, thus reducing its size and costs. Also, the generator itself is generally more cost-efficient than a permanent magnet generator (PMG) used in a full converter topology in which the power converter manages the total active power generated by the wind turbine and thus acts as an interface between the generator and the grid. On the other hand, in the DFIG configuration, the stator of the generator is connected to the grid and therefore experiences any transients present on the grid, in particular transients resulting from faults on the grid. Such transients can cause large overcurrents in the generator and, in particular as a consequence of the inductive behavior of the generator, can damage the power converter coupled to the rotor of the generator. In full converter topologies, such transients are only experienced at the grid side of the power converter, but are not transmitted to the generator.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The grid transients can cause overcurrents inside the power converter than can damage components of the power converter, in particular semiconductor components such as semiconductor switches provided for rectification and inversion of the electrical power. To avoid damage to semiconductor components, they can be equipped with an internal temperature sensor to measure the junction temperature of the semiconductor component. The measured junction temperature is however only valid for stationary operation, since the temperature measurement has a relatively slow response time. Accordingly, when a hard transient occurs on the grid, the resulting overcurrent can cause a significant increase of the junction temperature that goes undetected and may cause destruction of the semiconductor component. The power converter may thus be damaged and operation of the wind turbine may have to be stopped.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Effective protection strategies are difficult to implement for such situations, since the converter rotor currents can exceed the operational range of current sensors significantly. The operating range of the current sensors cannot be extended indefinitely, due to the loss in measurement accuracy at stationary conditions which is required to achieve a good converter control performance. As the converter rotor currents can exceed the nominal semiconductor currents and current sensor operational ranges during several milliseconds during a transient, the respective current measurements are generally not suitable for implementing an efficient protection strategy for protecting the semiconductors from overloading.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, it is generally desirable in DFIG systems to increase the power produced, resulting in an increase of converter and generator currents. Such tendency makes the above outlined problems even more prominent. It is therefore desirable to device an improved protection strategy for protecting a converter of such wind turbine. In particular, it is desirable to prevent that semiconductor components of such converter are damaged due to transients occurring on the power grid, in particular in a DFIG configuration. It is also desirable that when providing such efficient protection, the output power of the wind turbine can still be maintained at a relatively high level.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is accordingly a need to mitigate at least some of the drawbacks mentioned above. In particular, there is a need to improve the protection of a converter from overcurrents that are caused by transients occurring on the power grid.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the invention, a method of protecting a converter of a wind turbine is provided. The converter is coupled to a generator of the wind turbine to perform a conversion of electrical power produced by the generator. The converter comprises plural semiconductor components that are operational to provide the conversion of the electrical power. The method comprises performing a (iteration) step of estimating a junction temperature of at least one of the semiconductor components. The estimating step is performed by determining a current in the converter that is associated with power loss in one or more of the plural semiconductor components; estimating power loss associated with the one or more semiconductor components based on the determined current and on the state of the one or more semiconductor components; and using a thermal model of the one or more semiconductor components to estimate the junction temperature of at least one of the one or more semiconductor components based on the estimated power loss. The (iteration) step of estimating the junction temperature is repeatedly performed. A time period corresponding to a step size between subsequent steps of estimating the junction temperature is smaller than 1/10 of the period of an AC voltage output by the converter. The method further comprises triggering a protection mechanism that is configured to reduce the junction temperature of the at least one semiconductor component if the estimated junction temperature exceeds a predetermined temperature threshold.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">By means of such method, the junction temperature may be estimated significantly faster than what is achievable by conventional temperature sensors. It may essentially be estimated in real-time. Furthermore, due to the small step size of the estimating step, the alternating currents can be regarded as constant over the time period corresponding to the step size, thus significantly facilitating the estimation of the junction temperature. A real-time estimation of the junction temperature of one or more semiconductor components of the converter of the wind turbine thus becomes possible.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The power loss associated with the one or more semiconductor components generally relates to the power dissipation in the respective semiconductor component, i.e. to the conduction losses and the switching losses occurring in the semiconductor component. Correspondingly, the state of the one or more semiconductor components refers to the switching state, i.e. it may indicate the presence of an off state (blocking state) for a certain time period, the presence of an on state (conducting state) for a certain time period, a switching from on-state to an off-state, a switching from an off-state to an on-state, or any combination thereof, as generally occurring when operating a respective converter having power electronic components for providing controlled rectification or inversion of electrical power.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The one or more semiconductor components may form part of a generator side converter stage of the converter that may in particular be connected to a rotor of the generator. The junction temperature may be estimated for each of the semiconductor components of the rotor side converter stage.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The converter is a three-phase converter and the generator is a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The input of the converter may be connected to a rotor of the doubly fed induction generator.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The determining of a current in the converter comprises the determining of an operating current in the converter that is indicative of the current through the at least one semiconductor component. The operating current of the converter may be measured if the operating current lies within a working range of a respective current sensor and the operating current may be estimated based on operational parameters of the converter if the operating current lies outside the working range of the current sensor. In particular, for a three-phase converter, a respective current sensor may be provided for each phase of the converter, in particular for each phase of a generator side converter stage of the converter that is connected to a rotor of the generator. The current (rotor current) may thus be measured for a respective phase at the generator side input of the converter. The input for the respective phase may then be connected to a respective converter leg of the generator side converter stage in each of which one or more of the semiconductor components are connected. The operating current may thus be (substantially) equal to the current through the respective semiconductor component.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">By such configuration, it can be ensured that the operating current for estimating the junction temperature of the semiconductor component is available even though the operating current may be outside of a range of the respective current sensor. Accordingly, if a transient occurs on the power grid, resulting in an overcurrent in the rotor of the generator, the respective current that is experienced by the power converter can still be obtained (although the sensor is out of range). Also in such situations, a reliable estimation of the junction temperature of the semiconductor component becomes possible and a respective protection mechanism can be activated.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the converter is a three-phase converter having a grid side converter stage (generally operating as an inverter) and a generator side converter stage (generally operating as a rectifier). If the operating current for one phase of the generator side converter stage lies outside the working range of the respective current sensor, the operating current is estimated from the operating current that is measured for each of the other two phases of the generator side converter stage, i.e., the operational parameters of the converter from which the current lying outside the sensor range is estimated include the operating currents measured for the other two phases.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">If the operating currents for two phases of the generator side converter stage lie outside the working range of the respective current sensors, then the operating current for at least one of these two phases is estimated based on a current on a DC-link of the converter, in particular based on a current balance on the DC-link of the converter. In particular, in-flowing and out-flowing currents on the DC-link may be considered in order to estimate the operating current for one of the two phases. The larger of the two unknown currents is estimated based on the current balance on the DC-link. The estimation may be based on Kirchhoff s law. For example, if the largest unknown current is in-flowing into one node of the DC-link, all out-flowing currents from that node of the DC-link can be used to estimate the unknown largest current, which may involve respective grid voltage and current measurements as well as DC-link voltage measurements.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In particular, if the operating currents for two phases of the generator side converter stage lie outside the working range of the respective current sensors, the operating current may be estimated for the phase for which the operating current is the largest of the three phases. This may for example be known from the direction of the current that is within range of the respective current sensor, wherein the largest current is the current having the opposite sign. Estimating the largest operating current based on a current on the DC-link of the converter may include determining a current towards a DC-link capacitor of the DC-link, determining a current towards the grid side converter stage and possibly, if present, determining a current through a chopper stage of the converter. It should be clear that the respective estimation can be made for either direction of the current flow, i.e., into or out of the respective converter input for the respective phase.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The operational parameters of the converter for determining said largest operating current may include the DC-link voltage, a capacitance value of the DC-link capacitor, a chopper resistance of the chopper stage, an on/off state of the chopper stage; as well as voltage and current on the grid side of the converter, e.g., at the converter output connected to the power grid. For example, the current towards the DC-link capacitor may be determined based on a fixed capacitance value and a continuous measurement of the DC-link voltage. The current can be determined proportionally to the voltage change and capacitance. The current through the chopper stage may be determined from the DC-link voltage measurements, the chopper on/off state and a value of the chopper resistance. The current towards the grid side converter stage of the converter may be determined from the active grid power, in particular from the voltage and current measurements on the output of the grid side converter stage.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Based on the above-mentioned operational parameters of the converter, it thus becomes possible to efficiently and reliably determine the largest current at the input to the grid side converter stage even though it may exceed the operational range of the current sensor significantly. As the respective current is the most important current in view of the increase of the junction temperature of the semiconductor components, its determination allows an efficient protection of the respective semiconductor components by estimation of the junction temperature as outlined above and further below. From the measured current for one phase and the determined largest current for a second phase, the current present in the third phase, which is also out of range, can be obtained. The third current can be obtained from a simple current balance, since the three-phases of the rotor are generally delta connected. In this respect, it is noted that a situation in which the currents for all three-phases are out of the sensor range does generally not occur. First, the current sensor range extends up to significant values, such as 5,000 amperes or 7,000 amperes, so that for all three currents to be outside the range, the largest current would need to exceed 14,000 amperes. Other protection mechanisms will generally be triggered in such situation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, the step size between subsequent steps of estimating the junction temperature corresponds to a time period smaller than 2 ms (milliseconds) or 1 ms, desirably smaller than 500 &#x3bc;s (microseconds), more desirably smaller than 200 &#x3bc;s. For example, the time period may lie in a range between 20 and 200 &#x3bc;s, in particular between 50 and 150 &#x3bc;s. For example, the time period may be about 100 &#x3bc;s, such as 80, 90, 100, 110 or 120 &#x3bc;s. By using such time period as the step size, a real-time estimation of the junction temperature becomes possible. Further, as outlined above, the AC-currents can be regarded as constant over such time periods, which simplifies junction temperature estimation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The power loss associated with the semiconductor component may be dependent on the junction temperature of the semiconductor component. When estimating the power loss associated with the one or more semiconductor components, a junction temperature determined in a preceding step of estimating the junction temperature may be employed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Generally, the estimation of the junction temperature may be performed iteratively, and the junction temperature estimated in a preceding estimation step may be employed in the current estimating step. The estimation may be initialized by using an ambient temperature as an initial value of the junction temperature, or by using a predetermined (e.g. 25&#xb0; C.) or a typical average operating temperature value. When operating under normal conditions, the estimation of the junction temperature will converge within a short period of time and provide thereafter a real-time estimation of the junction temperature of the one or more semiconductor components.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Estimating the power loss associated with the one or more semiconductor components may comprise determining one or more operating states of the one or more semiconductor components during the time period and determining the power loss from the power loss associated with each of the one or more operating states of the one or more semiconductor components during the time period. For example, a semiconductor switch, such as an IGBT, may have switching losses when turning on and turning off the semiconductor switch, and may have further conduction losses when the semiconductor switch is in an on-state and conducting current. Blocking losses are generally low and thus do not need to be considered. A diode may for example have a conducting state and a blocking state, and again, blocking losses are relatively low and do not need to be considered.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">By considering the semiconductor states, and in particular the switching losses and the conduction losses, in accordance with the duty cycle, a precise estimation of the power losses associated with the one or more semiconductor components can be obtained. The switching losses and the conduction losses can be precisely estimated. The estimation may be performed individually for each semiconductor component (based on the individual operating states and current during the time period), or an overall estimation of the total power loss associated with all semiconductor components may be made. Such estimation may be made by employing the current for each phase leg of the respective converter stage, for example by separately considering the currents in the three legs, one for each phase, of the rotor side converter stage.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">To facilitate the determination, only the largest current may be considered, and the estimation may be made only on the basis of the largest current, for example for the respective phase leg of the converter stage, or for all phase legs of the converter stage. Simplification of the estimation of the power losses can thus be achieved, thus reducing the computational effort required for a real-time determination of the junction temperature. For example, the power losses may be estimated independently for the rotor side converter stage of the converter. An overall estimation of the switching losses for the rotor side converter stage may be based on the number of semiconductor components, the number of switching events (turn-ons and turn-offs of all devices), the DC-link voltage, and the largest current input to the rotor side converter stage. The respective switching loss determined as an overall value for all semiconductor components may then be assigned to each semiconductor component (i.e., the respective fraction of the overall switching loss). A simple and efficient method of estimating the switching losses may thus be achieved.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Similarly, for the conduction losses, the overall conduction losses for the rotor side converter stage may be determined based on the largest current input into the rotor side converter stage (which, as mentioned above, may be an in-flowing or out-flowing current). The conduction losses can then again be assigned to each semiconductor component.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">However, it is desired that for each semiconductor component, the individual current through it and its switching state are considered individually and separate from the other semiconductor components, so that the switching losses and power losses for each semiconductor component can be determined very precisely.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment, the at least one semiconductor component comprises or is a semiconductor switch, in particular an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), wherein the power losses include at least switching losses and conduction losses of the semiconductor switch during the time period. The junction temperature may also be determined for a diode, or for each of plural semiconductor components including both semiconductor switches and diodes.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The plural semiconductor components comprise plural modules each including a semiconductor switch and a diode, wherein the junction temperature is separately estimated for the semiconductor switch and the diode. When performing the estimation step, only the largest of the two junction temperatures estimated in the preceding estimation step for such module may be employed, thus improving the safety margin of the estimation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The thermal model of the semiconductor component may be a Foster model or a Cauer model. The respective model may be configured to consider the thermal impedance from the junction of the semiconductor component to ambient temperature. Such model may for example be constructed for the different layers of a semiconductor component module comprising the semiconductor component, such as an IGBT module, which may include only an IGBT or may include an IGBT and a diode, such as a free-wheeling or body diode. The thermal model may thus include both an IGBT and a diode and may consider the power dissipation in the respective semiconductor component as a heat source.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The thermal model may consider a temperature of an ambient medium to which the semiconductor component is exposed. The method may further comprise the obtaining of the temperature of the ambient medium. The ambient medium may for example be a cooling fluid, such as water, provided for cooling the semiconductor component. The temperature of the ambient medium may for example be measured. The ambient medium may be a cooling liquid that may cool directly a base plate of a semiconductor module of the respective semiconductor component or may cool a heat sink of such semiconductor module. The thermal model may be adapted accordingly to consider such heat sink, and possibly thermal grease between such base plate and the heat sink.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment the power losses are estimated separately for a generator side converter stage and a grid side converter stage of the converter. The power losses may be estimated only for the generator side converter stage, in particular for the rotor side converter stage.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The power losses may be estimated based on the largest current for the respective converter stage and the switching states of the semiconductor components, in particular of all the switched semiconductor components, of the respective converter stage (i.e. the semiconductor components concerned with the conversion of electrical power). Accordingly, an overall power loss may be estimated for the respective converter stage. The determined power loss may then be assigned to each semiconductor component of the respective converter stage. The calculation is thus simplified, allowing a fast and essentially real-time estimation of the junction temperature. The overall switching losses may for example be determined in dependence on the number of semiconductor components, the total number of the switching events (the number of state changes for all devices of the converter stage), the voltage on DC-link of the converter and the estimated largest current. These switching losses may then be assigned to each semiconductor component. Similarly, an overall value may be determined for the conduction losses of the semiconductor components.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The determining of the current comprises the determining of the current through each of the one or more semiconductor components, wherein the power losses are estimated individually for each of the one or more semiconductor components based on the current through the respective semiconductor component and the switching state of the respective semiconductor component. The junction temperature may be estimated for each of the one or more semiconductor components based on the power loss estimated for the respective semiconductor component. The estimation of the junction temperature may further be based on a previously estimated junction temperature for the respective semiconductor component, or for an associated semiconductor component (e.g., for a semiconductor component on same module).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The triggering of a protection mechanism may in particular involve the reduction of the current through the respective semiconductor component. As an example, the triggering of a protection mechanism may comprise at least one of opening one or more circuit breakers associated with the operation of the converter, activating a crowbar stage coupled to the converter, in particular coupled to a generator side of the converter, and delaying switching of semiconductor components of the converter. By such measures, the current flow through the semiconductor component can be reduced or may be stopped.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, by making use of the crowbar stage, the currents in the generator side converter stage can be reduced very quickly, avoiding a further rise of the junction temperature. Similarly, by delaying further switching of the semiconductor components, in particular switching to the conductive state (on-state), the junction temperature is allowed to drop down to values at which the semiconductor component is safe to operate. The crowbar stage may for example include a passive crowbar. The crowbar may be coupled to a connection between the rotor of the generator and the converter input of the generator side converter stage. The one or more protective measures may be taken while the wind turbine remains connected to the grid. Accordingly, the wind turbine can continue to feed power into the grid after the transients have passed and the currents in the rotor have returned to nominal, so that the protective measures are no longer required.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Opening of respective circuit breakers interrupts the current flow through the converter and thus also reduces the junction temperature of the semiconductor component. By opening the circuit breakers, the wind turbine may become disconnected from the power grid.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to a further embodiment, a protection system for protecting a converter of a wind turbine is provided. The converter is coupled to a generator of the wind turbine to perform conversion of electrical power produced by the generator. The converter comprises plural semiconductor components that are operational to provide the conversion of the electrical power. The protection system comprises a controller that is configured to perform a step of estimating a junction temperature of at least one of the semiconductor components. The step of estimating a junction temperature of at least one semiconductor component comprises determining a current in the converter that is associated with the power loss in one or more of the plural semiconductor components; estimating power loss associated with the one or more semiconductor components based on the determined current and on the state of the one or more semiconductor components; and using a thermal model of the one or more semiconductor components to estimate the junction temperature of at least one of the one or more semiconductor components based on the estimated power loss. The step of estimating the junction temperature is repeatedly performed, wherein a time period corresponding to a step size between subsequent steps of estimating the junction temperature is smaller than 1/10 of the period of an AC-voltage output by the converter. The controller is furthermore configured to trigger a protection mechanism that is configured to reduce the junction temperature of the semiconductor component if the estimated junction temperature exceeds a predetermined temperature threshold.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">By such protection system, advantages similar to the ones outlined further above may be achieved. In particular, such protection system allows a real-time estimation of the junction temperature and furthermore provides a fast reaction that reduces the junction temperature so that damage to the converter can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The protection system may comprise the converter, and the converter may be a three-phase converter that is coupled to a rotor of the generator. The protection system may further comprise three current sensors coupled to the input of the converter at a generator side of the converter. Each current sensor may have a respective predetermined working range, which is the same for the three sensors. The determining of a current associated with power loss in the semiconductor component may comprise measuring the current for at least one phase of the converter using the respective current sensor. As outlined in detail above, the controller may be configured to estimate one of the three currents, in particular the largest current, based on operating parameters of the converter, in particular if the current is outside the operating range of the respective current sensor for two of the phases. As further mentioned above, the controller may be configured to estimate one of the currents from the remaining two currents if only the current of one phase is out of the operating range of the respective current sensor.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In particular, the controller may be configured to perform any of the above outlined method steps. Furthermore, the protection system may comprise any of the elements described herein, such as the converter including the generator side converter stage, the DC-link and the grid side converter stage; the crowbar stage; a sensor for measuring DC-voltage on the DC-link; a sensor for measuring AC-current and AC-voltage on the grid side output of the converter; circuit breakers for disconnecting the converter; and the like. The protection system may furthermore include the generator, which may in particular be a doubly fed induction generator.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, at an output frequency of 50 Hz, the period of the AC voltage is 20 ms, so that the time period may accordingly be shorter than 2 ms.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to a further embodiment, a wind turbine comprising a protection system in any of the above outlined configurations is provided. The wind turbine may in particular include the generator, the converter, and the converter controller, and may further include any of the other components described herein with respect to a wind turbine.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to a further embodiment of the invention, a computer program product (non-transitory computer readable storage medium having instructions, which when executed by a processor, perform actions) for protecting a converter of a wind turbine is provided. The computer program may comprise control instructions which, when executed by a data processor of a controller of the converter, cause the data processor to perform any of the methods described herein, in particular any of the above described embodiments of the method of protecting a converter.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It is to be understood that the features mentioned above and those yet to be explained below can be used not only in the respective combinations indicated, but also in other combinations or in isolation, without leaving the scope of embodiments of the present invention.

The wind turbine has a rotor with a hub <b>10</b> that is coupled to a shaft <b>11</b>. The rotor converters wind energy into rotational mechanical energy. The shaft <b>10</b> is coupled to a generator <b>20</b> via a gearbox <b>12</b>. It should be clear that in other configurations, gearbox <b>12</b> may not be present (e.g., a direct drive wind turbine). In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the generator <b>20</b> is a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), but embodiments employing different types of generators are also conceivable. The shaft <b>11</b> is in particular coupled via the gearbox <b>12</b> to the rotor <b>21</b> of the DFIG to turn the rotor. The stator <b>22</b> of the generator <b>20</b> is electrically connected to a power grid <b>40</b> via a transformer <b>30</b>. It should be clear that the respective connection may include further components not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, such as circuit breakers or the like.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The rotor <b>21</b> is electrically connected to an input of a converter <b>110</b> of the wind turbine. The converter <b>100</b> includes a generator side converter stage <b>111</b> that is connected to the rotor <b>21</b>, and a grid side converter stage <b>112</b> that is connected to the power grid <b>40</b> (via the transformer <b>30</b>). Both converter stages <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> are coupled via a DC-link <b>113</b>. Both converter stages <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> are operable as a rectifier or as an inverter to allow power flow in either direction through the converter <b>110</b>. The converter <b>110</b> may in particular be configured to feed an adjustable frequency AC power to the field windings of the rotor <b>21</b> to allow the generator to operate at variable speed while providing AC power at the desired frequency at the output of stator <b>22</b>. In operation, a fraction of up to 20% or 30% of the generated electrical power is fed to the power grid via the converter <b>110</b>, the remaining electrical power being directly fed to the grid from the stator <b>22</b>. The general operation of a DFIG is known to the skilled person and thus not explained in greater detail herein.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Each converter stage comprises plural semiconductor components <b>150</b> that are operable to provide the desired conversion of electrical power. These include in particular semiconductor switches, such as IGBTs. A converter controller <b>130</b> is provided for controlling the semiconductor components, for example by using a pulse width modulation (PWM) control scheme. Converter controller <b>130</b> may accordingly include respective control connections to the semiconductor components <b>150</b>, in particular to IGBT modules, of the converter <b>110</b>. Current sensors <b>140</b> are furthermore provided to measure current at an input to the converter <b>110</b> (i.e. rotor currents) and at an output of the converter <b>110</b> (i.e. currents of the AC power provided to the power grid). It is noted that although converter <b>110</b> can be operated bi-directionally, the connection towards the rotor <b>21</b> is termed input herein, whereas the connection towards the grid <b>40</b> is termed output of the converter <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Converter controller <b>130</b> comprises a processing unit <b>131</b> such as a microprocessor, FPGA, PLD (Programmable Logic Device), or DSP (digital signal processor), and a memory <b>132</b> (such as RAM, ROM, flash memory or a hard disc drive) that stores control instructions which when executed by the processing unit <b>131</b> perform any of the methods described herein.

Further, inputs for receiving measurements of the DC voltage on the DC link <b>113</b>, of the AC voltage at the output of converter <b>110</b> and the like may be provided. Furthermore, the converter controller <b>130</b> may be coupled to or may implement a wind turbine controller that controls the operation of the wind turbine. Such wind turbine may for example set the output power to be fed into power grid <b>40</b> based on the prevailing wind conditions by providing a torque setpoint in accordance with which the converter <b>110</b> and thus the generator <b>20</b> are controlled. It may further control the pitch angle of the blades attached to hub <b>10</b> to adjust the conversion efficiency of wind energy into rotational energy, thereby adjusting rotor speed and/or torque.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Converter controller <b>110</b> is configured to perform a method of protecting the converter <b>110</b> of the wind turbine. According to this method, the converter controller <b>110</b> estimates the junction temperature of one or more semiconductor components of the converter <b>110</b> and triggers a protection mechanism if the junction temperature exceeds a threshold value.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The junction of a semiconductor component generally refers to the junction between n-type and p-type semiconductors in the component, wherein a component such as an IGBT can comprise several alternating layers of such semiconductors. The junction temperature refers to the highest temperature occurring in a semiconductor device during operation, which is generally found in proximity to the one or more junctions in the device through which the current is conducted.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The protection system <b>100</b> includes the converter controller <b>130</b>.

As can be seen, the converter is a three-phase converter having three inputs (one for each phase) at which respective current sensors <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>143</b> are provided. Furthermore, current sensors <b>145</b>, <b>146</b> and <b>147</b> are provided at each of the three phases of the output of converter <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Both, the generator side converter stage <b>111</b> and the grid side converter stage <b>112</b> include three converter legs comprising semiconductor components that are switched (by converter controller <b>130</b>) to effect the desired conversion of electrical power. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, each converter leg comprises two semiconductor modules, each module comprising semiconductor components in form of a semiconductor switch <b>151</b>, in particular an IGBT, and a diode <b>152</b>. IGBT <b>151</b> and diode <b>152</b> may for example form part of an IGBT module. It should be clear that other converter topologies are conceivable, for example by connecting more than two semiconductor modules in series in each leg, by providing series-connected converter cells that are each fed from the three-phase input or the like.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The converter further includes the DC link with the DC link capacitor <b>161</b>. Further, a chopper stage <b>162</b> is provided and includes the chopper resistance <b>163</b> as well as respective semiconductor switches for connecting the chopper resistance <b>163</b> into the DC link circuit. To the input to the converter <b>110</b>, a crowbar stage <b>170</b> is connected. The crowbar can be a passive crowbar, but an active crowbar may be used as well.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow diagram showing a method of protecting a converter of a wind turbine, in particular the converter <b>110</b>, according to an embodiment. The method involves the estimation of the junction temperature of at least one semiconductor component <b>150</b> of the converter <b>110</b>. The junction temperature of each semiconductor switch <b>151</b> of the generator side converter stage <b>111</b> is estimated. In an embodiment, the junction temperature of both semiconductor switches <b>151</b> and diodes <b>152</b> which are operable to provide the power conversion in the generator side converter stage <b>111</b> are estimated.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the converter is a three-phase converter coupled at its input to the rotor <b>21</b> of a DFIG, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The above explanations thus equally apply to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In step <b>201</b>, the junction temperature estimation is initialized. For example, parameters that are determined during the estimation may be given a present initial value, e.g., the ambient or a predetermined temperature may be used as an initial value for the junction temperature (e.g., 25&#xb0; C.). The method performs repeated (iteration) steps of estimating the junction temperature, wherein the resulting estimated junction temperature is used in the subsequent step. The method may thus employ an iterative process for estimating the junction temperature.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The step size between subsequent (iterative) steps is predetermined and is smaller than 1/10 of the period of the converted AC voltage given out at the output of the converter <b>110</b> (i.e. on the grid side). It can thus be ensured that the currents remain relatively constant over one cycle or step, which allows simplification of the estimation. Furthermore, a real time estimation thus becomes possible, i.e., there is only a short a very delay between the actual junction temperature and the obtaining of the result of junction temperature estimation.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In step <b>202</b>, currents in the converter are obtained. In particular, when applied to the generator side converter stage <b>111</b>, the currents for the three phases are measured at the input to the converter <b>110</b>, in particular by a current sensor <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>143</b> for each phase (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Each current sensor <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>143</b> has a particular operating range in which precise current measurements can be made. Outside the operating range, current measurements are no longer indicative of the current in the respective connection or are not possible.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">If in step <b>202</b>, one of the currents is outside the operating range of the respective sensor <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>143</b>, the current for this phase is estimated based on operating parameters of the converter <b>110</b>, in particular based on the currents measured for the other two phases. This is possible, since in the rotor <b>21</b>, the field windings are generally delta-connected, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, so that Kirchhoff s law can be employed to derive the third current. All three currents can accordingly be obtained.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">If in step <b>202</b>, two of the current sensors are out of range, the larger of these two currents is determined based on operating parameters of the converter <b>110</b>. If two currents are out of range, their values must have opposite sign, i.e. they flow into different directions. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, it can be seen that the largest of these currents (here I<sub>1</sub>) is the current with the sign opposite to the sign of the current that has the smallest value and that can still be measured by the current sensor (here current I<sub>3 </sub>measured by <b>143</b>). This is due to the fact that the sum of these three currents must be equal to zero. The direction/sign of the respective current can be determined by the respective current sensor <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>143</b> (e.g. for the current in range) and can be derived from the operating state of the converter <b>110</b> for the other currents (which is known to converter controller <b>130</b> that controls the switching state of the converter <b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the current is experienced by one or more semiconductor components connected in the respective leg of the converter <b>110</b>. I<sub>1 </sub>is for example experienced by the semiconductor switch <b>151</b>, in particular an IGBT, or the diode <b>152</b>, depending on the switching state/operating state of the converter <b>110</b>. As shown for the operating state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the current I<sub>1 </sub>is thus present on the DC link <b>113</b>. The value of I<sub>1 </sub>is now derived by considering the currents on the DC link.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The current I<sub>DC </sub>into the DC link capacitor <b>161</b> is derived based on the fixed value of the capacitance, which is known, and the DC Link voltage. A respective sensor can be provided to allow controller <b>130</b> to continuously measure the DC link voltage. Based on the DC link voltage and voltage change, the current into the DC link capacitor <b>161</b> can be derived.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The current I<sub>CH </sub>through the chopper stage is derived based on the fixed value of the chopper resistance <b>163</b>, which is known, the measured DC-link voltage, and further based on the ON or OFF state of the chopper stage <b>162</b>, which is controlled by the controller <b>130</b> and thus also known.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The current I<sub>grid </sub>that flows in or out through the grid side converter stage <b>112</b> (operating as inverter) is known from the active power provided to the grid. The active power is known from the grid current and voltage measurements, e.g., using sensors <b>145</b>, <b>146</b> and <b>147</b>. In particular, the AC voltage and current at the output of converter <b>110</b> are measured and are used to derive I<sub>grid</sub>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">From the sum of these three currents, the current I<sub>1 </sub>which is out of range is determined. In particular, the three determined currents I<sub>DC</sub>, I<sub>CH</sub>, and I<sub>grid </sub>are averaged and summed to obtain I<sub>1</sub>, i.e. the larger of the two currents out of range. Once I<sub>1 </sub>is known, the second current I<sub>2 </sub>that is out of range can be obtained, since the sum of the three currents I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2 </sub>and I<sub>3 </sub>equals zero.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Even though two of the rotor currents are out of range of the respective current sensors <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>143</b>, the present method allows a precise estimation of all three currents. In particular during the occurrence of transients on the power grid, which may be due to a fault occurring on the grid and which result in overcurrents in the rotor <b>21</b>, the currents experienced by the converter <b>110</b> can be obtained with relatively high precision.

For example, if the converter includes a semiconductor module that comprises semiconductor components in form of a diode and an IGBT, then a combined thermal model that considers both the diode and the IGBT, which may be coupled to the same heat sink, may be employed. An example of such combined model <b>700</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, wherein the reference numeral <b>701</b> is the model for the IGBT, <b>702</b> a model for thermal grease, <b>703</b> a model for the heat sink, <b>704</b> a model for the diode, and <b>705</b> a model for the thermal grease by which the diode is coupled to the heat sink. Both, diode and IGBT, are connected vie respective thermal grease to the heat sink. The power losses P<sub>L_IGBT </sub>and P<sub>L_DIODE </sub>of the IGBT and the DIODE are considered in the model.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0095">Further, it should be clear that certain simplifications and approximations may be used in the determination of the junction temperature to make the determination more efficient and safer. For example, when the junction temperature of both a diode and an IGBT of the same module are estimated, the higher of the two junction temperatures determined in the preceding iteration step may be used in the calculation of the junction temperature of both components in the current step. It can thereby be ensured that the junction temperature is not underestimated. In other embodiments, only the junction temperature of a semiconductor switch, in particular of an IGBT is estimated.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0096">In the decision step <b>207</b>, it is checked if the estimated junction temperature exceeds a predetermined temperature threshold. The junction temperature is estimated for each of the semiconductor components of at least the generator side converter stage <b>111</b>. The largest of the estimated junction temperatures may then be compared to the temperature threshold. Alternatively, each of the estimated junction temperatures may be compared to the temperature threshold to determine if an over-temperature condition exists for one of the semiconductor components. As an example, the temperature threshold may be set to 100&#xb0; C. for a semiconductor component for which the maximal junction temperature has a value of T<sub>max</sub>=140&#xb0; C. The temperature threshold may lie within a range of about 60% to 90% of the maximal junction temperature of the respective semiconductor component. The temperature threshold may be adjusted so as to achieve the desired protection function.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0097">If the largest estimated junction temperature (or any estimated junction temperature) does not exceed the temperature threshold value, the next iteration step of estimating the junction temperature is performed, i.e. steps <b>202</b>-<b>206</b> are repeated with an increased counter k=k+1.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0098">The time period between subsequent iteration steps of estimating the junction temperature (i.e. for one cycle of the iteration) is chosen such that a real time estimation of the junction temperature is achieved and that the AC currents can be approximated as constant during the time period. For example, the time period may be smaller than 1/10 of the AC period of the AC voltage at the output of converter <b>110</b>. Accordingly, at 50 Hz output voltage, the time period may be smaller than 2 ms. The time period may be smaller than 1 ms and may lie within a range of about 20 &#x3bc;s to 200 &#x3bc;s. For example, the time period may be about 80, 90, 100, 110, or 120 &#x3bc;s. An embodiment employs a time period of 100 &#x3bc;s.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0099">If in step <b>207</b>, the largest junction temperature exceeds the temperature threshold, a protection mechanism is triggered (step <b>208</b>). For example, triggering a protection mechanism may include activating the passive crowbar stage <b>170</b> to cause an immediate drop in the associated currents in order to prevent the junction temperature T<sub>T </sub>from reaching destructive values. Triggering a protection mechanism may additionally or alternatively include the inserting of a delay to allow the junction temperature to drop and to only resume the switching of the semiconductor component once the junction temperature has come down to values low enough for the diode to be able to block the DC Link voltage if the opposite (associated) IGBT is turned on. The controller <b>130</b> can delay the switching as desired to allow one or more of the semiconductor components to cool down. Additionally or alternatively, the triggering of the protection mechanism may include the triggering of a main protection mechanism of the wind turbine, which may disconnect electrical equipment from the power grid. For example, the converter <b>110</b> and/or the generator <b>20</b> may be disconnected from the power grid <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0100">Additionally, triggering a protection mechanism may comprise triggering an alarm, e.g. for informing an operator about the occurrence of the over-temperature event.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0101">In step <b>209</b>, it is checked if the operating temperature of the respective semiconductor component has been restored. A second temperature threshold may for example be defined, and the current junction temperature may be compared to this second threshold to determine if it has fallen below this second threshold, indicating the restoring of normal operating conditions. The second temperature threshold may be the same as the first temperature threshold or may be lower.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0102">If it is found in step <b>209</b> that the temperature has not been restored to operating conditions, additional protection mechanisms may be employed, such as disconnecting the wind turbine from the power grid <b>40</b>, e.g., by opening respective circuit breakers.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0103">It should be clear that also during steps <b>208</b> and <b>209</b>, the estimation of the junction temperature (steps <b>202</b>-<b>206</b>) can continue to be performed in parallel (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), so that an current (real time) estimation of the junction temperature is available when implementing the protection mechanism and when determining that the over-temperature condition is no longer present.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the estimation of the junction temperature in blocks of a flow diagram.

The disclosed method and system can thereby react quickly to transients occurring on the power grid, which lead to high overcurrents in the rotor of the generator that can damage the converter <b>110</b>.
