That is, unlike the configuration in which the pair of rotor holding portions are arranged above the rotation plane of the rotating member and the retaining structure of the rotating member protrudes as in the unlocking device of Patent Literature 1, the retaining portion <b>74</b> and the engaging portion (the bearing portion <b>30</b>) are provided to be within the thickness range T of the operating member <b>50</b>, and the retaining structure of the rotating member <b>70</b> is prevented from protruding in the thickness direction of the release device <b>10</b>, so that the release device <b>10</b> can be prevented from being bulky, and the thickness thereof can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the operating member <b>50</b> is formed with the notch portions <b>57</b> and <b>58</b> for avoiding the retaining portion <b>74</b> and the engaging portion (here, the bearing portion <b>30</b>).

By adopting the above configuration, the support shaft <b>73</b> and the pressed portion <b>75</b> are easily located within the thickness range T of the operating member <b>50</b> when viewed from the sliding direction of the operating member <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, and the thickness of the release device <b>10</b> is easily further reduced.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the support shaft <b>73</b> is rotatably supported on at least two positions in the thickness direction of the housing <b>20</b>, and the pressed portion <b>75</b> is located between the two positions when viewed in the sliding direction S of the operating member <b>50</b>.
