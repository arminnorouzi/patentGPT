In the following description of the present disclosure, an implantable device for a cerebral cortex stimulation-based visual prosthesis and a retina implant is mainly described as an example for illustration.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">An implantable device <b>100</b> according to some embodiments of the present disclosure includes a flexible cable <b>1</b>, a circuit chip <b>2</b>, a fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> and a vapor deposited layer <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the flexible cable <b>1</b> includes a lead-in part <b>11</b>, a stimulation part <b>12</b> and a connection part <b>13</b> between the lead-in part <b>11</b> and the stimulation part <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The stimulation part <b>12</b> may include a flexible substrate <b>121</b> and a plurality of stimulation electrodes <b>122</b> provided on the flexible substrate <b>121</b>. The flexible substrate <b>121</b> may support and protect the plurality of stimulation electrodes <b>122</b>. An end of each of the plurality of stimulation electrodes <b>122</b> is exposed from one surface of one side of the flexible substrate <b>121</b>, so as to be adaptive to generate a stimulus on a human body part where the implantable device is to be implanted (for example, the retina or the cerebral cortex). Here, it needs to be illustrated that, the term &#x201c;exposed&#x201d; may mean that each of the ends of the plurality of stimulation electrodes <b>122</b> can be seen from the one side of the flexible substrate <b>121</b>, and in this case, each of the ends of the plurality of stimulation electrodes <b>122</b> may protrude from the surface of the one side of the flexible substrate <b>121</b>, or may be flush with the surface of the one side of the flexible substrate <b>121</b>, or may sink below the surface of the one side of the flexible substrate <b>121</b>. In the description of the present disclosure, &#x201c;a plurality of&#x201d; means two or more. For example, the number of the plurality of stimulation electrodes <b>122</b> may be sixty. Of course, more stimulation electrodes <b>122</b> may be arranged according to a different requirement, for example, hundreds of stimulation electrodes <b>122</b> may be arranged. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the plurality of stimulation electrodes <b>122</b> may be provided on the flexible substrate <b>121</b> in a form of array (e.g., in rows and columns).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The connection part <b>13</b> may be provided therein with a plurality of conductive wires (not illustrated in the drawings) connected with the plurality of stimulation electrodes respectively. The plurality of conductive wires may be formed in one layer in the height direction, or several layers in the height direction. In this way, each stimulation electrode <b>122</b> may be driven separately, and the body part to be stimulated (such as the retina or the cerebral cortex) may be stimulated electrically in a targeted way. Optionally, each of the plurality of conductive wires (not illustrated in the drawings) in the connection part <b>13</b> may be preferably made from Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Ti, Ir or alloy made from any combination thereof. Each of the plurality of stimulation electrode <b>122</b> may be preferably made from Pt, Ir or alloy made from any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the flexible cable <b>1</b> as a whole includes a first film layer, a metal layer and a second film layer, to form a sandwich structure of film-metal-film. The flexible cable <b>1</b> as a whole is manufactured through an MEMS processing technology (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System processing technology, which is a generic term of a micro-structure processing technology ranging from a nanometre scale to a millimetre scale) and may be manufactured through a chemical vapor deposition, spraying, electroplating, evaporation, plasma etching, patterning or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some optional embodiments, the flexible substrate <b>121</b> may be preferably made from poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), Teflon(polytetrafluoroethylene), silicone, polyimide, polyethylene terephthalate, or Parylene(poly-p-xylylene, especially Parylene-C). By providing the flexible substrate <b>121</b> made of the flexible material, possible damage to the implanting position such as the cerebral cortex and eye tissue, caused by the stimulation part <b>12</b> during the implanting process, can be inhibited. The flexible substrate <b>121</b> may be preferably made from Parylene, and enable the stimulation part <b>12</b> of the flexible cable <b>1</b> to have a thickness of 10 &#x3bc;m-50 &#x3bc;m. In this way, it allows the stimulation part <b>12</b> to have a better plasticity to be adapted to the human tissue by being bent into an adaptive shape, so as to provide a better stimulation effect.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The circuit chip <b>2</b> may be for example an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chip configured to process a received data signal and to transmit an electric stimulation pulse to drive the stimulation electrode <b>122</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the circuit chip <b>2</b> is fixed to a surface of one side of the lead-in part <b>11</b>, and the circuit chip <b>2</b> is electrically connected to the lead-in part <b>11</b>. The circuit chip <b>2</b> is electrically connected to the lead-in part <b>11</b> at a plurality of connection points that are corresponding to the plurality of conductive wires within the connection part <b>13</b> respectively. The circuit chip <b>2</b> may be a semiconductor chip formed on a silicon substrate through e.g., a Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) process.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the circuit chip <b>2</b> and the lead-in part <b>11</b> are coated with the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> at the outer sides thereof. Here, the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> may be formed using hydrophobic, insulating and adhesive fluid, such as silicone oil or its derivatives. The silicone oil usually means linear polysiloxane, which is in a liquid form at room temperature, has good heat resistance, electric insulation, weather resistance, hydrophobicity, physiologic inertia, relatively small surface tension, relatively low viscosity-temperature coefficient, and relatively high resistance to compression. The fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> may be formed by adhering the above hydrophobic, insulating and adhesive fluid onto the outer side of the circuit chip <b>2</b> and the outer side of the lead-in part <b>11</b> through dipping, brushing, spraying, dripping or the like. Since different fluids have different viscosities, a person skilled in the art may select different adhering processes. For example, for a fluid of a relatively high viscosity, the brushing method may be adopted. Optionally, the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> may have a thickness of 10 &#x3bc;m-100 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In an optional example of the present disclosure, the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> may be formed by dipping the lead-in part <b>11</b> and the circuit chip <b>2</b> into the silicone oil. In particular, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a certain amount of silicone oil is poured into a container <b>500</b> such as a beaker or a measuring container, an assembly including the lead-in part <b>11</b> and the circuit chip <b>2</b> which are fixed together is dipped into the silicone oil, and the assembly is fetched out from the silicone oil after a period of time. Since the silicone oil is adhesive, the assembly is adhered with a layer of silicone oil in a liquid form, and the silicone oil is adhered, in a molecular scale, into gaps and onto the surface of the assembly. In this way, the lead-in part <b>11</b> and the circuit chip <b>2</b> can be encapsulated with excellent leakproofness. When dipping the assembly into the silicone oil, the connection part <b>13</b> of the flexible cable <b>1</b> may be clamped with a tweezer or special clamping tool.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">It shall be noted that, after the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> is formed on the lead-in part <b>11</b> fixed with the circuit chip <b>2</b>, the hydrophobic, insulating and adhesive fluid such as silicone oil may still exist in a liquid fluid form so as to be adhered to the outer side of the circuit chip <b>2</b> and the outer side of the lead-in part <b>11</b> in a form of liquid molecules. In this way, it can significantly prevent corrosive body fluid from permeating into the flexible cable <b>1</b> and the circuit chip <b>2</b>. It shall be noted that, before the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> is formed, other possible protection layer may be provided to further improve the leakproofness. For example, a protective layer (e.g., a Parylene layer formed by vapor deposition) may be formed on the outside of the circuit chip <b>2</b> and the lead-in part <b>11</b> and then the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> (e.g., a silicone oil layer) can be adhered to the outside of the protective layer. In this case, the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> is indirectly adhered to the outside of the circuit chip <b>1</b> and the lead-in part <b>11</b>, which is also in the protection scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The vapor deposited layer <b>4</b> may be directly deposited on the outer side of the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b>, so as to encapsulate and fix the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> in a liquid fluid form. Here, the vapor deposited layer <b>4</b> may be optionally a protection layer of Parylene, which is formed by direct deposition of Parylene (poly-p-xylylene, especially Parylene-C). The protection layer of Parylene may be formed by depositing Parylene onto the assembly formed with the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> through a vapor deposition process. Since Parylene monomer has excellent permeability, the protection layer of Parylene can be deposited into the gaps and onto the surface at the outer side of the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b>, so as to form a nonporous and transparent insulation layer of a uniform thickness. In this way, a complete protection layer is deposited in a molecular scale and the leakproofness is guaranteed. Preferably, the vapor deposited layer <b>3</b> may have a thickness of 10 &#x3bc;m-30 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an optional example of the present disclosure, the protection layer of Parylene may be deposited using a vapor deposition device. The vapor deposition device may include a vaporization device (not illustrated in the drawings) and a deposition device <b>600</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). The processing in the vaporization device may include two stages as follows. In a first stage, Parylene in a powdered form is heated in vacuum and becomes to be in vapor state. And in a second stage, the vapor is supplied into an oven and is pyrolyzed into monomer (usually p-xylylene as monomer radical) at a preset temperature and then is supplied into the deposition device <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the deposition device <b>600</b> includes a housing <b>610</b>. The housing <b>610</b> contains a deposition chamber <b>611</b> therein, and the housing <b>610</b> is provided with a monomer inlet <b>612</b> at its bottom. The assembly formed with the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> is fixed in the deposition chamber <b>611</b> by a clamping device <b>620</b>. The monomer formed after pyrolyzation enters the deposition chamber <b>611</b> from the monomer inlet <b>612</b>, and is subject to a lowered temperature so as to be deposited onto the assembly formed with the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b>. In this way, the protection layer of Parylene is deposited. Optionally, the clamping device <b>620</b> may be a special clamping device including two supporting legs <b>621</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. Firstly, the two supporting legs <b>621</b> are released, the connection part <b>13</b> and the stimulation part <b>12</b> of the flexible cable <b>1</b> are placed between the two supporting legs <b>621</b>, and then the two supporting legs <b>621</b> are closed up to form a clamping space, so as to cover the connection part <b>13</b> and the stimulation part <b>12</b>. In this way, after the deposition process, the connection part <b>13</b> and the stimulation part <b>12</b> which are covered by the clamping device <b>620</b> are not deposited with the Parylene layer, and the outer surface of the clamping device <b>620</b> and the lead-in part <b>11</b> formed with the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b>, which are exposed in the deposition chamber <b>611</b>, are deposited with the Parylene layer. Thus, the unneeded part of the Parylene layer needs to be removed with a cutting tool or other tool, and the needed part of the Parylene layer is kept. Here, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, at a position where the lower end of the clamping device <b>620</b> is located, the connection part <b>13</b> of the flexible cable <b>1</b> is formed with a second boundary line X<b>2</b> indicating whether the vapor deposited layer <b>4</b> needs to be deposited. Of course, the present disclosure is not limited to this, and the clamping device <b>620</b> may be a tweezer or other tool. Further, optionally, the clamping device <b>620</b> may be fixed by a clamping device supporting frame <b>630</b> provided in the deposition chamber <b>611</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the implantable device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the lead-in part <b>11</b> fixed with the circuit chip <b>2</b> is coated with the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> and the vapor deposited layer <b>4</b>, the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> is adhered in a form of liquid molecules, and the vapor deposited layer <b>4</b> is deposited in the molecular scale into the gaps and onto the surface of the assembly in which the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> is adhered. The insulation characteristic of the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> will not affect the electrical connection between the lead-in part <b>11</b> of the flexible cable <b>1</b> and the circuit chip <b>2</b> and can significantly prevent the corrosive body fluid from permeating into the flexible cable <b>1</b> and the circuit chip <b>2</b>, guaranteeing the leakproofness, the use life and operational reliability of the implantable device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, the connection part <b>13</b> is coated with a first encapsulating layer <b>81</b> at its outer side. The first encapsulating layer <b>81</b> can improve the strength of the connection part <b>13</b> and provide a sealing function. Optionally, the step of coating the connection part <b>13</b> with the first encapsulating layer <b>81</b> may be performed before the steps of adhering the fluid adhesion layer <b>2</b> and depositing the vapor deposited layer <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In a further embodiment of the present disclosure, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the vapor deposited layer <b>4</b> may be coated with a second encapsulating layer <b>82</b> at its outer side to further improve the leakproofness of the encapsulated structure, so as to prevent permeation of the corrosive body fluid. Both the first encapsulating layer <b>81</b> and the second encapsulating layer <b>82</b> may be applied through injection molding. Optionally, each of the first encapsulating layer <b>81</b> and the second encapsulating layer <b>82</b> may be made from biological compatible silicone. Optionally, the first encapsulating layer <b>81</b> has a thickness of 30 &#x3bc;m-100 &#x3bc;m. Optionally, the second encapsulating layer <b>82</b> has a thickness of 100 &#x3bc;m-1000 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The relative positional relations of the above layers will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a start reference line X<b>0</b> is defined at the position where an end of the lead-in part <b>11</b> is located, the first encapsulating layer <b>81</b> starts from a first boundary line X<b>1</b>, the vapor deposited layer <b>4</b> ends at a second boundary line X<b>2</b> from the first reference line X<b>0</b>, the second encapsulating layer <b>82</b> ends at a third boundary line X<b>3</b> from the first reference line X<b>0</b>, a distance between the first boundary line X<b>1</b> and the start reference line X<b>0</b> is L<b>1</b>, a distance between the second boundary line X<b>2</b> and the start reference line X<b>0</b> is L<b>2</b>, and a distance between the third boundary line X<b>3</b> and the start reference line X<b>0</b> is L<b>3</b>, where L<b>2</b>&#x3e;L<b>1</b> and L<b>3</b>&#x3e;L<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">By providing L<b>2</b>&#x3e;L<b>1</b>, an area between the first boundary line X<b>1</b> and the second boundary line X<b>2</b> is firstly coated with the first encapsulating layer <b>81</b> (for example, silicone layer). And then, the vapor deposited layer <b>4</b> (for example, Parylene layer) is deposited onto this area during the depositing process. The vapor deposited layer <b>4</b> is made of a material different from that of the first encapsulating layer <b>81</b> underneath the vapor deposited layer <b>4</b>. In this way, it is easy to cutoff the vapor deposited layer <b>4</b> (for example, Parylene layer) in this area with a cutting tool, and the needed vapor deposited layer <b>4</b> can be kept.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, by providing L<b>3</b>&#x3e;L<b>2</b>, in the encapsulating process, the first encapsulating layer <b>81</b> (for example, a silicone layer) is firstly applied, and then a second encapsulating layer <b>82</b> (such as a silicone layer) is applied onto the outer side of the vapor deposited layer <b>4</b>. Since the second encapsulating layer <b>82</b> is made of the same material as that of the first encapsulating layer <b>81</b> underneath the second encapsulating layer <b>82</b>, in an area between the second boundary line X<b>2</b> and the third boundary line X<b>3</b>, the second encapsulating layer <b>82</b> can be closely bonded with the first encapsulating layer <b>81</b>, further improving the leakproofness.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b> (for example, the silicone oil layer) ends at a fourth boundary line X<b>4</b>, a distance between the fourth boundary line X<b>4</b> and the start reference line X<b>0</b> is L<b>4</b>, and L<b>2</b> and L<b>4</b> satisfy L<b>2</b>&#x3e;L<b>4</b>. In other words, no insulating adhesive fluid is adhered in the area between X<b>2</b> and X<b>4</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, for consideration of requirement for further circuit connection, an upper end of the lead-in part <b>11</b> when soaked in the silicone oil, i.e., the right end of the lead-in part <b>11</b> when laid flat, is above the liquid level of the silicone oil to avoid the upper end from being soaked in the silicone oil. Therefore, the fourth boundary line X<b>4</b> is formed on the upper end of the lead-in part <b>11</b> to indicate whether the silicone oil needs to be adhered. In other words, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a part of the lead-in part <b>11</b> that is below the fourth boundary line X<b>4</b> is adhered with silicone oil to form the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b>, and a part of the lead-in part <b>11</b> that is above the fourth boundary line X<b>4</b> is not adhered with the fluid adhesion layer <b>3</b>.
