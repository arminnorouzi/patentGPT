While some tools have been developed to combat these threats, it remains difficult to provide enterprise users and other users with access to electronic information (which may, e.g., be remotely hosted and/or linked to in electronic communications sent to such users) in a manner that efficiently and effectively ensures the safety of each user, each user's personal information, and each user's computing device. These issues are further complicated when attempting to balance and optimize the consumption of the computing resources required to provide such protective features in an automated fashion while being constrained by the limitations imposed by finite processing power and limited network bandwidth.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects of the disclosure provide technical solutions that overcome one or more of the technical problems described above and/or other technical challenges.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, at step <b>201</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may receive a first message. For example, at step <b>201</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may receive, from a remote messaging server and/or a remote source device, a first email message that includes one or more links to one or more remote sites.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">At step <b>202</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may rewrite a first uniform resource locator (URL) in the first message. For example, at step <b>202</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may rewrite a link in the first email message, so that the original link (which may, e.g., point to a specific remote site) is replaced by an updated link (which may, e.g., point to user protection computing platform <b>110</b> and include a unique token corresponding to the original link). As a result, if the updated link is requested by a browser executing on the recipient device, the browser on the recipient device may exchange information with user protection computing platform <b>110</b>, instead of the remote site, so as to protect the recipient device from potentially malicious content associated with the remote site, as illustrated in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At step <b>203</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may deliver the first message to user computing device <b>140</b>.

For example, at step <b>204</b>, after receiving and/or presenting the first message, user computing device <b>140</b> may receive input from the user of user computing device <b>140</b> requesting to open the first URL, and user computing device <b>140</b> accordingly may send a request for the first URL (which may, e.g., point to user protection computing platform <b>110</b>, as discussed above) to user protection computing platform <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, at step <b>205</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may receive the request for the first URL from user computing device <b>140</b>. For example, at step <b>205</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may receive, via the communication interface (e.g., communication interface <b>113</b>), from a first user computing device (e.g., user computing device <b>140</b>), a first request for a first uniform resource locator associated with a first email message. For instance, the original URL in the email message may have been rewritten by an email filtering engine, such as email filtering engine <b>112</b><i>c</i>, and the updated URL in the email message (i.e., the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message) may point to user protection computing platform <b>110</b>, rather than the third-party site corresponding to the original URL.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">At step <b>206</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may identify that the first URL corresponds to a potentially malicious site. For example, at step <b>206</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may identify that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message corresponds to a first potentially-malicious site (which may, e.g., be hosted by web server <b>130</b>). This identification may, for instance, be performed by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> using one or more URL Defense (UD) functions provided by Targeted Attack Protection (TAP) technology. For example, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may, in some instances, identify that the specific site is potentially malicious based on one or more rules that are defined on and/or maintained by user protection computing platform <b>110</b>. For instance, a user of administrator computing device <b>160</b> may create and/or define one or more site safety rules, which may be stored on user protection computing platform <b>110</b> and/or applied by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> in executing a cybersecurity analysis process on the site. In some instances, new and/or modified rules may be received and/or applied by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> in real-time (e.g., as a rule is defined on administrator computing device <b>160</b>, it may be pushed to user protection computing platform <b>110</b>, which may trigger isolation and/or blocking of one or more specific sites). In some instances, different site safety rules (which may, e.g., be stored and/or applied by user protection computing platform <b>110</b>) may be defined for different groups of users (e.g., based on different groups of users having different roles in an enterprise organization operating user protection computing platform <b>110</b>). In one or more arrangements, by identifying that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message corresponds to a first potentially-malicious site, using one or more rules that are defined on and/or maintained by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> and/or received and/or applied by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> in real-time, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may dynamically respond in real-time to new and/or changing threats (e.g., phishing sites, malware, data loss prevention threats, etc.) posed by various URLs, such as the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">At step <b>207</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine a risk profile of the request received from user computing device <b>140</b>. For example, at step <b>207</b>, in response to identifying that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message corresponds to the first potentially-malicious site, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine a risk profile associated with the first request received from the first user computing device (e.g., user computing device <b>140</b>). For instance, the risk profile may be determined by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> based on a web category and/or other features of the original URL, one or more risk factors associated with the user of user computing device <b>140</b>, and/or other risk factors, as illustrated in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine a web category (e.g., personal site, business site, banking site, porn site, gambling site, etc.) for the original URL and use this category in determining the risk profile. Additionally or alternatively, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine one or more risk factors associated with the user of user computing device <b>140</b> and use these user-specific risk factors in determining the risk profile. For instance, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine whether the user of user computing device <b>140</b> is a &#x2018;very attacked person&#x2019; within an enterprise organization operating user protection computing platform <b>110</b> and/or otherwise a highly targeted user (e.g., based on an enterprise-specific index of users), and this determination may correspond to a particular user-specific risk factor that is used by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> in determining the risk profile, as discussed in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, in determining the risk profile of the request at step <b>207</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may use a set of predefined scores and thresholds to determine a level of risk associated with the request based on the categories and/or risk factors determined by user protection computing platform <b>110</b>. For example, each web category and/or risk factor may correspond to a different predetermined score value. After identifying the specific web categories and/or risk factors associated with the request received from user computing device <b>140</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may identify the score values corresponding to these web categories and/or risk factors. User protection computing platform <b>110</b> then may sum these score values to determine an overall score for the request and may compare the overall score with one or more predetermined thresholds. For example, if the overall score exceeds a medium risk threshold but not a high risk threshold, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine the risk profile of the request to be &#x2018;medium&#x2019; risk. If the overall score exceeds both the medium risk threshold and the high risk threshold, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine the risk profile of the request to be &#x2018;high&#x2019; risk. If the overall score does not exceed the medium risk threshold or the high risk threshold, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine the risk profile of the request to be &#x2018;low&#x2019; risk. If, for instance, the risk profile of the request is determined by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> to be &#x2018;low,&#x2019; user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may allow the site to be opened by user computing device <b>140</b> normally (e.g., without executing an isolation method). Alternatively, if the risk profile of the request is determined by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> to be &#x2018;medium&#x2019; or &#x2018;high,&#x2019; user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may continue to step <b>208</b> to execute one or more isolation methods, as illustrated below.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message may be an embedded link in the first email message that was rewritten by an email filtering engine hosted on the computing platform. In addition, identifying that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message corresponds to the first potentially-malicious site may include identifying that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message corresponds to the first potentially-malicious site using a URL defense (UD) tool hosted on the computing platform. For example, the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message may be an embedded link in the first email message that was rewritten by an email filtering engine (e.g., email filtering engine <b>112</b><i>c</i>) hosted on user protection computing platform <b>110</b>. In addition, in identifying that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message corresponds to the first potentially-malicious site at step <b>206</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may identify that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message corresponds to the first potentially-malicious site using a URL defense (UD) tool executed by and/or otherwise hosted on user protection computing platform <b>110</b>. For instance, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may identify that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message corresponds to the first potentially-malicious site using URL defense (UD) functions provided by Targeted Attack Protection (TAP) technology executed by and/or otherwise hosted on the computing platform (e.g., user protection computing platform <b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, determining the risk profile associated with the first request received from the first user computing device may include determining that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message is associated with a first web category. For example, in determining the risk profile associated with the first request received from the first user computing device (e.g., user computing device <b>140</b>) at step <b>207</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message is associated with a first web category. For instance, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message is associated with a first specific web category (e.g., personal site, business site, banking site, porn site, gambling site, etc.), as discussed above. In some instances, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message is associated with a specific category by matching site contents from the first uniform resource locator with information defined in one or more category templates maintained by user protection computing platform <b>110</b>, such as a template for identifying personal sites, a template for identifying business sites, a template for identifying banking sites, a template for identifying porn sites, a template for identifying gambling sites, and so on.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, determining the risk profile associated with the first request received from the first user computing device may include determining one or more user-specific risk factors associated with a user of the first user computing device.

In some instances, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message is associated with a particular user-specific risk factor by matching user information associated with the user of user computing device <b>140</b> with information defined in one or more user risk templates maintained by user protection computing platform <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may maintain and/or access information defining a group of &#x2018;very attacked persons&#x2019; (who may, e.g., be enterprise users who are members of and/or otherwise associated with an enterprise organization operating user protection computing platform <b>110</b>) for whom many or all links are to be opened using an isolation method. In some instances, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may dynamically score various enterprise users, so as to dynamically add and/or remove specific users to and/or from the group of very attacked persons (e.g., instead of using a static list of very attacked persons) and/or otherwise update the group. In this way, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may regularly and/or periodically reevaluate whether each user in the group of very attacked persons continues to qualify as a very attacked person and/or should continue to be included in the group (which may, e.g., be subject to having links be opened using an isolation method). In some instances, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may identify a particular user as a very attacked person based on calculating a user-specific risk score for the user and determining that the user-specific risk score exceeds a predetermined threshold.

For example, in executing the isolation method to provide limited access to the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message at step <b>208</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may initiate a browser mirroring session with the first user computing device (e.g., user computing device <b>140</b>) to provide the first user computing device (e.g., user computing device <b>140</b>) with limited access to the first potentially-malicious site corresponding to the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For instance, in executing the isolation method at step <b>208</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may use browser mirroring in which the site corresponding to the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message is opened on a cloud browser executing on isolation server <b>120</b>, while safe content is mirrored on the user's local browser executing on user computing device <b>140</b> (e.g., by mirroring the document object model loaded on the cloud browser at the local browser). This browser mirroring approach may be different from a remote desktop approach, as browser mirroring might not involve using an image or graphical representation of the cloud browser on isolation server <b>120</b> or other virtualization methods. Rather, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may send static hypertext markup language (HTML) content, trusted Javascript content, and/or other static/trusted web content to the user's local browser on user computing device <b>140</b> for local execution on user computing device <b>140</b>, based on the cloud browser on isolation server <b>120</b> executing the HTML, third-party Javascript, dynamic code, and/or other third-party content that is received from the original URL and/or web server <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, after determining that the risk profile associated with the request is relatively high (e.g., above a predefined threshold risk level or dynamic threshold risk level) and/or otherwise determining that an isolation method should be used in providing limited access to a site, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may spin up and/or otherwise instantiate a cloud browser that executes in a cloud service on isolation server <b>120</b> when a user of user computing device <b>140</b> attempts to visit the requested site. The cloud browser on isolation server <b>120</b> may fetch the original URL from web server <b>130</b>, and the dynamic code that is received from web server <b>130</b> may execute on the cloud service on isolation server <b>120</b>.

In this way, only static HTML content and trusted Javascript (e.g., not third-party Javascript) may run on the local browser on user computing device <b>140</b>. In addition, an open socket may be maintained (e.g., between isolation server <b>120</b>, user computing device <b>140</b>, and/or user protection computing platform <b>110</b>) so as to provide feedback from the local browser on user computing device <b>140</b> to the cloud browser on isolation server <b>120</b>, for instance, to report mouse input events (e.g., mouse hover events, selections, etc.), keyboard input events, and/or other input events from user computing device <b>140</b> back to the cloud browser on isolation server <b>120</b>. Furthermore, any malicious code associated with the third-party site may run on the cloud browser on isolation server <b>120</b> while being completely isolated from the end user and their local browser on user computing device <b>140</b>. In addition, if a phish or other malicious code is detected at the cloud browser on isolation server <b>120</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may prevent the phish or other malicious code from being replicated at the local browser on user computing device <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some instances, in executing the isolation method at step <b>208</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may allow an analyst user or network administrator (e.g., a user of administrator computing device <b>160</b>) to inspect the content being received by isolation server <b>120</b> from the site hosted by web server <b>130</b> in real-time (e.g., contemporaneously as such content is being received by isolation server <b>120</b>).

After the user of user computing device <b>140</b> selects the option to break out of isolation mode, user computing device <b>140</b> may access and/or otherwise locally open the site (which may, e.g., involve user computing device <b>140</b> directly exchanging data with web server <b>130</b> so as to receive source code from the site, locally execute dynamic code associated with the site on user computing device <b>140</b>, and/or locally render other content associated with the site on user computing device <b>140</b>).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Subsequently, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may perform one or more additional steps, similar to those described above, as requests for additional sites are received from the same and/or other user computing devices. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, at step <b>209</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may receive a second message. For example, at step <b>209</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may receive, from a remote messaging server and/or a remote source device, a second email message that includes one or more links to one or more remote sites.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">At step <b>210</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may rewrite a second uniform resource locator (URL) in the second message. For example, at step <b>210</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may rewrite a link in the second email message, so that the original link (which may, e.g., point to a specific remote site) is replaced by an updated link (which may, e.g., point to user protection computing platform <b>110</b> and include a unique token corresponding to the original link). As a result, if the updated link is requested by a browser executing on the recipient device, the browser on the recipient device may exchange information with user protection computing platform <b>110</b>, instead of the remote site, so as to protect the recipient device from potentially malicious content associated with the remote site.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">At step <b>211</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may deliver the second message to user computing device <b>150</b>. For example, at step <b>211</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may send the second message directly to user computing device <b>150</b> and/or may cause the second message to be sent to user computing device <b>150</b> via an email server or another messaging server.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">At step <b>212</b>, user computing device <b>150</b> may request the second URL included in the second message. For example, at step <b>212</b>, after receiving and/or presenting the second message, user computing device <b>150</b> may receive input from the user of user computing device <b>150</b> requesting to open the second URL, and user computing device <b>150</b> accordingly may send a request for the second URL (which may, e.g., point to user protection computing platform <b>110</b>, as discussed above) to user protection computing platform <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, at step <b>213</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may receive the request for the second URL from user computing device <b>150</b>. For example, at step <b>213</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may receive, via the communication interface (e.g., communication interface <b>113</b>), from a second user computing device (e.g., user computing device <b>150</b>), a second request for a second uniform resource locator associated with a second email message. For instance, the original URL in the email message may have been rewritten by an email filtering engine, such as email filtering engine <b>112</b><i>c</i>, and the updated URL in the email message (i.e., the second uniform resource locator associated with the second email message) may point to user protection computing platform <b>110</b>, rather than the third-party site corresponding to the original URL.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">At step <b>214</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may identify that the second URL corresponds to a potentially malicious site. For example, at step <b>214</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may identify that the second uniform resource locator associated with the second email message corresponds to a second potentially-malicious site (which may, e.g., be hosted by web server <b>130</b>). This identification may, for instance, be performed by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> using one or more URL Defense (UD) functions provided by Targeted Attack Protection (TAP) technology, similar to how user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may identify that the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message corresponds to the first potentially-malicious site in the examples discussed above.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">At step <b>215</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine a risk profile of the request received from user computing device <b>150</b>. For example, at step <b>215</b>, in response to identifying that the second uniform resource locator associated with the second email message corresponds to the second potentially-malicious site, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine a risk profile associated with the second request received from the second user computing device (e.g., user computing device <b>150</b>). For instance, the risk profile may be determined by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> based on a web category and/or other features of the original URL, one or more risk factors associated with the user of user computing device <b>150</b>, and/or other risk factors, similar to how user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine a risk profile of the request received from user computing device <b>140</b> in the examples discussed above.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">At step <b>216</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may execute an isolation method (e.g., based on determining the risk profile of the request at step <b>215</b>). For example, at step <b>216</b>, based on the risk profile associated with the second request received from the second user computing device (e.g., user computing device <b>150</b>), user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may execute a second isolation method to provide limited access to the second uniform resource locator associated with the second email message. For instance, in executing the isolation method, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may control and/or cause isolation server <b>120</b> to access web server <b>130</b> and provide user computing device <b>150</b> with limited access to a site hosted by web server <b>130</b> and/or may perform one or more other steps, similar to how user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may execute an isolation method to provide limited access to the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message in the examples discussed above.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Subsequently, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may continue to receive and process requests for URLs from the same and/or other user computing devices. In processing each of these requests, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may similarly identify whether the URL associated with the request is malicious, determine a risk profile of the request, and execute an isolation method based on the risk profile of the request, as in the examples discussed above. In some instances, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may apply similar isolation methods to URLs pointing to files (e.g., rather than webpages). In these instances, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may open the linked file using an isolation method and provide a requesting user computing device with limited access to the linked file, and user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may scan the file to determine whether it is safe or includes malicious content, as in the examples discussed above.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Additionally or alternatively, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may implement these isolation-based file-scanning methods to protect enterprise data and/or provide enterprise data loss prevention (DLP) functions. For instance, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may open a linked file using an isolation method and may scan the file to determine whether the file contains data that is not allowed to be sent and/or shared outside of an enterprise organization because of one or more enterprise data loss prevention policies. In these instances, if user protection computing platform <b>110</b> determines that the linked file does not contain data that is subject to a DLP policy, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may allow the user of a user computing device (e.g., user computing device <b>140</b>, user computing device <b>150</b>) who has requested the file to break out of isolation and/or otherwise fully access the file (e.g., after user protection computing platform <b>110</b> initially opened the file using an isolation method and scanned the file for compliance with the DLP policy). Alternatively, if user protection computing platform <b>110</b> determines that the linked file does contain data that is subject to a DLP policy, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may deny the user of the user computing device further access to the file, end any browser mirroring session that has been initiated, generate and send one or more alerts (e.g., to administrator computing device <b>160</b>), and/or perform other actions (which may, e.g., be specified by the DLP policy).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As noted above, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may, in some instances, select and/or use different models in evaluating a site's DOM based on the content or type of site being evaluated. In addition, because isolation server <b>120</b> may be rendering (and user protection computing platform <b>110</b> and/or phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d </i>may be scoring) the actual content that is intended for the user of user computing device <b>140</b>, including the site's DOM and the user's clickstream and other interactions, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> and/or phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d </i>may be able to analyze user-authenticated content. The ability to analyze this user-authenticated content may provide one or more technical advantages over conventional sandboxing approaches in which only non-authenticated content may be retrieved and/or analyzed by a monitoring and classification server. Moreover, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may, in some instances, apply one or more rules that were trained and/or learned by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> in isolated, user-authenticated sessions and apply those rules in non-isolated and/or non-authenticated sessions. For instance, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may apply one or more machine-learned rules for identifying phishing and/or malware that were trained and/or otherwise determined by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> based on analyzing user-authenticated content in one or more isolated, user-authenticated sessions when monitoring site content, user interaction data, and/or other data in one or more non-authenticated sessions.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">For instance, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may apply one or more machine-learned rules for identifying phishing and/or malware that were trained and/or otherwise determined by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> based on analyzing user-authenticated content in one or more isolated, user-authenticated sessions when monitoring a user's use of and/or interactions with a file sharing site. File sharing sites may, for example, be commonly targeted by malicious users, and user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may be configured to open links to file sharing sites in isolation by default and/or may be configured to monitor data received from file sharing sites and/or other interactions with file sharing sites (e.g., data received from and/or sent to a file sharing site by an enterprise user of a user computing device, such as user computing device <b>140</b> or user computing device <b>150</b>) even when such sites are not opened in isolation. Additional examples of how user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may open links to file sharing sites in isolation are discussed in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some instances, when opening a link in isolation and/or otherwise executing an isolation method, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may utilize one or more caching optimization rules. Such caching optimization rules may, for instance, define different caching policies for different members of different enterprise user groups. For examples, users who are members of a senior management user group within an enterprise organization may be allocated greater cache resources by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> than other users when user protection computing platform <b>110</b> is opening links in isolation and/or otherwise executing isolation methods (e.g., with respect to requests received from such users). Advantageously, such caching optimization rules may, for selected user groups, reduce delay and/or other impact on end-user experience that might otherwise be caused by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> opening links in isolation and/or otherwise executing isolation methods (e.g., due to the use of additional processing resources and/or network bandwidth that may be required by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> when opening links in isolation and/or otherwise executing isolation methods). In this way, such caching optimization rules may increase the overall effectiveness of user protection computing platform <b>110</b> when opening links in isolation and/or otherwise executing isolation methods, so as to protect information security, data integrity, and enterprise computing resources.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts an illustrative method for dynamically controlling access to linked content in electronic communications in accordance with one or more example embodiments.

For example, at step <b>1030</b>, after initiating the browser mirroring session with the first user computing device to provide the first user computing device with limited access to the first resource corresponding to the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message, the computing platform may scan the first resource using a live analysis service that is configured to analyze information received from the first resource while a user of the first user computing device is accessing the first resource and return an indication of whether the first resource is safe or malicious.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">For instance, after initiating the browser mirroring session with user computing device <b>140</b> to provide user computing device <b>140</b> with limited access to the first resource corresponding to the first uniform resource locator associated with the first email message, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may scan the first resource using phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d </i>to analyze information received from the first resource while a user of user computing device <b>140</b> is accessing the first resource. In addition, phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d </i>may return an indication of whether the first resource is safe or malicious, as discussed in greater detail below. Advantageously, by scanning the first resource using phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d</i>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may allow the user of user computing device <b>140</b> to break out of isolation if the resource is safe (and, e.g., thereby free up computing resources on user protection computing platform <b>110</b> and improve the user experience for the user of user computing device <b>140</b>) while also protecting the user of user computing device <b>140</b> and/or preserving the ability to take other cybersecurity actions if the resource is malicious.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">In some embodiments, scanning the first resource using the live analysis service may include scanning user-authenticated content received from the first resource after the user of the first user computing device is authenticated by the first resource. For example, in scanning the first resource using the live analysis service (e.g., phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d</i>) at step <b>1030</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may scan user-authenticated content received from the first resource after the user of user computing device <b>140</b> is authenticated by the first resource. Advantageously, by scanning user-authenticated content in this way (e.g., while the first resource is isolated from user computing device <b>140</b> as a result of the browser mirroring), user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may obtain a better, more accurate view of the resource and its behavior than might be gained if a conventional sandboxing approach (e.g., in which only non-authenticated content might be retrieved and/or analyzed by a monitoring and classification server) were used. This better, more accurate view provides various technical advantages, as user protection computing platform <b>110</b> can both more accurately identify resources that are actually malicious (e.g., particularly in instances where the malicious nature of a site or resource is not apparent until after the user is authenticated) while distinguishing resources that are actually safe and for which browser mirroring and/or other isolation is not required (e.g., so as to free up computing resources on user protection computing platform <b>110</b> and improve the user experience for the user of user computing device <b>140</b> and/or other users).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">At step <b>1035</b>, the computing platform may determine whether the linked resource is safe (e.g., based on the scanning performed by the live analysis service). For instance, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may determine whether it has received an indication that the site is safe from phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d </i>or an indication that the site is malicious from phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d</i>. For example, at step <b>1035</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may receive, from the live analysis service (e.g., phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d</i>), an indication that the first resource is safe. Alternatively, at step <b>1035</b>, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may receive, from the live analysis service (e.g., phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d</i>), an indication that the first resource is malicious.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">If the computing platform determines that the linked resource is safe, then at step <b>1040</b>, the computing platform may provide the user computing device with an option to break out of isolation. For example, at step <b>1040</b>, in response to receiving the indication that the first resource is safe from the live analysis service (e.g., phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d</i>), user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may provide a user-selectable option to break out of isolation to user computing device <b>140</b>. The user-selectable option to break out of isolation may, if selected, cause user protection computing platform <b>110</b> to end the browser mirroring session (and, e.g., thereby allow the user of user computing device <b>140</b> to directly access the linked resource), as in the examples discussed above.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">Alternatively, if the computing platform determines that the linked resource is not safe, then at step <b>1045</b>, the computing platform may capture and/or store data from the linked resource and/or perform other actions. For example, at step <b>1045</b>, in response to receiving the indication that the first resource is malicious from the live analysis service (e.g., phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d</i>), user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may store data captured from the first resource. For instance, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may store current and/or previous versions of the resource's DOM, other data received from the resource, data identifying the user's clickstream and/or other input to the resource, and/or other data. Any and/or all of this data may be used by user protection computing platform <b>110</b> in classifying and/or otherwise identifying malicious sites in connection with future requests. In some instances, if the computing platform determines that the linked resource is not safe, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> also may terminate the connection with the linked resource (e.g., so as to prevent and/or deny further access to the linked resource by user computing device <b>140</b> and/or isolation server <b>120</b>).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">In addition, at step <b>1050</b>, the computing platform may provide the data captured from the linked resource to a machine learning engine (which may, e.g., be hosted on and/or executed on the computing platform). For example, at step <b>1050</b>, in response to receiving the indication that the first resource is malicious from the live analysis service (e.g., phish detection service <b>112</b><i>d</i>), user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may provide the data captured from the first resource to a machine learning engine to train one or more machine learning models to recognize other malicious resources. The machine learning engine (which may, e.g., be hosted on and/or executed on user protection computing platform <b>110</b>) may create and/or update one or more machine learning models for identifying malicious content. For instance, the machine learning engine (which may, e.g., be hosted on and/or executed on user protection computing platform <b>110</b>) may train one or more classification models, neural networks, and/or machine-learning models based on the features associated with and/or data captured from actually malicious sites and/or other resources.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112">Subsequently, the computing platform may repeat one or more steps of the example method described above in processing other requests from the same user computing device and/or other user computing devices. For instance, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may repeat one or more steps of the example method described above in processing a second request from user computing device <b>150</b>. For example, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may receive, via the communication interface (e.g., communication interface <b>113</b>), from a second user computing device (e.g., user computing device <b>150</b>), a second request for a second uniform resource locator associated with a second email message. Subsequently, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may evaluate the second request for the second uniform resource locator associated with the second email message using one or more isolation criteria. Based on evaluating the second request for the second uniform resource locator associated with the second email message using the one or more isolation criteria, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may identify that the second request meets at least one isolation condition associated with the one or more isolation criteria. In response to identifying that the second request meets the at least one isolation condition associated with the one or more isolation criteria, user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may initiate a browser mirroring session with the second user computing device (e.g., user computing device <b>150</b>) to provide the second user computing device (e.g., user computing device <b>150</b>) with limited access to a second resource corresponding to the second uniform resource locator associated with the second email message, similar to how user protection computing platform <b>110</b> may provide limited access to the first resource in the examples discussed above.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">One or more aspects of the disclosure may be embodied in computer-usable data or computer-executable instructions, such as in one or more program modules, executed by one or more computers or other devices to perform the operations described herein.
