For this reason, it has been difficult to arrange each component at a predetermined position by absorbing variations in a shape of each of the plurality of bus bars or variations in a position of a terminal of each coil. In addition, positional displacement of each component also occurs due to variations in a shape of the insulator, and it has been difficult to reliably connect the coils.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention has been made in view of such drawbacks. An object of the present invention is to provide a bus bar guide capable of absorbing variations in a shape and arrangement of each component and reliably connecting coils, a bus bar assembly using the bus bar guide, and a motor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve the above object, a bus bar guide of the present invention is a bus bar guide that fixes a bus bar that connects a plurality of coils provided in a motor, in which the bus bar includes a conductor having a plate shape and having a pair of first surfaces that extend in a radial direction and face each other and a pair of second surfaces that extend in an axial direction, are continuous with the pair of first surfaces, and face each other, the bus bar guide is configured by annularly arranging a plurality of bus bar guide pieces each including an insulator, and each of the plurality of bus bar guide pieces is provided with a groove that holds one of the pair of first surfaces of the bus bar and positions the bus bar.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The bus bar assembly of the present invention includes at least the bus bar guide and the plurality of bus bars disposed in the plurality of grooves provided on the upper surface of the bus bar guide.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A motor of the present invention includes at least a rotor having an output shaft at an axial center, a stator disposed with a predetermined space from the rotor, the bus bar assembly attached to an upper part of the stator, in which the stator includes a yoke having an annular shape, a plurality of teeth connected to an inner circumference of the yoke at predetermined intervals, and a plurality of coils respectively attached to the plurality of teeth, and two of the plurality of coils are electrically connected via one of the plurality of bus bars.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the bus bar guide of the present invention, variations in the shape of the bus bar can be absorbed, and the plurality of bus bars can be easily disposed in the bus bar guide. In the bus bar assembly of the present invention, variations in the shape of the bus bar can be absorbed, and the plurality of bus bars can be easily disposed in the bus bar guide. In the motor of the present invention, the plurality of bus bars can be easily installed in the bus bar guide. Since the plurality of bus bars are positioned and disposed in the bus bar guide, the assembly process of the motor is simplified, and the assembly cost can be reduced.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top view of a motor according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional view along line II-II in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a top view of a bus bar guide.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a top view of the bus bar guide in which a bus bar is disposed in a groove.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a perspective view of the bus bar guide illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a top view of the bus bar.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a schematic sectional view taken along line VB-VB in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> is an enlarged view of an end of the bus bar illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is an enlarged top view of the groove.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is a schematic sectional view taken along line VIB-VIB in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is an enlarged top view of a gap.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is a schematic view of a vicinity of the gap as viewed from a radial direction.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a perspective view of a bus bar according to a first modification.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is an enlarged schematic view of a connection between a bus bar and a lead according to the first modification.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a top view of a bus bar according to a second modification.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.
