This layer of sebum film can retain water and form a moist, nutritious environment that is conducive to the survival of microorganisms. The quality of the scalp will be affected by factors such as immunity, epidermal shielding, genetics, mood, nutrition, pH, and moisture, which in turn affects the amount of lipid (sebum) secreted.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When the sebaceous glands are interfered by the organism itself and the external environment, the function of the sebaceous glands in regulating lipid secretion is weakened, and the sebaceous glands cannot properly regulate the secretion of lipid. For example, aging, excessive use of cleansing shampoos, long-term exposure to ultraviolet rays, or dry conditions in winter may all be the cause of less lipid secretion by sebaceous glands. When the sebum secretion is insufficient to form a complete sebum film to protect the scalp, it will cause damage to the epidermal layer of the scalp or loss of water, making the scalp dry, itchy, rough, and dull, erythema, or even dry desquamation in appearance. (AbramovitsW, Gonzalez-ServaA. Sebum, cosmetics, and skin care. <i>Dermatol Clin. </i>2000;18(4):617-620. doi:10.1016/S0733-8635(05)70212-6).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to solve the problem of too little lipid secretion by the sebaceous glands, there are therapeutic drugs on the market. In the case of external medicines, generally anti-inflammatory ingredients, anti-itching ingredients, skin tissue repair ingredients, bactericidal ingredients and/or cooling sensation ingredients are included. Specifically, the anti-inflammatory ingredient can be prednisolone acid (PVA) (prodrug steroid) or glycyrrhetinic acid, the anti-itching ingredient can be crotamiton, the skin tissue repair ingredient can be allantoin, the bactericidal ingredient can be isopropyl methylphenol, and the cooling sensation ingredient can be I-menthol.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, therapeutic drugs assist in reducing the uncomfortable symptoms caused by insufficient sebum. If you want to eliminate the symptoms of discomfort fundamentally, you must focus on the problem of insufficient sebum secretion. Therefore, it is still expected in the market to develop a product that can promote sebaceous glands to secrete lipid.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention found that derived peptides of lactoferrin (LF) can effectively promote and/or increase the lipid synthesis of sebocytes, and can be used as an alternative solution to solve problems such as too little lipid on the scalp.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present invention provides a derived peptide of a lactoferrin (LF) for promoting and/or increasing lipid synthesis, wherein the derived peptide of the lactoferrin comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 01.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the promoting and/or increasing lipid synthesis refers the lipid synthesis of a subject's cells is promoted or increased so that a content of a synthesized lipid is increased.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, an increase ratio of the content of the synthesized lipid to that of a non-administrated subject ranges from 10 to 60%.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, the present invention provides a composition for promoting and/or increasing lipid synthesis, comprising a derived peptide of a lactoferrin, wherein the derived peptide of the lactoferrin comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 01.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the composition comprises about 5 &#x3bc;g/mL to 1000 &#x3bc;g/mL the derived peptide of the lactoferrin.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the composition comprises one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, a dosage form of the composition is an ointment, a gel, a cream, an emulsion, a liquid, a wax, a powder, a spray, a gel spray, a foam, a shampoo, a treatment agent, a scalp treatment agent, a tonic, a drop or a patch.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the promoting and/or increasing lipid synthesis refers the lipid synthesis of a subject's cells is promoted or increased so that a content of a synthesized lipid is increased.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, an increase ratio of the content of the synthesized lipid to that of a non-administrated subject ranges from 10 to 60%.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for promoting and/or increasing lipid synthesis, comprising administering the composition as described above to a subject.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the promoting and/or increasing lipid synthesis is achieved by administering the composition comprising the derived peptide of the lactoferrin to a subject.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, an effective amount of the composition administered to the subject ranges from 5 &#x3bc;g/mL to 1000 &#x3bc;g/mL.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, a route of administering the composition to the subject is transdermal.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, a frequency of administering the composition to the subject is daily, at least one day apart or weekly.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the promoting and/or increasing lipid synthesis refers the lipid synthesis of the subject's cells is promoted or increased so that a content of a synthesized lipid is increased.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, an increase percentage of the content of the synthesized lipid to that of a non-administrated subject ranges from 10 to 60%.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the subject's cells refer to sebocytes.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the lipid synthesis is induced by linoleic acid.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the lipid content of sebocytes in the negative control group, the positive control group, and different types of lactoferrin peptide groups.

Alternatively, it refers to a polypeptide. When the amino acid is an &#x3b1;-amino acid, L-optical isomer or D-optical isomer can be used. In addition, it may also contain unnatural amino acids such as &#x3b2;-alanine, phenylglycine and homoarginine. The standard abbreviation of amino acids is used.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; as used herein refers to a material that is generally used to prepare pharmaceutical or cosmetic compositions to improve stability, sterility, and delivery. When the peptide delivery system is formulated as a solution or suspension, the delivery system is in an acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Insufficient sebum in the scalp can cause damage to the epidermal layer or loss of water, and symptoms such as dryness, itching, and roughness of the scalp, dull appearance, erythema, and even desquamation can occur. Although there are therapeutic drugs on the market, they can only assist in reducing the above-mentioned uncomfortable symptoms, and cannot fundamentally solve the problem of insufficient sebum secretion.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this regard, an object of the present invention is to develop a novel composition, which would not cause other discomfort to the user, such as inflammation, or other diseases or symptoms derived therefrom. This novel composition can also start from the source of the problem to promote the production of sebum.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In view of the above, the present invention develops a derived peptide of a lactoferrin, which can promote the sebaceous glands of the scalp to secrete lipid and/or increase the lipid secretion rate of the sebaceous glands of the scalp. The derived peptide of the lactoferrin can be obtained by chemical synthesis. In one embodiment, the derived peptide of the lactoferrin comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:01.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention also develops a composition, which comprises the derived peptide of the lactoferrin as described above. In one embodiment, the composition comprises the derived peptide of the lactoferrin in an amount of about 5 &#x3bc;g/mL to 1000 &#x3bc;g/mL, preferably about 100 &#x3bc;g/mL to 500 &#x3bc;g/mL, and more preferably about 200 &#x3bc;g/mL to 400 &#x3bc;g/mL.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The composition of the present invention includes a carrier for improving stability, sterility, and delivery without affecting the biological activity of the derived peptide of the lactoferrin. In one embodiment, the composition includes one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In a preferred embodiment, the acceptable carrier is an aqueous carrier. Various aqueous carriers can be used, such as water, buffer, 0.8% saline, 0.3% glycine, hyaluronic acid and the like. In addition, the composition may contain physiologically acceptable auxiliary substances that can approach physiological conditions as required, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, solution tension adjusting agents, wetting agents, and the like. Specific examples include sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, and the like.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The composition of the present invention, without affecting the biological activity of the derived peptide of the lactoferrin, can be formulated using known and widely used techniques. In one embodiment, the dosage form of the composition is an external agent. The external agent is not particularly limited as long as the composition can be applied, sprayed, or adhered to the part to be administered (affected part) of the skin of the individual to be administered. Examples of external agents include ointments, gels, creams, emulsions, liquids, waxes, powders, sprays, gel sprays, foams, shampoos, treatment agents, scalp treatment agents, tonic, drops or patches. In a preferred embodiment, the dosage form of the composition is an ointment, a gel, a cream, an emulsion, a liquid, a spray, a shampoo, a treatment agent, drops or a patch. The above-mentioned external agents can use the derived peptide of the lactoferrin as active ingredients, and then pharmaceutically acceptable bases or various additives as required can be added as needed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The ointment preparation of the present invention can be either an oily base or a water-soluble base, and both of them can be easily obtained according to known methods. Oily bases, such as vaseline, have little irritation, and are odorless and excellent in skin protection, softening, scab removal, granulation formation and epithelialization promotion. Although vaseline changes its viscosity and consistency due to temperature and thus has different hardness in winter and summer, it is one of the bases with high safety. Vaseline includes yellow petrolatum and white petrolatum with higher purity, both of which can be used. The water-soluble base is a macrogol-based ointment, which has a strong effect of absorbing and removing aqueous secretions. Ointment (vaseline preparation) can be prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of the derived peptide of the lactoferrin in distilled water or physiological saline to form an aqueous solution and then further mixing it with known or conventional vaseline and stirring according to the known or conventional methods.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The gel agent (suspension base) of the present invention is a water-containing gel, an anhydrous gel, and a low-water content gel composed of a swellable gel-forming material. Furthermore, the gel agent may also be a hydrogel base or a lyogel base, preferably a transparent hydrogel with inorganic or organic polymers as the base. The gel itself is not absorbed by the skin like preparations containing oil or fat. The hydrogel base is a substance that is fat-free, has an ointment-like consistency, and aims to improve the transdermal absorbability of the drug. The lyogel base is a substance obtained by suspending stearyl alcohol and the like in propylene glycol and gelling, and has excellent transdermal absorbability and hygroscopicity. The gel agent can also be used as a gel spray after being filled in a spray container. The gel agent of the present invention can be obtained by uniformly dispersing the derived peptide of the lactoferrin in a hydrophilic gel base. The hydrophilic gel base includes carboxy vinyl polymer, sodium polyacrylate, (vinyl methyl ether/ethyl maleate) copolymer, polymethacrylate, propylene glycol, and the like. The gel agent may be prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of the derived peptide of the lactoferrin in distilled water or physiological saline to form an aqueous solution and then further mixing it with known or conventional gel bases and stirring according to known or conventional methods.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The cream (emulsion base) of the present invention may be an oil-in-water base (O/W) (vanishing cream) or a water-in-oil base (W/O) (cold cream). The oil-in-water base has less oil-soluble components than water-soluble components, and has the advantage that the whiteness of the cream disappears when it is applied. The cream has good pushing uniformity, good feeling of use on sweaty skin, excellent cosmetic properties and good skin absorption. The water-in-oil base has less water-soluble components than oil-soluble components, and has a cooling effect when it is applied to and pushed evenly on the skin, so it is also called cold cream.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Compared with ointments or creams, the emulsion of the present invention adheres to the hair and is more suitable for use on hair parts and the like. The type of the emulsion can be any of a suspension emulsion base, an emulsive emulsion, and a solution emulsion base.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The liquid of the present invention is obtained by dissolving the derived peptide of the lactoferrin as an active ingredient in alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, water and the like as a base.

Sample Preparation</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Lactoferrin peptide Lf13 and lactoferrin peptide LfB562-568 were purchased from DgPeptides Co., Ltd (Hangzhou, China). The purity and composition of these lactoferrin peptides were confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometer. 10 mg of the freeze-dried powder of the peptide was dissolved in 1 mL of double deionized water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O) and stored at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. for use as a sample of lactoferrin peptide. Nile red was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (Missouri, USA). Nile Red was dissolved in 1 mg/mL acetone and used as a dye for later use.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">2. Cell Culture</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Human sebocytes (Cat. No. 36079-01, Celprogen, Torrance, Calif., USA) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM): Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12) purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Limited (Barrington, Ill., USA), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) purchased from Gibco, Grand Island, N.Y., USA and penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/50 g/mL), incubated at 37&#xb0; C. in the 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">3. Neutral Fat Detection</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Human sebocytes were implanted in 24- or 96-well plates. After 24 hours of culture, the cells were divided into a negative control group, a positive control group and an experimental group. The negative control group did not receive any treatment, the positive control group was added 0.1 mM linoleic acid (LA), and the experimental group was added 0.1 mM linoleic acid (LA) and 50 to 200 &#x3bc;g/mL lactoferrin peptide Lf13 or 50 &#x3bc;g/mL lactoferrin peptide LfB562-568. The treated human sebocytes were cultured for two days. Human sebocytes were fixed with 4% formaldehyde at room temperature. After 60 minutes of fixation, the cells were washed with PBS and stain with Nile Red solution (1 &#x3bc;g/ml in PBS) at 37&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes.

Compared with the negative control group in A, the fluorescence intensity of the positive control group in B increases, indicating that the addition of LA in the positive control group does induce lipid synthesis. The fluorescence intensity of the experimental group in C was increased compared with that of the positive control group in B, indicating that the addition of lactoferrin peptide Lf13 in the experimental group in C could promote and/or increase the lipid synthesis induced by LA, thereby increasing the final lipid content. However, compared with the positive control group in B, the fluorescence intensity of the experimental group in D did not increase significantly, indicating that the addition of the lactoferrin peptide LfB562-568 in the experimental group in D could not significantly promote and/or increase the lipid synthesis induced by LA, and could not greatly increase the final lipid content.
