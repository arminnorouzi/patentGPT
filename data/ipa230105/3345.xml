REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese patent application JP 2021-110899 filed on Jul. 2, 2021, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a pressure vessel.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">JP 2018-086875 A discloses a vehicle having a plurality of pressure vessels (also referred to as high-pressure tanks, for example) storing gas. These pressure vessels have pressure relief valves, each configured to open when a temperature of the pressure vessel reaches a predetermined temperature or higher. Each of the pressure relief valves has a gas release direction adjusted so as to release the gas in the pressure vessel in a predetermined direction, such as an obliquely rearward and downward direction of the vehicle. JP 2021-028519 A discloses a pressure vessel mounting structure incorporating a fusible-plug-type pressure relief valve (also referred to as a fusible plug valve, for example) as such a pressure relief valve.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the above-stated conventional pressure vessel, since gas is released in a fixed direction when the pressure relief valve is open, there may be some inconvenience depending on the attitude of the vehicle or the surrounding environment. That is, in the above-stated conventional pressure vessel, when the pressure vessel (pressure relief valve) is mounted on the vehicle, for example, the release direction of the gas from the pressure relief valve is a single direction determined with respect to the vehicle. When viewed in reference to the vehicle, however, there may be some direction in which the gas should not be released depending on the attitude of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure has been made in view of the foregoing, and provides a pressure vessel capable of adapting a release direction of the gas in the pressure vessel (i.e., release-permitted direction) and a direction in which the gas in the pressure vessel should not be released (i.e., release-restricted direction) to the attitude of the vehicle or the surrounding environment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the foregoing, a pressure vessel according to the present disclosure stores gas and includes: a pressure relief valve configured to open when a temperature of the pressure vessel reaches a predetermined temperature or higher; and a release direction control unit configured to release the gas in a predetermined direction as the pressure relief valve opens. The release direction control unit is configured to: variably change, with respect to the pressure vessel, a release direction of the gas as the pressure relief valve opens, and without depending on an attitude of the pressure vessel, release the gas stored in the pressure vessel as the pressure relief valve opens in a release-permitted direction set in advance with respect to a gravity direction, not in a release-restricted direction set in advance with respect to the gravity direction.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the release direction control unit is configured to variably change, with respect to the pressure vessel, a release direction of the gas as the pressure relief valve opens so as to offset a change in an attitude of the pressure vessel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the release direction control unit includes a guide member provided with a release opening or a release passage for releasing the gas and configured to move rotationally relative to the pressure vessel, and is configured to allow the guide member to move rotationally relative to the pressure vessel in accordance with a change in an attitude of the pressure vessel, and variably change, with respect to the pressure vessel, a release direction of the gas as the pressure relief valve opens.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the pressure vessel is provided with a projection portion having a plurality of release passages for releasing the gas. The guide member is slidably mounted around the projection portion and includes a shield wall that comes into sliding contact with an outer surface of the projection portion and the release opening for releasing the gas, and is configured to, when an attitude of the pressure vessel changes, move rotationally relative to the projection portion, close a release passage facing the release-restricted direction with the shield wall, and open a release passage facing the release-permitted direction with the release opening.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the guide member is configured to, when an attitude of the pressure vessel changes, open one release passage facing the release-permitted direction with the release opening.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the pressure vessel is provided with a projection portion having at least one release passage for releasing the gas. The guide member is mounted around the projection portion with a gap that allows the gas to pass therethrough, and includes a shield wall that is opposed to an outer surface of the projection portion and the release opening for releasing the gas, and is configured to, when an attitude of the pressure vessel changes, move rotationally relative to the projection portion, when the release passage is facing the release-restricted direction, block the gas to be released in the release-restricted direction through the release passage with the shield wall and release the gas from the release opening via the gap formed between the projection portion and the shield wall, and when the release passage is facing the release-permitted direction, release the gas to be released in the release-permitted direction through the release passage from the release opening not via the gap.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the guide member includes a plurality of release openings, and the shield wall is provided with a protrusion for releasing the gas to be released in the release-restricted direction through the release passage from one of the plurality of release openings via the gap formed between the projection portion and the shield wall.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the pressure vessel is provided with a storage portion including a storage chamber that is open to an outside via an open space, and the guide member is rotatably stored in the storage chamber of the storage portion and includes a plurality of release passages for releasing the gas, and is configured to, when an attitude of the pressure vessel changes, move rotationally relative to the storage portion and open a release passage facing the release-permitted direction via the open space.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the open space is configured such that one of the plurality of release passages is opened when an attitude of the pressure vessel changes.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the guide member is configured such that a center of gravity is disposed eccentrically with respect to a center of rotation, and without depending on an attitude of the pressure vessel, an attitude with respect to a gravity direction does not change by gravity.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the pressure vessel includes an inclination sensor for detecting an attitude of the pressure vessel, a motor for allowing the guide member to move rotationally, and a controller for controlling operation of the motor to allow the guide member to move rotationally, in which the controller is configured to control operation of the motor based on the attitude of the pressure vessel detected by the inclination sensor.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the release-restricted direction includes a predetermined angular range with respect to a horizontal direction and the release-permitted direction includes a predetermined angular range with respect to a vertical direction other than the release-restricted direction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the present disclosure, since the release direction of the gas in the pressure vessel (i.e., release-permitted direction) and the direction in which the gas in the pressure vessel should not be released (i.e., release-restricted direction) can be variably changed with respect to the pressure vessel including the pressure relief valve, it is possible to adapt the release direction of the gas in the pressure vessel (i.e., release-permitted direction) and the direction in which the gas in the pressure vessel should not be released (i.e., release-restricted direction) to the attitude of the vehicle or the surrounding environment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other words, it is possible to control the release direction of the gas from the pressure relief valve without depending on the attitude of the vehicle or the surrounding environment.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

It should be noted that an arrow FR, an arrow UP, and an arrow RH given to each figure as appropriate respectively indicate the front side, upper side, and right side of the vehicle in a vehicle <b>100</b> to which the pressure vessel is applied. Hereinafter, when a description is made by use of merely the front and rear sides, the upper and lower sides, and the right and left sides, they indicate the front and rear sides in the vehicle front-rear direction, the upper and lower sides in the vehicle up-down direction, and the right and left sides in the vehicle width direction in a state of the vehicle facing an advancing direction, respectively, unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">(Vehicle <b>100</b>)</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the vehicle <b>100</b> to which the pressure vessel according to the present embodiment is applied includes a motor (not shown) as a driving source. The motor is mechanically coupled to driving wheels (at least either of front wheels <b>102</b> or rear wheels <b>104</b>) of the vehicle <b>100</b> directly or indirectly via shift means such as a deceleration gear train. This transmits the driving force output from the motor to the driving wheels.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, the vehicle <b>100</b> includes a fuel cell stack (not shown). Electric power is generated when hydrogen and air are supplied to the fuel cell stack, and the electric power is supplied from the fuel cell stack to the motor so that the motor is driven. That is, the vehicle <b>100</b> is a so-called fuel cell vehicle.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">(Pressure Vessel Unit <b>1</b>)</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A pressure vessel unit <b>1</b> is disposed between the front wheels <b>102</b> and the rear wheels <b>104</b> in a lower part of the vehicle <b>100</b>. More specifically, the pressure vessel unit <b>1</b> is disposed below a floor panel (not shown) constituting a floor of a vehicle cabin.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The pressure vessel unit <b>1</b> includes a case <b>2</b> formed in a box-shape, and a pressure vessel <b>10</b> is provided inside of the case <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It should be noted that areas R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b>, R<b>4</b> indicated by dashed and single-dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are examples of a range (direction) in which gas should not be released under the laws and regulations, in other words, a range (direction) in which the release of gas is restricted (hereinafter this may also be referred to as a release-restricted range). This release-restricted range includes a release-restricted range R<b>1</b> in a wheel housing or in a direction of the wheel housing, a release-restricted range R<b>2</b> of the pressure vessel unit <b>1</b> (or the pressure vessel <b>10</b> thereof), a release-restricted range R<b>3</b> in the front side of the vehicle (ahead of the vehicle cabin thereof), and a release-restricted range R<b>4</b> in a horizontal direction (in parallel with the road surface) from the rear part or the side face of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, an area (direction) P indicated by a hollow arrow by solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an example of a range (direction) in which the release of gas is permitted (hereinafter this may also be referred to as a release-permitted range).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">(Pressure Vessel <b>10</b>)</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a plurality of pressure vessels <b>10</b> is disposed inside of the case <b>2</b> of the pressure vessel unit <b>1</b>. Each of the pressure vessels <b>10</b> extends in the vehicle front-rear direction as an axial direction, and is formed in a substantially cylindrical shape. These pressure vessels <b>10</b> are configured to store therein a hydrogen gas as a high-pressure gas.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the present embodiment, ten pressure vessels <b>10</b> are provided inside of the case <b>2</b> so as to be arranged side by side in a line (in a layer) in the vehicle width direction. It should be noted that in the present embodiment, the pressure vessel <b>10</b> is made of an aluminum alloy as a main component, but is not limited thereto, and may be made of a resin as a main component. For example, the pressure vessel <b>10</b> is configured to have an outer layer as a reinforcing layer made of carbon fiber impregnated with resin (carbon fiber-reinforced resin) on the outer circumference of a resin liner.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">(Manifold <b>14</b>)</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Here, a mouthpiece <b>12</b> is attached to an end portion of the pressure vessel <b>10</b>, on one side in the axial direction (the vehicle front side), and a manifold <b>14</b> as a pipe is coupled to the mouthpiece <b>12</b>. The manifold <b>14</b> extends along the front wall of the case <b>2</b>, with its longitudinal direction being along the vehicle width direction. The manifold <b>14</b> includes a general passage <b>14</b>A via which internal spaces of the plurality of pressure vessels <b>10</b> communicate with each other. Further, a valve <b>16</b> is provided at the center of the manifold <b>14</b> in the longitudinal direction, and the pressure vessels <b>10</b> communicate with the valve <b>16</b> provided on the outside of the case <b>2</b> via the general passage <b>14</b>A. The valve <b>16</b> is an opening-closing valve having a function to open and close the pressure vessels <b>10</b>, and the valve <b>16</b> is coupled to the above-stated fuel cell stack (not shown) via coupling means such as a pipe. By adjusting opening and closing of the valve <b>16</b>, a supply amount of hydrogen gas to be supplied to the fuel cell stack from the pressure vessels <b>10</b> is adjusted.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The manifold <b>14</b> is fixed to the lower face side of the case <b>2</b> via a protector <b>18</b>F disposed on the vehicle front side.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Meanwhile, an end portion of the pressure vessel <b>10</b>, on the other side in the axial direction (the vehicle rear side) is fixed to the lower face side of the case <b>2</b> via a protector <b>18</b>R disposed on the vehicle rear side. This prevents the pressure vessel <b>10</b> from moving in the case <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the manifold <b>14</b> includes a discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B branching from the general passage <b>14</b>A, in the vicinity of an outer end portion (a right end portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) in the vehicle width direction. The discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B extends to the vehicle rear side from the general passage <b>14</b>A. This discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B is provided with a pressure relief valve <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">(Pressure Relief Valve <b>19</b>)</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The pressure relief valve <b>19</b> is a valve mechanism configured to open when a temperature of the pressure vessel <b>10</b> reaches a predetermined temperature or higher. In the present embodiment, a fusible-plug-type pressure relief valve is provided as the pressure relief valve <b>19</b>. The pressure relief valve <b>19</b> is configured to release the hydrogen gas in the pressure vessel <b>10</b> to the outside when the temperature of the pressure vessel <b>10</b> reaches a predetermined temperature or higher because of fire or the like, so as to prevent the pressure vessel <b>10</b> from having an excessively high inner pressure. Normally, the discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B is configured to be closed by the pressure relief valve <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The pressure relief valve <b>19</b> includes a heat-sensitive portion formed of a fusible alloy made of a material such as low-melting metal, e.g., lead, tin, or the like as an example. When the temperature of the vehicle lower part becomes high for example, and reaches a predetermined temperature or higher, the heat-sensitive portion melts. In other words, the heat-sensitive portion is formed of an alloy that melts when the pressure relief valve <b>19</b> is exposed to a predetermined temperature higher than a supposed temperature under a normal gas-supply condition. For example, a binary alloy formed of bismuth (Bi) and indium (In) is used for the heat-sensitive portion.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the temperature of the vehicle lower part becomes high for example, and reaches a predetermined temperature or higher, the heat-sensitive portion of the pressure relief valve <b>19</b> melts, so that the discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B is opened.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">That is, in the present embodiment, the pressure vessel <b>10</b> storing a high-pressure gas therein is mounted in the lower part of the vehicle <b>100</b>, and the manifold <b>14</b> is coupled to the pressure vessel <b>10</b>. The manifold <b>14</b> includes the general passage <b>14</b>A and the discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B, and the general passage <b>14</b>A allows the pressure vessel <b>10</b> to communicate with the valve <b>16</b>. Meanwhile, the discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B branches from the general passage <b>14</b>A and is normally closed by the pressure relief valve <b>19</b>. When the temperature of the lower part of the vehicle <b>100</b> becomes high under the heating environment for example, and reaches a predetermined temperature or higher, at least a portion (heat-sensitive portion) of the pressure relief valve <b>19</b> melts and the discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B is opened, so that the high-pressure gas stored in the pressure vessel <b>10</b> is discharged from the discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For the detailed structure of the pressure relief valve <b>19</b>, refer to JP 2021-028519 A, for example, as appropriate. In addition, the pressure relief valve <b>19</b> can have any structure as long as it is designed to open when the temperature reaches a predetermined temperature or higher.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As described above, when the discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B is opened, it communicates with a release passage of a release direction control unit <b>20</b>, which will be described later. Accordingly, the high-pressure gas is configured to flow through the discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B and to be released through the release passage that opens to the outside of the case <b>2</b> (which will be described later).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It should be noted that the position of the pressure vessel unit <b>1</b> mounted is not limited to the illustrated example. For example, the pressure vessel unit <b>1</b> may be mounted below the rear seat or in the rear part of the vehicle, for example. In addition, the arrangement of the pressure vessels <b>10</b> inside of the case <b>2</b> is not limited to the illustrated example. For example, a plurality of lines (a plurality of layers) of the pressure vessels <b>10</b> may be arranged side by side in the vehicle width direction, or one line (one layer) of the pressure vessels <b>10</b> or a plurality of lines (a plurality of layers) of the pressure vessels <b>10</b> may extend with their axial direction being along the vehicle right-left direction and be arranged side by side.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the present embodiment, the vehicle <b>100</b> is a fuel cell vehicle and stores a hydrogen gas that is a fuel gas in the pressure vessel <b>10</b>, but the example of a gas stored is not limited thereto. For example, the vehicle <b>100</b> may store a natural gas that is a fuel gas in the pressure vessel <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, it is needless to mention that the position or shape of the discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B of the manifold <b>14</b>, the configuration of the arrangement of the pressure relief valve <b>19</b>, and the like are not limited to the illustrated example.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">(Release Direction Control Unit <b>20</b>)</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">To release the high-pressure gas to be discharged from the discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B to the outside of the case <b>2</b>, the high-pressure gas need be released, not to a release-restricted range (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b>, R<b>4</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, but only to a release-permitted range other than the release-restricted range. Herein, the release-restricted range (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b>) except R<b>4</b> is a range determined with respect to the vehicle <b>100</b>. As for the release-restricted range (R<b>4</b>), it is considered that the range (direction) is not determined with respect to the vehicle <b>100</b>, and may change, when viewed in reference to the vehicle <b>100</b>, depending on the attitude of the vehicle or the surrounding environment (for example, roll or pitch of the vehicle <b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Then, in the present embodiment, to adapt the release direction of the gas in the pressure vessel <b>10</b> (i.e., release-permitted direction) and the direction in which the gas in the pressure vessel <b>10</b> should not be released (i.e., release-restricted direction) to the attitude of the vehicle or the surrounding environment, a release direction control unit <b>20</b> is disposed on the rear side face (rear end face) of the manifold <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The release direction control unit <b>20</b>, though a detailed structure thereof will be described later, includes a mechanism for releasing the gas in the pressure vessel <b>10</b> in a predetermined direction.

The release passage of the release direction control unit <b>20</b> is coupled to the downstream side (rear end portion) of the discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B. Accordingly, the high-pressure gas to be discharged from the discharge gas passage <b>14</b>B is configured to be released in the predetermined direction outside of the case <b>2</b> (see the arrow directions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). It should be noted that the case <b>2</b> is provided with a release opening (not shown) for releasing the gas to be discharged from the release passage of the release direction control unit <b>20</b> to the outside of the case <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the present embodiment, the release direction control unit <b>20</b> is configured to variably change, with respect to the vehicle <b>100</b> (or the pressure vessel <b>10</b> mounted thereon), the gas release direction as the pressure relief valve <b>19</b> opens so as to release the gas stored in the pressure vessel <b>10</b> as the pressure relief valve <b>19</b> opens, not in the release-restricted direction set in advance with respect to the gravity direction, but (only) in the release-permitted direction set in advance with respect to the gravity direction, without depending on the attitude (rotation, inclination) of the vehicle <b>100</b> (or the pressure vessel <b>10</b> mounted thereon).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Specifically, the release direction control unit <b>20</b> is configured to variably change, with respect to the vehicle <b>100</b> (or the pressure vessel <b>10</b> mounted thereon), the gas release direction as the pressure relief valve <b>19</b> opens so as to offset (cancel) the change in the attitude (rotation, inclination) of the vehicle <b>100</b> (or the pressure vessel <b>10</b> mounted thereon).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Specifically, the release direction control unit <b>20</b> is configured to allow a guide member (which can move rotationally relative to the pressure vessel <b>10</b>), which will be described later, to move rotationally with respect to the pressure vessel <b>10</b> in accordance with the change in the attitude of the vehicle <b>100</b> (or the pressure vessel <b>10</b> mounted thereon), and variably change, with respect to the vehicle <b>100</b> (or the pressure vessel <b>10</b> mounted thereon), the gas release direction as the pressure relief valve <b>19</b> opens.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Here, in one example, the release-restricted direction (range) includes a predetermined angular range with respect to the horizontal direction and corresponds to the release-restricted range R<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

Accordingly, even if the attitude of the vehicle <b>100</b> (i.e., the pressure vessel <b>10</b>) changes (rotation or inclination), the guide members <b>40</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>80</b> move rotationally relative to the manifold <b>14</b> (pressure vessel <b>10</b>) (more specifically, move rotationally so as to offset the change in the attitude of the vehicle <b>100</b>) such that the attitude with respect to the gravity direction will not change.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">It should be noted that, other than the above-described control instruction, the controller <b>90</b> may generate a control instruction to stop the guide members <b>40</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>80</b> at any position in accordance with the change in the attitude of the vehicle <b>100</b> and output the control instruction to the motor <b>92</b>.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The aspect of releasing the high-pressure gas in the pressure vessel <b>10</b> after electronically controlling the guide members <b>40</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>80</b> to move rotationally by the controller <b>90</b> is equal to that described in the foregoing first to third embodiments.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">[Operational Effects of the Fourth Embodiment]</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">As described above, in the fourth embodiment, the pressure vessel <b>10</b> includes the inclination sensor <b>91</b> for detecting the attitude of the pressure vessel <b>10</b>, the motor <b>92</b> for allowing the guide member to move rotationally, and the controller <b>90</b> for controlling the operation of the motor <b>92</b> to allow the guide member to move rotationally. The controller <b>90</b> controls the operation of the motor <b>92</b> so as to offset the change in the attitude of the pressure vessel <b>10</b> (to allow the guide member to move rotationally relative to the pressure vessel <b>10</b> in the opposite direction to the change in the attitude of the pressure vessel <b>10</b>) based on the attitude of the pressure vessel <b>10</b> detected by the inclination sensor <b>91</b>.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">This allows controlling the release direction of the gas from the pressure relief valve <b>19</b> without depending on the attitude of the vehicle or the surrounding environment in the same manner as the foregoing first to third embodiments.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Since the controller <b>90</b> electronically controls the guide members <b>40</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>80</b> to move rotationally with use of the driving force of the motor <b>92</b> to determine the release direction of the gas stored in the pressure vessel <b>10</b>, the fourth embodiment can produce advantageous effects of precisely controlling the release direction of the gas stored in the pressure vessel <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">It should be noted that in the foregoing first to fourth embodiments, basically the pressure vessel <b>10</b> has a configuration adapting to roll rotation of the vehicle <b>100</b>.
