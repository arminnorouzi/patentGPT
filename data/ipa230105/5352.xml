Monitoring gas pressure is a complex matter, in part because pressure can vary due to many factors, including gas supply, user gas demand, pipe lengths, bends, joints, and gas friction with pipe interiors and other gas. Moreover, known systems tend to respond slowly to over-pressure events, in part because of latencies within communication networks, headend application latencies, and human delays. Accordingly, substantial gas pressure increases can result in damage before the increases are detected, reversed and/or mitigated.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The detailed description is described with reference to the accompanying figures.

In one example, a first device measures gas pressure. If a gas pressure that is over a threshold value is detected, the first device sends a message to a second device, which may be near the first device (e.g., both devices may be on a same gas delivery pipeline). The second device may respond by indicating its own gas over-pressure condition, thereby suggesting that the gas over-pressure condition is not localized at the first device (e.g., a first smart gas meter). Alternatively, the second device may not detect and/or report an over-pressure condition, thereby suggesting that the over-pressure condition may be localized to the first device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further example, the first device may share information about its over-pressure condition with devices within a group defined to include the first and the second devices and other devices. Members of the group may share information with devices in any group(s) in which they are members and/or with devices that are within a threshold physical (geographic) distance. An appropriate response may be made within the gas delivery system depending on if the over-pressure condition is localized to the first device, or more widely present within the group of devices. In examples, protective measures may be taken, such as closing valves providing gas to appropriate service sites, and such as sending warning notices to a headend device (e.g., to the utility company), to users' devices including users' cellphones and in-home devices, and to any other device(s) that may assist in mitigating damage and/or injury.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Example System and Techniques</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example gas delivery system <b>100</b>. If pressure in an area of the gas distribution system <b>100</b> is too high, the pressure may cause damage. The gas delivery system <b>100</b> is configured having devices and techniques of operation that detect, notify and mitigate or resolve overly high gas pressure conditions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the example system <b>100</b>, a major gas main <b>102</b> supplies gas to several local gas mains <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. In the example, the local gas main <b>104</b> supplies gas to large gas volume customer(s) <b>108</b> having associated gas pressure regulators and metering devices <b>110</b>. The local gas main <b>106</b> supplies gas to commercial customer(s) <b>112</b> having associated gas pressure regulators and metering devices <b>114</b>. The local gas main <b>106</b> also supplies gas to residential customer(s) <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> having associated gas pressure regulators and metering devices <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The local gas main <b>104</b> and the devices attached to it may constitute a group of devices for purposes of an algorithm (discussed at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>9</b></figref> and other locations) that detects, notifies and/or mitigates/resolves a situation wherein devices within the logical group detect gas pressure over a threshold value. The group may be based at least in part on knowledge of the topology of the gas delivery system. A topological description of the gas delivery system may be configured within a database or other data structure. In an example, the topological description may include a listing of devices in the system, their characteristics, and how, when, where, and/or to what they are connected. The topology may include &#x201c;states&#x201d; of devices, such as a valve being open or closed, or a gas main having a certain pressure, a battery having a certain charge, etc. Similarly, the local gas main <b>106</b> and devices attached to it may constitute a second group. Each device in the system <b>100</b> may be considered to be in one or more groups. The groups may be formed in a manner that logically groups devices so that data from one device may be synergistically interpreted using data from other device(s) in the group. For example, if one device recognizes a gas pressure over a threshold pressure value, that event is reported to other devices in a group. A confirmation of high pressure by other devices in the group tends to indicate a region of high gas pressure rather than an area of localized high gas pressure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A liquid natural gas (LNG) plant <b>124</b> provides gas to the delivery system <b>100</b> at local gas main <b>126</b>. Compressor stations <b>128</b> create, regulate and/or maintain the gas pressure within gas mains and local delivery pipes within the system <b>100</b>. An underground gas storage reservoir <b>130</b> and regulator <b>132</b> provide additional gas through a gas pipe <b>134</b> to the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Within the system <b>100</b>, gas flows from locations having higher gas pressures upstream (e.g., the LNG plant <b>124</b>, the compressor stations <b>128</b>, and the underground storage <b>130</b>) and to areas having lower pressures downstream (e.g., the customers <b>108</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Additionally, the gas pressure within the gas delivery system <b>100</b> can vary from city gate regulators/meters <b>136</b> in the system to the downstream service point gas pressure regulators and meters. Example factors resulting in pressure drop include pipe length, pipe bends and joints, and internal gas-against-gas and gas-against-pipe friction.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The example system <b>100</b> is configured to monitor pressure at a plurality of points, thereby providing control systems and techniques of operation that anticipate, detect and/or mitigate unsafe situations, and avoid unsafe situations resulting from network latencies, headend application latencies, and/or human delays. In the example system <b>100</b>, the gas meter/gas pressure regulator <b>114</b> is configured to include edge detection and gas pressure notification systems and techniques <b>138</b>. In an example, the techniques <b>138</b> are enabled by execution of software, which may be defined in memory and executed by a processor. Other devices shown in the system <b>100</b> may contain the same or similar edge detection and gas pressure notification systems and techniques <b>138</b>. The edge detection and gas pressure notification systems and techniques <b>138</b> are configured and operate according to one or more of the examples shown, discussed and/or suggested by the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example gas delivery system <b>200</b> illustrating example functionality of groups of devices, particularly showing a data-gathering functionality. A first example group <b>202</b> of devices includes four gas meters <b>206</b>-<b>212</b>. The first group <b>202</b> additionally includes two valves <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>. The valves may be associated with segment pipelines or &#x201c;stub pipelines&#x201d; off a main gas pipeline (e.g., pipes <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The valves <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> may allow gas to be turned on/off to more than one gas service site (i.e., more than one gas metering device).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first group <b>202</b> may also include a group data pool <b>218</b>, which may be located in any desired location, such as a remote server, one or more of the gas metering devices, or a dedicated device, etc. The data pool <b>218</b> may include information regarding a topology of some or all of the gas delivery system <b>200</b>, and time-stamped pressure measurements and/or pressure thresholds of gas pressure measuring devices in one or more groups of devices. The data pool <b>218</b> may also identify groups of devices according to geography and/or connectivity within the gas delivery system topology. A group may include devices on a segment of gas pipeline serving a related group of gas customers (e.g., related by use of a same gas main and/or related by physical distance between any two devices of less than a threshold value).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The example gas delivery system <b>200</b> may also include other group(s), represented for drawing simplicity by group <b>204</b> and gas meter <b>220</b>. The number of groups and the number of devices in each group may be based on the needs, conditions and design specification of a particular system, and are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> only to illustrate general concepts and not as requirements.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an example, the gas consumption meters, valves, gas pressure-measuring devices, combined function devices, etc., may be configured in a group based on gas delivery system topology. In the example, some or all of the components (e.g., smart gas metering devices, valves, pipelines, etc.) along a gas pipeline serving a number of customer sites (associated with the smart gas metering devices) may be configured in a logical group. The pipeline may terminate after the last downstream customer's site. In some examples, an over-pressure event (e.g., gas pressure over a threshold) could be resolved by temporarily turning off the gas supply to the pipeline.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an example of the operation of system <b>200</b>, devices with pressure sensors (e.g., smart gas metering devices, etc.) can periodically compare their pressure readings to one or more high gas-pressure threshold values. The comparison may be made at prescribed intervals, random times, etc., as indicated by system design requirements, including available battery power, time since detection of an over-pressure event, and/or other considerations. If a device (e.g., a smart gas meter) detects that pressure has passed a relevant threshold value, the device can increase the rate of its gas-pressure sampling. Conversely, if the device detects normal gas pressure values for over a relevant threshold time value, it can decrease the rate of its gas-pressure sampling.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">If a threshold gas-pressure value is exceeded, the device can send its latest pressure reading(s)&#x2014;and in some examples, its relevant threshold values(s)&#x2014;to its neighboring devices (e.g., devices within the group of devices) that also have gas pressure sensors.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Responsive to a message from a group member (e.g., smart gas metering device <b>208</b>) sensing a higher than threshold gas pressure, other pressure sensing devices in the group (e.g., smart gas metering devices <b>206</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>) can increase their rate of pressure sampling. Additionally, the other pressure sensing devices can add their own data set to the data pool <b>218</b> (e.g., a data pool associated with sensing devices in a geographic area and/or devices within a logical group). The data pool <b>218</b> may be used to determine if an over-pressure event is area-wide (e.g., caused by events on the distribution side) or if it is localized to the single service point and/or device. Such a collaboration between devices distributed on (or near) the edge of a gas distribution system reduces the chance that decisions will be made based on false positives.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Data from group <b>202</b> may be sent (e.g., by cellular or internet connection <b>222</b>) to a headend device. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the data sent to the headend device <b>224</b> may include an initial notification by one of the gas pressure-measuring devices that a high gas pressure event (e.g., gas pressure over a threshold) has been detected. The measured gas pressure and the threshold may be sent to the headend device. The threshold is relevant at least in that it puts into perspective what the preferred gas pressure is at the location at which the measurement was made. The headend device <b>224</b> may be a server of a utility company, a third-party contractor of the utility company, or may be another device. In an example, the data <b>226</b> received from gas pressure-measuring devices and/or groups of such devices may be displayed for the situational-awareness of human operator(s) and/or used in algorithms that are involved in data-gathering, data-processing, and response(s) to gas over-pressure events. Example responses may include damage prevention procedures, such as shutting valves to prevent increases in gas pressure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example gas delivery system <b>300</b> containing enhancements to the gas delivery system <b>200</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In the example, the gas delivery system <b>300</b> performs data-processing functions that formulate response(s) to gas over-pressure events, and send appropriate commands to initiate the response(s). The responses may address local gas over-pressure events (e.g., detected by a single smart gas metering device) or area-wide gas over-pressure events (e.g., detected by plural smart gas metering devices within a group of devices).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the example, an algorithm <b>302</b> (e.g., a &#x201c;group algorithm&#x201d;) may utilize data from the group data pool <b>218</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to determine a response to an over-pressure event seen by: a gas pressure-measuring device from among those in a group; and/or a group of smart gas pressure-measuring devices.

The group algorithm <b>302</b> can consider the rate of pressure increase so that severity and urgency of the issue can be evaluated.

If so, the first device sends a message to at least one other device. In an example, the message is sent to device(s) within a group of devices based on gas system topography (e.g., the group of devices are smart metering devices having a common gas supply line).

The reporting may be based at least in part on the group associated with the device(s) found to have over-pressure events. By recognizing common features of devices and grouping them, the reporting can include devices that are in danger of an over-pressure event but may not have even realized the situation. The failure to realize the situation may result from a frequency of gas pressure measurement.

Gas flows from higher pressures upstream to lower pressures downstream. Additionally, the gas pressure within a gas delivery system can vary from city gate regulators and meters in the system to the end service point regulators and meters. Example factors governing pressure drop include the length of runs (e.g., the length of gas mains), number of pipe bends and joints, and internal gas against pipe friction. By monitoring pressure at a plurality of points, the system increases the ability for utility companies to anticipate, detect and/or mitigate unsafe situations, and avoid unsafe situations with network latencies, headend application latencies, and human delays. The systems and techniques (e.g., smarter gas metering devices) at service points provide the means to self-monitor for unsafe situations. In some examples, the systems and techniques also monitor not only at the single point at which the equipment is installed, but also an area surrounding the location of the equipment. In the example, such monitoring is performed by exchanging information with smart metering devices at nearby service sites. In many examples, the gas delivery system performs actions that automatically mitigate unsafe situation(s).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Devices with pressure sensors (e.g., smart gas metering devices, etc.) can periodically compare their pressure readings to one or more high gas-pressure threshold values. If a device detects that pressure has passed one of the thresholds it can increase the rate of its pressure sampling and can send its latest pressure readings and thresholds to its neighboring devices that also have pressure sensors. The other pressure sensing devices can likewise increase their rate of pressure sampling and add their own data set to a group data pool (e.g., a data pool associated with sensing devices in a logical group defined according to a geographic area, according to pipelines, and/or according to a gas supply topology). The data pool may be used to determine if an over-pressure event is area-wide (e.g., caused by events on the distribution side) or if it is localized to the single service point and/or device. Such a collaboration between devices distributed on (or near) the edge of a gas distribution system reduces the chance that decisions will be made based on false positives.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The group algorithm can consider the rate of pressure increase so that severity and urgency of the issue can be evaluated.

In contrast, if the group of devices determines that the situation is real, urgent, and that immediate mitigating action needs to take place, the group of devices can perform automatic shutoffs of their own valves, send shutoff commands to valves in other devices around them, send alarms with pressure sampling data to the headend system for utility notification, and send information to in-home devices to warn the end-customer of the safety situation.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The logic that controls actions of the gas delivery system (e.g., that controls points to shut off) relies on knowledge of the distribution system service point connections and location of regulators and/or gate valves that &#x201c;segment&#x201d; portions of that distribution system. Additionally, the physical distance between service points may be considered even if they are not on the same distribution line. Devices can know their group (or groups) via pre-programming (e.g., programming at time of manufacture), programming at install time, self-discovery, and/or by hearing network radio frequency (RF) messages.
