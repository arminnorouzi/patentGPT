Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0003">With the recent rapid development of advanced information and communication processing technology and overall electronics industry, a next generation detector rapidly transmitting and receiving a large amount of information and the development of a new concept device and system have been considered. With the rise of video processing and the like in mobile devices, technology development of an ultra-down-sized and ultra-power-saving image sensor is rapidly accelerated, centering on existing CCD (Charge Coupled Device) and CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">An image sensor, which is a semiconductor that converts photons into electrons and displays them on a display or stores them in a storage device, may include a light receiving element that converts light signals into electrical signals, a pixel circuit portion that amplifies and compresses the converted electrical signals, and an ASIC portion that converts these pre-treated analog signals into digital signals to treat image signals and for example, includes CCD, CMOS, CIS (Contact Image Sensor), and the like.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">The CCD and CMOS image sensors use the same light-receiving element, but in the CCD image sensor, charges generated in the light-receiving element sequentially move through MOS capacitors connected in series and are converted into voltages in a source follower connected at the final end. In the CMOS image sensor, the charges are converted into voltages in a source follower built into each pixel and output to the outside. The CCD image sensor moves electrons generated by light as they are to an output unit by using a gate pulse, and the CMOS image sensor convert the electrons generated by light into voltages in each pixel and then output them through several CMOS switches. These image sensors are very widely applied from household products such as a digital camera and a mobile phone to an endoscope used in hospitals and a telescope used in a satellite orbiting the earth.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0006">The embodiments may be realized by providing a core-shell compound including a core represented by Chemical Formula

In addition, a color imaging device for an image sensor may use a smaller dispersed particle size to form a fine pattern. Accordingly, efforts to improve resolution by introducing a non-particle dye instead of the pigment to prepare a photosensitive resin composition suitable for the dye have been considered.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0053">The embodiments relate to a green dye used in a color filter for a CMOS image sensor. As pixels have a smaller size, there may be a limit to manufacture a fine pattern by using a pigment, and accordingly, a dye may be used to compensate for this. A dye may have issues in terms of processability during the pattern manufacturing, e.g., may exhibit much deteriorated chemical resistance, it may be very difficult to form a fine pattern after the curing and thermal process. In addition, when the dye as a colorant is included in a small amount based on the total amount of the composition, the chemical resistance of the dye itself may be a little insufficient. When the photosensitive resin composition for a CMOS image sensor includes the dye in an excessive amount (about 20 wt % to about 50 wt %, e.g., about 20 wt % to about 45 wt % based on the total amount of the photosensitive resin composition), a dye with excellent chemical resistance itself may be used.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0054">One or more embodiments may provide a core-shell compound prepared by introducing a long-chain alkyl group or cycloalkyl group under specific controls into a squarylium compound forming a core, and surrounding the core with a shell.

As the pixels become smaller, there may be a limit to manufacture a fine pattern by using a pigment, and accordingly, a dye for compensating for this may be considered. However, the dye may have issues in terms of processibility during the pattern manufacture, compared with the pigment. For example, the dye may have issues in terms of chemical resistance, because the pigment is fine particles and has crystallinity and thus insufficient solubility and thereby is not eluted in a solvent such as PGMEA after the baking, but the dye is an amorphous solid and thus dissolved out in the solvent after the baking. The CMOS image sensor may use a high content of a colorant and thus a binder resin or a monomer at a relatively lower ratio, and the chemical resistance of the dye may be difficult to improve.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0208">One or more embodiments may provide a core-shell compound constituting a</p><p id="p-0246" num="0209">The core-shell compound according to an embodiment may have excellent chemical resistance by itself, and thus may maintain improved chemical resistance even after curing and thermal processes, and thus the photosensitive resin composition including this as a dye may form a fine pattern, thereby providing a green color filter for a CMOS image sensor.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0210">Example embodiments have been disclosed herein, and although specific terms are employed, they are used and are to be interpreted in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purpose of limitation.
