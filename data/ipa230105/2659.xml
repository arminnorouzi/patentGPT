CSP plants use mirrors or lenses to concentrate solar energy from a large area of sunlight onto a receiver. A heat transfer fluid can be heated in the receiver and circulated to transport thermal energy and produce steam in a turbine, which can power a generator to produce electricity. CSP plants may employ linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) systems, power tower systems, dish engine systems, and/or parabolic trough systems to concentrate solar energy onto the receiver.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">LFR employs long parallel rows of flat mirrors instead of curved mirrors. These focus solar energy onto elevated receivers (located above the mirrors), which have a system of tubes through which an HTF flows.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Power tower systems use a central receiver system. Computer-controlled mirrors (called heliostats) track the sun and focus solar energy on a receiver at the top of a tower. The focused energy is used to heat an HTF in the receiver. The heated HTF can be used to produce steam and run a central power generator.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In dish engine systems, mirrors are distributed over a parabolic dish surface to concentrate sunlight on a receiver fixed at the focal point. The receiver contains an HTF that is heated in the receiver. The system uses the heated HTF to generate mechanical power that runs a generator or alternator to produce electricity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Parabolic trough systems use curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto a receiver tube that runs through a trough. In the receiver tube, a heat transfer fluid can absorb the solar energy and pass through a heat exchanger to heat water and produce steam. The steam can drive a steam turbine to generate electricity. HTFs based on an eutectic mixture of 73.5% diphenyl oxide (DPO) and 26.5% biphenyl (BP) such as DOWTHERM&#x2122; A (DTA) Heat Transfer Fluid have been commonly used in CSP plants with parabolic trough (PT) collector technology since the 1980's. In these CSP plants the HTF absorbs heat from the sun at PT collectors and transfers it to the power block where steam is generated and expanded in turbines that drive generators to produce electricity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One way to reduce the cost of CSP is increasing the operating temperature of the HTF. The current DPO/BP HTF used in most of the 60 PT CSP plants is operated at temperatures between 293&#xb0; C. (560&#xb0; F.) and 393&#xb0; C. (740&#xb0; F.). This allows the steam Rankine cycle to operate at 383&#xb0; C. (721&#xb0; F.) that limits the efficiency of the water steam Rankine cycle to 38.4%. An increase of the maximum HTF temperature to 530&#xb0; C. (986&#xb0; F.) for example could increase the superheated steam temperature of the Rankine cycle to 520&#xb0; C. (968&#xb0; F.) allowing a cycle efficiency of 42.7%.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The higher efficiency of the Rankine cycle would allow a reduction of the solar field size that would allow savings in capital cost and maintenance. CSP plants with thermal storage also benefit from higher operating temperatures as the storage size can be reduced which results in cost savings for capital, operating cost.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The maximum operating temperature of 393&#xb0; C. (739&#xb0; F.) of PT CSP plants is set by HTF suppliers' restriction of the maximum operating temperature of DPO/BP HTF to 400&#xb0; C. (750&#xb0; F.) due to accelerated thermal aging above that temperature.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The CSP industry needs HTFs with higher thermal stability than DOWTHERM&#x2122; A Heat Transfer Fluid, but also with a freeze point at ambient temperatures or below, low vapor pressure and excellent heat transfer properties. SYLTHERM&#x2122; 800 Heat Transfer Fluid has been widely used for cooling and heating applications up to 400&#xb0; C. This product is a linear polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with a viscosity of 10 mPa&#xb7;s (measured at 20&#xb0; C.). However, it has not been selected for commercial CSP plants due to higher cost compared to DPO/BP based HTF. If linear PDMS such as SYLTHERM&#x2122; 800 Heat Transfer Fluid is heated at high temperatures for extended periods of time, vapor pressure may increase and/or viscosity may decrease.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A branched polysiloxane compound may be used as a heat transfer fluid. A method of operating a system at a temperature up to 500&#xb0; C. comprises using a heat transfer fluid comprising the branched polysiloxane compound.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The branched polysiloxane compound comprises a moiety of formula: (TM<sub>2</sub>)<sub>x</sub>, where T represents a unit of formula (RSiO<sub>3/2</sub>) and M represents a unit of formula (R<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>1/2</sub>), each R is an independently selected monovalent hydrocarbon group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and subscript x&#x2265;3.

ARC Test Protocol: A 24 hour isothermal ARC test at 400&#xb0; C. was performed to screen the thermal stability of the branched polymethylsiloxane compounds prepared as described in Reference Examples 1-3, above. Exothermic activity or excessive pressure generation at these conditions is an indication of insufficient thermal stability. Two linear PDMS materials and two branched polymethylsiloxanes were used for comparison. The first linear PDMS material was XIAMETER&#x2122; PMX-200 2 mPa&#xb7;s fluid and the second was XIAMETER&#x2122; PMX-200 10 mPa&#xb7;s fluid, both of which are commercially available from Dow Silicones Corporation of Midland, Mich., USA. The first branched material was tetra(trimethylsiloxy)silane, abbreviated M<sub>4</sub>Q, and was purchased from Millipore Sigma of St. Louis, Mo., USA.

Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that lower pressure build up in heat transfer fluid systems and particularly in parabolic trough CSP plants is beneficial for the following reasons:</p><p id="p-0054" num="0046">As CSP plants operate at temperatures of 400&#xb0; C. and higher, the choice of construction material is limited as low cost construction materials such as standard carbon steel may not be able to stand combinations of high temperatures and high pressures. More robust construction materials can be used to design such systems, but at significantly higher cost. In addition to materials of construction, wall thickness of equipment must be increased for higher pressures and temperatures in such systems, and this can also increase cost significantly. Therefore, it is beneficial to select HTFs with lower vapor pressures that allow selection of a lower maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) of the HTF system.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="315pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>ARC Test Conditions and Results</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Time</entry><entry>Temp</entry><entry>Pressure</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Example</entry><entry>HTF</entry><entry>(min)</entry><entry>(C.)</entry><entry>(psia)</entry><entry>Comments</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Comparative</entry><entry>M<sub>4</sub>Q</entry><entry>250</entry><entry>400</entry><entry>423</entry><entry>SHR of 0.3&#xb0;

Quantitative results are based on weight percent adjusted to the internal standard. Peak identifications for GC-FID were made by comparison to the simultaneous GC/MS data on the same samples. Theoretical response factors were used to determine individual component response relative to the internal standard. Quantitative amounts provided should be considered estimates. This approach does adjust for non-volatiles or non-elutable components from the GC column. Not all components were identified and reported. Annotated GC/MS total ion chromatograms are included for the sample analyzed. The other samples were historical results on this material at various conditions for comparison. GC-FID results were provided. The sample was collected on an instrument with dual detection GC/MS and GC-FID.

GC/MS is unable to differentiate between isomers with the same empirical formula and mass without representative standards. In general, branched materials will elute before a linear material of the same empirical formula. The mass calibration was verified to be accurate on the day of analysis.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0087">GC/MS data are qualitative only. Although this is a qualitative technique, typically analytes present between 5-100 ppm can be observed using this technique. This estimation is dependent on the analyte's structure and properties and detector response for that day. Estimates of the number of components present cannot be determined using GC/MS alone. Relative amounts of components can usually be determined using a GC technique. GC-FID accuracy and precision parameters have not been determined for this sample type or by the approach used for analysis. Repeatability is estimated to be &#xb1;10% (relative) but will likely be dependent on the concentration of individual components.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">ESI MS Experimental</heading><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Sample Preparation</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0088">The sample was analyzed by electrospray ionization LC-MS to structurally identify the species present in the 450&#xb0; C. heat aged T(TM<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>sample.
