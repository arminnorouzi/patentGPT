The entire contents of this application are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an inkjet printer.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2016-55478 discloses a printer including a liquid spray that includes nozzles through which ink is sprayed, and a cap attachable to the liquid spray. The cap is provided to maintain spray characteristics of ink to be sprayed from the nozzles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The cap is attachable to, or separable from, the liquid spray by a moving mechanism. The cap is put into contact with, and is attached to, the liquid spray so as to cover a space on which the nozzles are located. In this state, the space on which the nozzles are located may be tightly closed. The cap is attached to the liquid spray in this manner, so that the ink is suppressed from being evaporated from the nozzles and the ink discharged from the nozzles is recovered.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The cap is connected with, for example, a suction pump. The suction pump is driven in a state where the cap is attached to the liquid spray, so that a suction process of suctioning the ink from the liquid spray is performed. The cap is formed of, for example, rubber, and may be expanded or contacted by an aging deterioration. Such a cap formed of rubber may cause an aging change, for example, may be inflated, expanded or contracted, hardened, or softened by a contact thereof with the ink.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such an aging deterioration or aging change of the cap causes a situation where the cap attached to the liquid spray does not closely contact the liquid spray and as a result, the space on which the nozzles are located is not tightly closed. In such a case, the suction process, even if executed, may not be performed properly, namely, the ink may not be suctioned from the liquid spray.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide inkjet printers each capable of performing a suction process properly.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An inkjet printer according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes an ink head, a damper, a pressure sensor, a cap, an upward/downward moving mechanism, a suction pump, and a controller. The ink head includes a nozzle through which ink is injected. The damper is connected with the ink head. The pressure sensor is configured or programmed to detect a damper pressure in the damper. The cap is attachable to the ink head so as to cover the nozzle. The upward/downward moving mechanism is configured or programmed to move the cap upward and downward with respect to the ink head. The suction pump is connected with the cap. The controller is configured or programmed to include a suction controller, a pressure acquisition controller, a determination controller, and an upward/downward movement controller. The suction controller is configured or programmed to execute a suction process to drive the suction pump in a state where the cap is attached to the ink head. The pressure acquisition controller is configured or programmed to acquire the damper pressure detected by the pressure sensor during the suction process. The determination controller is configured or programmed to determine whether a change amount of the damper pressure is no larger than a reference change amount. The upward/downward movement controller is configured or programmed to control the cap to move upward toward the ink head when the change amount is no larger than the reference change amount.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the inkjet printer, when the change amount of the damper pressure is large during the suction process, the pressure in the cap is of a negative level. Thus, it is considered that the ink is suctioned properly from the ink head. By contrast, when the change amount of the damper pressure is small during the suction process, the cap is not attached to the ink head properly. In this case, it is considered that the ink is not suctioned properly from the ink head. When the change amount of the damper pressure is no larger than the reference change amount, it is determined that the suction process is not performed properly because the change amount is small. Therefore, the cap is moved upward. This moves the cap toward the ink head, and is put into in closer contact with the ink head. As a result, the pressure in the cap is decreased to a sufficiently negative level. This allows the suction process to be performed properly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above and other elements, features, steps, characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front view of a printer according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a bottom view schematically showing a structure of bottom surfaces of a carriage and ink heads.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of the printer according to the present preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a conceptual view showing the relationship between the ink heads and ink supply units.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic front view showing a structure of one ink head and the ink supply units corresponding thereto.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a front view showing the carriage, the ink heads and a cap unit.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a front view showing the carriage, the ink heads and the cap unit.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic front view showing one ink head, the ink supply units corresponding thereto, and one cap corresponding thereto in a state where the cap is separated from the ink head.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic front view showing one ink head, the ink supply units corresponding thereto, and one cap corresponding thereto in a state during a suction process.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a control procedure of the suction process.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of inkjet printers according to the present invention will be described with reference to the attached drawings.

In step S<b>107</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the determination controller <b>95</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> determines whether the change amount C<b>1</b> of at least one of the damper pressures P<b>1</b> corresponding to each ink head <b>40</b> is no larger than the reference change amount C<b>2</b>. When the change amount C<b>1</b> of at least one of the damper pressures P<b>1</b> corresponding to each ink head <b>40</b> is no larger than the reference change amount C<b>2</b>, the upward/downward movement controller <b>96</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> moves the plurality of caps <b>71</b> upward in step S<b>109</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. As described above, with the structure where the plurality of caps <b>71</b> are moved upward collectively (i.e., at the same time), in the case where the suction process is not performed properly on one of the plurality of ink heads <b>40</b>, the caps <b>71</b> are moved upward collectively. Therefore, the suction process may be performed properly on all the ink heads <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In this preferred embodiment, for example, the second ink head <b>42</b> corresponds to &#x201c;another ink head&#x201d;. At least one of the dampers <b>58</b> connected with the second ink head <b>42</b> corresponds to &#x201c;another damper&#x201d;. At least one of the pressure sensors <b>59</b> detecting the pressures of the dampers <b>58</b> connected with the second ink head <b>42</b> corresponds to &#x201c;another pressure sensor&#x201d;. The second cap <b>71</b>B corresponds to &#x201c;another cap&#x201d;, and the second suction pump <b>73</b>B corresponds to &#x201c;another suction pump&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In this preferred embodiment, in step S<b>109</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the upward/downward movement controller <b>96</b> moves the caps <b>71</b> upward by the reference distance L<b>5</b>. After the caps <b>71</b> are controlled by the upward/downward movement controller <b>96</b> to move upward by the reference distance L<b>5</b>, the pressure acquisition controller <b>94</b> acquires the damper pressures P<b>1</b> in step S<b>105</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. This allows the caps <b>71</b> to be moved upward gradually by the reference distance L<b>5</b> until the change amount C<b>1</b> of each damper pressure P<b>1</b> is increased to be larger than the reference change amount C<b>2</b>. Therefore, the caps <b>71</b> are suppressed from being moved upward excessively.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In this preferred embodiment, the controller <b>90</b> includes the error controller <b>97</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). When, in step S<b>111</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the upward moving distance L<b>1</b>, by which the caps <b>71</b> are controlled by the upward/downward movement controller <b>96</b> to move upward, is no shorter than the error distance L<b>2</b>, the error controller <b>97</b> performs the error control in step S<b>113</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. In the case where, for example, the upward moving distance L<b>1</b> of the caps <b>71</b> is too long, the absorbers <b>75</b> of the caps <b>71</b> may, for example, contact the nozzle surfaces <b>45</b>. When the absorbers <b>75</b> contact the nozzle surfaces <b>45</b>, there is an undesirable possibility that the meniscus of each of the nozzles <b>46</b> is not adjusted properly. Therefore, it is preferred that the absorbers <b>75</b> do not contact the nozzle surfaces <b>45</b>. For this reason, in this preferred embodiment, when the upward moving distance L<b>1</b> of the caps <b>71</b> is no shorter than the error distance L<b>2</b>, the error control is performed and the suction process is finished. In this manner, such a situation may be prevented that the upward moving distance L<b>1</b> of the caps <b>71</b> is too long and as a result, the absorbers <b>75</b> in the caps <b>71</b> contact the nozzle surfaces <b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this preferred embodiment, the two dampers <b>58</b> (in this example, the first damper <b>58</b><i>a </i>and the second damper <b>58</b><i>b</i>) are provided for one ink head <b>40</b>. Alternatively, one damper <b>58</b> may be provided for one ink head <b>40</b>, or, for example, three or more dampers <b>58</b> may be provided for one ink head <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In this preferred embodiment, the pressure sensors <b>59</b> each detect the damper pressure P<b>1</b> in the corresponding damper <b>58</b> at a predetermined time point. The pressure sensor <b>59</b> detects the damper pressure P<b>1</b> with a numerical value. The pressure sensor <b>59</b> is not limited to detecting the damper pressure P<b>1</b> with a numerical value. For example, the pressure sensor <b>59</b> may detect whether the damper pressure P<b>1</b> in the damper <b>58</b> is no smaller than a predetermined pressure (e.g., lower-limit pressure). The pressure sensor <b>59</b> may be, for example, a filler sensor disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2019-107852. In this case, the filler sensor detects whether the damper pressure P<b>1</b> during the suction process is no smaller than the predetermined pressure. When, for example, the filler sensor hits to detect that the damper pressure P<b>1</b> during the suction process is changed to a level smaller than the predetermined pressure, the determination controller <b>95</b> determines that the suction process is performed properly. By contrast, when a state where the filler sensor does not hit is continued even though the suction process is performed and thus it is detected that the damper pressure P<b>1</b> is still no smaller than the predetermined pressure, the determination controller <b>95</b> determines that the suction process is not proper, and thus the upward/downward movement controller <b>96</b> moves the caps <b>71</b> upward toward the ink heads <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it is to be understood that variations and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.
