Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a coating method for coating a substrate with a hard coating, plating, or the like.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are various methods as a technology for coating surfaces of various substrates such as film substrates with two-pack reaction liquid.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, plating is also one of the methods, and a method of applying a highly reactive plating liquid by spraying has been proposed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, JP2004-035996A describes a method of manufacturing a plated and coated product, including a step of forming an undercoat on the entire surface of a substrate by spray coating, a step of forming an electroless plating layer on the entire surface of the undercoat by coating type electroless plating, and a step of forming a protective film and/or a toned coating film on a surface of the electroless plating layer by spray coating, in which the steps are continuously performed by a coating robot under automatic control.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Here, JP2004-035996A describes, as a preferable method of forming an electroless plating layer, applying two liquids, i.e., a solution containing a silver ion such as an aqueous solution of a water-soluble silver salt such as silver nitrate and a reducing liquid, by spray coating using a double head spray gun.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, JP2006-016659A describes a two-pack electroless silver plating liquid consisting of two liquids, i.e., a silver-containing aqueous solution containing a silver compound and ammonia and a reducing agent-containing aqueous solution containing a reducing agent, in which predetermined ethyleneamines are contained in the silver-containing aqueous solution and/or the reducing agent-containing aqueous solution. JP2006-016659A describes an electroless silver plating method in which using the two-pack electroless silver plating liquid, the silver-containing aqueous solution and the reducing agent-containing aqueous solution are simultaneously sprayed to an object to be plated with the use of a spray gun such as a double head spray gun or a concentric spray gun.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the method of JP2006-016659A, the silver-containing aqueous solution and the reducing agent-containing aqueous solution prepared separately are simultaneously sprayed to a surface of the object to be plated so that the spraying positions match, and thus a reduction reaction occurs at the position where both the solutions are sprayed and leads to the formation of a silver plating film.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the methods described in JP2004-035996A and JP2006-016659A, a two-pack plating liquid consisting of an aqueous solution containing silver as a main agent and an aqueous solution containing a reducing agent as an auxiliary agent is simultaneously applied to mix the agents on a substrate, so that electroless plating is formed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to this method, since the main agent and the auxiliary agent of the plating liquid are not previously mixed, it is possible to prevent the precipitation of plating which causes the generation of foreign matter and clogging. Therefore, according to the methods described in JP2004-035996A and JP2006-016659A, the substrate can be coated with appropriate plating even with a highly reactive two-pack plating liquid.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Here, the plating which coats the substrate is desired to be dense.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, in JP2004-035996A, a plated product having uniform electromagnetic shielding properties can be produced, but it is preferable that the plating is dense to obtain more excellent electromagnetic shielding properties. In addition, in JP2006-016659A, a silver film which has excellent gloss and is free from discoloration and unevenness can be formed, but the denser the plating, the more suitably these effects can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, with the two-pack plating methods according to the related art, it may not be always possible to stably form a sufficiently dense plating film.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">An object of the present invention is to solve such problems of the related art and provide a coating method with which a target position on a substrate can be coated with a dense film by using a two-pack reaction liquid consisting of a main agent and an auxiliary agent.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In order to solve the problems, the present invention has the following

applied to the substrate Z to mix and react the main agent with the auxiliary agent on the substrate Z, so that a predetermined position on the substrate Z is coated with a coating material.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the coating device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, while the substrate Z is guided to a guide roller <b>12</b> and transported downward (in the direction of the arrow v) in a vertical direction, a reaction liquid to be a coating material is applied in an applying portion <b>14</b> to coat at least a part of the substrate with the coating material.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The substrate Z coated with the coating material is then immersed and washed in a washing solution <b>16</b><i>a </i>in a washing tank <b>16</b>, and the transport direction is changed upward by a guide roller <b>18</b> in the washing tank <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The substrate Z transported upward is transported to the next step by a guide roller <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Here, in the coating method according to the embodiment of the present invention, a base containing a coating material is formed on the substrate Z. The coating with a coating material is performed on a part where the base is formed. That is, in the present invention, the base of the substrate Z contains a coating material, and determines a region to be coated with the coating material by the coating method according to the embodiment of the present invention on the substrate Z.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, in the coating method according to the embodiment of the present invention, the reaction liquid to be a coating material is a two-pack reaction liquid consisting of a main agent containing a coating material and an auxiliary agent. In the present invention, while the substrate Z is transported, the auxiliary agent is first applied to the substrate Z, and the main agent containing the coating material is then applied to the substrate to mix and react the main agent with the auxiliary agent on the substrate Z, so that the substrate Z is coated with the coating material.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the coating method according to the embodiment of the present invention, the substrate Z is not limited, and various sheet-like objects (plate-like objects, films) can be used.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Examples thereof include resin films such as a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film, a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) film, a cycloolefin polymer (COP) film, a polyimide film, a cycloolefin copolymer (COC) film, and a triacetyl cellulose (TAC) film, metal foils such as aluminum foil and copper foil, nonwoven fabric, and paper.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The thickness of the substrate Z is also not limited, and may be appropriately selected according to the use of the substrate Z coated with the coating material.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the example shown in the drawing, as a preferable aspect, an elongated substrate Z is used and continuously coated with a coating material while being continuously transported in the longitudinal direction as in a so-called roll-to-roll treatment for a material to be treated. However, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">That is, in the coating method according to the embodiment of the present invention, while a cut sheet-like substrate is transported, an auxiliary agent and a main agent may be applied as will be described later to coat a base forming portion of the substrate with a coating material.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The transportation speed of the substrate Z is also not limited, and may be appropriately set according to the state of the base to be described later, the reactivity of the main agent and the auxiliary agent, the amount of the main agent and the auxiliary agent to be applied, the coating material to be formed, and the like.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In consideration of productivity and the like, the transportation speed of the substrate Z is preferably 0.1 to 100 m/min, more preferably 1 to 50 m/min, and even more preferably 5 to 30 m/min.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the coating method according to the embodiment of the present invention, a base containing a coating material is previously formed on the substrate Z.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As will be described later, the coating of the substrate Z with the coating material is performed at a position where the base is formed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The base contains a coating material which coats the substrate Z. For example, in a case where the coating material is metal plating, the base is formed of a metal for plating. In addition, in a case where the coating material is a hard coating, the base is formed of a hard coating which coats the substrate. In addition, in a case where the coating material is an adhesive coating, a pressure-sensitive adhesive coating, or the like, the base is formed of an adhesive layer, a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, or the like which coats the substrate.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As will be described in detail later, in the coating method according to the embodiment of the present invention, the substrate Z having such a base and the two-pack reaction liquid are used, and moreover, while the substrate Z is transported, the auxiliary agent is first applied to the substrate, and the main agent containing the coating material is then applied to the substrate. Accordingly, the main agent and the auxiliary agent are mixed and reacted on the substrate Z, and this makes it possible to coat the substrate Z with a dense coating material along the base.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The method of forming the base is not limited, and the base may be formed by a known method according to the material for forming the base, that is, the coating material for coating by the coating method according to the embodiment of the present invention. In a case where both sides of the substrate Z are coated with the coating material as in the example shown in the drawing, the base is formed on both sides of the substrate Z.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The method of forming the base and the coating method with the coating material to be described later may be the same or different from each other. For example, in a case where the coating material is metal plating, the base may be formed by a metal plating treatment. Otherwise, a base formed of a metal for plating may be formed by a film forming method such as sputtering with which a thin metal film can be formed.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The shape (planar shape) of the base is not limited, and various shapes can be used.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, the base may be formed like a layer covering the entire surface of the substrate Z or a layer covering a part of the substrate Z. That is, in the coating method according to the embodiment of the present invention, the entire surface of the substrate Z may be coated with the coating material.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Alternatively, a base having a planar pattern consisting of planes spaced from each other in the form of sea islands, such as a polka dot pattern or a checker pattern (checker board pattern), may be formed. In this case, the planar pattern may be formed regularly or irregularly.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Alternatively, the base may be formed in a lattice shape such as a mesh shape, a square lattice, a triangular lattice, and a hexagonal lattice (honeycomb shape).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Alternatively, the base may be formed in a stripe pattern (stripe shape). The thickness and/or spacing of the stripes in the stripe pattern may be uniform or non-uniform, and portions where the thickness and/or spacing are uniform and portions where thickness and/or spacing are non-uniform may be mixed.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Alternatively, the base may be formed in a linear pattern consisting of one line or a plurality of lines. The base having a linear pattern may have a straight line shape or a curved shape. Otherwise, it may be a line having a bent portion such as a polygonal line of zigzag, or may be in a linear pattern in which the above shapes are mixed.

The solvents of the main agent and the auxiliary agent are preferably the same in consideration of the control of the atmosphere of an applying space to be described later where the main agent and the auxiliary agent are applied. That is, in a case where one kind of solvent is used for both the main agent and the auxiliary agent, it is preferable that the same solvent is used for the main agent and the auxiliary agent. In addition, in a case where a plurality of kinds of solvents are used for both the main agent and the auxiliary agent, it is preferable that the same solvent is used for the main agent and the auxiliary agent, and it is more preferable that the ratio of each solvent is the same.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As described above, in the coating method according to the embodiment of the present invention, the substrate Z having a base containing a coating material and the two-pack reaction liquid are used, and moreover, the auxiliary agent is first applied to the substrate, and the main agent containing the coating material is then applied to mix and react the main agent with the auxiliary agent on the substrate Z, so that the substrate Z can be coated with the dense coating material along the base.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In a case where the surface of the substrate is coated with the coating material by using the two-pack reaction liquid consisting of the main agent and the auxiliary agent, the mixing properties of the two liquids is important. In particular, the more reactive the liquids, the more important it is to mix the two liquids.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">However, in a case where the main agent and the auxiliary agent are previously mixed, the coating material precipitates at that time and causes the generation of foreign matter and clogging in the pipes and the storage tank in the course of the operation.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Regarding this, as shown in JP2004-035996A and JP2006-016659A, in a case where the main agent and the auxiliary agent are simultaneously applied through different systems and mixed on the substrate, it is possible to prevent the generation of foreign matter and clogging.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">However, the inventors found that in order to form a film with a highly reactive liquid such as electroless plating, the affinity of the auxiliary agent for the substrate, the reaction state of the two liquids, and the substrate are important. The reason for this was found to be that in a case where two highly reactive liquids are applied and mixed on the substrate as described in JP2004-035996A and JP2006-016659A, the coating material precipitates on the gas-liquid interface side of the liquid film on the substrate simultaneously with its formation and is regarded as foreign matter, and the dense coating material cannot be formed.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Therefore, the inventors have conducted intensive studies, and as a result, found that as a method of coating a substrate with a dense coating material, in a case where a substrate Z on which a base containing a coating material is formed is used, an auxiliary agent for accelerating the reaction is first applied instead of simultaneous application of the main agent and the auxiliary agent to make the auxiliary agent adapt to the substrate Z (base) sufficiently, and the main agent containing the coating material is then applied, it is possible to solve the problems.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The base contains a coating material. The auxiliary agent reacts with the main agent containing the coating material and forms the coating material. That is, it is thought that the auxiliary agent has reactivity with the coating material to some extent and has high affinity for the coating material.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Therefore, by first applying the auxiliary agent to the substrate Z on which the base containing the coating material is formed, the auxiliary agent selectively adheres to the base and permeates the base while causing a slight reaction. In this state, in a case where the main agent is then applied, the reaction between the main agent and the auxiliary agent proceeds even inside the base, and the coating material is selectively formed in the portion where the base is formed.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">As a result, according to the coating method according to the embodiment of the present invention, the substrate Z can be coated with the dense coating material along the base. The present invention is particularly suitable for a case where a highly reactive main agent and a highly reactive auxiliary agent are used, that is, a case where the substrate Z is desired to be rapidly coated with many dense coating materials. In addition, in a case where the base has a pattern structure as described above, it is possible to control the coating amount of the coating material in a pattern portion and a non-pattern portion by utilizing the permeation of the auxiliary agent in a depth direction of the base, and this also advantageously acts in optionally changing the in-plane coating properties.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the coating method according to the embodiment of the present invention, in a case where the auxiliary agent is first applied to the substrate Z and the main agent is then applied to the substrate Z, the timing of the application of the main agent after the application of the auxiliary agent is not limited.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">That is, as the timing of the application of the main agent to the substrate Z after the application of the auxiliary agent to the substrate Z, a timing at which the auxiliary agent sufficiently adapts to the base and the main agent and the auxiliary agent can be suitably mixed on the substrate Z may be appropriately set according to the kind of the coating material, the transportation speed of the substrate Z, the amount of the main agent and the auxiliary agent to be applied to the substrate Z, the state of the base formed on the substrate Z, the drying speed of the solvent of the auxiliary agent and the main agent, the leveling speed of the auxiliary agent and the main agent, and the like.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The main agent is applied to the substrate Z preferably after 0.01 to 120 seconds, more preferably after 0.1 to 60 seconds, and even more preferably after 0.5 to 30 seconds from the application of the auxiliary agent.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The method of applying the main agent and the method of applying the auxiliary agent in the applying portion <b>14</b>, that is, the first applying unit <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the second applying unit <b>14</b><i>b </i>are not limited, and known applying methods can be used.

In addition, the reaction rate between the main agent and the auxiliary agent can be increased, whereby productivity can be improved. In addition, by adjusting the temperature of the main agent and the auxiliary agent to a predetermined temperature or lower, the evaporation of the solvents from the main agent and the auxiliary agent which are solutions is suppressed, and thus it is possible to suppress the generation of the coating material which does not adhere to the substrate Z and is regarded as foreign matter.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">That is, by applying the main agent and the auxiliary agent to the substrate Z while controlling the temperature of the main agent and the auxiliary agent to an appropriate temperature, it is possible to suitably prevent foreign matter from adhering to the surface of the coating material while appropriately coating the substrate Z with the coating material in the portion where the base is formed.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Here, in the coating method in which the auxiliary agent and the main agent are sequentially applied while the substrate Z is transported as in the present invention, it may be difficult to control the temperature of the main agent and the auxiliary agent on the substrate Z to a target temperature.

That is, the spray method is a coating method which rapidly increases the specific surface area of the applied material. Therefore, even in a case where the temperature of the main agent and the auxiliary agent to be sprayed is increased, the temperature of the main agent and the auxiliary agent rapidly decreases due to the heat of vaporization. For example, in a case where the main agent and the auxiliary agent are applied by spraying at room temperature, the temperature of the main agent and the auxiliary agent decreases to be much lower than room temperature in the vicinity of the substrate Z, and the heat of the substrate Z is taken away.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Examples of the method of solving such problems and appropriately adjusting the temperature of the main agent and the auxiliary agent on the substrate Z include a method of controlling the vapor pressure of the solvent of the main agent and/or the auxiliary agent in a space where the main agent and the auxiliary agent are applied to the substrate Z.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">For example, in a case where the main agent and the auxiliary agent are aqueous solutions, the water vapor pressure in a space where the main agent and the auxiliary agent are applied to the substrate Z is controlled.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Preferably, the temperature of the space where the main agent and the auxiliary agent are applied to the substrate Z is also controlled.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the vaporization of the main agent and the auxiliary agent applied to the substrate Z, and thus it is possible to appropriately control the temperature of the main agent and the auxiliary agent on the substrate Z.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example of a method of controlling the vapor pressure of the solvent in a space where the main agent and the auxiliary agent are applied to the substrate Z and the temperature of the space.

In addition, in Comparative Example 2 in which no base is formed, dense silver plating cannot be formed, and the conductivity is low.

The reason for this is that foreign matter caused by the hard coating material generated not on the substrate, but at the gas-liquid interface, is removed. In addition, as shown in Examples 7 and 10, by adjusting the humidity of the applying space to 50% RH or greater, that is, 50% or greater of the saturated vapor pressure, the substrate can be coated with a hard coating which is denser and has a higher pencil hardness.
