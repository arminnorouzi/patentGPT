According to the illustrated example, the engine <b>10</b> is a turboshaft gas turbine engine generally comprising in serial flow communication a compressor <b>12</b> for pressurizing the air, a combustor <b>16</b> in which the compressed air is mixed with fuel and ignited for generating an annular stream of hot combustion gases, and a turbine section <b>18</b> for extracting energy from the combustion gases. There will now be described a fuel manifold adapter <b>100</b> (the adapter <b>100</b>) used in a hot section of the engine, generally shown at L<b>1</b>, in connection with a fuel manifold <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of a fuel system of the engine <b>10</b> located proximate to the combustor <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the adapter <b>100</b> is disposed in fluid communication between a fuel inlet nozzle <b>30</b> (the inlet nozzle <b>30</b>) supported by a first mount <b>40</b> (or flange <b>40</b> of the inlet nozzle <b>30</b>), and a fuel source <b>50</b> (the source <b>50</b>) for instance provided in the form of a flow divider valve and supported by a second mount <b>60</b> (or bracket <b>60</b> of the source <b>50</b>). The inlet nozzle <b>30</b> and the source <b>50</b> are also respectively referred to as a first component and a second component of the fuel system of the engine <b>10</b>. Via the first mount <b>40</b> and the second mount <b>60</b>, the inlet nozzle <b>30</b> and the source <b>50</b> are respectively mounted at a first mounting point of the engine <b>10</b> and at a second mounting point of the engine <b>10</b> each being susceptible to thermal growth. Due to the thermal growth occurring as the engine <b>10</b> operates, the first and second mounting points move relative to one another with their respective mounted components. In the illustrated embodiment, the first mounting point is on a turbine support case of the engine <b>10</b>. The first mount <b>40</b> is integral to the inlet nozzle <b>30</b> and fastened directly to the turbine support case. The second mounting point is located fore of the first mounting point on a peripheral flange of the turbine support case. The second mounting point is also located radially outward of the first mounting point relative to a center line CL of the engine <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In other embodiments, the second mounting point is located aft of the first mounting point, for example on a turbine exhaust case of the engine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The adapter <b>100</b> includes a body <b>110</b> that is held in position fixedly relative to the source <b>50</b> yet movably relative to the inlet nozzle <b>30</b> so as to mitigate stresses imparted to the inlet nozzle <b>30</b> by the adapter <b>100</b> as the body <b>110</b> moves with the source <b>50</b> to and from the inlet nozzle <b>30</b>. The body <b>110</b> is mounted at a third mounting point of the engine <b>10</b> via a third mount <b>150</b> (or bracket <b>150</b> of the body <b>110</b>), supporting the adapter <b>100</b> in position relative to the source <b>50</b>. The third mounting point is located aft of the first mounting point, on a peripheral flange of the turbine exhaust case of the engine <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the third mount <b>150</b> is integral to the body <b>110</b> (as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In yet other embodiments, the body <b>110</b> could be mounted to the source <b>50</b> (as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) and the third mount <b>150</b> could be omitted.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A body-output interface <b>112</b> of the body <b>110</b> movably interfaces with a nozzle-input interface <b>32</b> (or upstream end of the inlet nozzle <b>30</b>) via a transfer tube assembly <b>120</b> located at a downstream end (or output end) of the adapter <b>100</b>. The transfer tube assembly <b>120</b> may be said to thermally and dynamically decouple the body-output interface <b>112</b> and a remainder of the adapter <b>100</b> from the inlet nozzle <b>30</b>. At an upstream end (or input end) of the adapter <b>100</b>, a body-input interface <b>114</b> of the body <b>110</b> fixedly interfaces with a source-output interface <b>52</b> (or downstream end of the source <b>50</b>) via a flanged connector <b>130</b> and a conduit <b>140</b>. The conduit <b>140</b> comprises a rigid tube routed from the flanged connector <b>130</b> to the body <b>110</b>. The conduit <b>140</b> and the flanged connector <b>130</b> can also be described as a rigid supply line which, depending on the embodiment, can form part of the adapter <b>100</b> or the source <b>50</b>. In this embodiment, the supply line forms part of the adapter <b>100</b>. The conduit <b>140</b> may be said to rigidly connect the flanged connector <b>130</b> and the body <b>110</b> to one another. A fuel path through the adapter <b>100</b> extending from the source <b>50</b> to the inlet nozzle <b>30</b> is defined successively by the flanged connector <b>130</b>, the conduit <b>140</b>, the body <b>110</b> and the transfer tube assembly <b>120</b>. The fuel path can consist of a primary fuel path and a secondary fuel path both routed through the adapter <b>100</b> separately from one another. The forthcoming description will focus on features of the adapter <b>100</b> defining the primary fuel path, as corresponding features of the adapter <b>100</b> defining the secondary fuel path are similar, unless stated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, according to the illustrated embodiment, the inlet nozzle <b>30</b> interfaces with the first mounting point via the first mount <b>40</b> so as to orient the nozzle-input interface <b>32</b> in a first direction D<b>1</b> having an axial component parallel to the center line CL of the engine <b>10</b>. In the first direction D<b>1</b>, the nozzle-input interface <b>32</b> extends aft relative to the first mounting point. The second mount <b>60</b> holds the source <b>50</b> so as to orient the source-output interface <b>52</b> in a second direction D<b>2</b> having an axial component parallel to the center line CL of the engine <b>10</b>. The first direction D<b>1</b> and the direction D<b>2</b> are in this arrangement parallel to one another and to the center line CL of the engine <b>10</b>, although other arrangements are possible. Also, the nozzle-input interface <b>32</b> and the source-output interface <b>52</b> are positioned so as to be radially close to one another relative to the center line CL. This disposition allows the adapter <b>100</b> to have a minimal radial footprint as it extends from the source-output interface <b>52</b> to the nozzle-input interface <b>32</b>. As such, the inlet nozzle <b>30</b>, the source <b>50</b> and the adapter <b>100</b> can be made to fit inside a radially outer envelope of the turbine section <b>18</b> defined by the outside of the turbine support and exhaust cases up to a radially outer limit of the engine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The adapter <b>100</b> is positioned such that the body-output interface <b>112</b> is oriented opposite the first direction D<b>1</b> across from the nozzle-input interface <b>32</b> and the body-input interface <b>114</b> is oriented in such a way that the flanged connector <b>130</b> rigidly connected thereto is oriented opposite the second direction D<b>2</b> across from the source-output interface <b>52</b>. The connections between the body <b>110</b> and the inlet nozzle <b>30</b> and between the body <b>110</b> and the source <b>50</b> are directional. Indeed, connecting the body-output interface <b>112</b> to the nozzle-input interface <b>32</b> via the transfer tube assembly <b>120</b> places the body-input interface <b>114</b> in an orientation suitable for it to be connectable to the source-output interface <b>52</b> via the supply line. Also, upon the supply line being connected to the body <b>110</b>, connecting the body-output interface <b>112</b> to the nozzle-input interface <b>32</b> orients the flanged connector opposite the second direction D<b>2</b> in alignment with the source-output interface <b>52</b>.

In this embodiment, the first mounting point is located on the turbine support case and the second mounting point is located on the peripheral flange of the turbine support case fore of the first mounting point. The third mounting point is located on the source <b>50</b>, i.e., the body <b>110</b> is supported by virtue of its connection to the source <b>50</b>. The body <b>110</b> may be said to be located axially between the inlet nozzle <b>30</b> and the source <b>50</b> relative to the center line of the engine <b>10</b>. The nozzle-input interface <b>32</b> extends in the first direction D<b>1</b> fore relative to the first mounting point and toward the second mounting point. The first direction D<b>1</b> may thus be said to be toward the source <b>50</b>. This arrangement of the inlet nozzle <b>30</b> relative to the source <b>50</b> allows for an axially-compact adapter <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In this embodiment, first and second flanged connectors <b>130</b>, <b>130</b>&#x2032; connect to the body <b>110</b> by way of first and second conduits <b>140</b>, <b>140</b>&#x2032;, provided in the form of hollow and axially short arms that are integral to the body. The first and second conduits <b>140</b>, <b>140</b>&#x2032; project from the body-input interface <b>114</b> transversely to the body axis B of the body-output interface <b>112</b>. The nozzle-input interface <b>32</b> is closer to a first port <b>54</b> of the source <b>50</b> than to a second port <b>54</b>&#x2032; of the source <b>50</b>. As such, the first conduit <b>140</b> is shorter than the second conduit <b>140</b>&#x2032;. The first flanged connector <b>130</b> is of a type similar to that described hereinabove, having a first-connector flange <b>132</b> and a first-connector cylinder <b>134</b>, or cylindrical fitting, projecting therefrom along a first-connector axis C for mating engagement with the first port <b>54</b> along a first-port axis P. The second flanged connector <b>130</b>&#x2032; has a second-connector flange <b>132</b>&#x2032; and a second-connector bore <b>134</b>&#x2032; extending inward thereof along a second-connector axis C&#x2032;. The second-connector bore <b>134</b>&#x2032; is in fluid communication with the second port <b>54</b>&#x2032; of the source-output interface <b>52</b>. A third transfer tube <b>122</b><i>a</i>&#x2033; of the adapter <b>100</b> has a first end <b>122</b><i>a</i>&#x2033; slidably engaged with the second flanged connector <b>130</b>&#x2032; via the second-connector bore <b>134</b>&#x2032; along the second-connector axis C&#x2032;, and a second end <b>122</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; opposite the first end <b>122</b><i>a</i>&#x2033; slidably engaged with the source-output interface <b>52</b> via the second port <b>54</b>&#x2032; along a second-port axis P&#x2032;. The source-output interface <b>52</b> is arranged such that the first-port axis P and the second-port axis P&#x2032; are generally parallel and aligned with the second direction D<b>2</b>, thereby allowing the first flanged connector <b>130</b> to matingly engage the first port <b>54</b> simultaneously as the second flanged connector <b>130</b>&#x2032; engages with the second port <b>54</b>&#x2032; via the third transfer tube <b>122</b>&#x2033;. Under certain circumstances, the second-port axis P&#x2032; may be misaligned (e.g., be at an angle of between 0 to 4 degrees) relative to the first-port axis P, due for example to thermal deformation of the source <b>50</b> and/or to manufacturing tolerances. As the first flanged connector <b>130</b> matingly engages the first port <b>54</b> with the first-connector axis C collinear to the first-port axis P, the third transfer tube <b>122</b>&#x2033; may tilt relative to the second-connector axis C&#x2032; and/or to the second-port axis P&#x2032; to accommodate such misalignment while maintaining the fluid communication between the second port <b>54</b>&#x2032; and the second flanged connector <b>130</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present disclosure is not limited to aircraft engines of the turboshaft gas turbine type.

Thus, the first direction D<b>1</b> and the second direction D<b>2</b> are neither the same nor opposite one another. Nevertheless, such differences in location and orientation of the nozzle-input interface <b>32</b> and the source-output interface <b>52</b> are compensated by the supply line being suitably routed therebetween. With the body <b>110</b> located such that the body-output interface <b>112</b> is in alignment with the nozzle-input interface <b>32</b> opposite the first direction D<b>1</b>, the supply line is routed from the body-input interface <b>114</b> so as to extend opposite the second direction D<b>2</b> as it nears the source-output interface <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It shall be noted that the same body <b>110</b> can also be used in connection to the inlet nozzle <b>30</b> of a turboshaft engine, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, provided that the supply line is suitably routed between the body-input interface <b>114</b> of the body <b>110</b> and the source-output interface <b>52</b> of the source <b>50</b> of the turboshaft engine.
