Due to a good treatment effect, a low equipment investment cost, simple operation, high safety of a treatment process and other reasons, the ozone oxidation and the hydrogen peroxide oxidation have been widely popularized and applied in treatment of the wastewater with a low COD concentration.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, both the ozone oxidation and the hydrogen peroxide oxidation have some problems. For example,</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. an unsatisfactory effect is achieved when a single treatment technology is used for treatment, and a better treatment effect is achieved when two technologies are combined for use; and</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. since the utilization efficiency of ozone and hydrogen peroxide in current treatment processes is not high, the operating cost is high, and generated exhaust needs to be further processed and then discharged to satisfy standards.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In further researches, an ultraviolet radiation method is combined with advanced oxidation of the ozone and the hydrogen peroxide. For example, a Chinese Patent Application with a publication number of CN110117115A in the prior art discloses a treatment equipment for recycling of industrial waste salts. The equipment includes a pretreatment unit, a resin adsorption unit, an advanced oxidation unit, an advanced treatment and anodic oxidation unit and an ionic membrane caustic soda production process unit connected in sequence. The pretreatment unit includes a waste salt dissolving device, a pH adjustment device and a mechanical impurity removal device connected in sequence; and the advanced oxidation unit includes an integrated device for combining ozone, ultraviolet radiation and hydrogen peroxide to conduct advanced oxidation, and a step of combining the ozone, the ultraviolet radiation and the hydrogen peroxide to conduct advanced oxidation to degrade organic matter in high-salt wastewater is used. However, in the prior art, when the integrated device for combining ozone, ultraviolet radiation and hydrogen peroxide to conduct advanced oxidation is used for reactions under same conditions, the following problems may be caused:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">(1) the residence time of the ozone in a reactor is short, the utilization rate of the ozone is low (the utilization rate of the ozone is generally not higher than 60% under industrial treatment conditions), the concentration of the ozone in effluent is high, and the ozone in the effluent needs to be decomposed by using additional energy to ensure that the wastewater is discharged to satisfy the standards, so that the wastewater treatment cost is greatly increased;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">(2) the hydrogen peroxide, the wastewater and the ozone are mixed unevenly, the ability of the hydrogen peroxide to generate free radicals with the ozone is reduced, and the utilization efficiency of the hydrogen peroxide is reduced; and</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">(3) the efficiency in a photocatalytic reaction stage of the wastewater in an integrated reactor is difficult to improve.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">1. Problems to be Solved</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the problem that the utilization rate of ozone in a photocatalytic reaction stage of wastewater in an existing integrated reactor for photocatalytic ozone and hydrogen peroxide oxidation is difficult to improve, the present disclosure provides a multi-stage apparatus and process for advanced oxidation treatment of wastewater, and combined with characteristics of free radical reactions, parallel photocatalytic reactors and an oxidation tower are reasonably designed, so that a photocatalytic time of a system is in an ideal range when the ozone quickly generates free radicals, utilization rates of the ozone and hydrogen peroxide are increased, and the wastewater treatment cost is reduced;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">furthermore, through step-by-step mixing, that is, evenly mixing the wastewater and the hydrogen peroxide first, raising the temperature to a target temperature and then conducting mixing with the ozone, the system temperature is in the range when the ozone quickly generates the free radicals, and the utilization rate of the ozone is further increased; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">furthermore, by arranging separate mixing units for liquid-liquid mixing or gas-liquid mixing, the problem of uneven mixing of the hydrogen peroxide, the wastewater and the ozone is solved.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">2. Technical Solutions</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to resolve the above problems, the present disclosure adopts the technical solutions as follows:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A multi-stage apparatus for advanced oxidation treatment of wastewater includes a liquid-liquid mixing unit, a preheating unit, a gas-liquid mixing unit, a parallel photocatalytic reactor group and an oxidation tower connected in sequence;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">the liquid-liquid mixing unit is used for mixing to-be-treated wastewater and hydrogen peroxide;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">the preheating unit is used for preheating a mixed solution of the to-be-treated wastewater and the hydrogen peroxide;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">the gas-liquid mixing unit is used for mixing ozone at room temperature and the preheated mixed solution of the to-be-treated wastewater and the hydrogen peroxide to form a gas-liquid mixture; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">the parallel photocatalytic reactor group is internally provided with several photocatalytic reactors, and an ultraviolet lamp is arranged in the photocatalytic reactor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, an effective volume of the oxidation tower is much greater than the sum of effective volumes of the photocatalytic reactors in the parallel photocatalytic reactor group, and the effective volume of the oxidation tower is generally 5-50 times the sum of the effective volumes of the photocatalytic reactors in the parallel photocatalytic reactor group. Herein, the effective volume refers to an actual volume of water contained in the oxidation tower or the photocatalytic reactor. According to a free radical reaction principle in a photocatalytic oxidation process, a rapid reaction is conducted in an initial reaction stage, that is, an intrinsic reaction rate is very high, high mass transfer efficiency is required to match the reaction, and just as a rapid working machine requires rapid feeding to achieve high efficiency. Therefore, high enough mass transfer efficiency is required in the initial reaction stage. Several parallel photocatalytic reactors are used to replace a traditional single-channel reactor so that gas-liquid mixing and mass transfer efficiency in each reactor can be maximized. On the one hand, it can be ensured that the reaction efficiency of the reactor is not reduced under a large processing capacity; and on the other hand, the processing capacity can be flexibly adjusted by only adjusting a use number of the photocatalytic reactors without affecting the reaction efficiency. In addition, the parallel photocatalytic reactors can be used for solving the problem of reduced photocatalytic efficiency caused by pollution of outer walls of the ultraviolet lamps in time. When the outer wall of one ultraviolet lamp is polluted, the reactor could be switched out of the system, the outer wall of the ultraviolet lamp could be cleaned, and the operation of the entire device is basically not affected.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Due to a large volume of the oxidation tower, a residence time of effluent out of the parallel photocatalytic reactor group is prolonged, a slow reaction is conducted in a later photocatalytic oxidation reaction stage, and at this time, high mass transfer efficiency is not required, but an enough residence time needs to be required. By using the large-volume oxidation tower, the reaction time can be prolonged, and at the same time, the operating energy consumption for a processing capacity per unit and the equipment investment can be minimized.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, a height-to-diameter ratio of the photocatalytic reactor is 8-15.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, a height-to-diameter ratio of the oxidation tower is 5-20.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the ultraviolet lamp is axially arranged in a water flow direction.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the ultraviolet lamp is installed in a glass tube, during operation, the glass tube is polluted by pollutants in wastewater, the photocatalytic efficiency is reduced, and the glass tube needs to be removed and cleaned regularly. The parallel photocatalytic reactor group is used for a rapid oxidation reaction. When inlet and outlet valves of the photocatalytic reactor are closed and residual liquid is completely discharged, the ultraviolet lamp tube can be removed and cleaned online.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, a guide plate is arranged on a cylinder wall of the photocatalytic reactor to accelerate turbulence of gas and liquid in the photocatalytic reactor and increase the backmixing degree of materials in the reactor. On the one hand, the gas and the liquid are mixed more evenly, and on the other hand, a surface renewal rate of the gas and the liquid is increased, so that a reaction rate in the photocatalytic reactor is increased.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably, the oxidation tower is a plate tower, several layers of sieve trays are arranged in the tower for redistribution of a gas phase and a liquid phase, and specific structural sizes of the sieve trays are designed according to gas and liquid flow loads.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, a liquid-liquid static mixer is used as a liquid-liquid mixing equipment; and a gas-liquid static mixer is used as a gas-liquid mixing equipment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, a fixed-tube-sheet heat exchanger is used as a preheater.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present disclosure also provides a process for advanced oxidation treatment of wastewater by using the above apparatus, and the process includes the following steps:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">S1: mixing to-be-treated wastewater and hydrogen peroxide;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">S2: preheating a mixed solution of the to-be-treated wastewater and the hydrogen peroxide;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">S3: mixing ozone at room temperature and the preheated mixed solution of the to-be-treated wastewater and the hydrogen peroxide to form a gas-liquid mixture;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">S4: making the gas-liquid mixture enter the parallel photocatalytic reactor group for a reaction for a residence time t<sub>1</sub>, where the residence time refers to a reaction time of a stage when a COD degradation rate k is equal to or greater than 1, and k refers to a decrease of a mass concentration of COD in the wastewater per minute with a unit of mg/(L&#xb7;min); and</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">S5: making effluent in step S4 enter the oxidation tower for a residence time t<sub>2 </sub>and then discharging the effluent, where the residence time refers to a reaction time of a stage when the COD degradation rate k is less than 1.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, the utilization efficiency of the ozone is higher than 80%, more preferably higher than 86%.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably, a preheating temperature in step S2 is 50-65&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, the residence time t<sub>1 </sub>in the parallel photocatalytic reactor group (rapid reaction) in step S4 is 1-60 min, and the residence time t<sub>2 </sub>in the oxidation tower (slow reaction) in step S5 is 20-360 min. In this process, in the initial reaction stage, since the wastewater in the parallel photocatalytic reactor group can achieve rapid mass transfer, an ultraviolet light irradiation area of the wastewater per unit volume is large, the ozone and the hydrogen peroxide can be quickly stimulated to generate a large number of free radicals, and a free radical chain reaction stage is started; at this time, due to a guiding effect of the guide plate, turbulent mixing of gas and liquid in the parallel photocatalytic reactor is intensified, and a phase contact area of the gas and the liquid and the surface renewal rate are greatly increased, so that undegraded organic matter in the liquid phase is quickly mass transferred to a gas-liquid contact surface, and the reaction rate is increased; and due to the longer residence time in the oxidation tower, a free radical termination stage can have an enough residence time, so that a reaction is conducted more thoroughly, and finally the oxidation efficiency is improved.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">3. Beneficial Effects</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Compared with the prior art, the present disclosure has the following beneficial effects:</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">(1) In the multi-stage apparatus for advanced oxidation treatment of wastewater provided in the present disclosure, the parallel photocatalytic reactor group and the oxidation tower are arranged and connected in series for an advanced oxidation reaction;

a rapid free radical reaction is conducted in the parallel photocatalytic reactors with higher efficiency; in step S5, effluent in step S4 enters the oxidation tower for a residence time t<sub>2</sub>, and then is discharged, where the residence time refers to a reaction time of a stage when the COD degradation rate k is less than 1;

and</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">(5) in the present disclosure, the wastewater and the hydrogen peroxide are mixed and preheated in the preheating unit, and then a heated liquid-liquid mixture is mixed with the ozone at room temperature, so that the decomposition amount of the ozone is effectively reduced, and the utilization rate of the ozone can be maximized; and since the decomposition rate of the ozone is high, two problems need to be solved to increase the utilization rate of the ozone: first, it is ensured that the ozone and the wastewater are at optimal temperature conditions, the decomposition rate of the ozone is too high when the temperature is too high, the rate of generating free radicals by the ozone is very low when the temperature is too low, and it is found by the inventor through a lot of experiments that an optimal temperature range is 50-65&#xb0; C.; and second, it needs to be ensured that the free radicals can quickly participate in a reaction when generated, based on a synergistic oxidation effect of the ozone and the hydrogen peroxide in the presence of the hydrogen peroxide, and the free radicals can quickly participate in a reaction under the synergistic effect of the hydrogen peroxide when generated by the ozone, so that the utilization rate of the ozone is increased (increased to 80% or above), and a basis is provided for subsequent generation of the free radicals in the parallel photocatalytic reactor group.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a process and apparatus for advanced oxidation treatment of wastewater in the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a photocatalytic reactor in the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows change curves of a COD concentration and a k value with time in a small pilot test in Example 1;</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows change curves of a COD concentration and a k value with time in a small pilot test in Example 2;
