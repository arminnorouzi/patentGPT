In one form, the synthetic ball <b>10</b> is formed having a generally circular or ball shape, but other shapes are envisioned, such as a football shape, for example. The synthetic ball <b>10</b> is soft, resilient, machine washable, and can be formed in a variety of sizes. In one form, the synthetic ball <b>10</b> is sold as a bundle of balls <b>10</b> that can be used in a simulated ball fight game that can be held indoors throughout the year. The synthetic balls <b>10</b> are soft and scrunchy that no matter how fast they are thrown, they will cause no discomfort upon impact. The synthetic balls <b>10</b> are designed to compress or deform upon impact to disperse energy and then recover to their original form after impact.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Synthetic fibers are fibers that are generally created as the result of research to improve naturally occurring animal and plant fibers. In general, synthetic fibers are created by forcing, usually through extrusion, fiber forming materials through holes (called spinnerets) into the air, forming a bead. Synthetic fibers can also be made from synthesized polymers or small molecules. Non-synthetic fibers are fibers that are formed from animals (such as cotton) and plant fibers.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the synthetic ball <b>10</b> comprises a fastening fiber <b>12</b> that is located at a central core of the ball <b>10</b>. In one form, the fiber ball <b>10</b> has a radius from the central core of the fiber ball <b>10</b> of about 1.5 inches. As such, the diameter of the fiber ball <b>10</b> is about 3 inches. Extending outwardly from the fastening fiber <b>12</b> are a plurality of fibers <b>14</b>. The fibers <b>14</b> extend outwardly from the fastening fiber <b>12</b> such that a generally spherical shaped ball is formed. As set forth in greater detail below, the balls <b>10</b> are formed through a unique manufacturing process that creates a unique look and feel to the balls <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the first step in creating the balls <b>10</b> is a process called fiber bundling <b>20</b>. At this step, a fiber bundling machine <b>30</b> is used to bundle the fibers <b>14</b> to a predetermined size thereby creating a fiber bundle strand <b>22</b>. As such, the fiber bundling machine <b>30</b> bundles the fibers <b>14</b> together by gathering each single fiber <b>14</b> on each fiber reel <b>32</b> together up into the fiber bundle strand <b>22</b>. It should be appreciated that a plurality of fiber reels <b>32</b> are used to create the fiber bundle strand <b>22</b>. In the preferred form, the fiber bundle <b>22</b> has a generally cylindrical or tubular shape with a diameter of about 2 inches. After the fiber bundle strand <b>22</b> is formed, the fastening fiber <b>12</b> is placed at predetermined points <b>24</b> along the fiber bundle strand <b>22</b>. In one form, the fiber bundling machine <b>30</b> is used to place the fastening fiber <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The next step in forming the balls <b>10</b> is a process of bundle cutting <b>40</b>. In this step, a bundle cutting machine <b>34</b> is used to cut the fiber bundle strand <b>22</b> at a required length. The distance from the fastening fiber <b>12</b> to both cut ends <b>26</b> must be equal. In one form, the distance from the fastening fiber <b>12</b> to both cut ends <b>26</b> is about 2.5 inches. Equal distance makes the fiber ball <b>10</b> round after the shaping oven process is complete. Non-equal distance will result in non-round fiber balls. As a result of this step, a generally cylindrical shaped cut fiber bundle <b>28</b> is formed which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Once the generally cylindrical shaped cut fiber bundles <b>28</b> are formed, the next step in the process of creating the fiber balls <b>10</b> is shaping <b>50</b>. At this step, a spinning oven <b>36</b> is used to shape the generally cylindrical shaped cut fiber bundles <b>28</b> into the fiber ball <b>10</b>. This process is very critical to make the fiber ball <b>10</b> feel like a snowball and sound like a snowball. In one form, the spinning oven <b>36</b> is set up at 80&#xb0; C. and the cut fiber bundles <b>28</b> are heated for about 10-12 minutes. In another form, the spinning oven <b>36</b> is set up at 100&#xb0; C. and the cut fiber bundles are heated for about 8 minutes. In yet another form, the spinning oven <b>36</b> is set up at 120&#xb0; C. and the cut fiber bundles are heated for about 6 minutes. The spinning oven <b>36</b> is also set at a predetermined spinning speed to properly form the fiber ball <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The temperature and timing is critical to make the fiber ball <b>10</b> at just the right size and hardness. If the temperature is set up to high or the timing is longer, then the fiber ball <b>10</b> will be too hard and will not remain in a good looking snowball type shape and will not feel like a snowball or sound like a snowball. If the temperature is set too low or the timing is too short, then the fiber ball <b>10</b> will come out too soft and will not remain in a good looking shape and cannot come back to a ball shape after impact. The spinning oven <b>36</b> must also continuously spin during the shaping process. During the shaping process, the cut fiber bundles <b>28</b> shrink to form the fiber ball <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Although embodiments of the invention have been described using specific terms, such description is for illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood that changes and variations obvious to the skilled artisan are to be considered within the scope of the claims that follow and their equivalents.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
