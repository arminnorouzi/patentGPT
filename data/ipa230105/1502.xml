That is, typically, in order to install a component on the vehicle body, separate multi-step apparatuses are installed and managed for continuous processes on a production line.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, this typical production line structure is completed by combining components on a sub line and is basically used in a method of assembling complete units in a main buck. However, in this method, a floor, a side, and a roof are coupled in complete units to a vehicle body, and thus it is necessary to weld closed sections. In addition, in this method, components are positioned based on a pre-set assembly jig, and thus it is necessary to prepare a pre-set assembly jig for every component and to change a type and position of a jig according to a vehicle type. That is, it is cumbersome to prepare and re-arrange new equipment according to change in a type of vehicle to be produced. In addition, in spot welding, when one corresponding point of two panels is pressurized, a vehicle body is frequently distorted. In particular, this typical equipment uses a plurality of clamping jigs, concentration welding is hindered.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art while advantages achieved by the prior art are maintained intact.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Certain embodiments of the present inventive concept provide a technology for a new manufacturing process of a vehicle body, in which complete units are sequentially stacked using a method different from a typical assembly method for assembling complete units in a main buck by picking up, aligning, and gripping components of the vehicle body, loading and pressurizing the component on a position of the vehicle body, and systemizing welding equipments as one apparatus.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Certain embodiments of the present inventive concept provide one apparatus obtained by systemizing a picking apparatus, an aligning apparatus, a gripping apparatus, a pressurizing apparatus, a position checking apparatus, and a projection melting point apparatus.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present inventive concept, a multi point projection welding method includes loading a component panel having one or more protrusions famed thereon onto a vehicle body panel such that at least one of the protrusions of the component panel contacts the vehicle body panel.

This means that a plurality of protrusions may be simultaneously welded by appropriately adjusting weld time and current magnitude according to the shape and number of protrusion.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">That is, during projection welding, while the component panel is pressurized onto the vehicle body panel (in this state, the protrusion of the component panel strongly contacts the vehicle body panel), when pressurizing tips contact a vehicle body and a component at different positions from the position of the protrusion and current flows, welding is performed at a plurality of positions, and thus the number of processes for welding may be reduced and also problems do not occur in terms of distortion or tilt of components due to the pressurizing tips because the pressurizing tip has only to contact the vehicle body and the component as long as current flows.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Since the pressurizing tips have only to approach different positions other when a welding point, it is very advantageous in that problems in terms of interference between the pressurizing tips and a panel or other production equipment may also be prevented for welding panels with a complex shape. In particular, according to typical spot welding, welding points of two panels that contact each other are pressurized onto each other in opposite directions so as to weld the weld points, and thus it is difficult to apply the typical spot welding to a panel such as a closed section and so on. However, according to the a multi point projection welding method, both pressurizing tips may approach the panel in one direction of the panel, and thus there is no limit in applying the multi point projection welding method to a vehicle body structure that is difficult to approach, such as a closed section and so on.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In particular, the problem in terms of strength of welding that proceeds in one direction may be overcome by forming a protrusion on a panel and locally concentrating current.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the height H of the protrusion of the panel may be appropriately adjusted according to a welding condition. In certain embodiments, the height H may be at least a minimum of 0.1 mm. In certain embodiments, current may have a magnitude of about 3 to 35 kA according to a type of a used welder. That is, the current magnitude may be changed according to a material and a thickness thereof, and in the case of a MF DC welder, the current magnitude may be adjusted to 20 kA from 3 kA, and in the case of a capacitor welder, the current magnitude may be adjusted up to 35 kA.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In certain embodiments, with regard to weld time, current may flow for 0.01 second to 1 second, and in the case of multi-step welding, current may flow for maximum of 2 seconds and target points may be welded.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to the present disclosure, two welding portions of multi point projection welding do not have to pressurize the vehicle body panel and the component panel. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the vehicle body pressurizing tip <b>35</b> may be pressurized onto one side of the component panel, and the component pressurizing tip <b>65</b> may be pressurized onto the other side of the component panel.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to this welding method, a plurality of clamps that are used to fix a component to a typical jig may be omitted, and a trajectory along which a robot performs many operations may be simplified in order to prevent interference of jig, which is advantageous for ensuring cycle time.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a state in which a component panel is loaded in a component loading-welding system according to an embodiment of the present inventive concept. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a state in which a component panel is pressurized onto a vehicle body panel and projection key welding is performed in the component loading-welding system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a state in which a component panel is clamped to a component loading-welding system according to an embodiment of the present inventive concept. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of a state in which a component panel is not clamped to a component loading-welding system, which is viewed at a different angle, according to an embodiment of the present inventive concept. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a state in which a rotation portion is rotated at a different angle in the component loading-welding system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a state in which a radius moving portion, a vehicle body pressurizing moving portion, and a component pressurizing moving portion are moved at a rotation portion position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> such that a vehicle body pressurizing tip and a component pressurizing tip are pressurized onto a vehicle body (not shown) and a component (not shown) at a pressurizing position of projection key welding.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Hereinafter, a component loading-welding system <b>1</b> using the aforementioned multi point projection welding method will be described. According to an embodiment of the multi point projection welding method, even if both two pressurizing tips approach one side of a panel, no problem arises, and thus the pressurizing tips <b>35</b> and <b>65</b> for welding may be integrated with a component panel pressurizing apparatus and one apparatus.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">First, the component loading-welding system <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present inventive concept may be fixed to an end of a robot aim R, a position of the component loading-welding system <b>1</b> may be adjusted by the robot arm R, and a rotation portion <b>11</b> and a pressurizing portion <b>13</b> may be relatively rotated. This is an integration system, and thus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the component panel P may be clamped by the system <b>1</b> from a component supplying box S, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the robot arm R and the system <b>1</b> align and apply pressure to the component panel P at a home position of the vehicle body panel B and simultaneously the vehicle body pressurizing tip <b>35</b> and the component pressurizing tip <b>65</b> are pressurized to the vehicle body panel and the component panel and current flows so as to weld the vehicle body panel and the component panel via welding in the system <b>1</b>. That is, it is possible to clamp a component panel by one system <b>1</b> and to weld the component panel to the vehicle body panel.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A structure of the system <b>1</b> will be described in detail. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the system <b>1</b> includes the rotation portion <b>11</b> with one end coupled to the robot arm R and the pressurizing portion <b>13</b> coupled to the other end of the rotation portion <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The robot arm R may be coupled to the rotation portion <b>11</b> and may relatively rotate the rotation portion <b>11</b> and the pressurizing portion <b>13</b>. The rotation portion <b>11</b> includes a rotation portion body <b>110</b> that constitutes a frame thereof and the pressurizing portion <b>13</b> may also include a pressurizing portion body <b>130</b> that constitutes a frame thereof. The robot arm R is coupled to the rotation portion body <b>110</b>. The rotation portion body <b>110</b> and the pressurizing portion body <b>130</b> are rotatably coupled around a rotational axis.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The pressurizing portion body <b>130</b> is disposed at an opposite position to the robot arm R based on the rotation portion body <b>110</b>, and thus the pressurizing portion <b>13</b> may load the component panel P onto the vehicle body panel B toward an axial direction of a rotation axis of relation rotation of the rotation portion <b>11</b> and the pressurizing portion <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The rotation portion body <b>110</b> includes a picking device for holding and releasing of the component panel P. The picking device <b>20</b> is installed on and is integrally operated with the rotation portion body <b>110</b>. In certain embodiments, the picking device <b>20</b> may be an electromagnet or a vacuum suction device. In certain embodiments, the picking device <b>20</b> may be used to pick up one component from components that are stacked on each other, and may temporarily pick up the component panel from a component stack and re-put it on a temporary storage place of the component. That is, in certain embodiments, when a robot arm is moved to reach an upper portion of stacked components while a vacuum is formed in a vacuum suction device, for example, a vacuum cup of an end of the picking device <b>20</b>, the component panel is held by the picking device <b>20</b> due to vacuum. In this embodiment, while the robot arm is moved and the component panel is held by the picking device <b>20</b>, when the component panel is put on the temporary storage place and vacuum suction of the picking device <b>20</b> is released, one component panel may be put on the temporary storage place. As such, the component panel moved to the temporary storage place is fixed to the pressurizing portion <b>13</b> by a pin clamp <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The component panel P is moved to a home position of the vehicle body panel and is pressurized by a pressurizing plate <b>50</b> of the pressurizing portion <b>13</b>, and the picking device is a device that is temporarily used to pick up one component panel from a plurality of component panels.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In certain embodiments, the pin clamp <b>70</b> includes at least two pins. Thus, the robot arm may be moved to allow the pin clamp <b>70</b> to approach a component panel put on a temporary storage place so as to accurately align and clamp the component panel by the pin clamp <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the pressurizing plate <b>50</b> is fixed to an inner portion (an upper portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) of the clamped component panel P. The pressurizing plate <b>50</b> has a shape corresponding to the component panel P so as to stably load the component panel to a vehicle body during pressurization of the component panel to the vehicle body. The pressurizing plate <b>50</b> may be changed according to a vehicle type or a type of the component panel P. In certain embodiments, the pressurizing plate <b>50</b> is detachably installed in a pressurizing plate coupling portion <b>53</b> installed in the pressurizing portion body <b>130</b> using a welding force absorbing portion <b>55</b>, which in certain embodiments is a spring, as a medium. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, when the robot arm is pressured toward the vehicle body in a rotation axis of the system, the pressurizing plate <b>50</b> installed in the pressurizing plate coupling portion <b>53</b> stably pressurizes the component panel to a home position, and thus a pressurizing force is absorbed into the welding force absorbing portion <b>55</b> as a spring, thereby preventing the component panel or the vehicle body panel from being changed due to force of the robot arm.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">While the pressurizing plate <b>50</b> pressurizes the component panel P onto the vehicle body panel B, embodiments of the aforementioned multi point projection welding method may be used. To this end, the system according to embodiments of the present inventive concept is configured in such a way that the vehicle body pressurizing tip <b>35</b> is installed in the rotation portion body <b>110</b> and the component pressurizing tip <b>65</b> for pressurizing the component panel P is installed in the pressurizing portion body <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Since the component pressurizing tip <b>65</b> is installed in the pressurizing portion <b>13</b>, the component pressurizing tip <b>65</b> installed in the pressurizing portion <b>13</b> is also fixed to the pin clamp <b>70</b>, and pressure to the component panel P pressurized by the pressurizing plate <b>50</b> may be easily applied or released. In certain embodiments, the component pressurizing tip <b>65</b> is also moved forward and backward by a component pressurizing moving portion <b>63</b> installed in the pressurizing portion <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The vehicle body pressurizing tip <b>35</b> is moved to a portion of a vehicle body, to be pressurized, and then is pressurized. To this end, in certain embodiments, a position of the vehicle body pressurizing tip <b>35</b> is adjusted by relatively rotating the rotation portion body <b>110</b> with respect to the pressurizing portion body <b>130</b> to adjust a directional angle and then moving the rotation portion body <b>110</b> in a radial direction of a rotational axis of a rotation portion by a radius moving portion <b>31</b> so as to be close to or away from the rotational axis of the rotation portion. As such, in certain embodiments, according to rotation of the rotation portion and an operation of the radius moving portion, the vehicle body pressurizing tip that is accurately aligned is moved forward and backward in the same direction as a rotational axis direction of the rotation portion by a vehicle body pressurizing moving portion <b>33</b> so as to apply pressure to or release pressure from the vehicle body. A position of the vehicle body to be pressurized by the vehicle body pressurizing tip may be changed according to a vehicle type, and a type and position of a component panel to which the vehicle body panel is welded. As such, the vehicle body pressurizing tip may be aligned and an operation is performed according to rotation of the rotation portion and radius-adjustment of the radius moving portion <b>31</b>, and thus a typical technology of newly aligning jigs for every component and every vehicle type may be flexibly and widely used without cumbersome.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The system <b>1</b> according to embodiments of the present inventive concept is configured to achieve the following weld structure of the vehicle body pressurizing tip <b>35</b> and the component pressurizing tip <b>65</b> so as to freely rotate the rotation portion and the pressurizing portion.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In certain embodiments, a current generating apparatus <b>40</b> is installed in the rotation portion body <b>110</b>, a conductive ring <b>43</b> exposed to a rotation portion body is installed in the pressurizing portion body <b>130</b>, and the conductive ring <b>43</b> is electrically connected to the component pressurizing tip <b>65</b>. Both the conductive ring <b>43</b> and the component pressurizing tip are included in the pressurizing portion body <b>130</b>, and thus the conductive ring <b>43</b> and the component pressurizing tip may be electrically connected irrespective of rotation of the rotation portion <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In certain embodiments, the vehicle body pressurizing tip <b>35</b> may also be electrically connected to the conductive ring <b>43</b>. In certain embodiments, the vehicle body pressurizing tip <b>35</b> may be relatively rotated with respect to the conductive ring <b>43</b>, and thus vehicle body pressurizing tip <b>35</b> and the conductive ring <b>43</b> may be connected using an elastic terminal and so on so as to be electrically connected to each other while being relatively moved with respect to each other. On the other hand, in certain embodiments, since the vehicle body pressurizing tip <b>35</b> is integrally rotated with the current generating apparatus <b>40</b>, the vehicle body pressurizing tip <b>35</b> may be electrically connected directly to the current generating apparatus <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In certain embodiments, the current generating apparatus <b>40</b> may be selectively and electrically connected to the conductive ring <b>43</b> by an indirect current carrying portion <b>41</b>.
