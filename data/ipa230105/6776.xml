To ensure signal transmission quality, a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is introduced.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The HARQ is a technology that combines a forward error correction (FEC) method and an automatic repeat request (ARQ) method. In FEC, redundant information is added, so that a receive end corrects a part of errors, to reduce a quantity of retransmissions. For an error that is unable to be corrected through the FEC, the receive end requests, by using an ARQ mechanism, a transmit end to retransmit data. The receive end is configured to use an error detection code to detect whether a received data packet is successfully decoded. If the decoding succeeds, the receive end sends an acknowledgement (ACK) to the transmit end. After receiving the ACK, the transmit end sends a next data packet. If the decoding fails, the receive end sends a negative acknowledgement (NACK) to the transmit end. After receiving the NACK, the transmit end retransmits same data.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, for downlink transmission, how a terminal device performs HARQ feedback to reduce power consumption of the terminal device still needs to be further studied currently.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some embodiments provide a communication method and an apparatus, to implement flexible HARQ feedback, and to adapt to service constraints in different scenarios, reduce HARQ feedback overheads, and reduce power consumption of a terminal device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a communication method.

The wireless terminal device is a device that provides voice and/or data connectivity for a user, a handheld device with a wireless connection function, or another processing device connected to a wireless modem.

The terminal device is a mobile terminal device, for example, a mobile phone (or referred to as a &#x201c;cellular&#x201d; phone or a mobile phone), a computer, and a data card. For example, the terminal device is a portable, pocket-sized, handheld, computer built-in, or vehicle-mounted mobile apparatus that exchanges voice and/or data with the radio access network. For example, the terminal device is a personal communications service (PCS) phone, a cordless phone, a session initiation protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer (Pad), or a computer having wireless receiving and sending functions.

For example, the network device is a radio access network (RAN) node (or device) that enables a terminal device to access the wireless network, and further is referred to as a base station.

For ease of description, in some embodiments, an apparatus that provides a wireless communication function for a terminal device is referred to as a network device.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">(3) The terms &#x201c;system&#x201d; and &#x201c;network&#x201d; is used interchangeably in some embodiments. &#x201c;At least one&#x201d; means one or more, and &#x201c;a plurality of&#x201d; means two or more. The term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; describes an association relationship between associated objects and represents that three relationships exists. For example, A and/or B represents the following cases: A exists, both A and B exist, and B exists, where A and B is singular or plural.

The RAN device includes a baseband apparatus and a radio frequency apparatus. The baseband apparatus is implemented by one node, or is implemented by a plurality of nodes. The radio frequency apparatus is independently implemented remotely from the baseband apparatus, or is integrated into the baseband apparatus, or a part of the radio frequency apparatus is implemented remotely from the baseband apparatus and a remaining part is integrated into the baseband apparatus. For example, in an LTE communication system, a RAN device (eNB) includes a baseband apparatus and a radio frequency apparatus. The radio frequency apparatus is remotely disposed relative to the baseband apparatus. For example, a remote radio unit (RRU) is remotely disposed relative to a BBU. For another example, in an evolved structure, a RAN device includes a CU and a DU, a plurality of DUs are centrally controlled by one CU, and an interface between the CU and the DU is referred to as an F1-U interface.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>is a schematic diagram of another network architecture, in accordance with some embodiments. Compared with the network architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>c, </i>a control plane (CP) and a user plane (UP) of a CU further is split and implemented as different entities: a control plane (CP) CU entity (namely, a CU-CP entity) and a user plane (UP) CU entity (namely, a CU-UP entity).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the foregoing network architecture, signaling generated by the CU is sent to a terminal device through a DU, or signaling generated by a terminal device is sent to the CU through a DU. The DU transparently transmits the signaling to the terminal device or the CU by directly encapsulating the signaling at a protocol layer without parsing the signaling. In the following embodiments, if transmission of such signaling between the DU and the terminal device is involved, sending, or receiving of the signaling by the DU includes this scenario. For example, radio resource control (RRC) layer signaling or packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer signaling is finally processed as physical layer signaling and sent to the terminal device or is converted from received physical layer signaling. In this architecture, the RRC layer signaling or the PDCP layer signaling is sent by the DU, or sent by the DU and a radio frequency apparatus.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The network architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>a, </i><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>is applicable to communication systems of various radio access technologies (RATs). For example, the communication system is a 5G (or referred to as new radio (NR)) communication system, or certainly be a future communication system. Network architectures and service scenarios described in some embodiments are intended to describe the technical solutions more clearly, and do not constitute any limitation on the technical solutions provided. A person of ordinary skill in the art knows, with evolution of the communication network architecture and emergence of new service scenarios, the technical solutions provided are further applicable to resolving similar technical problems.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, an apparatus i is in a terminal device or a network device based on a function implemented by the apparatus. When the foregoing CU-DU structure is used, the network device is a CU, a DU, or a RAN device including a CU and a DU.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the network architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>a, </i><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>c, </i>communication between the network device and the terminal device complies with a protocol layer structure. For example, a control plane protocol layer structure includes functions of protocol layers such as an RRC layer, a PDCP layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, a media access control (MAC) layer, and a physical layer (PHY); and a user plane protocol layer structure includes functions of protocol layers such as the PDCP layer, the RLC layer, the MAC layer, and the physical layer. In a possible implementation, a service data adaptation protocol (SDAP) layer is further included above the PDCP layer. For example, the network device implements the functions of the protocol layers such as the RRC layer, the PDCP layer, the RLC layer, and the MAC layer through one node or a plurality of nodes. For example, if the network device includes a CU and a DU, the CU and the DU is obtained through division based on a protocol layer of a wireless network. For example, functions of the PDCP layer and a protocol layer above the PDCP layer are set on the CU, and functions of protocol layers below the PDCP layer, such as the RLC layer and the MAC layer, are set on the DU. Division based on the protocol layer is an example, and division alternatively is performed based on another protocol layer, for example, based on the RLC layer. Functions of the RLC layer and a layer above the RLC layer are set on the CU, and functions of protocol layers below the RLC layer are set on the DU. Alternatively, division is performed at a protocol layer. For example, some functions of the RLC layer and a function of a protocol layer above the RLC layer are set on the CU, and a remaining function of the RLC layer and functions of protocol layers below the RLC layer are set on the DU. In addition, division alternatively is performed in another manner. For example, division is performed based on a delay. A function whose processing time needs to meet a delay constraint is set on the DU, and a function whose processing time does not need to meet the delay constraint is set on the CU.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Data transmission between the network device and the terminal device is used as an example. Data transmission needs to pass through a user plane protocol layer, for example, the SDAP layer, the PDCP layer, the RLC layer, the MAC layer, and the physical layer. The SDAP layer, the PDCP layer, the RLC layer, the MAC layer, and the physical layer further is collectively referred to as an access stratum. Because a data transmission direction is divided into sending and receiving, each layer is further divided into a sending part and a receiving part. Downlink data transmission is used as an example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic diagram of downlink data transmission between layers. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref><i>a, </i>a downward arrow represents data sending, and an upward arrow represents data receiving. After obtaining data from an upper layer, a PDCP layer transmits the data to an RLC layer and a MAC layer, the MAC layer generates a transport block (TB), and then wireless transmission is performed through a physical layer. Data is correspondingly encapsulated at each layer. Data received by a layer from an upper layer of the layer is considered as a service data unit (SDU) of the layer. After being encapsulated at the layer, the data becomes a protocol data unit (PDU), and is then transferred to a next layer. For example, data received by the PDCP layer from an upper layer is referred to as a PDCP SDU, and data sent by the PDCP layer to a lower layer is referred to as a PDCP PDU. Data received by the RLC layer from an upper layer is referred to as an RLC SDU, and data sent by the RLC layer to a lower layer is referred to as an RLC PDU. Data received by the MAC layer from an upper layer is referred to as a MAC SDU, and data sent by the MAC layer to a lower layer is referred to as a MAC PDU. The MAC PDU further is referred to as the TB. In a protocol, the layers correspond to each other mostly through a channel The RLC layer corresponds to the MAC layer through a logical channel (LCH), the MAC layer corresponds to the physical layer through a transport channel (transport channel), and the physical layer corresponds to a physical layer at another end through a physical channel (physical channel).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">It can be further learned from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>that the terminal device is further configured to have an application layer and a non-access stratum. The application layer is used to provide a service for an application program installed on the terminal device. For example, downlink data received by the terminal device is sequentially transmitted from the physical layer to the application layer, and then the application layer provides the downlink data for the application program. The non-access stratum is used to forward user data. For example, the non-access stratum forwards uplink data received from the application layer to the SDAP layer, or forwards downlink data received from the SDAP layer to the application layer.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The downlink data transmission shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>is still used as an example. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref><i>b. </i>A MAC layer of a network device includes a HARQ entity (HARQ entity), and one HARQ entity maintains or manages one or more HARQ processes (HARQ processes), for example, HARQ process 1, HARQ process 2, . . . , and HARQ process n. Each HARQ process has an independent HARQ buffer (buffer) at a receive end (namely, a terminal device), for example, HARQ buffer 1, HARQ buffer 2, . . . , and HARQ buffer n. HARQ buffer 1 is a HARQ buffer of HARQ process 1, HARQ buffer 2 is a HARQ buffer of HARQ process 2, and the rest is deduced by analogy.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The HARQ process sends data based on a stop-and-wait protocol (stop-and-wait protocol), and therefore further is referred to as a stop-and-wait process (stop-and-wait process). In the stop-and-wait protocol, after sending a TB, a transmit end stops to wait for acknowledgement information, and the receive end performs acknowledgement (ACK) or negative acknowledgement (NACK) for the TB. Considering that a throughput is very low because the transmit end stops to wait for an acknowledgement after each transmission, a plurality of parallel HARQ processes are used in an LTE communication system and a 5G communication system. When a HARQ process is waiting for acknowledgement information, the transmit end continues to send data by using another HARQ process. These HARQ processes jointly form a HARQ entity. The HARQ entity is combined with the stop-and-wait protocol to allow continuous transmission of data.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The HARQ buffer corresponding to each HARQ process is used to buffer a data packet that fails to be decoded, so that soft combining is performed on received data. In an HARQ mechanism, after determining that decoding of a received data packet fails, the receive end discards the data packet, and sends a NACK to the transmit end to request retransmission of the data packet. Considering that the data packet that fails to be decoded includes useful information, and if the data packet is discarded, the useful information further is discarded, a HARQ with soft combining (HARQ with soft combining) is used. The receive end stores the received data packet that fails to be decoded in a HARQ buffer, and combine the data packet with a subsequently received and retransmitted data packet, to obtain a data packet that is more reliable than an individually decoded data packet (this is referred to as a &#x201c;soft combining&#x201d; process). Then, the receive end decodes the data packet after combining.

For example, the TB is associated with HARQ information, and the HARQ information is transferred from a physical layer to a MAC layer. The HARQ information includes a new data indicator (NDI), a transport block size (TBS), a redundancy version (RV), and a HARQ process identifier (HARQ process ID). The NDI is for indicating whether a TB is newly transmitted or retransmitted. Each HARQ process stores an NDI value. If, compared with a previous NDI value, an NDI value of a same HARQ process is toggled (NDI toggled), current transmission TB is a newly transmitted TB; or if an NDI value of a same HARQ process is not toggled (NDI not toggled), current transmission is a retransmitted TB. The RV is for indicating a redundancy version used for transmission, where a value range of the RV is 0 to 3. The HARQ process identifier is information for identifying a HARQ process. For example, the HARQ process identifier is a HARQ process number.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Accordingly, after receiving the TB, the physical layer of the terminal device delivers the TB to a decoding entity at a MAC layer, so that the decoding entity performs decoding.

This is understood as: The network device schedules a dynamic scheduling resource by using the DCI. For example, the network device is unable to notify, by using the DCI, the terminal device to receive data (for downlink) on a frequency band of YYY at time of XXX, and send data (for uplink) on a frequency band of VVV at time of ZZZ. In other words, the dynamic scheduling resource is a resource for downlink transmission, or is a resource for uplink transmission.

A configured downlink assignment (configured downlink assignment) configured by the network device is valid for a plurality of times. For example, the network device notifies, by using RRC signaling, MAC signaling, or physical layer signaling, a terminal to receive data on a frequency band of YYY at time of XXX, and then receive data on the frequency band of YYY at the time of XXX at an interval of periodicity T.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">For example, the network device configures an SPS resource by using an RRC message, where the RRC message includes parameters such as a periodicity of the SPS resource and a quantity of HARQ processes that use the SPS resource; and activate or reactivate the SPS resource by using DCI or a MAC layer control message. For example, the DCI is used to activate or reactivate the SPS resource. The DCI includes parameters such as a time-frequency position and a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) of the SPS resource.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of activating, deactivating, and reactivating an SPS resource by a network device by using DCI.

The URLLC service is applied to scenarios such as a smart grid and an intelligent transportation system. The URLLC service usually has a periodicity, and has very high constraints on a delay and reliability. Therefore, an SPS resource is used for downlink transmission of the service.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic diagram of transmitting a data packet (namely, a TB) by using an SPS resource. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref><i>a, </i>a quantity of HARQ processes is 5, namely, HARQ process 1 to HARQ process 5 (where #1 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>represents that a HARQ process ID corresponding to an SPS resource is HARQ process 1). Transmission reliability of a URLLC service is high. Therefore, in a possible case, seven TBs are consecutively transmitted on the SPS resource and one TB fails to be decoded, and a terminal device needs to feed back a NACK. The terminal device needs to feed back ACKs for the other six TBs that are successfully decoded.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Considering that the reliability of the URLLC service reaches 99.999%, when radio link quality is good, a NACK needs to be fed back for one of approximately 100,000 data packets that fails to be transmitted, and ACKs need to be fed back for more than 99,000 remaining data packets. Consequently, ACK feedback overheads are large. Therefore, in a possible solution, the terminal device is configured to use a HARQ feedback manner with NACK feedback (in other words, skip ACK feedback), so that ACK feedback overheads can be reduced by a large quantity, and power consumption of the terminal device is reduced.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Table 1 shows feedback behaviors that the terminal device has when the HARQ feedback manner with only NACK feedback is used.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>HARQ feedback manner with only NACK feedback</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>HARQ feedback of the</entry><entry>Behavior of the</entry></row><row><entry>DL decoding result</entry><entry>terminal device</entry><entry>network device</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>TB decoding fails</entry><entry>NACK</entry><entry>Schedule retransmission</entry></row><row><entry>TB decoding succeeds</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>No further behavior</entry></row><row><entry>No TB is received</entry><entry>NACK</entry><entry>No further behavior</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">It can be learned from Table 1 that the terminal device no longer feeds back an ACK when TB decoding succeeds, and feeds back a NACK when TB decoding fails or a TB is not received. Accordingly, if the network device receives the NACK feedback, the network device determines that the corresponding TB fails to be transmitted, and schedules retransmission of the TB; or if the network device does not receive any feedback, the network device determines that the corresponding TB is successfully transmitted.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">However, the solution in which the terminal device uses, for an SPS resource by default, the HARQ feedback manner with only NACK feedback has a limitation. For example, this solution is mainly applicable to a scenario in which a service periodicity matches an SPS periodicity. URLLC service scenarios are diversified. Therefore, there are some other scenarios, for example, Scenario 1 to Scenario 3 described below.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">Scenario 1</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">In some scenarios such as a smart grid, a data packet for differential protection not has high constraints on a delay and reliability, but further calls for a delay variation to be within a low range. Therefore, in some scenarios, a service periodicity is a non-integer multiple of an SPS periodicity. For example, the service periodicity is 0.833 ms. As a result, an integer multiple of one slot is unable to be used to configure a matching SPS periodicity. In this case, a plurality of sets of SPS resources are configured, to meet a delay variation constraint as much as possible. For example, a periodicity of one set of SPS resources is 0.8 ms, and a periodicity of another SPS resource is 0.9 ms. However, in this manner, no TB is transmitted on some configured downlink assignments.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref><i>b, </i>data packets arrive at an interval of 0.833 ms, and two sets of SPS resources with different periodicities are configured. A periodicity of a first set of SPS resources is 0.8 ms, and HARQ processes are HARQ process 1 to HARQ process 5. A periodicity of a second set of SPS resources is 0.9 ms, and HARQ processes are HARQ process 6 to HARQ process 10. In a time period, TBs are transmitted in HARQ process 6, HARQ process 2, HARQ process 3, HARQ process 4, HARQ process 9, HARQ process 10, and HARQ process 6 that correspond to the SPS, so that the terminal device feeds back ACKs; and no TB is transmitted on another resource, so that the terminal device feeds back NACKs. In the time period, the TBs are transmitted on seven of thirteen configured downlink assignments in total. When more sets of SPS resources are configured, there is more configured downlink assignments on which no TB is transmitted. As a result, there is a large quantity of NACK feedbacks.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">Scenario 2</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref><i>c, </i>for a service with an indefinite periodicity, that is, a service in which there is no fixed periodicity for arrival of a data packet, to meet a strict delay constraint of the service, a network device configures a short SPS periodicity, so that when a downlink data packet arrives, the data packet can be transmitted in a timely manner, to reduce a transmission delay. However, in this manner, no TB is transmitted on a large quantity of configured downlink assignments. For example, HARQ feedbacks corresponding to HARQ process 2, HARQ process 3, HARQ process 5, and HARQ process 1 are NACKs.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">Scenario 3</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">In some remote control applications in an industrial scenario with a strict delay, a data packet arrives at an interval of less than 0.5 ms.

Therefore, any HARQ feedback of the terminal device is no longer helpful to reliability of the service.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0131">Based on this, some embodiments provide a communication method, to implement flexible HARQ feedback, and to adapt to service constraint in different scenarios, reduce HARQ feedback overheads, and reduce power consumption of the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132">In the following descriptions, the communication method provided in some embodiments is applicable to the network architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>a. </i>The method is performed by a first communication apparatus and a second communication apparatus.

When the terminal device is in DRX active mode, the terminal device powers on a receiver to monitor a PDCCH (for example, monitors PDCCHs scrambled by using various RNTIs). When the terminal device is in DRX dormant mode, the terminal device is unneeded to monitor the PDCCH, to reduce the power consumption of the terminal device. That the terminal device is in DRX active mode alternatively is described as: The terminal device is in active mode, or the terminal device is in awake mode, or the terminal device is awake. This is not limited. That the terminal device is in DRX dormant mode alternatively is described as: The terminal device is in dormant mode, or the terminal device is in sleep mode.

In each cycle, the terminal device wakes up regularly for a period of time (the terminal device is in DRX active mode in the period of time) to monitor the PDCCH. There are two types of DRX cycles: a long cycle and a short cycle. The long cycle is an integer multiple of the short cycle.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0227">(2) drx-onDurationTimer: drx-onDurationTimer represents continuous downlink duration, and indicates a period of time in which the terminal device keeps awake after waking up (that is, a period of time in which the terminal device is in DRX active mode). In this period of time, the terminal device needs to monitor the PDCCH. The timer starts at a starting moment of each DRX cycle.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0228">(3) drx-InactivityTimer: drx-InactivityTimer represents continuous downlink duration, and the terminal device needs to monitor the PDCCH in the duration. The timer is started or restarted when the terminal device successfully demodulates a PDCCH that is for scheduling newly transmitted data (which is newly transmitted uplink or downlink data) of the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0229">(4) drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer: drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer represents a minimum retransmission scheduling interval, which is for indicating a minimum quantity of symbols after which a next HARQ retransmission occurs. The timer is classified into an uplink corresponding timer (namely, drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL) and a downlink corresponding timer (namely, drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL). drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL is started in the 1<sup>st </sup>symbol after end of HARQ feedback for a HARQ process transmitted on a downlink. drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL is started in the 1<sup>st </sup>symbol after end of uplink transmission of a HARQ process (if the uplink transmission is repetition (repetition) transmission, drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL is started in the 1<sup>st </sup>symbol after end of the 1<sup>st </sup>transmission).</p><p id="p-0233" num="0230">(5) drx-RetransmissionTimer: drx-RetransmissionTimer represents a waiting period of time for receiving scheduling for retransmission, and the timer indicates a maximum period of time in which the terminal device in DRX active mode waits for retransmitted data. The timer is classified into an uplink corresponding timer (namely, drx-RetransmissionTimerUL) and a downlink corresponding timer (namely, drx-RetransmissionTimerDL). drx-RetransmissionTimerDL is started in the 1<sup>st </sup>symbol after drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL of a HARQ process expires, and drx-RetransmissionTimerUL is started in the 1<sup>st </sup>symbol after drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL of a HARQ process expires.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0231">(6) drx-shortCycleTimer: drx-shortCycleTimer represents lifetime of the short cycle. After the timer expires, the long cycle needs to be used. When the short cycle is configured, the timer is started or restarted in the following two cases: (1) drx-Inactivity Timer expires; and (2) the terminal device receives a DRX command MAC CE. The DRX command MAC CE is a MAC CE that enables the terminal device to immediately enter dormant mode. After receiving the control signaling, the terminal device immediately stops drx-onDurationTimer and drx-InactivityTimer.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0232">In addition to the parameters described above, other possible parameters, for example, drx-SlotOffset and drx-StartOffset, is further configured by the network device for the terminal device. drx-StartOffset is for determining a subframe from which a DRX cycle starts, and drx-SlotOffset is for delaying starting of drx-onDurationTimer by a period of time from a front boundary of the subframe in which a start location of the DRX cycle is located.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0233">The terminal device maintains the DRX cycle and various timers described above according to the following rules. The DRX cycle, drx-onDurationTimer, drx-InactivityTimer, and drx-shortCycleTimer are maintained per MAC entity (per MAC entity), that is, one MAC entity of the terminal device maintains one set of DRX cycles, drx-onDurationTimer, drx-InactivityTimer, drx-shortCycleTimer, and the like. drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer and drx-RetransmissionTimer are maintained per HARQ process, that is, each HARQ process starts/restarts, based on a condition, drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer and drx-RetransmissionTimer that are related to the HARQ process.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0234">After the DRX cycle is configured, a period of time in which the terminal device is in active mode (namely, a period of time in which the terminal device is awake) includes: (1) a period of time in which drx-onDurationTimer/drx-InactivityTimer/drx-RetransmissionTimerDL/drx-RetransmissionTimerUL runs; (2) a period of time in which ra-ContentionResolutionTimer runs, where ra-ContentionResolutionTimer is for receiving a Msg <b>4</b> in a random access process; (3) a period of time in which an SR is suspended, where the terminal device sends the scheduling request (scheduling request, SR) on a PUCCH; and (4) a period of time in which the terminal device is in a collision-free random access process, where the terminal device successfully receives a random access response (random access response, RAR) but does not receive newly transmitted data scheduled by a PDCCH that is scrambled by using a cell radio network temporary identifier (cell radio network temporary identifier, C-RNTI).</p><p id="p-0238" num="0235">As described above, an SPS resource is a periodic downlink resource configured by the network device for the terminal device. Different from a dynamic scheduling resource (where a HARQ resource corresponding to the dynamic scheduling resource is dynamically indicated by using DCI), a HARQ resource corresponding to the SPS resource alternatively is configured by the network device in a semi-persistent manner. However, in a time division duplex (TDD) system, configuring the HARQ resource corresponding to the SPS resource in the semi-persistent manner results in overlap between a HARQ resource corresponding to a part of SPS resources (for example, a first HARQ resource corresponding to a first SPS resource) and a downlink resource. Consequently, the terminal device is unable to send, on the first HARQ resource, feedback information for a HARQ process corresponding to the first SPS resource. To resolve this problem, a possible solution is as follows. The network device dynamically triggers retransmission of the feedback information. For example, the network device indicates a new HARQ resource (which is referred to as a second HARQ resource) to the terminal device by using DCI, so that the terminal device can send, on the second HARQ resource, the feedback information for the HARQ process corresponding to the first SPS resource.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0236">However, if a DRX function is configured for the terminal device, the terminal device is in DRX dormant mode in a period of time before and after the first SPS resource, in other words, the terminal device does not monitor DCI scheduled by the network device. Consequently, the network device is unable to indicate, to the terminal device in a timely manner by using the DCI, a retransmission resource for the feedback information, and the terminal device is unable to send, to the network device in a timely manner, the feedback information for the HARQ process corresponding to the first SPS resource. This affects downlink transmission efficiency.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0237">Based on this, some embodiments provide a communication method, to improve the downlink transmission efficiency.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0238">The following describes in detail the communication method provided with reference to Embodiment 5 and Embodiment 6.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Embodiment 5</heading><p id="p-0242" num="0239">In Embodiment 5, a terminal device receives configuration information from a network device.

Configuration information 1 is for configuring the first SPS resource, and configuration information 2 is for configuring the first HARQ resource. For an implementation of configuring the first SPS resource by using configuration information 1, refer to the foregoing descriptions related to the SPS resource. For example, the network device sends an RRC message to the terminal device. The RRC message includes configuration information 1. Configuration information 1 includes a parameter such as a periodicity of an SPS resource. Each periodicity includes one SPS resource, and the first SPS resource is an SPS resource in a periodicity. For an implementation of configuring the first HARQ resource by using configuration information 2, adaptively refer to the implementation of configuring the first SPS resource by using configuration information 1.

When the HARQ feedback manner for the HARQ process corresponding to the first SPS resource is the normal HARQ feedback manner if the terminal device receives a data packet from the HARQ process, and the data packet is successfully decoded, the terminal device feeds back, on a corresponding HARQ resource, an ACK for transmission corresponding to the HARQ process; or if the terminal device receives a data packet from the HARQ process, and the data packet fails to be decoded, the terminal device feeds back, on a corresponding HARQ resource, a NACK for transmission corresponding to the HARQ process; or if the terminal device does not receive a data packet from the HARQ process, the terminal device feeds back, on a corresponding HARQ resource, a NACK for transmission corresponding to the HARQ process.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0246">The second HARQ feedback manner is skipping NACK feedback or is ACK-only feedback.

For example, the terminal device determines that the first HARQ resource and a first resource overlap, where the first resource is for transmitting downlink information. For example, the first resource is a downlink resource in a TDD system. In this case, the feedback information for the HARQ process corresponding to the first SPS resource is unable to be sent on the first HARQ resource.

A value of k1 or k2 is predetermined in a protocol, or is configured by the network device for the terminal device. For example, the network device configures the value of k1 or k2 by using an RRC message. For example, the start moment of the first SPS resource is a start moment of the 1<sup>st </sup>symbol occupied by the first SPS resource. For example, if the 1<sup>st </sup>symbol occupied by the first SPS resource is symbol 2, and k1 is 1, the moment obtained by translating the start moment of the first SPS resource by k1 time units is a start moment of symbol 3.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0254">When the terminal device is in DRX active mode, the terminal device monitors a PDCCH.
