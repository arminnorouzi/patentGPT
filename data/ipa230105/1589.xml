Passed in the shaft <b>23</b> are driving wires <b>29</b> to drive the joint function part <b>25</b> and a flexible member <b>3</b> being a push-pull cable to drive the holding unit <b>27</b>. On a front end side of the shaft <b>23</b>, the holding unit <b>27</b> is provided through the joint function part <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0118">The joint function part <b>25</b> is provided with a base part <b>31</b>, a movable part <b>33</b>, a flexible tube <b>35</b>, and a bending structure <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0119">The base part <b>31</b> is a cylinder body formed of resin, metal or the like, and is attached at the front end of the shaft <b>23</b>. Through the base part <b>31</b>, the driving wires <b>29</b> pass via through-holes <b>31</b><i>a </i>in the axial direction and the flexible member <b>3</b> passes via an insertion hole <b>31</b><i>b </i>on an axial center portion.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0120">The movable part <b>33</b> is a cylinder body formed of resin, metal or the like, and is attached to the holding unit <b>27</b> explained later. To the movable part <b>33</b>, front end portions of the driving wires <b>29</b> are fixed. Accordingly, the movable part <b>33</b> is displaced with respect to the base part <b>31</b> by operation of the driving wires <b>29</b> to orient the holding unit <b>27</b> toward a desired direction. An axial center portion of the movable part <b>33</b> is provided with an insertion hole <b>33</b><i>b </i>to pass the flexible member <b>3</b> therethrough.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0121">The flexible tube <b>35</b> is interposed between the base part <b>31</b> and the movable part <b>33</b> and is bent according to the displacement of the movable part <b>33</b> relative to the base part <b>31</b>. The flexible tube <b>35</b> passes the driving wires <b>29</b> and the flexible member <b>3</b> therethrough in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0122">The flexible tube <b>35</b> of the present embodiment is configured by a bellows formed of a tube body having a wave sectional shape. The flexible tube <b>35</b> may use, however, a coil spring, a tube body or the like, and is not particularly limited as long as it has a flexible tube shape.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0123">The bending structure <b>1</b> is the same as of the embodiment 1. The bending structure <b>1</b> is arranged along the axial center portion of the flexible tube <b>35</b> and is provided between the base part <b>31</b> and the movable part <b>33</b>. In addition, the bending structure <b>1</b> of any one of the embodiments 2-5 may be applied to the joint function part <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0124">The bending structure <b>1</b> passes the flexible member <b>3</b> through the passing portion <b>9</b>, in this state both ends of which are respectively attached to the insertion holes <b>31</b><i>b </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the base part <b>31</b> and the movable part <b>33</b>. With this, the bending structure <b>1</b> supports the movable part <b>33</b> with respect to the base part <b>31</b> so as not to be movable in the axial direction and is bendable as well as the flexible member <b>3</b> according to the displacement of the movable part <b>33</b> relative to the base part <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0125">The holding unit <b>27</b> has a pair of holding parts <b>37</b> openably pivotally supported with respect to the movable part <b>33</b> of the joint function part <b>25</b>. The holding unit <b>27</b> is connected to the flexible member <b>3</b> passing through the joint function part <b>25</b> and is configured to open and close the holding parts <b>37</b> by axial movement (reciprocation movement) of the flexible member <b>3</b>. It should be noted that the end effector is not limited to the holding unit <b>27</b> and may be, for example, scissors, a holding retractor, a needle driver or the like.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0126">In the robot forceps <b>21</b> having the structure, an operator such as a doctor reciprocatingly operates the flexible member <b>3</b>, thereby to cause the holding parts <b>37</b> of the holding unit <b>27</b> to perform opening/closing operation.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0127">Further, the operator pulls any one or some of the driving wires <b>29</b> to bend the joint function part <b>25</b>, thereby to cause the holding unit <b>27</b> to orient relatively to the shaft <b>23</b> toward a desired direction. In this state, if the flexible member <b>3</b> is reciprocated, the holding parts <b>37</b> of the holding unit <b>27</b> is caused to perform the opening/closing operation.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0128">The opening/closing operation is stabilized and accurately performed because the moving amount of the flexible member <b>3</b> is constant as mentioned in the embodiment 1.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0129">Additionally, the present embodiment provides the same effect as the embodiment 1.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
