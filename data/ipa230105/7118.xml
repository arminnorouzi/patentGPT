Here, the specific position in the vertical direction and the specific position in the front-back direction for the user are, for example, a position of the smartphone <b>10</b> at an arbitrary timing such as when the user logs into the smartphone <b>10</b>. hr a case where the smartphone <b>10</b> makes a notification of a status as to on which one of the upper side and the lower side of the specific position in the vertical direction, the smartphone <b>10</b> is supported, for example, when the device support status is biased to either a status in which the smartphone <b>10</b> is supported by the user on the upper side of the specific position in the vertical direction or a status in which the smartphone <b>10</b> is supported by the user on the lower side of the specific position in the vertical direction, the smartphone <b>10</b> can cause the user to recognize to which one of the status in which the smartphone <b>10</b> is supported by the user on the upper side of the specific position in the vertical direction and the status in which the smartphone <b>10</b> is supported by the user on the lower side of the specific position in the vertical direction, the device support status is biased and to what extent the device support status is biased. Furthermore, in a case where the smartphone <b>10</b> makes a notification of a status as to on which one of the front side and the back side of the specific position in the front-back direction for the user, the smartphone <b>10</b> is supported, for example, when the device support status is biased to either a status in which the smartphone <b>10</b> is supported by the user on the front side of the specific position in the front-back direction for the user or a status in which the smartphone <b>10</b> is supported by the user on the back side of the specific position in the front-back direction for the user, the smartphone <b>10</b> can cause the user to recognize to which one of the status in which the smartphone <b>10</b> is supported by the user on the front side of the specific position in the front-back direction for the user and the status in which the smartphone <b>10</b> is supported by the user on the back side of the specific position in the front-back direction for the user, the device support status is biased and to what extent the device support status is biased.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example different from the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> of the device support status notification system according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">An example has been described above where the device support status notification system of the present invention is constituted with only the electronic device of the present invention. However, the device support status notification system of the present invention may be constituted with the electronic device of the present invention and at least one electronic device outside the electronic device of the present invention. For example, a device support status notification system <b>70</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is constituted with a smartphone <b>71</b> as the electronic device of the present invention and a cloud service <b>72</b> with which the smartphone <b>71</b> can communicate via a network <b>70</b><i>a</i>.

However, the electronic device of the present invention may be a device other than a smartphone as long as at least part of the electronic device is carried by the user and used by the user. For example, the electronic device of the present invention may be a mobile phone other than a smartphone, a fixed phone, a tablet, a wearable terminal, a digital camera, or a laser pointer. Here, examples of the wearable terminal can include a smart watch, a ring-type activity meter, and the like. The electronic device of the present invention preferably includes a display unit.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">As described above, the device support status notification system of the present invention makes notifications of the left hand use period., the right hand use period, the left hand use ratio, and the right hand use ratio (S<b>243</b>). However, the device support status notification system of the present invention may calculate a total period (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;left hand support period&#x201d;) during which the electronic device is supported by the left hand of the user in a specific period, a total period (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;right hand support period&#x201d;) during which the electronic device is supported by the right hand of the user in the specific period, a ratio of the left hand support period (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;left hand support ratio&#x201d;) with respect to the total of the left hand support period and the right hand support period, and a ratio of the right hand support period (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;right hand support ratio&#x201d;) with respect to the total of the left hand support period and the right hand support period and may make notifications of the calculated left hand support period, right hand support period, left hand support ratio, and right hand support ratio instead of or in addition to the left hand use period, the fight hand use period, the left hand use ratio, and the right hand use ratio. In particular, in a case where the electronic device of the present invention is a wearable terminal, it is extremely effective for the device support status notification system of the present invention to make notifications of the left hand support period, the right hand support period, the left hand support ratio, and the right hand support ratio.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
