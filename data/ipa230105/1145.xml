It arises due to a narrowing resulting from a build-up of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis). The coronary arteries run along the surface of the heart and supply blood to the heart muscle. The narrowing(s) associated with coronary heart disease, for example, limit blood flow and this can starve the heart muscle of its vital oxygen supply. To gain access to the coronary and other arteries, medical practitioners need to insert a catheter into the vascular system. For access to the coronary arteries, for the commonest of vascular interventions, the catheter was traditionally inserted via the femoral artery. More recently, it has become more common for the radial artery to be used. The most common procedure to treat coronary heart disease is called coronary angioplasty or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (commonly known as &#x2018;stenting&#x2019;).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In such a procedure, the narrowing in the coronary artery is identified by injecting contrast dye under X-ray guidance. A balloon is inflated to relieve the narrowing and a stent (a metal mesh tube) inserted. The stent acts to keep the artery open and blood flow is restored. In the UK, around 100,000 PCI procedures are performed per annum.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A catheter is used to deliver the contrast dye and angioplasty equipment including wires, balloons and stents. Because of the technical demands placed on a vascular catheter, it is often made from a relatively stiff material and is formed into a cylindrical tube. Advancing the vascular catheter through the artery in the arm often causes the so-called &#x201c;razor effect&#x201d;, in which the edges of the vascular catheter scrape against the wall of the artery. This is painful for the patient, can cause the artery to go into spasm and can cause snagging and serious bleeding complications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Where spasm or snagging occurs, the procedure is frequently delayed while the patient is given a combination of sedative, painkilling (e.g. opiate) and artery dilating drugs. In some circumstances, the procedure has to be done via a different artery or even abandoned altogether. If the procedure is done via the femoral artery instead, there are additional risks of bleeding and major complication.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Whilst the prior art provides certain solutions to help reduce the risk of some of these problems arising, such solutions often require expensive devices. Furthermore, many prior art solutions are incompatible with standard equipment and are compatible only with specific catheter hardware, so multiple devices are required to enable an appropriate one to be selected for use with a particular catheter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of certain embodiments of the present invention to overcome at least some disadvantages associated with the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a guiding device for a vascular catheter that is inserted over a guidewire, the guiding device comprises:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a tapered component for passing through a bore of the vascular catheter and extending from a distal end thereof,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">the tapered component having an aperture through which the guidewire may pass so that the tapered component may move along the guidewire; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">pushing means extending from the tapered component and configured to extend beyond a proximal end of the vascular catheter;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">wherein the tapered component comprises a first section, a second section and the third section; the first section is disposed between the proximal end of the tapered component and the second section; the second section is disposed between the first section and the third section; and the third section is disposed between the second section and a distal end of the tapered component;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">wherein the first section is a cylinder, the second and the third sections are conical, and the taper of the second section differs from the taper of the third section.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In certain embodiments, the second section may be a convex conic section.

The guiding device <b>10</b> may facilitate improved passage of a vascular catheter through a peripheral blood vessel (e.g. the radial artery).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The guiding device <b>10</b> extends along a longitudinal axis <b>100</b> between a proximal end <b>10</b><i>a </i>and a distal end <b>10</b><i>b</i>. Throughout the present specification, references to forward or distal directions (and similar) relate to directions towards the distal end <b>10</b><i>b </i>(or away from the proximal end <b>10</b><i>a</i>) that are parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>100</b>.

References to cross-sections relate to cross-sections in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The guiding device <b>10</b> comprises a tapered component <b>12</b> that extends generally along the longitudinal axis <b>100</b> from a proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>to a distal end <b>12</b><i>b</i>. In the non-limiting embodiment shown in the Figures, the distal end <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b> is coincident with the distal end <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the guiding device <b>10</b>. The tapered component <b>12</b> tapers (i.e. increases in diameter) from a minimum diameter at its distal end <b>12</b><i>b </i>to a larger diameter rearward of the distal end <b>12</b><i>b</i>. In certain embodiments, the maximum diameter may be coincident with the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In certain embodiments, the shape of the taper changes along the tapered component <b>12</b> between the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the distal end <b>12</b><i>b</i>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the tapered component <b>12</b> comprises a first section <b>15</b>, a second section <b>17</b> and a third section <b>19</b>. Each section takes a different shape. However, the resulting outer profile of the tapered component <b>12</b> is continuous along a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>100</b>. The first section <b>15</b> is disposed between the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b> and the second section <b>17</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the first section <b>15</b> takes the form of a cylinder. That is, the cross-section of the first section is substantially uniform along its length. The proximal end of the first section <b>15</b> may coincide with the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b>. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the first section <b>15</b> may be the maximum diameter of the tapered component <b>12</b>. The second section <b>17</b> is disposed between the first section <b>15</b> and the third section <b>19</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the second section <b>17</b> takes the form of a convex cone. That is, the profile of the taper of the cone follows a convex curve. The diameter of the cross-section of a convex cone decreases at an increasing rate. The maximum diameter of the second section <b>17</b> coincides with the proximal end of the second section <b>17</b> and the diameter of the second section decreases in the distal direction. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the proximal end of the second section <b>17</b> may equal the diameter of the first section <b>15</b>. The third section <b>19</b> is disposed between the second section <b>17</b> and the distal end <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the third section takes the form of a concave cone. That is, the profile of the taper of the cone follows a concave curve. The diameter of the cross-section of a concave cone decreases at a decreasing rate. The maximum diameter of the third section <b>19</b> coincides with the proximal end of the third section and the diameter of the third section <b>19</b> decreases in the distal direction. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the proximal end of the third section <b>19</b> may equal the diameter of the distal end of the second section <b>17</b>. The distal end of the third section <b>19</b> may coincide with the distal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b>. In certain embodiments, the minimum diameter of the tapered component <b>12</b> may be the diameter of the distal end of the third section <b>19</b>. The above-described shape of the tapered component <b>12</b> provides it with improved flexibility relative to the prior art, enabling it to navigate through blood vessels effectively. As a result, in certain embodiments, the tapered component <b>12</b> may be manufactured without the need to vary the materials or material properties (e.g. hardness) along its length.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In other embodiments, the tapered component may take any alternative shape capable of providing it with the required flexibility. In alternative embodiments, the tapered component may comprise a different number of sections. For example, a fourth section may extend distally from the third section. The fourth section (not shown) may take the form of a cylinder. Additionally or alternatively, a fifth section may extend proximally from the first section. The fifth section (not shown) may take the form of a cylinder. In certain embodiments, additional sections may be disposed between the first <b>15</b> and the second <b>17</b> sections and/or between the second <b>17</b> and third <b>19</b> sections. Additionally, the shape of each section may take a different form. The second section <b>17</b> may take the form of a cone (i.e. the profile of the taper of the cone follows a straight line). Alternatively, the second section <b>17</b> may take the form of a concave cone or the second section <b>17</b> may have a radiused or a parabolic taper. The third section <b>19</b> may take the form of a cone (i.e. the profile of the taper of the cone follows a straight line). Alternatively, the third section <b>19</b> may take the form of a convex cone or third section <b>19</b> may have a radiused or a parabolic taper. In certain embodiments, the taper of the second section <b>17</b> may differ from the taper of the third section <b>19</b>. For example, the taper of the second section <b>17</b> may be steeper (at least in parts) than the taper of the third section <b>19</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The tapered component <b>12</b> includes an aperture <b>13</b> at its distal end <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The tapered component <b>12</b> is hollow such that an internal bore <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b> is accessible through the aperture <b>13</b>. The internal bore <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b> extends to the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b> so that it is also accessible from the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the internal bore <b>13</b><i>a </i>extends through all sections of the tapered component <b>12</b>. The internal bore <b>13</b><i>a </i>may have a constant diameter from the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>to the distal end <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b>. The internal bore <b>13</b><i>a </i>is accessible through a second aperture <b>13</b><i>b </i>in the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b>. A wall <b>12</b><i>c </i>may extend between the internal bore <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the outer surface of the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b>. In certain embodiments, at least a part of the wall <b>12</b><i>c </i>may be substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>100</b>. Additionally or alternatively, at least a part of the wall <b>12</b><i>c </i>may be inclined relative to the longitudinal axis <b>100</b>. Thus, the wall <b>12</b><i>c </i>may provide a tapered opening for the second aperture <b>13</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The guiding device <b>10</b> also comprises a pushing means <b>14</b> (e.g. a pusher in the form of a pushing component or assembly of components) that extends rearwardly from the tapered component <b>12</b>. The pushing means <b>14</b> may additionally extend from a position on the tapered component <b>12</b> that is axially forwards of the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b>. The pushing means <b>14</b> may be inserted into a groove in the tapered component <b>12</b>. The pushing means <b>14</b> is sufficiently rigid to move the tapered component <b>12</b> both forwards and backwards through a blood vessel, when the pushing means <b>14</b> extends proximally from the tapered component <b>12</b> out of the blood vessel (and out of the body). Despite such rigidity, the pushing means <b>14</b> is also sufficiently flexible so as to be capable of bending and following the contours of a blood vessel as it passes therethrough.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The guiding device <b>10</b> additionally includes a connector <b>18</b> that is connected to the pushing means <b>14</b>. The connector <b>18</b> may facilitate easier handling and movement of the pushing means <b>14</b> from outside the blood vessel. The connector <b>18</b> may be configured to releasably connect the guiding device <b>10</b> to a proximal end <b>22</b><i>b </i>of a vascular catheter <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>3</b></figref>, in use, the guiding device <b>10</b> is passed through a bore of a vascular catheter <b>22</b> so that at least a portion of the tapered component <b>12</b> extends from a distal end <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the vascular catheter <b>22</b>. In the schematic side-view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>3</b></figref>, the vascular catheter <b>22</b> is shown as translucent to aid understanding of the depicted embodiment of the invention. The depicted length of the vascular catheter relative to the length of the tapered component is shortened in the Figures to facilitate understanding of the embodiment. The term vascular catheter refers to any suitable catheter for use in a blood vessel (i.e. an artery or vein). The tapered component <b>12</b> and the vascular catheter <b>22</b> are threaded over a guidewire (not shown) such that the guidewire passes through the aperture <b>13</b> of the tapered component <b>12</b>, through the internal bore <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b>, and through the bore of the vascular catheter <b>22</b>. In such a configuration, the guidewire extends forwardly from the distal end <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b> and rearwardly from the proximal end (not shown) of the vascular catheter <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Rearwardly of the proximal end of the vascular catheter <b>22</b>, the guidewire and the pushing means <b>14</b> extend alongside one another. As such, axial movement of the pushing means <b>14</b> causes the axial movement of the tapered component <b>12</b> along the guidewire <b>20</b>. In use the guidewire may be disposed within a blood vessel such that it may guide passage of the vascular catheter <b>22</b>, while the proximal end of the vascular catheter <b>22</b> remains outside of the blood vessel. Given that the tapered component <b>12</b> extends beyond the distal end <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the vascular catheter <b>22</b>, the tapered component <b>12</b> leads the vascular catheter <b>22</b> in the blood vessel. Thus, the passage of the vascular catheter <b>22</b> in the blood vessel is made easier by the tapered component <b>12</b> thereby substantially avoiding the &#x201c;razor effect&#x201d; of the front edge of the proximal end <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the catheter <b>22</b> in its interaction with the lining of the blood vessel. Consequently, the risk of the vascular catheter <b>22</b> snagging the walls of the blood vessel is reduced, as is the risk of the blood vessel going into spasm. As a result, patient comfort may be improved. These advantages may serve to increase the success rate of procedures (such as coronary angioplasty or percutaneous intervention (PCI)) in blood vessels such as the radial and brachial arteries (in which problems associated with the &#x201c;razor effect&#x201d; are more prevalent), improving their viability over procedures in other blood vessels such as the femoral artery. In preferable embodiments, the tapered component <b>12</b> is always partly contained within the vascular catheter <b>22</b> whilst the guiding device <b>10</b> is guiding the passage of the vascular catheter <b>22</b> through a blood vessel. In certain embodiments, the first portion <b>15</b> of the tapered component <b>12</b> may always be contained within the vascular catheter <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Notably, the pushing means <b>14</b> does not extend so as to be coaxial with the longitudinal axis <b>100</b>, whereas the guidewire extends substantially along the longitudinal axis <b>100</b>. Consequently, the pushing means <b>14</b> does not interfere with the path of the guidewire <b>20</b>. Importantly, the pushing means <b>14</b> is configured such that a portion of the guidewire that is radially adjacent to the pushing means <b>14</b> remains visible to an operator in use (i.e. when using the pushing means <b>14</b> to move the tapered component <b>12</b> along the guidewire <b>20</b>). Therefore, the operator may maintain the guidewire in sight to ensure that the whole guidewire does not inadvertently advance into the blood vessel.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the preferable embodiment shown in the Figures, the pushing means <b>14</b> comprises a wire that has a stiffness that permits the tapered component <b>12</b> to be advanced in the blood vessel by pushing on the wire. In alternative embodiments, the pushing means <b>14</b> may take any alternative form that is capable of advancing the tapered component <b>12</b> and that permits a portion of the guidewire that is radially adjacent to the pushing means <b>14</b> to remain visible to an operator in use. For example, the pushing means may comprise a rod. A wire or rod is only radially aligned with the guidewire over a small angular extent, and so provides sufficient means to push (and pull) the tapered component <b>12</b> without significantly visually obscuring the exposed guidewire <b>20</b>. Similarly, other preferable variations of the pushing means <b>14</b> may be radially aligned with the guidewire over a small angular extent (e.g. less than 180&#xb0;, less than 90&#xb0;, less than 45&#xb0;, less than 20&#xb0;, less than 10&#xb0; or less than 5&#xb0;). The pushing means <b>14</b> may be made of any suitable material that is sufficiently rigid to facilitate the advancement of the tapered component <b>12</b> in the blood vessel by manipulation of the pushing means <b>14</b>. In certain embodiments, the pushing means <b>14</b> may be made of a metal (e.g. if the pushing means <b>14</b> is a wire or rod).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a cross-section of an embodiment of the guiding device <b>10</b> at the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the distal end of the pushing means <b>14</b> extends from the wall <b>12</b><i>c</i>. As described above, the wall <b>12</b><i>c </i>extends between the inner bore <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the outer surface of the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b>. The wall <b>12</b><i>c </i>has a limited thickness. For example, in a 6F size catheter the tapered component has a maximum diameter of less than 1.7 mm and an inner bore diameter of about 1.1 mm, thus, providing a wall with a thickness of about 0.3 mm and from which the pushing means extends. In certain embodiments, the cross-section <b>40</b> of the pushing means <b>14</b> is non-circular to facilitate the connection of the pushing means <b>14</b> to the tapered component <b>12</b>. In certain embodiments, the non-circular cross-section <b>40</b> is substantially across the length of the pushing means <b>14</b>. For example, the non-circular cross-section <b>40</b> may be across more than 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% of the length of the pushing means <b>14</b>. In alternative embodiments, the cross-section may vary along the length of the pushing means <b>14</b>. A non-circular cross-section <b>40</b> improves the attachment of the pushing means <b>14</b> to the wall <b>12</b><i>c </i>that has a limited thickness. Pushing means <b>14</b> with non-circular cross-sections <b>40</b> have different bending properties along difference axes of the cross-sectional profile. However, since the pushing means <b>14</b> is long (relative to its width) and, in use, constrained within the lumen of the guide catheter, the impact of the different bending properties of the pushing means <b>14</b> on the control of the tapered component <b>12</b> are minimal and within acceptable levels. In certain embodiments, the non-circular cross-section <b>40</b> provides the pushing means <b>14</b> with extra pushability whilst maintaining flexibility and a small cross-sectional profile of the pushing means <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The pushing means <b>14</b> may take any non-circular cross-section <b>40</b> suitable for attachment to the tapered component <b>12</b> that can provide the required rigidity and flexibility to advance the tapered component <b>12</b> along the guidewire <b>20</b>. The pushing means <b>14</b> may also take a non-circular cross-section <b>40</b> that ensures that the guidewire remains visible during use. The cross-section <b>40</b> of the pushing means <b>14</b> may comprise a plurality of sides. For example, the cross-section <b>40</b> may have four sides. One or more of the plurality of sides may be a curved side. The one or more curved sides may be a convex or a concave curve. Additionally, the cross-section may have a convex curved side and a concave curved side. In certain embodiments, the cross-section <b>40</b> may comprise a curved side that, for example, conforms with a part of the circumference of the internal bore <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Alternatively or additionally, the cross-section <b>40</b> may comprise a curved side that conforms with a part of the circumference of the outer surface of the proximal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the tapered component <b>12</b>. The plurality of sides of the cross-section <b>40</b> may comprise adjacent sides having different lengths. In certain embodiments, the cross-section <b>40</b> of the pushing means <b>14</b> may have a first side with a length between 0.40 mm to 0.53 mm and a second side, adjacent to the first side, with a length between 0.20 mm to 0.30 mm. In certain embodiments, there may be well defined corners between adjacent sides. Alternatively, the corners between adjacent sides of the profile may be rounded. The angle between a pair of adjacent sides may be 90&#xb0;, greater than 90&#xb0; or less than 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows examples of the cross-sectional profile of the pushing means <b>14</b> according to embodiments of the invention.

Additionally, in certain embodiments, the cross-section <b>40</b> of the pushing means <b>14</b> may vary along the length of the pushing means <b>14</b>.

In certain embodiments, the connector <b>18</b> may be moveable along the pushing means so as to be engageable with vascular catheters <b>22</b> of various lengths.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The connector <b>18</b> may releasably connect the guiding device <b>10</b> to the proximal end of the vascular catheter <b>22</b> by any suitable fixing mechanism, including but not limited to push fit and snap fit arrangements. In certain embodiments, the connector may be rotatably connectable to the vascular catheter <b>22</b>. In such embodiments, the connector <b>18</b> comprises a free-wheeling mechanism. The free-wheeling mechanism is configured to permit connection of the connector <b>18</b> to the proximal end of the vascular catheter <b>22</b> without causing rotation of the pushing means <b>14</b>. Therefore, when rotating the connector <b>18</b> to connect it to the vascular catheter <b>22</b>, the tapered component <b>12</b> is not rotated within the vascular catheter <b>22</b> or the blood vessel.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>8</b></figref> show a non-limiting embodiment of the connector <b>18</b> according the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> show the connector <b>18</b> in the assembled state and connected to the pushing means <b>14</b> whilst <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an exploded side-view of the connector <b>18</b>. The connector <b>18</b> comprises a body <b>30</b>, a locking tube <b>38</b> and a free-wheeling ring <b>24</b>. When assembled, the body <b>30</b> and free-wheeling ring <b>24</b> form the free-wheeling mechanism.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The body <b>30</b> comprises a bore <b>34</b> which extends through the body <b>30</b> from the proximal end <b>30</b><i>a </i>to the distal end <b>30</b><i>b</i>. The central axis of the bore <b>34</b> coincides with the longitudinal axis <b>100</b> of the guiding device <b>10</b>. The body <b>30</b> has an annular rim <b>32</b>. The rim <b>32</b> may be proximally spaced from the distal end <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the body <b>30</b>. In alternative embodiments, the rim may be at the distal end <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the body <b>30</b>. The rim <b>32</b> may be continuous or may comprise a plurality of separate raised sections. The body <b>30</b> comprises a shoulder <b>38</b> proximally spaced from the rim <b>32</b>. The shoulder <b>38</b> extends circumferentially around the body <b>30</b>. The shoulder <b>38</b> may be continuous or may comprise a plurality of separate raised sections. A channel <b>36</b> is formed between the rim <b>32</b> and shoulder <b>38</b>. The channel <b>38</b> is configured to receive a portion of the free-wheeling ring <b>24</b>. In certain embodiments, the proximal end <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the body <b>30</b> may comprise a thread <b>35</b> for connecting the body <b>30</b> to additional components. In certain embodiments, the body <b>30</b> may be a single injection moulding.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The free-wheeling ring <b>24</b> comprises an internal cavity <b>25</b> at the distal end of the ring <b>24</b>. The internal cavity <b>25</b> comprises a thread <b>26</b> for connecting to the proximal end of the catheter <b>22</b>. In certain embodiments, the internal cavity <b>25</b> may comprise a female luer thread. The free-wheeling ring <b>24</b> comprises an aperture <b>27</b> at the proximal end of the ring <b>24</b>. The aperture extends through the proximal wall of the free-wheeling ring <b>24</b> into the internal cavity <b>25</b>. The aperture <b>27</b> is configured to receive the proximal end <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the body <b>30</b>. The diameter of the aperture <b>27</b> is configured to form a snap-fit over the annular rim <b>32</b> and reside between the annular rim <b>32</b> and the shoulder <b>38</b>. The diameter of the aperture <b>27</b> is smaller than the diameter of the rim <b>32</b> and the diameter of the shoulder <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">During assembly of the connector <b>18</b>, the proximal end <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the body <b>30</b> is inserted through the aperture <b>27</b> of the free-wheeling ring <b>24</b>. The aperture <b>27</b> of the free-wheeling ring <b>24</b> is pushed over the rim <b>32</b> so that the free-wheeling ring <b>24</b> is retained within the channel <b>36</b>. Therefore, in the assembled state, the free-wheeling ring <b>24</b> is axially restrained relative to the body <b>30</b> by the rim <b>32</b> and the shoulder <b>38</b> but can freely rotate around the body <b>30</b>. The rotation axis of the free-wheeling ring <b>24</b> may be the longitudinal axis <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The pushing means <b>14</b> is connected to the body <b>30</b> by the locking tube <b>28</b>. The outer diameter of the locking tube <b>28</b> is smaller than the diameter of the bore <b>34</b> of the body <b>30</b>. The inner diameter of the locking tube <b>28</b> is greater than the diameter of the guide wire (not shown).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">During connection of the pushing means <b>14</b> to the body <b>30</b>, the pushing means <b>14</b> is inserted into the bore <b>34</b> of the body <b>30</b>. The locking tube <b>28</b> is also inserted into the bore <b>34</b> of the body <b>30</b> with an adhesive to hold the locking tube <b>28</b> and the pushing means <b>14</b> securely within the body <b>30</b>. The locking tube <b>28</b> holds the pushing means <b>14</b> at a radially offset position relative to longitudinal axis <b>100</b>. This corresponds to the pushing means <b>14</b> extending from the tapered component <b>12</b> at a position radially offset form the longitudinal axis <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Once the connector <b>18</b> has been assembled and the pushing means <b>14</b> connected to the body <b>30</b>, the free-wheeling ring <b>24</b> can be rotated to connect the connector <b>18</b> to the proximal end of the vascular catheter <b>22</b>. Since the free-wheeling ring <b>24</b> rotates relative to the body <b>30</b>, the connection to the vascular catheter <b>22</b> does not cause the pushing means <b>14</b> to rotate. Consequently, the tapered component <b>12</b> is not rotated within the vascular catheter <b>22</b> or the blood vessel when the guiding device <b>10</b> is connected to the catheter. The connector <b>18</b>, therefore, provides a secure connection between the guiding device <b>10</b> and the vascular catheter <b>22</b> whilst avoiding rotation of the tapered component <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Once the vascular catheter <b>22</b> has been advanced to the desired position within the blood vessel, the connector <b>18</b> may be disconnected from the vascular catheter <b>22</b> and the pushing means <b>14</b> may be pulled rearwardly to withdraw the guiding device <b>10</b> from the blood vessel along the guidewire <b>20</b>, leaving the vascular catheter <b>22</b> in place. Advantageously, the guiding device <b>10</b> may be used to reduce the risk of the artery spasming during the standard insertion procedure. This contrasts with certain prior art methods in which the standard guidewire must be removed and additional components inserted in order to continue advancement of a catheter once a restricted, tortuous or spastic artery is encountered.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In addition to assisting with the guiding of the vascular catheter <b>22</b> in the blood vessel ahead of the advancing catheter, the guiding device <b>10</b> may be used to &#x201c;rescue&#x201d; a procedure where snagging or spasm are encountered and the passage of the vascular catheter <b>22</b> along the guidewire in the blood vessel may have become obstructed and further advancement of the vascular catheter <b>22</b> may be inhibited or prevented. In such a situation, the guiding device <b>10</b> may be advanced along the guidewire and through the bore of the vascular catheter <b>22</b> so that the tapered component <b>12</b> protrudes from the distal end <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the vascular catheter <b>22</b>. The tapered component <b>12</b> may then dilate the blood vessel to facilitate onward advancement of the vascular catheter <b>22</b> in the blood vessel and/or reducing the pain and discomfort experienced by the patient associated with this. Additionally, guiding devices according to certain embodiments of the invention may be used via a sheath or without a sheath, as the device may be used as an introducer for the guiding catheter and the combination may be known as a sheathless catheter and may be universal, in that it may be used with any manufacturer's catheters and guidewires.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In certain preferable embodiments, the tapered component <b>12</b> may have a low friction outer surface. A low friction interface with the blood vessel wall facilitates smoother travel of the tapered component in the blood vessel. In certain embodiments, any lubricious and/or hydrophilic outer surface may provide such a low friction outer surface. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic outer surface may be provided by a hydrophilic coating that is applied to the tapered component <b>12</b>. In alternative embodiments, the hydrophilic outer surface may be provided by the surface topography of the tapered component <b>12</b> (e.g. a plurality of grooves, recesses or other surface features that may lend the tapered component <b>12</b> hydrophilic properties).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The tapered component <b>12</b> may be made of any suitable material. In certain embodiments, the tapered component <b>12</b> comprises plastics material. Additionally or alternatively, the tapered component <b>12</b> may comprise a resilient material that may be deformable in use within the blood vessel. The tapered component <b>12</b> may be formed from a single material.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In certain embodiments, the tapered component <b>14</b> has an axial length of up to 30 cm. In certain embodiments, the tapered component <b>14</b> may have an axial length between 1 cm and 30 cm, or between 14 cm and 25 cm. In certain embodiments, the tapered component <b>14</b> has an axial length of about 14 cm. The tapered component <b>14</b> may have any axial length suitable for providing it with the required flexibility.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">When the guiding device <b>10</b> is for use with a 6F catheter, the tapered component <b>12</b> may have a axial length of 14 cm, with the cylindrical first section <b>15</b> having an axial length of 10 cm and an axial length of 4 cm between the distal end <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the tapered component and the cylindrical first section <b>15</b>. The second section <b>17</b> may be a convex cone where the taper of the cone conforms to an arc of a circle with a radius between 2000 mm and 4000 mm. Additionally or alternative, the third section <b>19</b> may be a concave cone where the taper of the cone conforms an arc of a circle with a radius between 2000 mm and 4000 mm.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In certain embodiments, the maximum diameter of the tapered component <b>12</b> (e.g. in an uncompressed state) is less than the internal diameter of the catheter in which it is to be inserted. The tapered component may have a maximum diameter that is less than 3.00 mm, less than 2.7 mm, less than 2.29 mm, less than 2.0 mm, less than 1.7 mm or less than 1.35 mm. For example, for an 8F catheter, the maximum diameter may be less than 2.29 mm, for a 7F catheter, the maximum diameter may be less than 2.0 mm, or for a 6F catheter, the maximum diameter may be less than 1.7 mm. The skilled reader will appreciate that, in this context, &#x201c;F&#x201d; refers to the French Gauge system, where 1F is equivalent to a diameter of 1.3 mm.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In order to be compatible with a range of guidewires <b>20</b>, in certain embodiments the apertures <b>13</b> and <b>29</b> may be sized to permit the passage therethrough of a guidewire having a diameter between about 0.5 mm and 1 mm, e.g. having a diameter of 0.46 mm (0.018&#x2033;), 0.64 mm (0.025&#x2033;), 0.81 mm (0.032&#x2033;), 0.89 mm (0.035&#x2033;), 0.97 mm (0.038&#x2033;) or 1.10 mm (0.043&#x2033;). In certain non-limiting embodiments, the aperture <b>13</b> may be larger than 0.36 mm (0.014&#x2033;) as to permit the tapered component <b>12</b> to pass over a guidewire (e.g. an angioplasty wire) having a diameter of 0.36 mm (0.014&#x2033;).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The guiding device <b>10</b> may be dimensionally compatible with and be otherwise suitable for use with a range of known vascular catheters <b>22</b> and/or guidewires <b>20</b>. It is preferable for a guiding device <b>10</b> of a single size to be usable with a range of vascular catheters <b>22</b> of different lengths. In order to be dimensionally compatible with a particular vascular catheter <b>22</b>, the pushing means <b>14</b> must extend rearwardly beyond the proximal end of the vascular catheter <b>22</b> when the tapered component <b>12</b> is in a position in which it protrudes from the distal end <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the vascular catheter <b>22</b>. In certain embodiments, the pushing means <b>14</b> may extend from the tapered component <b>12</b> by at least 60 cm, at least 70 cm, at least 80 cm, at least 90 cm or at least 100 cm.
