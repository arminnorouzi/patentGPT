In particular, the present invention relates to a reagent for measuring 25-hydroxy vitamin D and a method for measuring 25-hydroxy vitamin D, the reagent and the method based on a competitive immunoassay.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Vitamin D is an important substance with many implications in the biological processes of the human and animal body. Physiologically active vitamin D is known to regulate calcium absorption from the intestinal tract and bone calcification in particular. It also has the effect of increasing the serum calcium concentration. A deficiency or excess in vitamin D is known to have various consequences, and in particular, vitamin D deficiency is known to lead to serious diseases such as osteoporosis and rickets. Therefore, the quantification of vitamin D in the body is important for revealing a potential deficiency or excess.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vitamin D is present in the living body in two forms, namely vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vitamin D2 is an exogenous vitamin D obtained from food, and vitamin D3 is an endogenous vitamin D produced by the action of the ultraviolet rays from the sun on the skin. These vitamin Ds bind to the vitamin D-binding protein and are transported to the liver by this protein, where the carbon at position 25 is hydroxylated in the liver to form 25-hydroxy vitamin Ds (25(OH)VDs). Furthermore, some of them are hydroxylated at the carbon at position 1 in the kidneys to produce the active forms, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>VDs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above two-step metabolism of vitamin D occurring in the living body will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In the first step, vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 is metabolized into 25-hydroxy vitamin D2 or 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as 25(OH)VD2 and 25(OH)VD3, respectively. These are collectively referred to as 25-hydroxy vitamin D (hereinafter sometimes referred to as 25(OH)VD)). Then, 25(OH)VD2 or 25(OH)VD3 is metabolized into 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D2 or 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D2 and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3, respectively, and collectively referred to as 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>VD).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Among these metabolites, the stable 25(OH)VD is a useful index since it reflects well the vitamin D sufficiency in the blood.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, the following methods are known as methods for measuring 25(OH)VD.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">&#x201c;Lumipulse (registered trademark) 25-hydroxyvitamin D&#x201d; is known as a reagent for a method for measuring 25(OH)VD in serum or plasma by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA). The present method is a method of measuring the 25(OH)VD concentration in a sample by measuring the amount of luminescence by an enzymatic reaction through a first reaction of forming an immune complex with anti-25(OH)VD monoclonal antibody-bound ferrite particles and 25(OH)VD in the sample, and a second reaction of forming an immune complex with the above complex and enzyme-labeled anti-25(OH)VD immune complex monoclonal antibodies. The present method requires a washing step after the first reaction and after the second reaction, and is a complex process.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, Patent Literature 1 discloses an immunoassay of 25(OH)VD using a disposable cone. In the present method, a pretreated sample is mixed with enzyme-labeled anti-vitamin D antibodies in a well, incubated, then transferred to a vitamin D-immobilized cone, and further incubated. During this time, the antigen in the sample, 25(OH)VD, and the vitamin D immobilized on the cone compete for the antibody site of the enzyme-labeled anti-vitamin D antibody, and a complex of the vitamin D immobilized on the cone and the enzyme-labeled anti-vitamin D antibody can be detected by removing the non-immobilized products by washing. Since the concentration of the complex is inversely proportional to the antigen concentration in the sample, 25(OH)VD in the sample can be calculated. However, the present method also requires a washing step, and is a complex process as described above.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Translation of PCT International Application Publication No. 2016-531306</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, the conventional method for measuring 25(OH)VD is a complex process, and there was no method based on latex turbidimetric immunoassay, which is a homogeneous measurement method which does not require a washing step.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The latex turbidimetric immunoassay (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as LTIA) is a method for measuring a test substance using latex particles on which antigens or antibodies are immobilized, and is widely used in the field of clinical testing. LTIA can be roughly classified into a method of reacting latex particles on which antibodies against a test substance are immobilized, with an antigen, which is the test substance, to form a sandwich-type immune complex, and measuring the test substance (antigen) from the degree of agglutination of the latex particles associated with the formation of the immune complex (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as sandwich LTIA), and a method of inhibiting the formation of an immune complex between the latex particles and the antigen (test substance) by the competition between a synthetic antigen and the antigen in the test sample (test substance) in the presence of latex particles on which an antibodies are immobilized, and measuring the test substance (antigen) from the degree of inhibition of agglutination (agglutination inhibition) of the latex particles associated with the inhibition of formation of the immune complex (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as competitive LTIA, or the like).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention addresses the problem of providing a method for measuring 25(OH)VD by competitive LTIA and a measurement reagent. Furthermore, the present invention also addresses the problem of providing a method for measuring 25(OH)VD and a measurement reagent, the method and the reagent being based not only on competitive LTIA, but also on competitive immunoassay.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The inventors have prepared a polyvalent antigen in which two or more 25(OH)VDs are bound to a carrier such as a protein in competitive LTIA, and investigated a measurement by competitive LTIA in which the maximum agglutination occurs when the 25(OH)VD concentration in blood is zero, and the amount of agglutination decreases as the concentration of 25(OH)VD in the blood increases. That is, the inventors investigated a measurement system using a two-reagent kit containing the polyvalent antigen in a first reagent and an anti-25(OH)VD antibody-sensitized latex in a second reagent. Here, when the 25(OH)VD, which is the target of measurement, was derivatized to be the polyvalent antigen, the detection sensitivity was not sufficiently satisfactory. However, the inventors discovered that the measurement sensitivity surprisingly increases when a structure obtained by derivatizing vitamin D represented by the chemical formula (I), which is different from the 25(OH)VD to be measured, is used as a competing polyvalent antigen.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, the inventors found that this found action is not limited to competitive LTIA and can also be applied to competitive immunoassay, and completed the present invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">More specifically, the present invention has the following constitution:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0000">&#x3c;1&#x3e;<br/>A reagent for measuring 25-hydroxy vitamin D based on a competitive immunoassay, which includes at least the following composition:<br/>(1) A vitamin D derivative represented by the following chemical formula (I) and/or (II);
