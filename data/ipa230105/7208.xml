For example, in a CMOS image sensor, charge that has been generated in a photodiode due to photoelectric conversion is transferred to a floating diffusion (FD) unit, and analog to digital (AD) conversion is performed on a pixel signal that has been output via an amplification transistor in accordance with an amount of the charge.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, in CMOS image sensors, a configuration in which AD conversion is performed on pixel signals in parallel in units of a pixel row and a configuration in which AD conversion is performed on pixel signals in parallel in units of one pixel or a plurality of pixels have been achieved.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, Patent Document 1 discloses an imaging element that has a structure in which individual transfer transistors that correspond to, for example, four photodiodes of four pixels are included, these transfer transistors are connected to a common FD unit, and a transistor or the like that follows is shared. Such a structure enables the area of a photodiode per unit pixel area to be increased.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2013-179313</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, in a structure in which a plurality of pixels shares an FD unit, as in the imaging element disclosed in Patent Document 1 described above, the simultaneous transfer of charge from a photodiode to the FD unit in the respective pixels (all-pixel simultaneous read) has failed to be performed. Note that, in an imaging element that has a structure in which a plurality of pixels does not share an FD unit, all-pixel simultaneous reading can be performed, but the size of a circuit increases.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, in an imaging element that has a structure in which a plurality of pixels shares an FD unit and requires a reduction in the size of a circuit, there is a need for improvements in performance that enable global shutter for performing exposure in all of the pixels at the same timing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure has been made in view of such a situation, and enables performance to be further improved.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solutions to Problems</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A solid-state imaging element in one aspect of the present disclosure includes: a pixel that at least includes a photoelectric conversion unit configured to perform photoelectric conversion, an FD unit to which charge generated in the photoelectric conversion unit is transferred, and an amplification transistor that has a gate electrode to which the FD unit is connected; and a first MOS transistor to which a reference signal is input, the reference signal being referred to when AD conversion is performed on a pixel signal according to an amount of light received by the pixel.
