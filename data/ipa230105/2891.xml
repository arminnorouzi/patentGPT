or a &#x201c;rotary type substrate processing apparatus&#x201d;) includes a process vessel <b>203</b> which is a cylindrical sealed vessel (hermetic vessel). For example, the process vessel <b>203</b> is made of a material such as stainless steel (SUS) and an aluminum alloy. A process chamber <b>201</b> in which a plurality of substrates (also simply referred to as &#x201c;substrates&#x201d;) including a substrate S are processed is provided in the process vessel <b>203</b>. A gate valve <b>205</b> is connected to the process vessel <b>203</b>. The substrate S may be loaded (transferred) into or unloaded (transferred) out of the process vessel <b>203</b> through the gate valve <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The process chamber <b>201</b> includes a process region <b>206</b> to which a process gas such as a source gas and a reactive gas is supplied and a purge region <b>207</b> to which a purge gas is supplied. That is, the process gas is supplied to the substrate S in the process region <b>206</b>, and the purge gas is supplied to the substrate S in the purge region <b>207</b>. According to the embodiments, the process region <b>206</b> and the purge region <b>207</b> are alternately arranged along a circumferential direction of the process chamber <b>201</b>. For example, a first process region <b>206</b><i>a</i>, a first purge region <b>207</b><i>a</i>, a second process region <b>206</b><i>b </i>and a second purge region <b>207</b><i>b </i>are arranged along the circumferential direction in this order. As described later, for example, the source gas is supplied into the first process region <b>206</b><i>a</i>, the reactive gas is supplied into the second process region <b>206</b><i>b</i>, and an inert gas serving as the purge gas is supplied into the first purge region <b>207</b><i>a </i>and the second purge region <b>207</b><i>b</i>. As a result, a predetermined processing (substrate processing) is performed to the substrate S in accordance with the gas supplied into each region.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The purge region <b>207</b><i>a </i>and the purge region <b>207</b><i>b </i>are configured to spatially separate the first process region <b>206</b><i>a </i>and the second process region <b>206</b><i>b</i>. As described later in detail, ceilings <b>208</b> of the purge region <b>207</b><i>a </i>and the purge region <b>207</b><i>b </i>are disposed lower than a ceiling of the process region <b>206</b> (that is, a lower surface of the top plate <b>209</b>). Ceilings <b>208</b><i>a </i>and <b>208</b><i>b </i>are provided in the purge regions <b>207</b><i>a </i>and <b>207</b><i>b</i>, respectively, at positions facing a rotary table <b>217</b> serving as a substrate support. By purging spaces defined by the ceilings <b>208</b><i>a </i>and <b>208</b><i>b </i>and the rotary table <b>217</b>, it is possible to remove excess gases on the substrate S. By purging spaces defined by the ceilings <b>208</b><i>a </i>and <b>208</b><i>b </i>and the rotary table <b>217</b>, it is also possible to partition the adjacent process region <b>206</b> (that is, the first process region <b>206</b><i>a </i>and the second process region <b>206</b><i>b</i>).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The rotary table <b>217</b> configured to be rotatable is provided at a center portion of the process vessel <b>203</b>. A rotating shaft of the rotary table <b>217</b> is provided at a center of the process vessel <b>203</b>. For example, the rotary table <b>217</b> is made of a material such as quartz, carbon and silicon carbide (SiC) such that the substrate S is not affected by the metal contamination.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The rotary table <b>217</b> is configured such that the plurality of the substrates (for example, five substrates) including the substrate S can be arranged within the process vessel <b>203</b> on the same plane and along the same circumference along a rotational direction &#x201c;R&#x201d;. In the present specification, the term &#x201c;the same plane&#x201d; is not limited to a perfectly identical plane but may also include a case where, for example, the plurality of the substrates including the substrate S are arranged so as not to overlap with each other when viewed from above.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A plurality of concave portions (also simply referred to as &#x201c;concave portions&#x201d;) <b>217</b><i>b </i>serving as a part of substrate mounting table (that is, the rotary table <b>217</b>) are provided on a surface of the rotary table <b>217</b> to support the plurality of the substrates including the substrate S. The concave portions <b>217</b><i>b </i>may also referred to as supports <b>217</b><i>b</i>. The number of the concave portions <b>217</b><i>b </i>is equal to the number of the substrates to be processed. For example, the plurality of the concave portions <b>217</b><i>b </i>are arranged at the same distance from a center of the rotary table <b>217</b>, and are arranged along the same circumference at equal intervals (for example, 72&#xb0; intervals).
