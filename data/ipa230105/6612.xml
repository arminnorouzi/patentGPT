Examples of such circuits include comparators (in which an op amp is in an open loop configuration) and amplifier circuits (in which an op amp is in a closed loop configuration). An operational amplifier includes multiple transistors and operates from a supply voltage. A manufacturer of an operational amplifier specifies a parameter referred to as the input common-mode voltage range. The input common-mode voltage range is a range of input voltages that results in proper operation of the operational amplifier. That is, the operational amplifier remains in the intended (linear) region of operation. Having a wide range of common mode for an op amp is useful for achieving a target linearity for amplification over a wide range of input voltage.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In at least one example, a circuit includes first through fourth transistors and a device.

It may be desirable to have a wider, rather than a narrower, input common-mode voltage range. Each transistor included in an op amp is rated for a certain voltage. The voltage rating of a transistor defines the maximum voltage difference that can exist across any pair of terminals (e.g., source-to-drain, gate-to-source, gate-to-drain, body-to-drain, etc.). For example, a 1.8V transistor is one in which the voltage difference between any two of its terminals (e.g., gate, drain, source, and body) should not exceed 1.8V (or should not exceed the voltage rating plus a small margin of, for example, 10%). A voltage applied between a pair of terminals exceeding the rating may result in gate oxide stress, channel hot carrier (CHC) degradation, and may result in a catastrophic failure of the device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For applications, such as comparators and amplifiers, it may be desirable to use lower voltage transistors (e.g., 1.8V transistors) for the op amp's input stage in order for the comparator or amplifier to achieve better performance. For example, the delay time of a comparator represents the amount of time between the signal on an input crossing the reference level on the other input and the output signal from the comparator changing state. Lower voltage input stage transistors for the op amp input pair may help the comparator achieve a lower delay than if higher voltage transistors were used in the input stage. Unfortunately, using a lower voltage device (e.g., 1.8V) with a substantially higher supply voltage (e.g., 3.3V) presents challenges in terms of ensuring reliability of the device if an adequate biasing scheme is not incorporated. That is, to ensure that the voltage between any pair of terminals for the input stage does not exceed the rating for the transistors. Without a proper biasing scheme, the input voltage to the op amp (input common mode) may need to be limited to a narrower range of voltages. However, if higher voltage transistors are used to resolve the reliability problem, they will limit the other parameters of the comparator such as common mode (common mode reduces with higher voltage transistors as the higher voltage devices have higher threshold voltages), delay, and offset. Hence, there is a tradeoff between performance and reliability of the circuit. The embodiments described herein are directed to an input stage for an op amp that uses lower voltage transistors while also having a relatively large input common-mode voltage range without fewer or no reliability issues even while operating the circuit at higher supply voltages. For the biasing scheme described herein at least some of the transistors in the op amp's input stage (e.g., the input pair) are rated for voltages significantly lower than the supply voltage. For example, the supply voltage may be 3.3 V but the rating on the transistors in the op amp's input stage may be 1.8V. The embodiments described herein ensure that, despite a relatively large range of input common-mode voltages and despite the supply voltages being higher than the maximum rated value for the lower voltage transistors (e.g., the input pair), the op amp's input stage transistors will not receive a voltage difference across any pair of their terminals in excess of the voltage rating of the transistors while supporting the common mode of, for example, 0V to 2.1V.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of at least a portion of an input stage <b>100</b> of an op amp.

The gate G<b>7</b> of transistor M<b>7</b> is coupled to its drain D<b>7</b>. Similarly, the gate G<b>8</b> of transistor M<b>8</b> is coupled to its drain D<b>8</b>. Accordingly, transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b> are configured as diode-connected transistors and that, when on, each transistor M<b>7</b>, M<b>8</b> generates a voltage on its drain with respect to its source is equal to a diode voltage drop (e.g., a voltage in the range of 0.5V to 0.7V) with bias current I<b>2</b> flowing through them. In other embodiments, diodes are used in place of diode-connected transistors. Resistor R<b>1</b> is coupled between the source S<b>7</b> of transistor M<b>7</b> and AVSS. Diode-connected transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b> are coupled in series with resistor R<b>1</b> between current source device I<b>2</b> and AVSS. The voltage difference across resistor R<b>1</b> is equal to the product of the resistance of resistor R<b>1</b> and the magnitude of the current produced by current source I<b>2</b> (I<b>2</b>*R<b>1</b>). The voltage on the drain D<b>8</b> (and thus the gate G<b>8</b>) of transistor M<b>8</b> is equal to the voltage drop across resistor R<b>1</b> plus the sum of the drain-to-source voltage drops across diode-connected transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b>. That voltage is a fixed voltage (and is labeled V_FIXED) because of the fixed voltage across resistor R<b>1</b>, and the generally fixed voltage drop developed across each of the diode-connected transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, the gate G<b>3</b> of transistor M<b>3</b> is biased at a fixed voltage, V_FIXED. The gate G<b>4</b> of transistor M<b>4</b> is coupled to the sources S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>, and thus receives the voltage VTAIL. The voltage VCAS_BIAS generated by the cascode bias generation circuit <b>130</b> is used to bias the gates of transistors M<b>5</b> and M<b>6</b>. The voltage on the sources S<b>5</b> and S<b>6</b> of transistors M<b>5</b> and M<b>6</b> is approximately the Vgs (Vgs is equal to the threshold voltage, VT, plus the overdrive voltage, Vov) below the voltage on the gates G<b>5</b> and G<b>6</b>. That is, the voltage on the source S<b>5</b> is one Vgs (of M<b>5</b>) below the voltage on the gate G<b>5</b>, and the voltage on the source S<b>6</b> is one Vgs (of M<b>6</b>) below the voltage on the gate G<b>6</b>. The threshold voltages of transistors M<b>5</b> and M<b>6</b> are approximately the same in one embodiment. Because the gates G<b>5</b> and G<b>6</b> of transistors M<b>5</b> and M<b>6</b> receive the same bias voltage, VCAS_BIAS, the voltage on the drain D<b>1</b> of transistor M<b>1</b> will be approximately the same as the voltage on the drain D<b>2</b> of transistor M<b>2</b> at the common mode input, which is VCAS_BIAS minus the Vgs of transistors M<b>5</b>, M<b>6</b>. This means that the drain voltage on transistors M<b>1</b>/M<b>9</b> and M<b>2</b>/M<b>10</b> is a function of the voltage VCAS_BIAS, which is generated by the cascode bias generation circuit <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The voltage VTAIL is the voltage on the sources S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>. The voltage VTAIL at the common mode input is approximately one Vgs of P-type MOSFET transistors M<b>1</b>/M<b>2</b> above the voltage on their gate. With VINP and VINN having approximately the same voltage (common mode), the voltage VTAIL is one Vgs above the voltage present on VINP or VINN. As the voltage on VINP, VINN (common mode) increases, the voltage VTAIL also increases, and as the voltage on VINP, VINN decreases, the voltage VTAIL also decreases.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The current through resistor R<b>3</b> and transistor M<b>3</b> is designated as I_M<b>3</b>, and the current through resistor R<b>4</b> and transistor M<b>4</b> is designated as I_M<b>4</b>. At low enough levels of the voltage VTAIL that the voltage on the gate G<b>4</b> of transistor M<b>4</b> is below its source voltage, VCAS_BIAS, transistor M<b>4</b> will be off, and the full I<b>1</b> current will flow through transistor M<b>3</b> (I_M<b>3</b> will be equal to I<b>1</b>). The voltage on the gate of transistor M<b>3</b> is a fixed voltage, V_FIXED (decided by I*R plus the two diode voltage drop from transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b>), and thus the source voltage of transistor M<b>3</b>/M<b>4</b> remains constant. As the input voltage of VINP, VINN increases, the voltage VTAIL also increases and remains one Vgs above the voltage of VINP or VINN. As the voltage VTAIL increases but is still less than one Vgs (of M<b>4</b>) above the VCAS_BIAS, transistor M<b>4</b> will remain off, and I_M<b>3</b> will be equal to I<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As the voltage VTAIL continues to increase, eventually, the voltage VTAIL on the gate G<b>4</b> of transistor M<b>4</b> will be high enough that it will be more than one Vth above the voltage on its source S<b>4</b> (VCAS_BIAS). At that point, current I_M<b>4</b> will begin to flow through transistor M<b>4</b>. As the gate voltage (VTAIL) of transistor M<b>4</b> continues to increase and thus current I_M<b>4</b> increases, in order for the sum of I_M<b>3</b> and I_M<b>4</b> to remain equal to fixed current I<b>1</b>, the current I_M<b>3</b> must decrease. Because the gate voltage of transistor M<b>3</b> is fixed, for I_M<b>3</b> to decrease the voltage on the source S<b>3</b> of transistor M<b>3</b> increases. Thus, once VTAIL is large enough to turn on transistor M<b>4</b>, the voltage VCAS_BIAS increases as the voltage VTAIL increases.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When transistor M<b>4</b> is off, the voltage VCAS_BIAS is one Vgs (of transistor M<b>3</b>) below V_FIXED. Further, the voltage on the drains D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> is one Vgs (of transistors M<b>5</b>, M<b>6</b>) below the gate voltage of transistors M<b>5</b> and M<b>6</b> (VCAS_BIAS). Thus, the voltage on drains D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> is two Vgs drops below V_FIXED (one Vgs is the Vgs of M<b>3</b> and the other Vgs is the Vgs of M<b>5</b>, M<b>6</b>). Because of this two-Vgs drop, two series-connected, in this example, diode-connected transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b> are included in series with resistor R<b>1</b>, to generate the voltage V_FIXED. V_FIXED, as explained above, is two Vgs voltages above the voltage (I<b>2</b>*R<b>1</b>) across resistor R<b>1</b>. Accordingly, when transistor M<b>4</b> is off, the voltage on drains D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> is approximately equal to I<b>2</b>*R<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As explained above, the voltage VCAS_BIAS, which through transistors M<b>5</b> and M<b>6</b> dictates the voltage (VCAS_BIAS minus Vgs of M<b>5</b>, M<b>6</b>) on the drains D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> of transistors M<b>1</b>/M<b>9</b> and M<b>2</b>/M<b>10</b>, is controlled by the voltage V_FIXED when the input common-mode voltage on VINP and VINN is relatively low (low enough that transistor M<b>4</b> is off). At relatively low common-mode voltages, the voltage VCAS_BIAS is at a fixed level (approximately one Vgs voltage below V_FIXED as explained above). Voltage V_FIXED is approximately equal to the sum of the voltage drop across resistor R<b>1</b> and the voltage drops across the diode-connected transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b>. The level of VCAS_BIAS can be set by selection of the magnitude of the current source device I<b>2</b> and the resistance of resistor R<b>2</b>. The magnitude of the current source device I<b>2</b> and the resistance of resistor R<b>2</b> are chosen such that, at low levels of the input common mode voltage, VCAS_BIAS will be a sufficiently high voltage to ensure sufficient Vds margins for the input pair M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and M<b>9</b>, M<b>10</b> devices. The Vgs of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> is generally maintained slightly above the one threshold voltage (e.g., 0.75V) throughout the range of common-mode voltages. The bodies B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> are connected to their respective sources S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>, and thus the drain-to-body and gate-to-body voltages are protected in the same way that the Vds and Vgs voltages are protected from exceeding the voltage rating of the transistors.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">However, as the input common-mode voltage VINP, VINN reaches and exceeds a high enough level to cause transistor M<b>4</b> to begin to conduct current I_M<b>4</b>, the voltage VCAS_BIAS increases with increases in the input common-mode voltage. With VCAS_BIAS increasing with increases in common-mode voltage, the voltage on the drains D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> of transistors also increases (the drain voltages are approximately one Vgs (of M<b>5</b>, M<b>6</b>) below VCAS_BIAS). By causing the drain voltages of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> to increase with increases in the common-mode voltages on the gates G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>, the Vgd and Vds continues to be less than the voltage rating of the transistors even at higher levels of common-mode voltage.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The voltage drop across any pair of terminals for transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b> also remains less than the voltage rating of transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b>. The sources S<b>9</b> and S<b>10</b> are connected to AVSS, and the level of VBIAS for the gates G<b>9</b> and G<b>10</b> is low enough to ensure that the Vgs of transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b> is less than the voltage rating. Transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b> (lower threshold voltage devices) and transistors M<b>5</b> and M<b>6</b> (higher threshold voltage devices) are sized such that at higher common levels, VCAS_BIAS minus Vgs of M<b>5</b>/M<b>6</b> will be low enough such that the voltage on the drain of transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b> will not be greater than its rated voltage. VCAS_BIAS is equal to VTAIL minus the relatively low value of the Vgs of transistor M<b>4</b>. Accordingly, the voltage on the drains D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> and the on the drains D<b>9</b> and D<b>10</b> of transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b> is VCAS_BIAS minus the higher level of Vgs of transistors M<b>5</b> and M<b>6</b>, and hence will be lower than the rated voltage of transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one example, the voltage rating of transistors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>9</b>, and M<b>10</b> within the op amp's input stage <b>100</b> is 1.8V, but the power supply voltage (AVDD) is in the range of 2.9 V to 3.6 V. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows various voltages within the op amp's input stage <b>100</b> for a range (X-axis) of common-mode voltage (VCM) from 0V to 2.2V.

Voltage V_FIXED <b>210</b> is shown as a fixed voltage of approximately 2.15 V in this example. As explained above, this voltage V_FIXED is a function of the Vgs of transistors M<b>7</b> and M<b>8</b>, resistor R<b>1</b> and the magnitude of current source device I<b>2</b> (the sum of I<b>2</b>*R<b>1</b>, the Vgs of M<b>7</b>, and the Vgs of M<b>8</b>. Voltage VTAIL <b>211</b> is function of VCM, and thus linearly increases as a function of VCM. Voltage VCAS_BIAS <b>212</b> is relatively flat in region <b>201</b> in which VTAIL <b>211</b> is not large enough to turn on transistor M<b>4</b>, and thus VCAS_BIAS <b>212</b> (approximately 1.15 V in region <b>201</b> is maintained at a level that is one Vgs (of transistor M<b>3</b>) below the voltage V_FIXED.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this example, as VCM increases, at approximately a VCM of 0.6 V, VCM is high enough that VTAIL <b>211</b> also is high enough to begin to turn on transistor M<b>4</b>.

Accordingly, the gate-to-drain voltage of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> in region <b>201</b> (VCM minus VD of M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>) is less than approximately 0.4 V, and thus well within a voltage rating of, for example, 1.8V.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The voltage VTAIL <b>211</b> on the sources S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> remains approximately one Vgs (of M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>) above the common-mode voltages on the gates G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the Vgs of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> remains slightly more than one Vth, well below the voltage rating of the transistors (e.g., 1.8V). Because the bodies B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> are connected to their sources, the gate-to-body voltages of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> are the same as the Vgs voltages, which are within the voltage rating of the transistors.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For the source-to-drain voltage of transistors M<b>1</b>, and M<b>2</b>, the source voltage is VTAIL <b>211</b> and the drain voltage is VD.

Because the bodies B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> are connected to their sources, the body-to-drain voltage of transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> is the same as the source-to-drain voltage, that is, less than the voltage rating of the transistor.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Transistors M<b>9</b> and M<b>10</b> have their sources S<b>9</b> and S<b>10</b> connected to AVSS.

The voltage on the drains D<b>9</b> and D<b>10</b> is approximately 0.2V for lower common mode as shown and reaches a maximum level of approximately 1.35V as the input common mode increases to 2.1V.
