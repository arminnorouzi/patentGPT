FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This relates generally to packaging electronic devices, and more particularly to flip chip mounted dies in molded device packages.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Processes for producing packaged electronic devices include mounting the electronic devices to a package substrate, and covering the electronic devices with mold compounds to form packages. The molding processes may be done on single devices or may be done on multiple electronic devices simultaneously. The devices may be arranged in a strip of devices adjacent to one another, or in a two dimensional array of devices in rows and columns on a package substrate, such as lead frame strips or arrays. Once the packages are complete, the devices are separated from one another. In one method to separate the devices from one another, a saw is used. The saw cuts through the mold compound and through the package substrate materials along saw streets defined between the electronic devices, to separate the devices. Other cutting tools such as lasers can be used.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Small outline transistor (SOT) packages are used when a device has a few terminals, such as a power transistor device, a sensor, or an analog device. Flip-chip mounted semiconductor devices can be used to form an SOT package. Flip chip mounting to a lead frame (FCOL) replaces wire bonded, face up packages and can reduce problems associated with bond wires. When devices are mounted on package substrates using flip-chip packages, a semiconductor die has conductive post connects that extend from a proximal end placed on bond pads on an active surface of the semiconductor die to a distal end having a solder ball or solder bump. In a flip-chip package the semiconductor die is mounted with the active surface facing the package substrate. When the semiconductor die is flip-chip mounted to the package substrate, the solder bumps at the distal end of the post connects are heated and allowed to reflow to form solder joints that provide a mechanical connection and electrically couple the semiconductor die to the package substrate.

In an SOT package, the semiconductor die can be isolated from the system board by the mold compound, and by ambient atmosphere, so that the heat from the die is transferred away from the package using the package leads, which is inefficient. To increase performance and power handling capabilities for packaged devices in molded packages, thermal dissipation needs to be increased.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a described example, an apparatus includes a first package substrate having a die mount surface; a semiconductor die flip chip mounted to the first package substrate on the die mount surface, the semiconductor die having post connects having proximate ends on bond pads on an active surface of the semiconductor die, and extending to distal ends away from the semiconductor die having solder bumps, wherein the solder bumps form solder joints to the package substrate; a second package substrate having a thermal pad positioned with the thermal pad over a backside surface of the semiconductor die, the thermal pad comprising a thermally conductive material; and a mold compound covering a portion of the first package substrate, a portion of the second package substrate, the semiconductor die, and the post connects, thermal pad having a surface exposed from the mold compound.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> illustrate in a projection view, a cross sectional view, and a partially exploded projection view, respectively, a small outline transistor (SOT) package.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> illustrate, in a cross sectional view, a partially exploded view, and a projection view looking from a bottom side, respectively, an arrangement in an SOT package.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates, in a cross sectional view, an arrangement in an SOT package surface mounted to a printed circuit board.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> illustrate in a projection view and a close up view, respectively, semiconductor dies on a semiconductor wafer with post connects and solder bumps.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>J</figref> illustrate, in a series of cross sectional views and side views, the major steps in manufacturing a flip chip packaged electronic device of the arrangements.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates in a flow diagram selected steps of a method for forming the arrangements.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>H</figref> illustrate, in a series of cross sectional views, major steps for forming an arrangement.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates in a flow diagram selected steps of a method for forming the arrangements.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Corresponding numerals and symbols in the different figures generally refer to corresponding parts, unless otherwise indicated. The figures are not necessarily drawn to scale.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Elements are described herein as &#x201c;coupled.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; includes elements that are directly connected and elements that are indirectly connected, and elements that are electrically connected even with intervening elements or wires are coupled.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;semiconductor die&#x201d; is used herein. As used herein, a semiconductor die can be a discrete semiconductor device such as a bipolar transistor, a few discrete devices such as a pair of power FET switches fabricated together on a single semiconductor die, or a semiconductor die can be an integrated circuit with multiple semiconductor devices such as the multiple capacitors in an A/D converter. The semiconductor die can include passive devices such as resistors, inductors, filters, or active devices such as transistors. The semiconductor die can be an integrated circuit with hundreds or thousands of transistors coupled to form a functional circuit, for example a microprocessor or memory device. The semiconductor die can be a passive device such as a sensor, example sensors include photocells, transducers, and charge coupled devices (CCDs), or can be a micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) device, such as a digital micromirror device (DMD).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The term &#x201c;packaged electronic device&#x201d; is used herein. A packaged electronic device has at least one semiconductor die electronically coupled to terminals and has a package body that protects and covers the semiconductor die. In some arrangements, multiple semiconductor dies can be packaged together. For example, a power metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) field effect transistor (FET) semiconductor die and a logic semiconductor die (such as a gate driver die or a controller die) can be packaged together to from a single packaged electronic device. Additional components such as passives can be included in the packaged electronic device. The semiconductor die is mounted to a substrate that provides conductive leads, a portion of the conductive leads form the terminals for the packaged electronic device. The semiconductor die can be mounted to the substrate with an active device surface facing away from the substrate and a backside surface facing and mounted to the substrate. Alternatively, the semiconductor die can be flip-chip mounted with the active surface facing the substrate surface, and the semiconductor die mounted to the leads of the substrate by conductive post connects carrying solder balls. The packaged electronic device can have a package body formed by a thermoset epoxy resin in a molding process, or by the use of epoxy, plastics, or resins that are liquid at room temperature and are subsequently cured. The package body may provide a hermetic package for the packaged electronic device. The package body may be formed in a mold using an encapsulation process, however, a portion of the leads of the package substrate are not covered during encapsulation, these exposed lead portions provide the exposed terminals for the packaged electronic device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;package substrate&#x201d; is used herein. A package substrate is a substrate arranged to receive a semiconductor die and to support the semiconductor die in a completed semiconductor package. Package substrates useful with the arrangements include conductive lead frames, which can be formed from copper, aluminum, stainless steel and alloys such as Alloy 42 and copper alloys. The lead frames can include a die mounting area for mounting a semiconductor die, and conductive leads arranged proximate to the die pad for coupling to bond pads on the semiconductor die using wire bonds, ribbon bonds, or other conductors. The lead frames can be provided in strips or arrays. Dies can be placed on the strips or arrays, the dies placed on a die pad for each packaged device, and die attach or die adhesive can be used to mount the dies to the lead frame die pads. In wire bonded packages, wire bonds can couple bond pads on the semiconductor dies to the leads of the lead frames. After the wire bonds are in place, a portion of the substrate, the die, and at least a portion of the die pad can be covered with a protective material such as a mold compound. In flip-chip on lead (FCOL) packages, conductive post connects are formed on an active surface of a semiconductor die and extend from bond pads on the active surface as pillars, rails, or posts. The post connects end in a solder bump or solder column portion at the distal end of the post connects. The solder can be used in a thermal reflow process to mount the semiconductor die to a package substrate in a flip chip mounting arrangement. The solder joints that are formed provide electrical and mechanical connection between the semiconductor die and the package substrate.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Alternative package substrates include pre-molded lead frames (PMLF) and molded interconnect substrates (MIS) for receiving semiconductor dies. These package substrates can include dielectrics such as liquid crystal polymer (LCP) or mold compound, and can include one or more layers of conductive portions in the dielectrics. Repeated plating and patterning can form multiple layers of conductors spaced by dielectrics, and conductive vias connecting the conductor layers through the dielectrics, the dielectrics can be mold compound. The package substrate can include lead frames, and can include plated, stamped and partially etched lead frames. In a partially etched lead frame, two levels of metal can be formed by etching a pattern from one side of a metal substrate configured for lead frames, and then etching from the other side, to form full thickness and partial thickness portions, and in some areas, all of the metal can be etched through to form openings through the partial etch lead frames. The package substrate can also be tape-based and film-based, and these can form substrates carrying conductors. Ceramic substrates, laminate substrates with multiple layers of conductors and insulator layers; and printed circuit board substrates of ceramic, fiberglass or resin, or glass reinforced epoxy substrates such as FR4 can be used as the package substrates.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term &#x201c;post connect&#x201d; is used herein. As used herein, a post connect is a structure made of a conductive material, for example copper or copper alloys, gold or gold alloys, or combinations of conductive metal that provides a connection between a semiconductor die and a package substrate. A proximate end of the post connect is mounted to a bond pad on the active surface of a semiconductor die, while a distal end of the post connect is extended away from the bond pad of the semiconductor die. When the packaged semiconductor device is oriented with the semiconductor die positioned above and facing a die mount surface of a package substrate in a flip-chip orientation, the post connect makes a vertical connection between a conductive portion of the package substrate and the bond pad of the semiconductor die. Some references describe a type of post connect as a &#x201c;controlled collapse chip connection&#x201d; or as &#x201c;C4&#x201d; bumps. The conductive post connect includes a post of conductor material and a solder bump or ball at the distal end facing away from the surface of the bond pad on the semiconductor die, where a proximal end of the post connect is mounted to the bond pad. The conductive material remains intact after the solder bump is melted during a solder reflow process, the conductive material controlling the vertical spacing or controlling the &#x201c;collapse&#x201d; of the post connect structure during solder reflow.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A package substrate, such as a lead frame, MIS, or PMLF substrate, will have conductive portions on a die side surface. Leads of a metal lead frame are conductive all along the surfaces, while for other substrate types, conductive lands in dielectric substrate material are arranged and aligned to electrically and mechanically connect to the conductive post connects. The post connects can extend along the same direction as a conductive lead in the package substrate, so that it appears as a rail or rectangle. Solder will be formed at the distal end of the post connect. When the post connect is copper and is pillar shaped and solder bumped at the end, it may be referred to as a &#x201c;copper pillar bump.&#x201d; A copper pillar bump or copper bump is therefore an example of a post connect. In addition to the pillar shape, the post connect can also be a column, rectangle or rail shape, and can have an oval, round, square or rectangular cross section. In examples, multiple post connects can be arranged in parallel to one another with additional post connects coupled to a common trace on a package substrate, to provide a low resistance path between the semiconductor die and the package substrate. The post connects can also transfer thermal energy away from the semiconductor die to a package substrate and out of the package. The solder at the ends of the post connects is used in a thermal reflow process to make a solder joint. The solder joint provides both a mechanical attachment and an electrical connection between the semiconductor die and the package substrate. Post connects are used to form several, tens, hundreds or thousands of connections between a semiconductor die and a substrate in fine pitch semiconductor packages. In a discrete device or power transistor package, only a few post connects may be used. The conductive post connects can be, in some examples, a uniform size and have uniform or minimum pitch between them. In other examples, the size of the post connects can be made larger for power terminals or for high current signals, and smaller for control signals or logic signals that require less current, and may have varying spacing distances. Multiple post connects can be coupled in parallel to reduce resistance for certain signals, such as a high current signal, power or ground signal. Pot connects can vary in size and shape, but in examples range from 10-70 microns in diameter, and may range from 20-50 microns in height from the bond pad surface on the semiconductor die. The solder ball or bump may have a height from 5-15 microns, so that the total height of the post connect and bump may range from 25-65 microns. As device sizes continue to fall and the density of connections rises, these sizes may decrease.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In packaging semiconductor devices, a mold compound may be used to partially cover a package substrate, to cover the semiconductor die, and to cover the connections from the semiconductor die to the package substrate. This can be referred to as an &#x201c;encapsulation&#x201d; process, although some portions of the package substrates are not covered in the mold compound during encapsulation, for example terminals and leads are exposed from the mold compound. Encapsulation is often a compressive molding process, where thermoset mold compound such as resin epoxy can be used. A room temperature solid or powder mold compound can be heated to a liquid state and then molding can be performed. Transfer molding can be used. Unit molds shaped to surround an individual device may be used, or block molding may be used, to form the packages simultaneously for several devices from mold compound. The devices can be provided in an array of several, hundreds or even thousands of devices in rows and columns that are molded together. After the molding, the individual packaged devices are cut from each other in a sawing operation by cutting through the mold compound and package substrate in saw streets formed between the devices. Portions of the package substrate leads are exposed from the mold compound package to form terminals for the packaged semiconductor device. Flip chip mounted devices can be used. In flip chip mounting, solder balls, solder columns, or solder bumps are formed on the conductive post connects. The post connects are formed extending from bond pads of the semiconductor die. The semiconductor die is then oriented with the solder bumps at the distal ends of the post connects facing a die mounting surface of a circuit board or substrate. A solder reflow process is used to attach the solder bumps to the conductive die pads or leads on the package substrate, the solder forming a physical attachment and an electrical connection between the package substrate and the semiconductor die. Mold compound or other protective dielectric material can cover the die and a portion of the package substrate to complete the flip chip package.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term &#x201c;scribe lane&#x201d; is used herein. A scribe lane is a portion of semiconductor wafer between semiconductor dies. Sometimes in related literature the term &#x201c;scribe street&#x201d; is used. Once semiconductor processing is finished and the semiconductor devices are complete, the semiconductor devices are separated into individual semiconductor dies by severing the semiconductor wafer along the scribe lanes. The separated dies can then be removed and handled individually for further processing. This process of removing dies from a wafer is referred to as &#x201c;singulation&#x201d; or sometimes referred to as &#x201c;dicing.&#x201d; Scribe lanes are arranged on four sides of semiconductor dies and when the dies are singulated from one another, rectangular semiconductor dies are formed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;saw street&#x201d; is used herein. A saw street is an area between molded electronic devices used to allow a saw, such as a mechanical blade, laser or other cutting tool to pass between the molded electronic devices to separate the devices from one another. This process is another form of singulation. When the molded electronic devices are provided in a strip with one device adjacent another device along the strip, the saw streets are parallel and normal to the length of the strip. When the molded electronic devices are provided in an array of devices in rows and columns, the saw streets include two groups of parallel saw streets, the two groups are normal to each other and so the saw will traverse the molded electronic devices in two different directions to cut apart the packaged electronic devices from one another in the array.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term &#x201c;quad flat no-lead&#x201d; or &#x201c;QFN&#x201d; is used herein for a type of electronic device package. A QFN package has conductive leads that are coextensive with the sides of a molded package body and the leads are on four sides. Alternative flat no-lead packages may have leads on two sides or only on one side. These can be referred to as &#x201c;small outline no-lead&#x201d; or &#x201c;SON&#x201d; packages. No-lead packaged electronic devices can be surface mounted to a board. Leaded packages can be used with the arrangements where the leads extend away from the package body and are shaped to form a portion for soldering to a board. A dual in line package (DIP) can be used with the arrangements. A small outline package (SOP) can be used with the arrangements. Small outline no-lead (SON) packages can be used, and a small outline transistor (SOT) package is a leaded package that can be used with the arrangements.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the arrangements, a package includes a semiconductor die that is flip-chip mounted to a first package substrate. A second package substrate has a thermal pad portion that is placed with the thermal pad spaced from the backside of the semiconductor die, and the semiconductor die, the first package substrate and the second package substrate are encapsulated in mold compound to form a packaged device. The thermal pad of the second package substrate has a surface that is exposed from the mold compound on a board side or &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; surface of the device package. When the device package is mounted to a printed circuit board, the thermal pad can be soldered or placed in thermal contact to a thermal pad on the printed circuit board to make an efficient thermal transfer path to the printed circuit board. The leads of the package are soldered in a thermal reflow to make electrical connections and mechanical connections to the printed circuit board. Some additional thermal transfer from the semiconductor die to the printed circuit board is provided by the leads of the package, which are portions of the first package substrate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> illustrates in a projection view, a cross section, and an exploded projection view, respectively, a packaged electronic device <b>100</b> in a small outline transistor (SOT) package.

The packaged electronic device <b>100</b> can be mounted to a circuit board or module using surface mount technology (SMT). Package sizes for packaged electronic devices are continually decreasing, and currently can be several millimeters on a side to less than one millimeter on a side, although larger and smaller sizes are also used. Future package sizes may be smaller. A JEDEC standard for a 6 terminal SOT package, as an example useful with the arrangements, is the SOT-23-6 package. An example of this package has a body that is about 3 millimeters long, and about 1.75 millimeters wide, and that the total package width including the leads to the ends of the leads is about 3 millimeters wide. The package body has a height of about 1.45 millimeters including the ends of the leads <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, semiconductor die <b>105</b> is flip chip mounted to a die mount portion of a package substrate <b>109</b>.

The die <b>105</b> is coupled to the lead frame by post connects <b>113</b>. The post connects <b>113</b> can be, in an example, copper pillar bumps.
