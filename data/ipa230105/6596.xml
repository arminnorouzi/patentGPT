A variable speed drive allows modifying a frequency, amplitude and/or phase of an electric signal provided by an electric network in order to control an electric motor. More precisely, a variable speed drive comprises a DC-link stage and an inverter stage. The DC-link stage may induce, among others, oscillations at a resonance frequency which may introduce issues in the electric motor control.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention improves this situation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An object of the present disclosure is to propose a method for controlling a variable speed drive driving an electric motor, the variable speed drive being connected to an electric power source, the variable speed drive comprising a passive DC-link and an inverter stage, the inverter stage being controlled by a first controller of the variable speed drive, the passive DC-link being connected to the inverter stage, the method comprising:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">running, by the variable speed drive, the electric motor to reach a steady-state operating point;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">measuring, by the variable speed drive, in response to reaching the steady state, a plurality of values of current or voltage of the passive DC-link;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">computing, by a second controller, a frequency spectrum of the DC-link based on the plurality of values of current or voltage measured;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">detecting, by the second controller, a specific resonance frequency by comparing amplitudes of the frequency spectrum to a predetermined pattern; and</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">modifying, by the first controller, filter parameters of a digital filter of the DC-link or control parameters of a control law of the electric motor based on the specific resonance frequency.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Modifying control parameters or filter parameters during the control of the electric motor after detecting a specific resonance frequency allows reducing negative impact, for example electrical and/or mechanical damages, induced by undesired oscillations at a resonance frequency in both the variable speed drive and the electric motor. Moreover, the oscillations of the system (variable speed drive and motor) may be corrected in real time. Hence, the overall performance of the system may be optimized or improved in real time. Such optimization or improvement can be applied regardless of the components composing the DC-link (i.e. regardless of the topology of such variable speed drive) since the parameters may be modified depending on the situation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Optionally, the method further comprises determining a line inductance based on the specific resonance frequency. In such an option, the line inductance may also be determined based on a value of DC-link components of the variable speed drive. Determining the line inductance provides information regarding the components of the electric system, and can permit observing a deviation in value potentially linked to a component health issue.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Optionally, the first controller modifies filter parameters of the digital filter of the DC-link and control parameters of the control law of the electric motor. This allows optimizing or improving the performance of the system by aiming at obtaining a good balance between a stability of the DC-link and an efficiency of the electric motor control.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Optionally, detecting the specific resonance frequency by comparing amplitudes of the frequency spectrum to a predetermined pattern comprises determining whether an amplitude of the frequency spectrum exceed a predetermined threshold. Determining whether an amplitude of the frequency spectrum exceed such a predetermined threshold allows detecting an amplitude associated to a resonance frequency.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Optionally, control parameters of the control law of the electric motor are modified and control parameters of the control law comprises at least one of a bandwidth of a control feedback loop of the electric motor, and a duty cycle of a pulse width modulation function. Modifying a bandwidth of the control feedback loop and a duty cycle of the pulse width modulation respectively allows attenuating the resonance of the DC-link.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Optionally, filter parameters of the digital filter are modified, and filter parameters of the digital filter comprises at least one of a cut-off frequency and a gain of the filter. This allows moving the filter in frequency to filter the detected resonance frequency and modifying its attenuation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Optionally, the method further comprises triggering an alert.

Providing advices to modify the filter and control parameters allows for example an operator to optimize or improve the performance of the system, i.e. by ensuring or seeking a compromise between a DC-link stability and an efficient control of the electric motor. Sending an alert message allows warning interested persons or control systems of a detection of a resonance frequency. Playing an alert song and displaying an alert icon both allows warning, for example, operators located close to the system.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Optionally, the method further comprises receiving a specific operating point, and running the electric motor to reach a steady-state operating point corresponds to running the electric motor to reach a steady-state of the specific operating point.

Further iterating the method when changing the operating point allows optimizing or improving performance of the system at different operating points adapted to different applications.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure also presents a computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions which, when executed by at least one controller, cause the controller to carry out any one of the methods presented hereby.

Variable speed drives comprise a passive direct voltage link, DC-link, which may induce undesired oscillations at a resonance frequency during the control of the electric motor. The resonance frequency depends, among others, on a topology of the variable speed drive and may appear at different operating points of the electric motor. Hence, the control of the electric motor by the variable speed drive may be disturbed due to oscillations at the resonance frequency. The method is to mitigate negative impacts of the undesired oscillations at the resonance frequency in the control of the electric motor. The proposed method therefore detects the resonance frequency and modifies control parameters of a control law of the electric motor and/or filter parameters of a digital filter applied on measured value of the DC-link depending on the detected resonance frequency. The modification of the parameters of the variable speed drive allows limiting the amplitude of the oscillations at the resonance frequency to stabilize the voltage in the DC-link while seeking to keep a good reaction time of the control law of the electric motor. The method can be used regardless of the topology of the variable speed drive and does not need to stop the electric motor to be implemented, i.e. the method can be implemented in real time for different operating points.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">An example of an architecture whereby the method could be applied is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The circuit may comprise an electric power source <b>2</b>, a variable speed drive <b>3</b> and an electric motor <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The electric power source <b>2</b> may correspond to a battery supplying a direct voltage DC or to an electric network supplying either an alternating voltage AC or a direct voltage DC. The alternating voltage AC may for example comprise two or three phases. The power source <b>2</b> may, for example, be a three-phase electric network as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">An electric motor <b>4</b> should be understood in this disclosure as any kind of electric motors which may be driven by a variable speed drive. The electric motor may be a motor controlled by an alternating voltage, for example, an induction motor. In some examples, the electric motor may be a synchronous electric motor or an asynchronous electric motor. In some examples, the electric motor may be a direct current motor.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A variable speed drive <b>3</b> should be understood in this disclosure as an electronic, electrical, virtual or software implemented control unit for an electric motor. A variable speed drive may control an electric motor <b>4</b> using an electric or electronic command and in particular may apply a determined voltage to the motor.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The variable speed drive may comprise a passive input stage <b>31</b>. The passive input stage connects the electric power source <b>2</b> to an inverter stage <b>32</b> of the variable speed drive <b>3</b>. By passive input stage, it should be understood here an electronic or electrical stage connecting the electric power source <b>2</b> to the inverter stage <b>32</b> whereby the electronic or electrical stage comprises passive electronic or electrical components, i.e. non-controlled electronic or electrical components.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The passive input stage <b>31</b> comprises a passive DC-link <b>312</b>. The DC-link may be defined as a circuit configured to stabilize the voltage of a direct power bus, DC bus, supplying the inverter stage <b>32</b>. The DC-link can therefore comprise an electrolyte capacitor, a DC-choke or a small film capacitor.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">An electrolyte capacitance, which the order of magnitude is 100 &#x3bc;F/kW, allows stabilizing the voltage of the power bus but may have a reduced total harmonic distortion, THDI.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Adding a DC-choke, i.e. adding a choke inductor allows having a better THDI but increases the cost and the size of the DC-link while cooling means of the DC-link may have to be improved. A variable speed drive comprising a choke inductor comprises a DC-choke topology.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Having a small film capacitor, the order of magnitude of which is 15 &#x3bc;F/kW, improves the THDI but decreases the voltage stabilization and therefore challenges the control of the electric motor by the variable speed drive. A variable speed drive comprising a small film capacitor comprises a C-less topology.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some examples, the passive input stage <b>31</b> may comprise a passive rectifier <b>311</b>, such rectifier being intended to convert an alternating voltage AC supplied by the power source <b>2</b> into a direct voltage DC. As the electric power source <b>2</b> may already supply a direct voltage DC, the passive rectifier is an option as represented by the dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In some examples, a passive rectifier may be a diode rectifier.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In examples wherein the electric power source is a single-phase alternating power source, a passive rectifier may comprise two arms, each arm having a top diode and a bottom diode, the passive rectifier therefore corresponding to a four-diode rectifier.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In examples wherein the electric power source is a three-phase alternating power source, a passive rectifier may comprise three arms, each arm having a top diode and a bottom diode, the passive rectifier therefore corresponding to a six-diode rectifier.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some examples, the passive input stage <b>31</b> may also comprise an input filter <b>310</b>. The input filter may be connected in one side to an alternating power source <b>2</b> and on the other side to the passive rectifier. The input filter may comprise an AC line choke or an LC filter (Inductor-Capacitor filter) for filtering harmonics. A variable speed drive comprising an input filter comprises an input filter topology.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The variable speed drive may also comprise electric measuring means (not shown) adapted to measure at least one of voltage and current values in the DC-link. Measuring means may for example correspond to an ammeter or a voltmeter.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some examples, a variable speed drive comprises a first controller PROC<b>1</b> intended to implement a control law by taking into account, for example, an input speed set point, a voltage set point, a current set point or a torque set point to be applied to the electric motor during normal operation of the motor and control instructions to be applied to an inverter stage <b>32</b> in order to obtain corresponding output voltages. The control law may be of a vector or of a scalar type.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The inverter stage <b>32</b> is intended to cut off the voltage supplied by the DC-link into a variable voltage to control the electric motor <b>4</b>. The inverter stage may, for example, comprise multiple switching legs, each comprising controlled power transistors, for example of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors, IGBT, type, for applying the variable voltage to the electric motor.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some examples, the inverter stage <b>32</b> may comprise 3 legs, each leg comprising a top switch and a bottom switch, i.e. six switches. A switch comprises an IGBT and a freewheeling diode connected in parallel of the IGBT. A middle point of each leg, corresponding to a point between the bottom switch and the top switch, is connected to a respective phase of the electric motor <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The inverter stage and in particular its controlled transistors may be controlled by the first controller PROC<b>1</b>, for example, by implementing a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) function. The control law performed by the first controller PROC<b>1</b> makes it possible to determine the voltage to be applied to the output phases intended to be connected to the electric motor to be controlled. The processor PROC<b>1</b> may also be adapted to implement a digital filter (not shown) on the DC-link of the variable speed drive.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first controller PROC<b>1</b> may for example correspond to a microcontroller or to a digital signal controller, DSC, the latter combining features of a microcontroller and of a digital signal processor, DSP.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As illustrated for example on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>, in some examples the first controller PROC<b>1</b> may comprise a first communication unit CU<b>1</b> adapted to communicate with a second communication unit CU<b>2</b> of a second controller PROC<b>2</b> remote from the variable speed drive.

In some other examples, the first and the second controller are a same controller and the variable speed drive comprises said same controller. The same controller may be a DSC. Both first CU<b>1</b> and second CU<b>2</b> communication units may for example corresponds to a receiving/transmitting equipment adapted to exchange radiofrequency waves.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The variable speed drive <b>3</b> may also comprise a non-transitory machine-readable or computer readable storage medium, such as, for example, memory or storage unit MEM, whereby the non-transitory machine-readable storage medium is encoded with instructions executable by a processor such as the first controller PROC<b>1</b>, the machine-readable storage medium comprising instructions to operate the first controller PROC<b>1</b> to perform at least part of the example methods hereby described. A computer readable storage according to this disclosure may be any electronic, magnetic, optical or other physical storage device that stores executable instructions.

A bandwidth of a control feedback loop of the electric motor may for example comprise at least one of a speed loop bandwidth, a current loop bandwidth or a position loop bandwidth of the electric motor depending on the control law applied to the electric motor by the variable speed drive. In some examples, modifying the bandwidth of a control feedback loop of the electric motor may comprise reducing the bandwidth of the control feedback law such that the detected resonance frequency is moved out of such bandwidth. In particular, when the detected resonance frequency corresponds to a bandwidth of the control law (magnitude order of 80 Hz), for example in an input filter topology, applying a filter on the resonance frequency may disturb the functioning of the control law. In such cases, a good trade-off between stability of the DC-link and performance of the electric motor may consist to reduce the bandwidth of the control law to move the detected resonance frequency out as explained above.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some examples wherein filter parameters of the digital filter are modified, filter parameters of the digital filter comprise at least one of a cut-off frequency and a gain of the filter. In some examples, modifying the cut-off frequency or the gain respectively comprises modifying the cut-off frequency to filter the detected resonance frequency or increasing the attenuation of the filter to attenuate the resonance frequency. In particular, when the detected resonance frequency corresponds to several hundreds of Hertz or more, for example in a C-less topology, applying a filter on the resonance frequency will not significantly affect the performance of the motor. Hence, a good trade-off between stability of the DC-link and performance of the electric motor may consist in modifying the filter parameters of the digital filter to filter the resonance frequency.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some examples, both filter parameters of the digital filter and control parameters of the control law are modified. In some examples, the parameters are chosen to reduce the bandwidth of the control law and to modify the cut-off frequency of the digital filter to filter the resonance frequency while avoiding filtering a new bandwidth of the control law. In particular, when the detected resonance frequency corresponds to several tens of Hertz, for example in a DC-choke topology, the bandwidth of the control law may have the same order of magnitude. Filtering the resonance frequency alone may affect the control law while modifying the bandwidth of the control law alone may significantly slow the response of the electric motor. Hence, modifying both filter parameters of the digital filter and control parameters of the control law may optimize the performance of the system (drive and electric motor) by seeking a good compromise between the stability of the DC-link and the time response of the electric motor control.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some examples, the method <b>100</b> may further comprise triggering an alert.

Providing advices to modify the parameters of the variable speed drive may, for example, allow an operator to manually implement the modifications. Sending an alert message may, for example, allow warning operators, manufacturers or interested persons of the detection of a resonance frequency.
