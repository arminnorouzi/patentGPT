In the variable nozzle structure, a plurality of nozzle vanes are rotatably supported between a nozzle mount and a nozzle plate, and a vane angle of each of the nozzle vanes can be changed. By changing the vane angle of the nozzle vane, it is possible to make a flow-passage area of the exhaust gas supplied to the turbine wheel variable, making it possible to adjust a flow velocity or a supply amount of the exhaust gas supplied to the turbine wheel and to regulate a boost pressure of air supplied to the engine.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A temperature of the exhaust gas supplied to a turbine housing of the exhaust turbocharger is around 800&#xb0; C. for a diesel engine and around 1,000&#xb0; C. for a gasoline engine, and durability of the members against the increasing temperature of the exhaust gas is a problem. An exhaust turbocharger disclosed in Patent Document 1 aims to improve thermal cycle efficiency by increasing a temperature of the exhaust gas at an inlet of the turbine housing to not lower than 1,000&#xb0; C. In Patent Document 1, a cooling hole is formed in the turbine wheel, and compressed air on a compressor side is supplied to the cooling hole to cool the turbine wheel, thereby taking measures against a high-temperature environment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">Patent Document 1: JP2004-232622A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a variable geometry turbocharger, there is a problem that, for example, thermal deformation in a nozzle mount due to an increasing temperature of an exhaust gas causes a nozzle shaft to stick to the nozzle mount, which disables a rotation of the nozzle vane, or promotes wear of a drive ring, a lever plate, or the like forming a variable nozzle structure under high temperature.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure was made in view of the above problem, and an object of the present disclosure is to solve the above-described problem concerning the constituent member of the variable geometry turbocharger caused by the increasing temperature of the exhaust gas.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve the above object, a variable geometry turbocharger according to the present disclosure includes a rotational shaft; a turbine wheel disposed on one end side of the rotational shaft; a compressor wheel disposed on another end side of the rotational shaft; a bearing housing for housing a bearing part for rotatably supporting the rotational shaft; a variable nozzle structure for controlling a flow rate of an exhaust gas flowing into the turbine wheel, the variable nozzle structure including a nozzle plate and nozzle mount that define an exhaust gas flow passage for allowing the exhaust gas to flow into the turbine wheel, a nozzle vane disposed rotatably about a support shaft in the exhaust gas flow passage, and a drive part for rotating the nozzle vane, the drive part being disposed in an internal space defined between the bearing housing and the nozzle mount; and a cooling gas passage for extracting compressed gas compressed by the compressor wheel and introducing the compressed gas into the internal space.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With a variable geometry turbocharger according to the present disclosure, even if a temperature of an exhaust gas increases, it is possible to suppress thermal deformation, wear under high temperature, or the like in the configuration of a variable nozzle structure including, for example, a nozzle mount, a drive ring, a lever plate, and the like, under a high-temperature environment.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a variable geometry turbocharger according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view seen from a direction A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an enlarged explanatory view of a part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a variable geometry turbocharger according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a variable geometry turbocharger according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a front view of a perforated plate according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a variable geometry turbocharger according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.

In each of these variable geometry turbochargers <b>10</b>, a rotational shaft <b>12</b> is disposed laterally at the center of a housing, a turbine wheel <b>14</b> is disposed on one end side of the rotational shaft <b>12</b>, and a compressor wheel <b>16</b> is disposed on another end side of the rotational shaft <b>12</b>. A housing for housing these members is composed of a turbine housing <b>20</b> for housing the turbine wheel <b>14</b>, a compressor cover <b>22</b> for housing the compressor wheel <b>16</b>, and a bearing housing <b>24</b> disposed between the turbine housing <b>20</b> and the compressor cover <b>22</b> to house bearing parts <b>18</b> for rotatably supporting the rotational shaft <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, the turbine housing <b>20</b> internally includes a variable nozzle structure <b>26</b> for controlling the flow rate of an exhaust gas e flowing into the turbine wheel <b>14</b>.

A nozzle vane <b>34</b> is disposed rotatably about a support shaft <b>36</b> in the exhaust gas flow passage <b>32</b>. An internal space Si is defined between the bearing housing <b>24</b> and the nozzle mount <b>30</b>, and a drive part <b>38</b> for rotating the nozzle vane <b>34</b> is disposed in the internal space Si. In addition, a cooling gas passage <b>42</b> (<b>42</b><i>a, </i><b>42</b><i>b</i>) for extracting compressed gas g (for example, compressed air) compressed by the compressor wheel <b>16</b> and introducing the compressed gas g into the internal space Si is provided.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">With such configuration, the members forming the variable nozzle structure <b>26</b> can be cooled by supplying the compressed gas g compressed by the compressor wheel <b>16</b> to the internal space Si through the cooling gas passage <b>42</b>, making it possible to suppress thermal deformation or wear of these members in the turbine housing <b>20</b> into which the high-temperature exhaust gas e is introduced.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view seen from a direction of an arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the drive part <b>38</b> of the variable nozzle structure <b>26</b> disposed in the internal space Si includes a drive ring <b>45</b> and a lever plate <b>46</b> as constituent members.

The drive ring <b>45</b> rotates about an axis of the rotational shaft <b>12</b> in a direction of an arrow b, thereby rotating the nozzle vane <b>34</b> about the support shaft <b>36</b>.

The cooling gas passage <b>42</b> has an inlet side opening <b>43</b> communicating with an outlet side region of the diffuser flow passage <b>50</b> where the compressor wheel <b>16</b> is housed.

Thus, it is possible to supply the compressed gas g increased in pressure through the diffuser flow passage <b>50</b> to the internal space Si.
