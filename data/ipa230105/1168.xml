Such direct delivery to cells using electroporative electric pulses can have a profound clinical effect on the quality of the response of the body's metabolic and/or immune systems over that of simple syringe and needle injection. Moreover, the capability of direct delivery of agents into the cell via electroporation has enabled the effective delivery of therapeutic agents (e.g., DNA-encoded monoclonal antibodies (dMAb), expressible naked DNA encoding a polypeptide, expressible naked DNA encoding a protein, recombinant nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody, and the like) having any number of functions, including antigenic for eliciting of immune responses, or alternatively, metabolic for affecting various biologic pathways that result in a clinical effect.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, an electrode array for use with an electroporation device includes a support member having a top surface and a bottom surface and defines a plurality of injection channels extending from the top surface to the bottom surface.

Also, as used in the specification including the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include the plural, and reference to a particular numerical value includes at least that particular value, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The term &#x201c;plurality&#x201d;, as used herein, means more than one. When a range of values is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent &#x201c;about,&#x201d; it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment. All ranges are inclusive and combinable.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The terms &#x201c;approximately&#x201d;, &#x201c;about&#x201d;, and &#x201c;substantially&#x201d;, as used herein with respect to dimensions, angles, ratios, and other geometries, takes into account manufacturing tolerances. Further, the terms &#x201c;approximately&#x201d;, &#x201c;about&#x201d;, and &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; can include 10% greater than or less than the stated dimension, ratio, or angle. Further, the terms &#x201c;approximately&#x201d;, &#x201c;about&#x201d;, and &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; can equally apply to the specific value stated.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The term &#x201c;agent&#x201d;, as used herein, means a polypeptide, a polynucleotide, a small molecule, or any combination thereof. The agent may be a recombinant nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody, a fragment thereof, a variant thereof, or a combination thereof. The agent may be a recombinant nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide or protein.

The offset distance X<b>4</b> and the secondary offset distance X<b>5</b> are measured between the central axis <b>755</b> of the injection channel <b>736</b> and the nearest electrode row axis <b>747</b> and the next nearest electrode row axis <b>747</b>, respectively. The offset distance X<b>4</b> can be quantified as a factor (i.e., multiple) of the secondary offset distance X<b>5</b>. For example, the offset distance X<b>4</b> can range from a factor of about 0.001 to a factor of about 0.999 of the secondary offset distance X<b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to a non-limiting example of the illustrated embodiment, the matrix array <b>715</b> has six (6) electrodes <b>14</b> arranged in a 3&#xd7;2 matrix (i.e., three (3) rows <b>717</b> and two (2) columns <b>719</b>), with equidistant row and column spacing X<b>2</b>, Y<b>2</b>. The injection channels <b>736</b> are arranged in a 3&#xd7;1 channel array (i.e., three (3) rows <b>740</b> and one column <b>742</b> of channels <b>136</b>) such that each injection channel <b>736</b> is eccentrically offset from the nearest row <b>717</b> of electrodes <b>14</b> at equidistance offset distances X<b>4</b>. In this example, each offset distance X<b>4</b> is a factor of about 0.25 of the respective secondary offset distance X<b>5</b>. In particular, in this example the electrode row spacing X<b>2</b>, electrode column spacing Y<b>2</b>, and the channel row spacing X<b>3</b> are each about 10 mm, with the injection channels eccentrically offset at an offset distance X<b>4</b> of about 2.5 mm along the longitudinal direction X<b>1</b>.

It should yet also be appreciated that the number of electrodes <b>14</b> and/or injection channels <b>736</b> in the matrix array <b>715</b> can be reduced or increased as needed based on various factors, such as the target treatment location, target tissue, and injection volume, by way of non-limiting examples. For example, the matrix array <b>715</b> can be increased to include one or more additional rows <b>717</b> and/or columns <b>719</b> of electrodes <b>14</b> and/or one or more additional rows <b>740</b> and/or columns <b>742</b> of injection channels <b>736</b>, such that the injection channels <b>736</b> are eccentrically offset from the electrode rows <b>717</b>. It should further be appreciated that the matrix array <b>715</b> can employ a combination of eccentrically offset injection channels <b>717</b> and injection channels <b>717</b> that are not eccentrically offset (such as by being located equidistantly between respective electrodes <b>14</b> or by being aligned with a respective electrode row <b>717</b>). The matrix array <b>715</b> of the present embodiment provides significant advantages for electroporation treatment. One such advantage is that by employing multiple injection channels <b>736</b> within the electrode array <b>715</b>, the agent dosage can be fractionated among multiple injection sites.

As with the matrix arrays described above, the array <b>815</b> employs multiple injection channels <b>836</b> that allows fractionating the agent dosage among multiple injection sites. Moreover, the dispersed injectate at the multiple injection sites can be targeted with respective electroporation fields delivered by respective subsets of electrodes <b>14</b> in the array <b>815</b>. Another advantage is that the matrix array <b>815</b> can employ a pulse pattern that enhances co-localization of the electroporation fields with the delivered fluid dispersions from the injection channels <b>836</b> aligned with the electrode rows <b>817</b>. In particular, the matrix array <b>815</b> can employ a pulse pattern that delivers pulses between electrode pairs in each row <b>817</b>, thereby directing the pulses across the area underneath the injection channels <b>836</b>. This better co-localizes the electroporation fields with the fluid dispersions emanating from injection needles <b>14</b> extending through the injection channels <b>836</b>, as described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, an example pulse pattern will be described for the matrix array <b>81</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>. For purposes of illustrating the pulse pattern, the electrodes <b>14</b> of the matrix array <b>815</b> will be referred to by electrode positions E<b>1</b>-E<b>6</b>, in which electrode positions E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> are on a first electrode row <b>817</b>, electrode positions E<b>3</b> and E<b>4</b> are on a second electrode row <b>817</b>, and electrode positions E<b>5</b> and E<b>6</b> are on a third electrode row <b>817</b>. In this example, the pulse pattern includes three (3) pulses, of which the first pulse P<b>1</b> is delivered between E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b>, the second pulse P<b>2</b> is delivered between E<b>3</b> and E<b>4</b>, and the third pulse P<b>3</b> is delivered between E<b>5</b> and E<b>6</b>. In another example, the pulse pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> can be repeated, providing a pulse pattern having two identical pulse trains and a total of six (6) pulses. Such a repeated pulse pattern provides two pulses per electrode pair, which can facilitate enhanced electroporation results.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, in an additional example, a pulse pattern can employ the three pulses P<b>1</b>-P<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, plus four (4) additional pulses P<b>4</b>-P<b>7</b> delivered diagonally between adjacent electrode rows <b>817</b> and columns <b>819</b>.

This pulse pattern can effectively target injectate dispersed between the electrode rows <b>817</b> using fewer total pulses than the pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It should be appreciated that the example pulse patterns described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref> represent non-limiting examples of pulse patterns that can be employed with the matrix array <b>815</b>. It should also be appreciated that the foregoing pulse patterns can also be employed with the matrix array <b>715</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref>. Furthermore, these pulse patterns can be adjusted as needed based on the particular factors involved.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>, an additional advantage of the matrix array <b>815</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref> involves its particular effectiveness in tissues that influence fluid dispersion along specific directions. One such tissue is muscle tissue <b>675</b>. As described above, intramuscular (IM) tissue tends to influence injected fluid <b>7</b> (e.g., the injectate) to disperse predominantly along the direction of muscle fiber extension M<b>1</b>. One particular advantage of the matrix array <b>815</b> is that its design allows favorable IM electroporation results regardless of its orientation relative to the direction of muscle fiber extension M<b>1</b>. In this manner, the matrix array <b>815</b> can be said to be more robust against mis-orientation in muscle.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, the matrix array <b>815</b> can be inserted into muscle tissue <b>675</b> at an orientation whereby the electrode rows <b>817</b> align with the direction of muscle fiber extension M<b>1</b>. This orientation can be characterized as a &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; or &#x201c;0-degree&#x201d; orientation. In this orientation, each electrode row <b>817</b> and the associated injection channel <b>836</b> generally extends alongside and/or in-between the same muscle fibers <b>677</b>. The three (3) fluid injections (utilizing the injection channels <b>836</b>) disperse predominantly along the direction of muscle fiber extension M<b>1</b>, resulting generally in three side-by-side fluid dispersions <b>7</b>. In this manner, each of electroporation pulses P<b>1</b>-P<b>3</b> can effectively target the respective fluid dispersion <b>7</b> so that the high-magnitude portions of the electroporation fields co-localize with the respective fluid dispersions <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, the matrix array <b>815</b> can alternatively be inserted into muscle tissue <b>675</b> at an orientation whereby the electrode rows <b>817</b> are oriented perpendicular to the direction of muscle fiber extension M<b>1</b>. This orientation can be characterized as a &#x201c;perpendicular&#x201d; or &#x201c;90-degree&#x201d; orientation. In this orientation, each electrode row <b>817</b> can traverse multiple muscle fibers <b>677</b>. The three (3) fluid injections (utilizing the injection channels <b>836</b>) disperse predominantly along the direction of muscle fiber extension M<b>1</b>, resulting generally in longitudinally overlapping fluid dispersions <b>7</b> having a maximum concentration between electrodes E<b>3</b> and E<b>4</b>. In this manner, electroporation pulses P<b>1</b>-P<b>3</b> can effectively target more muscle fibers and encompass more of the injected fluid than at the 0-degree orientation. Thus, a physician can employ the matrix array <b>815</b> at the 90-degree orientation to target more injectate with a more homogeneous electrical field, which can lead to transfecting more myocyte cells.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, each electrode pair (i.e., the electrodes in a single row <b>817</b>) demonstrate strong co-localization of the electroporation field and the fluid dispersion regardless of the array orientation relative to the direction of muscle fiber extension M<b>1</b>. For example, at the 0-degree orientation, the high-magnitude portion of the electrical field aligns with the high-concentration portion of the fluid dispersion <b>7</b>. One reason for this result is because the muscle fibers <b>677</b> demonstrate anisotropic electrical conductivity that is highest along the direction of muscle fiber extension M<b>1</b>. Thus, electrical impedance is minimized along direction M<b>1</b>. Additionally, muscle fibers provide a lower mechanical fluid impedance along the direction of muscle fiber extension M<b>1</b>, as discussed above. However, even when the orientation rotates toward higher angles, the injectate still disperses along the direction of muscle fiber extension M<b>1</b> while the electrical field deforms (due to electrical conductivity being anisotropic and highest along the fiber axis) to somewhat match. Even at a 90-degree orientation, the electrical field is effectively &#x201c;stretched&#x201d; in direction M<b>1</b>, resulting in an electrical field that bulges out in the middle, where injectate is located. Thus, regardless of the array <b>815</b> orientation relative to muscle fibers, the array <b>815</b> beneficially co-localizes the electrical field with the injectate.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In other embodiments of the matrix array <b>815</b>, the number of electrode rows <b>817</b> and/or columns <b>819</b> and/or the number of injection channel rows <b>840</b> and/or columns <b>842</b> of the matrix array <b>815</b> can be reduced or increased as needed based on various factors, such as the target treatment location, target tissue, and injection volume, by way of non-limiting examples. For example, the matrix array <b>815</b> can be increased to include one or more additional rows <b>817</b> and/or columns <b>819</b> of electrodes and/or one or more additional rows <b>840</b> and/or columns <b>842</b> of injection channels <b>836</b>, such that the rows <b>840</b> of injection channels <b>836</b> are aligned with the rows <b>817</b> of electrodes <b>14</b>.
