The present embodiment of the present disclosure is particularly suitable for switching and sharing two information pages therebetween for multiple times on a client, or switching and sharing a large number of information pages on the client. The method may be implemented by means of an apparatus for switching and sharing information, which may be implemented in the form of software and/or hardware. The apparatus may be configured in an electronic device, such as a smart phone, a tablet computer, a notebook computer or a desktop computer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method for switching and sharing information according to the present embodiment is applied to a client of a sharer. The method includes the following S<b>110</b> to S<b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">In S<b>110</b>, a second page is jumped to, in response to a detection of a trigger operation on a link to the second page in a currently shared first page.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">Common information sharing technology is a kind of screen sharing technology, in which a video stream on the screen interface of the client of the sharer is captured, and is transmitted to a client of a sharee through the network bandwidth. With the information sharing method involved in the embodiment of the present disclosure, the client of the sharer sends to the client of the sharee a page content of the currently displayed information page (for example, a Jackins document page, a word document page, an Excel document page, or a PowerPoint (PPT) document page) or together with operations such as scrolling up and down the information page or editing a content of the information page. Specifically, the information sharing method involved in the embodiment of the present disclosure is a kind of page sharing technology. In the page sharing technology, the client of the sharer shares an access address for the shared page or the access address for a file displayed in the shared page with the client of the sharee in a sharing range, and shared the operation information on the page or file corresponding to the access address with the client of the sharee in the sharing range. In this way, the client of the sharee may access and display the page or file corresponding to the received access address according to the received access address, so that the operation on the client of the sharee is consistent with the operation on the client of the sharer based on the received operation information, In this way, the synchronous display of pages on the client of the sharee and the client of the sharer are realized.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">However, in the information sharing method related to an embodiment, when the information pages are switched and shared, the client of the sharer is required to trigger the operation of &#x201c;exiting from the currently shared page-sharing the next page&#x201d;. When two pages are switched and shared for multiple times or a large number of pages are switched and shared, the client of the sharer is required to repeatedly trigger the operation of &#x201c;exiting from the shared page-sharing the page&#x201d;, which consumes a lot of time and cost, thereby affecting information sharing efficiency and reducing the experience for information sharing between the sharer and the other users. Therefore, the defect in the information sharing method related to the present embodiment can be overcome with the method for switching and sharing information according to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, when a client sends information to the other client to share the information with the other client, the client may be considered as the client of the sharer. When this client receives the information shared from the other client, this client is also considered as the client of the sharee. That is, the same client may be used as the client of the sharer or the client of the sharee. The client of the sharer sharing a page to the client of the sharee may be considered as a process of sending the page content of the currently displayed page or the page contect together with the user operation (such as scrolling the page up and down, and editing the page content) from the client of the sharer to the client of the sharee, such that the client of the sharee may display the page content simultaneously or performs the received user operation in parallel. Therefore, the currently shared first page in the present embodiment is the page currently displayed on the client of the sharer, which is sent to the client of the sharee to be displayed on the client of the sharee.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0039">A hierarchical page may be formed by embedding a link to another page in a page. The hierarchical page may be used as an upper-level page for anther page, the link of which is embedded in the hierarchical page; and another page is used as a lower-level page for the hierarchical page. For example, a link to a page 2 is embedded in a page 1. The page 1 is jumped to the page 2 in response to a click on the link to the page 2 embedded in the page 1. That is to say, the page 1 is an upper-level page of the page 2, and the page 2 is a lower-level page of the page 1. The first page in the present embodiment may be any level of page that is linkable to the next level of page among the hierarchical pages shared by the client of the sharer with the client of the sharee. A second page may be any one of the lower-level pages which may be linked to the first page.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0040">For example, the hierarchical page shared by the client of the sharer with the client of the sharee has a hierarchical structure as follow. Page 1 is a home page with a link to page 2 and a link to page 3 embedded therein, a link to page 4 is embedded into page 2, a link to page 1 is embedded into page 4. In this case, the first page that is currently shared by the client of the sharer may be page 1, page 2, or page 4. Moreover, when the first page is page 1, the second page may be determined to be page 2 or page 3, based on the trigger operation received by the client of the sharer. When the first page is page 2, the second page is page 4. When the first page is page 4, the second page is page 1.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">When the client of the sharer shares the first page with the client of the sharee, the second page is jumped to directly in response to a detection of a trigger operation (such as a single-click or double-click operation) on the link to the second page in the first page. Therefore, in the case that two pages are switched and shared for multiple times by the client of the sharer or a large number of pages are switched and shared, the tedious operation of repeatedly exiting from the currently shared first page and re-sharing the second page is avoided, thereby facilitating the page switching.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">In S<b>120</b>, in the case that the client of the sharee is in a follow mode, the second page is shared with the client of the sharee, to display the second page on the client of the sharee in the follow mode by following a display of the client of the sharer.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">In the embodiment of the present disclosure, the follow mode is a mode in which the client of the sharee follows the client of the sharer to display a page which is currently displayed on the client of the sharer. In the follow mode, the client of the sharee receives operation information of the currently demonstrating client on the page, and renders the page based on the operation information. In this way, a display mode following the currently demonstrating client is realized. The display page on the client of the sharee in the follow mode is the same as that on the currently demonstrating client. The currently demonstrating client is a client which sends information to other clients in the sharing range to share the information with the other clients.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0044">The client of the sharee may be in the follow mode under the following circumstances. First, in the case that the first page shared by the client of the sharer with the client of the sharee is a home page of the hierarchical page, the client of the sharee may display the home page through a click on a shared link sent by the client of the sharer. In this case, the client of the sharee is set to the follow mode by default, or is also set to the follow mode according to the trigger operation from the user. Second, in the case that the first page shared by the client of the sharer with the client of the sharee is an intermediate-level page, when the client of the sharee displays an upper-level page of the first page in the follow mode, the client of the sharee is also in the follow mode by default when displaying the first page. Third, in the case that the hierarchical page shared by the client of the sharer is freely browsed on the client of the sharee, the client of the sharee may be switched to be in the follow mode according to the trigger operation of the user. In this case, when the client of the sharer currently shares the first page, the client of the sharee may display the first page in a follow-up manner.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0045">When the currently shared first page on the client of the sharer is jumped to the second page, the second page is shared to the client of the sharee in the follow mode while being displayed on the client of the sharer. That is, when the client of the sharee is not in the follow mode, the second page is not sent to the client of the sharee. By sharing the second page with the client of the sharee in the follow mode, the client of the sharee in the follow mode may display the second page instead of the first page. Therefore, in the case that two pages are switched and shared for multiple times by the client of the sharer or a large number of pages are switched and shared by the client of the sharer, the tedious operation of the client of the sharee repeatedly exiting from the currently shared first page and re-sharing the second page is avoided, thereby facilitating the page switching.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0046">In an embodiment, after the second page is shared with the client of the sharee in the follow mode, the method further includes: rolling back to the first page in response to a detection of the trigger operation on a rollback control; sharing the first page with the client of the sharee in the follow mode, to display the first page on the client of the sharee in the follow mode by following a display of the client of the sharer.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">In an embodiment, the rollback control may be provided on a page sharing interface of the client of the sharer. After the first page on the client of the sharer is jumped to the second page, an upper-level page may be rolled back to by triggering the rollback control. The trigger operation on the rollback control may be, for example, a single click or double click on the rollback control, or operations such as a left click or a right click with an input device such as a mouse, which is not specifically limited herein. When the client of the sharer rolls back to the first page, the client of the sharer may display the first page, and share the first page with the client of the sharee in the follow mode at the same time.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">In the case that the client of the sharer detects the trigger operation on the rollback control when sharing the second page, the upper-level page is directly rolled back to, thereby avoiding the tedious operation of the client of the sharer exiting from the currently shared second page and re-sharing the first page. Furthermore, when the client of the sharer rolls back to the first page, the first page is shared with the client of the sharee in the follow mode, thereby avoiding the tedious operation of the client of the sharee receiving the first page shared by the client of the sharer once again, and improving the information sharing efficiency and the user sharing experience.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">In an embodiment, the method for switching and sharing information according to the embodiment of the present disclosure is applied to a real-time interactive application.

The interactive form of real-time interaction is enriched, and the information sharing efficiency and the user sharing experience are improved.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">Further, the first page and the second page are displayed through a browser embedded in the client of the sharer. In the embodiment, a preset browser may be embedded in the client of the sharer, through which page is displayed. The process of jumping to the second page from the first page and rolling back to the first page from the second page is carried out through the same browser, without displaying different pages by changing the browser. Thus, the page switching process is smooth to a certain extent and the user sharing experience is improved.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052">According to the technical solution of the embodiment of the present disclosure, the client of the sharer currently displays the first page; and sends the first page to the client of the sharee to display the first page on the client of the sharee simultaneously. The client of the sharer is jumped to the second page, in response to the click on the link to the second page in the first page on the client of the sharer; and sends the second page to the client of the share, in the case that the client of the sharee is in the follow mode, to display the second page on the client of the sharee in the follow mode by following the display of the client of the sharer.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053">In addition, with the common screen sharing technology, the first page of the client of the sharee can be jumped to the second page following the client of the sharer. However, network delay and video decompression distortion and other problems occur in the video streaming process, due to the high requirement on the network and video compression. As a result, the shared image becomes unsmooth and unclear, which seriously affects the effect of information sharing and user experience for attending a conference. According to the method for switching and sharing the information disclosed in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the high-fidelity and smooth information sharing is realized by sharing the page content of the information page, or together with the user operation. In addition, the second page is jumped to and shared through the trigger on the link to the second page in the currently shared first page on the client of the sharer, to facilitate the easy switching between the shared information pages, and improve information sharing efficiency and the shared experience between users.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a method for switching and sharing information according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure.

The client of the sharee may be in the follow mode under the following circumstances. First, in the case that the first page shared by the client of the sharer with the client of the sharee is a home page of the hierarchical page, the client of the sharee may display the home page through a click on a shared link sent by the client of the sharer. In this case, the client of the sharee is set to the follow mode by default, or is also set to the follow mode according to the trigger operation from the user. Second, in the case that the first page shared by the client of the sharer with the client of the sharee is an intermediate-level page, when the client of the sharee displays an upper-level page of the first page in the follow mode, the client of the sharee is also in the follow mode by default when displaying the first page. Third, in the case that the hierarchical page shared by the client of the sharer is freely browsed on the client of the sharee, the client of the sharee may be switched to be in the follow mode according to the trigger operation of the user.

The present embodiment may be combined with each optional solution in the embodiment described above. In the method for switching and sharing information according to the present embodiment, the switching between information pages on the client of the sharee in a free browsing mode is optimized, to realize the page jumping and rollback on the client of the sharee in the free browsing mode.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a method for switching and sharing information according to the present embodiment includes the following S<b>310</b> to S<b>340</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0068">In S<b>310</b>, in the follow mode, before the second page shared by a client of a sharer is received, a free browsing mode is triggered in response to a detection of a trigger operation on a free browsing control.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0069">In the free browsing mode, the page can be browsed freely. The free browsing mode is a type of display mode for accessing a shared page, which is opposite to the follow mode. The free browsing mode refers to a display mode in which the client of the sharee does not display the page displayed on a currently demonstrating client. In the free browsing mode, the client of the sharee may render the displayed page according to the operation on the client of the sharee, without be affected by the page displayed on a currently demonstrating client. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the free browsing control is provided on a page sharing interface of the client of the sharee. Before receiving the second page shared by the client of the sharer, the client of the sharee is in the follow mode and displays the first page shared by the client of the sharer. In this case, the free browsing mode may be triggered when the client of the sharee detects a trigger operation (operations such as a single-click or double-click) on the free browsing control. In the free browsing mode, the first page is allowed to be freely browsed for the user.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0070">In S<b>320</b>, in the free browsing mode, the second page is jumped to in response to a detection of a trigger operation on a link to the second page in the first page that is currently freely browsed.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0071">In the present embodiment, when the client of the sharee is in the free browsing mode, each of the hierarchical pages may be freely browsed according to the trigger operation of the user without following the display of the client of the sharer. For example, in a process of freely browsing the first page, the first page may be jumped to the second page to freely browse the second page, when the trigger operation (such as a click operation) on the link to the second page is detected. In addition, the client of the sharee may regard the second page that is jumped to, as a new first page. When a trigger operation on a link to a new second page in the new first page is detected, the new first page may be jumped to a new second page. In this way, each of the hierarchical pages shared by the client of the sharer may be freely browsed, which is beneficial for the users to browse the pages according to their own needs and improves the experience for user sharing information.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0072">For example, it is assumed that the client of the sharee is in the follow mode, and the client of the sharee is displaying the first page, namely Page 1, shared by the client of the sharer. In this case, the client of the sharee triggers the free browsing mode when the trigger operation on the free browsing control is detection, to allow the sharee to freely browse page 1. It is assumed that the link to page 2 is embedded in page 1, and the link to page 3 is embedded in page 2. The second page (page 2) is jumped to in response to a click on the link to page 2 in the first page (page 1). In this case, page 2 may also be used as a new first page, and a new second page (page 3) is jumped to in response to a click on the link to page 3 in the new first page (page 2).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0073">In S<b>330</b>, in the free browsing mode, a currently freely browsed page is rolled back to a page that is previously freely browsed, when a trigger operation on a rollback control is detected.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0074">In an embodiment, the rollback control may be provided on a page sharing interface of the client of the sharee. When the client of the sharee in the free browsing mode detects the trigger operation (such as a click operation) on the rollback control, a currently freely browsed page is rolled back to a page that is previously freely browsed. That is to say, if the currently freely browsed page is the first page that is freely browsed, a rollback will not be performed on the client of the sharee. In this way, the jumping path on the client of the sharee is not substituted with the jumping path on the client of the sharer. Thus, a rollback abnormality on the client of the sharee can be avoided, when the jumping path on the client of the sharee in the free browsing mode is different from the jumping path on the client of the sharer.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0075">For example, it is assumed that the client of the sharee is in the follow mode, and the client of the sharee is displaying the first page, namely page 1, shared by the client of the sharer. In this case, the client of the sharee triggers the free browsing mode when the trigger operation on the free browsing control is detected, to allow the sharee to freely browse page 1. In this case, the rollback will not be performed when the trigger operation on the rollback control is detected. On the basis of the above assumption, if the link to page 2 is embedded in page 1, page 2 is jumped to in response to a click on the link to page 2 in page 1. In this case, page 1 is rolled back to when the trigger operation on the rollback control is detected. On the basis of the above assumption, if the link to page 3 is embedded in page 2, page 3 is jumped to in response to a click on the link to page 3 in page 2. In this case, page 2 is rolled back to when the trigger operation on the rollback control is detected, and page 1 is rolled back to when the trigger operation on the rollback control is detected once again.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0076">In S<b>340</b>, the follow mode is triggered, when a trigger operation on a follow control is detected, and a page currently shared by the client of the sharer is received in the follow mode.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0077">In the present embodiment, a follow control may be provided on the page sharing interface of the client of the sharee.
