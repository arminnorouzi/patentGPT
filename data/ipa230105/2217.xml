A MEMS acoustic sensor includes a base <b>1</b> with a back cavity <b>1</b><i>a </i>and a capacitance system <b>3</b> fixed to the base <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The capacitance system <b>3</b> includes a diaphragm <b>5</b> that reciprocates along the vibration direction and a back plate <b>7</b> that is spaced apart from the diaphragm <b>5</b> to form a capacitor <b>8</b>. The capacitor <b>8</b> includes a first capacitor <b>81</b> and a second capacitor <b>83</b>. A plurality of through holes <b>7</b><i>a </i>are provided in the area of the back plate <b>7</b> facing the back cavity <b>1</b><i>a</i>. The diaphragm <b>5</b> includes a main body part <b>51</b> opposite to the back plate <b>7</b> and spaced apart to form the first capacitor <b>81</b>, and a plurality of combining parts <b>53</b> recessed from the main body part <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">During operation, the combining part <b>53</b> can be inserted into the through hole <b>7</b><i>a</i>. The combining part <b>53</b> and the inner wall of the through hole <b>7</b><i>a </i>are spaced apart to form the second capacitor <b>83</b>. When pressure (sound wave) acts on the diaphragm <b>5</b>, the diaphragm <b>5</b> moves closer to and away from the back plate <b>7</b> along the vibration direction to reciprocate to make the capacitance of the capacitor <b>8</b> between the diaphragm <b>5</b> and the back plate <b>7</b> Make a change.

This kind of back plate <b>7</b> passes through a different number of anchor points (the anchor points are: The end of the first beam <b>71</b> away from the center part <b>75</b>) is fixed. The stiffness of the back plate <b>7</b> can be increased, thereby reducing the displacement of the back plate <b>7</b> under the frequency signal and mechanical vibration.

The electrode area of the back plate <b>7</b> with such a circular distribution is large (that is, the capacitor <b>8</b> formed is large). However, the outer ring will still produce a certain amount of displacement under the frequency signal and mechanical vibration, which will generate noise.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

Wherein, the regular polygon can be a regular hexagon, a regular octagon, a regular hexadecagon and other polygons. Compared with the circular back plate <b>7</b> (that is, the second beam <b>73</b> is arranged in a circular shape), the regular polygonal back plate <b>7</b>&#x2032; can ensure that the reduced electrode area is less (That is to say, the capacitor value of the capacitor <b>8</b> formed has a smaller decrease), so that the distance between the two anchor points is the shortest (the anchor point is: One end of the first beam <b>71</b> away from the center part <b>75</b>). Thereby reducing the displacement of the outer ring of the back plate under the frequency signal and mechanical vibration, thus reducing the mechanical noise caused by the vibration of the back plate to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It should be noted that the structure of the back plate and its connection structure to the base are not limited to the back plate described in embodiment 1 and embodiment 2.
