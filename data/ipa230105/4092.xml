In particular, the inspection tool or apparatus may be used to inspect pellicles that are used in an EUV lithographic apparatus to shield a patterned reticle from contamination.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A lithographic apparatus is a machine constructed to apply a desired pattern onto a substrate. A lithographic apparatus can be used, for example, in the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs). A lithographic apparatus may, for example, project a pattern at a patterning device (e.g., a mask) onto a layer of radiation-sensitive material (resist) provided on a substrate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To project a pattern on a substrate a lithographic apparatus may use electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of this radiation determines the minimum size of features which can be formed on the substrate. A lithographic apparatus, which uses extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation, having a wavelength within the range 4-20 nm, for example 6.7 nm or 13.5 nm, may be used to form smaller features on a substrate than a lithographic apparatus which uses, for example, radiation with a wavelength of 193 nm.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">the patterning device as mentioned is, in case of an EUV lithographic apparatus often shielded by a pellicle. Prior to the application of the pellicle, the pellicle needs to undergo a qualification or inspection process, in order to assess that it meets specification.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In known arrangements, such a qualification process may be rather time-consuming and may not have the required accuracy.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object to provide in an inspection apparatus for inspection of an object such as a pellicle, whereby the processing time is reduced and/or the accuracy is improved.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect, there is provided an inspection apparatus for inspecting an object such as a pellicle for use in an EUV lithographic apparatus, the inspection apparatus comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">a vacuum chamber;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">a load lock forming an interface between the vacuum chamber and an ambient environment;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">a stage apparatus configured to receive the object from the load lock and displace the object inside the vacuum chamber,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">wherein the vacuum chamber comprises a first parking position and a second parking position for temporarily storing the object.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">According to an aspect, there is provided an inspection apparatus for inspecting an object such as a pellicle for use in an EUV lithographic apparatus, the inspection apparatus comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0014">a vacuum chamber;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0015">a first load lock forming an interface between the vacuum chamber and an ambient environment;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0016">a second load lock forming an interface between the vacuum chamber and an ambient environment;<br/>a stage apparatus configured to receive the object from the first load lock and displace the object inside the vacuum chamber and configured to provide the object to the second load lock.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0017">According to an aspect, there is provided an inspection apparatus for inspecting an object such as a pellicle for use in an EUV lithographic apparatus, the inspection apparatus comprising:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0018">a chamber configured to provide in a conditioned atmosphere for inspecting the object;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0019">a load lock forming an interface between the chamber and an ambient environment;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0020">a radiation beam source configured to generate a radiation beam for inspecting the object;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0021">a radiation beam measurement system configured to measure a characteristic of the radiation beam, wherein the radiation beam measurement system comprises:        <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0022">a member arranged in an optical path of the radiation beam between the radiation beam source and the object, the member comprising an aperture to allow part of the radiation beam to propagate to the object, and</li>            <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0023">at least one radiation sensor arranged on the member and configured to measure to the characteristic of the radiation beam.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0024">Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a lithographic system comprising a lithographic apparatus and a radiation source;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>F</figref> depict a first embodiment of an inspection apparatus;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> depict a second embodiment of an inspection apparatus;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a radiation beam measurement system as can be applied in an inspection apparatus according to an embodiment;

The radiation source SO is configured to generate an EUV radiation beam B and to supply the EUV radiation beam B to the lithographic apparatus LA. The lithographic apparatus LA comprises an illumination system IL, a support structure MT configured to support a patterning device MA (e.g., a mask), a projection system PS and a substrate table WT configured to support a substrate W.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0031">The illumination system IL is configured to condition the EUV radiation beam B before the EUV radiation beam B is incident upon the patterning device MA. Thereto, the illumination system IL may include a facetted field mirror device <b>10</b> and a facetted pupil mirror device <b>11</b>. The faceted field mirror device <b>10</b> and faceted pupil mirror device <b>11</b> together provide the EUV radiation beam B with a desired cross-sectional shape and a desired intensity distribution. The illumination system IL may include other mirrors or devices in addition to, or instead of, the faceted field mirror device <b>10</b> and faceted pupil mirror device <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0032">After being thus conditioned, the EUV radiation beam B interacts with the patterning device MA. As a result of this interaction, a patterned EUV radiation beam B&#x2032; is generated. The projection system PS is configured to project the patterned EUV radiation beam B&#x2032; onto the substrate W. For that purpose, the projection system PS may comprise a plurality of mirrors <b>13</b>,<b>14</b> which are configured to project the patterned EUV radiation beam B&#x2032; onto the substrate W held by the substrate table WT. The projection system PS may apply a reduction factor to the patterned EUV radiation beam B&#x2032;, thus forming an image with features that are smaller than corresponding features on the patterning device MA. For example, a reduction factor of 4 or 8 may be applied. Although the projection system PS is illustrated as having only two mirrors <b>13</b>,<b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the projection system PS may include a different number of mirrors (e.g. six or eight mirrors). The substrate W may include previously formed patterns. Where this is the case, the lithographic apparatus LA aligns the image, formed by the patterned EUV radiation beam B&#x2032;, with a pattern previously formed on the substrate W.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0033">A relative vacuum, i.e. a small amount of gas (e.g. hydrogen) at a pressure well below atmospheric pressure, may be provided in the radiation source SO, in the illumination system IL, and/or in the projection system PS.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0034">The radiation source SO may be a laser produced plasma (LPP) source, a discharge produced plasma (DPP) source, a free electron laser (FEL) or any other radiation source that is capable of generating EUV radiation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0035">An embodiment of the present invention relates to manufacture of components for an apparatus or for use in an apparatus. The apparatus may be a lithographic apparatus, for example an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithographic apparatus such as may be used to fabricate integrated circuit chips. The components may be, for example, membranes or pellicles for use in the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0036">During production of components, it may be necessary to test the components to ensure they satisfy certain criteria. Some tests may be carried out in a specific environment, for example a vacuum environment. This may be provided in a vacuum chamber. It will be appreciated, of course, that other processing, measurements or handling of the components may also be performed in the vacuum chamber. In order to maintain a vacuum environment within the vacuum chamber, an antechamber (also known as a load lock) may be provided. A component can be inserted into the load lock at ambient pressure. The load lock is then sealed, and the air pumped out until vacuum conditions matching those of the vacuum chamber are prevalent in the load lock. The load lock is then opened to the vacuum chamber and the component can then be moved from the load lock to the vacuum chamber ready for testing or other procedures to be carried out. When the component is to be removed from the vacuum chamber, the process is reversed. In other words, the component is transferred to the load lock in a vacuum and the load lock is sealed off from the vacuum chamber. Ambient pressure is then restored to the load lock by pumping air into the space inside the load lock. Once ambient pressure is reached, the load lock can be opened, and the component removed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0037">In the case of sensitive and/or delicate components, such as a pellicle for an EUV apparatus, the pumping and venting time may be of the order of a few hours in order to preserve mechanical integrity of the component by maintaining a low-pressure differential as well as reduce the risk of contamination by keeping the gas flow speed low. This may be significantly greater than the time taken to test the component(s) in the vacuum chamber, for example up to twice as long.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0038">An embodiment of the present invention discloses two solutions to the above problem. In a first aspect, there is provided an inspection apparatus for inspecting an object or a component, e.g. a pellicle for use in an EUV lithographic apparatus.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0039">In accordance with the first embodiment, the inspection apparatus comprises:<ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0040">a vacuum chamber;</li>        <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0041">a load lock forming an interface between the vacuum chamber and an ambient environment;</li>        <li id="ul0009-0003" num="0042">a stage apparatus configured to receive the component from the load lock and displace the object inside the vacuum chamber.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0029" num="0043">In addition, according to the first embodiment, in order to reduce total manufacturing and/or testing time, or, more specifically, to increase throughput of components, it is proposed to use part of the vacuum chamber for storage of components such that the loading and/or unloading phase can be performed for a first component at the same time as a second component is being tested.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0044">In particular, in an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum chamber of the inspection apparatus comprises a first parking position and a second parking position. In accordance witan embodiment, a parking position refers to a position or location where a component may be temporarily stored.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0045">In accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, it is thus proposed to provide two parking positions inside the vacuum chamber. As will be illustrated below, the application of two parking positions inside the vacuum chamber enables the operating of the load lock while a first component is present inside the load lock, said operating e.g. including pumping out air out of the load lock or pumping air into the load lock, at the same time as the processing, e.g. inspecting of a second component that is arranged inside the vacuum chamber. A possible sequence for this process is illustrated further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F</figref> below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F</figref> schematically show plan views of an inspection apparatus <b>100</b> according to an embodiment. In the embodiment as shown, the inspection apparatus comprises a vacuum chamber <b>110</b>, a load lock <b>120</b>, a stage apparatus <b>130</b>, whereby the vacuum chamber <b>110</b> includes two parking positions <b>140</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>140</b>.<b>2</b>, also indicated as PP<b>1</b> and PP<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0046">In an embodiment, a load lock such as load lock <b>120</b> may be considered an interface between a first atmosphere and a second atmosphere, e.g. between an ambient atmosphere or environment and a vacuum environment.

After loading of the product B into the load lock, in particular the load lock chamber <b>120</b>.<b>3</b>, the first door <b>120</b>.<b>1</b> can be closed as well and the air can be pumped out of the load lock chamber <b>120</b>.<b>3</b>.

In an embodiment, this step can e.g. be performed by the stage apparatus <b>130</b>, in particular the X-stage <b>130</b>.<b>1</b> and the Y-stage <b>130</b>.<b>2</b>. In an embodiment, the stage apparatus <b>130</b> may e.g. comprise one or more linear motors, e.g. a linear motor for displacing the object, e.g. the pellicle, along the X-direction and a linear motor for displacing the object along the Y-direction.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0050">In a third step, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the load lock door <b>120</b>.<b>2</b> to the vacuum chamber <b>110</b> is opened and Product B is retrieved from the load lock <b>120</b> and moved into the vacuum chamber <b>110</b> while Product A remains in the first storage area <b>140</b>.<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0051">In a fourth step, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, Product B is moved to a second storage area (parking position <b>2</b>, PP<b>2</b>, <b>140</b>.<b>2</b>). In the embodiment as shown, the load lock <b>120</b> comprises a transfer mechanism <b>150</b> configured to transfer an object from the load lock <b>120</b> to the stage apparatus <b>130</b> and vice versa. It can be pointed out that such a transfer mechanism may also be located on the stage apparatus or elsewhere in the vacuum chamber <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, an end portion <b>150</b>.<b>1</b> of the transfer mechanism may e.g. be configured to hold the object and lift and/or lowering the object.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0052">In a fifth step, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>, Product A is returned to the load lock <b>120</b> from the first storage area <b>140</b>.<b>1</b>. In this respect, it can be pointed out that, due to the application of two parking positions PP<b>1</b> and PP<b>2</b>, this transfer can be performed by the stage apparatus <b>130</b>.

This is because, in particular, a second component may be loaded or unloaded while a first component is undergoing measurement. In such a configuration, the loading/unloading time for one component overlaps with the measurement process time for another component, thus improving throughput of components to be tested/measured and reducing total processing time.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0055">According to a second embodiment of the first aspect of the invention, a second load lock may be used. In this configuration, loading and unloading may occur simultaneously. For example, while a first component is being measured, a second component may be unloaded following a previous measurement and a third component may be loaded prior to a subsequent measurement. Use of this process may reduce the measurement cycle time by up to two times. This may also reduce the amount of manufacturing equipment and/or clean-room space required for manufacturing the components since the throughput increases significantly.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0056">A possible sequence of steps using a vacuum chamber having two load locks is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> schematically depict a cross-sectional view in a vertical plane (XZ-plane).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows an inspection apparatus <b>200</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.

Within the meaning herein, such a radiation source may include any suitable form of radiation, e.g. electromagnetic radiation or a particle beam such as an electron beam or ion beam.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0062">According to a second aspect, there is provided an inspection apparatus for inspecting objects such as pellicles.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0063">Some lithographic apparatus comprise a pellicle attached to a patterned reticle. The pellicle is a transmissive film which is spaced a few millimetres away from the pattern of the reticle. A contamination particle which is received on the pellicle is in the far field with respect to the pattern of the reticle, and consequently does not have a significant impact upon the quality of image which is projected by the lithographic apparatus on to a substrate. If the pellicle were not present then the contamination particle may lie on the pattern of the reticle and could therefore obscure a portion of the pattern, thereby preventing the pattern from being projected correctly on to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0064">An inspection apparatus, also referred to as a pellicle qualification system may be configured to determine optical properties (such as reflectivity and/or transmissivity) of the pellicle in order to determine whether or not the pellicle is of a high enough quality to be used in a lithographic apparatus. Such a pellicle qualification or inspection may involve directing a measurement radiation beam towards the pellicle and using radiation sensors to detect an intensity of the measurement radiation beam before and after it has interacted with the pellicle. This enables a comparison of characteristics of the measurement radiation beam before and after it has interacted with the pellicle, thereby enabling determination of how the pellicle has affected the measurement radiation beam and whether or not the pellicle is of a high enough quality to be used in a lithographic apparatus.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0065">One known pellicle qualification system uses two radiation sensors to detect an intensity of the measurement radiation beam before the measurement radiation beam has interacted with the pellicle. A first portion of the measurement radiation beam is directed along a main measurement path where it interacts with the pellicle. A second portion of the measurement radiation beam is directed to the radiation sensors. Therefore, the two radiation sensors are located on different optical paths and/or receive incident radiation at different angles to the main measurement path. The optical paths may differ from each other. The differences between different optical paths may vary over time. For example, optical components in the different optical paths (e.g. lenses and/or mirrors) may degrade differently, temperature and subsequent thermal deformations may vary, vacuum or gas variations in the optical path, etc. Due to the different optical paths, there are random differences between the first and second portions of the measurement radiation beam and thereby reduce an accuracy of the known pellicle qualification system. Known methods of improving an accuracy of the known pellicle qualification system involve the use of beam splitters and/or grazing mirrors. However, such optical components reduce an intensity of the radiation, which in turn negatively affects an accuracy of the system. The inspection apparatus according to the second aspect provides an alternative manner to measure the radiation beam as applied to inspect or qualify a pellicle.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> schematically shows a top view (left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) and a side view (right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the novel radiation beam measurement system as applied in the inspection apparatus according to the second aspect, also referred to as a pellicle qualification system.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0067">The inspection apparatus according to the second aspect may e.g. comprise:<ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0068">a chamber configured to provide in a conditioned atmosphere for inspecting the object;</li>        <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0069">a load lock forming an interface between the chamber and an ambient environment;</li>        <li id="ul0011-0003" num="0070">a radiation beam source configured to generate a radiation beam for inspecting the object;</li>        <li id="ul0011-0004" num="0071">a radiation beam measurement system configured to measure a characteristic of the radiation beam.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0054" num="0072">In an embodiment, the conditioned atmosphere may e.g. be a vacuum environment.

In such embodiment, the detector thus receives radiation that is transmitted through the object <b>440</b>. In general, the inspection apparatus according to the second aspect may be configured to receive any type of radiation caused by interaction of the radiation beam with the object <b>440</b>. Such radiation can e.g. include radiation that is emitted by the object or radiation that is reflected by the object or radiation that is transmitted by or through the object.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0081">The spectral purity filter <b>422</b> may be configured to filter the incoming radiation beam <b>450</b> before the radiation beam <b>450</b> is incident on the pellicle <b>440</b>.

The CCD, in general the detector <b>430</b>, may be configured to detect the radiation beam <b>450</b> after the radiation beam <b>450</b> has interacted with the pellicle <b>440</b>.

A comparison between the measurement performed by the radiation beam measurement system and the measurement performed by the CCD of the pellicle qualification system may be used to determine what effect the pellicle <b>440</b> had on the radiation beam, and thereby determine whether or not the pellicle <b>440</b> is suitable for use in a lithographic apparatus.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0082">The spectral purity filter <b>422</b> may be held in place by a support. In the embodiment as shown, the spectral purity filter <b>422</b> is mounted to the member <b>400</b> via the support <b>420</b>. In the embodiment as shown, the member <b>400</b> comprises an aperture <b>410</b> for at least part of the radiation beam (which may be referred to as a first portion of the radiation beam) to pass through before the radiation beam is incident on the pellicle. The radiation sensors <b>1</b> to <b>8</b> of the radiation beam measurement system may be installed on the member <b>400</b>. Edges of the radiation sensors may be substantially aligned with edges of the aperture of the member <b>400</b>. The surfaces of the member <b>400</b> on which the radiation beam measurement system is installed, and the radiation sensors of the radiation beam measurement system, act to block some of the incident radiation beam <b>450</b> (which may be referred to as a second portion of the incident radiation beam). Since the edges of the radiation sensors are substantially aligned with edges of the aperture <b>410</b> of the member <b>400</b>, the radiation beam measurement system is able to measure characteristics of the radiation beam <b>450</b> as close as possible to a central axis of the radiation beam without affecting the portion of the radiation beam that interacts with the pellicle (and which may be detected by the CCD <b>430</b> of the inspection apparatus or pellicle qualification system). The radiation beam measurement system may be the final optical component to interact with the radiation beam before the radiation beam is incident on the pellicle <b>440</b>. The influence of all other optical components in the optical path of the radiation beam is thereby included and accounted for in the measurement performed by the radiation beam measurement system. Thus, variations in the optical path of the radiation beam have less of an effect on the accuracy of the novel radiation beam measurement system compared to the known radiation beam measurement system.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0083">The radiation beam measurement system advantageously enables in-situ monitoring of characteristics (e.g. energy, spatial intensity profile, dose, etc.) of the incident radiation beam without significantly affecting the radiation beam. This may improve an accuracy of subsequent measurements performed using the radiation beam after the radiation beam has interacted with the pellicle. The radiation beam measurement system allows for a set-up calibration using the CCD <b>430</b> as a reference. For example when there is no pellicle <b>440</b> disposed between the support and the CCD <b>430</b>, both the radiation sensors <b>1</b> to <b>8</b> of the radiation beam measurement system and the CCD <b>430</b> can be used to determine characteristics of the incident radiation beam <b>450</b>. The direct measurement from the CCD <b>430</b> of the first portion of the radiation beam can be used to calibrate the in-direct measurement from the radiation sensors <b>1</b> to <b>8</b> of the radiation beam measurement system. The radiation beam measurement system is compact and easy to install and use. The radiation beam measurement system may be capable of reconstructing a spatial intensity profile of the radiation by, for example, using a combination of known positions of the radiation sensors, performing reference measurements, comparing measurements with a database of information regarding characteristics of the radiation beam, and fitting algorithms.
