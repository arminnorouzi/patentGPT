interest in beauty culture is rapidly increasing in modern society, interest in skin procedures and skin care is rapidly increasing. Accordingly, interest and research on a cooling device for skin care and skin disease treatment are increasing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, a conventional cooling device for skin treatment, particularly, a cooling device which uses the method of cooling skin by spraying a refrigerant to the skin is a supply source of a refrigerant, and has been used by connecting a refrigerant tank to the cooling device through a hose or by mounting a refrigerant cartridge to the cooling device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the existing cooling device is not compatible with both a hose connected to the refrigerant tank and the refrigerant cartridge, and is divided into a cooling device for the refrigerant tank and a cooling device for the refrigerant cartridge to be used individually.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, the cooling device for skin treatment may inevitably have a safety problem in that the cooling device performs treatment on the skin. For example, impurities contained in a refrigerant may be delivered to a targeted area of the skin, which may cause skin to be infected.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, research on the structure and control method of the cooling device that can perform cooling while increasing the ease of use and ensuring safety is required.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A problem which the present disclosure is intended to solve is to provide a filter fixing module which is mounted to a cooling device and receives a filter which filters out impurities in a refrigerant.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another problem the present disclosure is to provide the cooling device from which the filter fixing module is mounted and removed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Problems which the present disclosure intends to solve are not limited to the tasks described above, and problems not mentioned will be clearly understood by those skilled in the art to which the present disclosure belongs from the present specification and the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the embodiment of the present specification, a filter fixing module mounted to a handpiece cooling device having a connecting unit such that a refrigerant supply unit is coupled thereto may include: a body having a support surface formed in the shape of a flat plate in a first direction, and a receiving surface formed on the edge of the support surface and protruding in a second direction relative to the support surface so as to prevent the removal of a filter received in the support surface&#x2014;the first direction and the second direction are different;

cooling device and a cooling method of the same in which the filter fixing module easily removed therefrom is used such that a target is safely cooled.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">According to the embodiment of the present specification, for beauty or treatment of a target, the cooling system may be used to cool the target such that the target can be in a cooled state, and in this case, a cooling control method may be used such that the target is not damaged due to overcooling or the like.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The target may refer to a target to be cooled using the cooling system. For example, a target may refer to a target to receive skin cosmetic treatment in which cooling is used. Specifically, a target may include parts of a body, including moles, warts, corns, and acne scars, etc. which can be removed by cooling a local area, or may include a portion of a body that requires local anesthesia during laser treatment such as hair removal, dermabrasion, or Botox treatment. For another example, a target may refer to a target to be made into anesthesia or pain-free state for receiving medical procedures. Specifically, a target may refer to a part of the body including nerves, such as diseased eyes, skin, and gums.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Cooling means lowering the temperature of a target to be cooled by absorbing the thermal energy of the target to be cooled by applying cooling energy to the target to be cooled. Here, cooling energy expresses the escape of heat by cooling, and may be understood as a concept for expressing decrease in thermal energy. For example, cooling is applying cooling energy to a target to be cooled by &#x201c;spraying&#x201d; a refrigerant or air gas to the target to be cooled. For another example, cooling is applying cooling energy to a target to be cooled by applying cooling energy to a cooling medium and &#x201c;contacting&#x201d; the cooling medium to the target to be cooled. In other words, cooling should be understood as a comprehensive concept including various methods of applying cooling energy to a target to be cooled. Hereinafter, for convenience of explanation, cooling a target through a non-contact method of using a refrigerant is described as a main embodiment, but the technical idea of the present specification is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The cooling system may also be used for treatment such as inflammation relief (e.g., acne relief), itch relief, for pigmented lesion treatment, vascular lesion treatment, blemish removal, and fat removal. Alternatively, the cooling system may cool a target to directly destroy at least a portion of the target. For example, when a target is a part of the body including the above-mentioned skin moles, warts, and corns, etc., the cooling system provides cooling energy to the target through the surface of the target such that tissue in the target may be necrotic or killed by the provided cooling energy. For another example, the cooling system provides cooling energy to a target surface by spraying a refrigerant on the target surface, and the provided cooling energy makes the temperature of a nerve distributed under the target surface to be below a temperature at which the nerves are temporarily paralyzed or nerve transmission is blocked, whereby the target may be placed under anesthesia or analgesia. The cooling system may cool the target surface and the inside of the target to an appropriate temperature range in order to maintain such anesthesia or analgesia for a predetermined period of time.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Hereinafter, for convenience of explanation, a case in which a target is skin and the cooling system sprays a refrigerant on the surface of the skin to deliver cooling energy thereto is described as a main embodiment, but the technical idea of the present specification is not limited thereto and may be applied to any part of a body.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Hereinafter, the cooling system <b>10</b> according to the embodiment of the present specification will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view illustrating the cooling system <b>10</b> according to the embodiment of the present specification.
