More specifically, the present disclosure relates to an adhesive composition that has high flame retardancy due to containing a flame retardant, while also having both excellent adhesiveness and excellent holding force, which typically significantly decreases in an adhesive tape to which a flame retardant is added, and also relates to an adhesive agent, an adhesive tape, and an airtight waterproof adhesive tape obtained using the adhesive composition.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, it has been considered imparting flame retardancy to a flame retardant adhesive tape by adding a flame retardant to an adhesive layer. For example, PTL 1 discloses a flame retardant adhesive tape for electrical insulation that is excellent in flame retardancy, adhesive properties, and suppressing carbonization dielectric breakdown due to an isocyanate crosslinking agent being used as a crosslinking agent for an acrylic resin and a phosphoric acid ester amide flame retardant being added to a flame retardant. Epoxy compounds are also described as examples of the crosslinking agent.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">PTL 1: JP-A-2008-24827</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the adhesive tape disclosed in PTL 1 described above is for electrical insulation, and its adhesiveness is insufficient for construction uses in which stronger adhesiveness is required.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also, although adhesiveness can be improved by reducing the amount of the crosslinking agent, the holding force typically significantly decreases when a flame retardant is added, and there is demand for an adhesive tape that is excellent in both adhesiveness and the holding force while having high flame retardancy due to containing a flame retardant.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Under the above circumstances, the present disclosure provides an adhesive composition that is excellent in both adhesiveness and the holding force while having high flame retardancy by using an epoxy crosslinking agent and an isocyanate crosslinking agent in combination as crosslinking agents for a specific acrylic resin.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, an acrylic adhesive composition is useful for airtight waterproof adhesive tapes, which are used for the purpose of achieving at least either airtightness or waterproofness at a gap between a structure of a house and a member or between members (mainly around sash openings and joint portions such as overlapped portions of moisture-permeable waterproof sheets), for example, in line with the enforcement of laws relating to quality promotion of waterproof airtight houses (houses excellent in waterproofness or airtightness) and energy saving through improvement in airtightness and thermal insulation of houses. Such an airtight waterproof adhesive tape is required to strongly adhere to an adherend having relatively high polarity such as an aluminum sash, an adherend having relatively low polarity such as a moisture-permeable waterproof sheet, and a rough surface such as an OSB (Oriented Strand Board: wooden plate obtained by stacking oriented thin wood chips and compressing the chips at a high temperature using an adhesive agent), have a strong holding force so that a moisture-permeable waterproof sheet or the like fixed using the tape is not displaced, and further have high flame retardancy.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the foregoing, the inventor of the present disclosure carried out intensive studies and found that it is possible to obtain an adhesive composition that is excellent in both adhesiveness and the holding force while having high flame retardancy, and an adhesive agent, an adhesive tape, and an airtight waterproof adhesive tape using the adhesive composition, if an adhesive composition in which an acrylic resin is used contains a (meth)acrylic acid monomer and a hydroxyl group-containing monomer as copolymerization components constituting the acrylic resin, and also contains both an epoxy crosslinking agent and an isocyanate crosslinking agent together with a flame retardant.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">That is, the gist of the present disclosure is as follows.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0011">&#x3c;1&#x3e;</li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">An adhesive composition including: an acrylic resin (A) that contains a (meth)acrylic acid monomer (a<b>1</b>) unit and a hydroxyl group-containing monomer (a<b>2</b>) unit; an epoxy crosslinking agent (b<b>1</b>); an isocyanate crosslinking agent (b<b>2</b>); and a flame retardant (C).<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">&#x3c;2&#x3e;</li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">The adhesive composition according to &#x3c;1&#x3e;, wherein the acrylic resin (A) contains a terminal end carboxy group-containing monomer (a<b>3</b>) unit represented by the following general formula (1),</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="11.51mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002649A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">where R<sup>1 </sup>represents hydrogen or a methyl group, R<sup>2 </sup>represents a divalent saturated aliphatic group, unsaturated aliphatic group, aromatic group, saturated alicyclic group, or unsaturated alicyclic hydrocarbon group, and n represents a positive number of 1 or more.<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0016">&#x3c;3&#x3e;</li></ul></p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">The adhesive composition according to &#x3c;2&#x3e;, wherein the acrylic resin (A) contains the following monomer units (a<b>1</b>) to (a<b>4</b>):</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">(a<b>1</b>) 0.1 to 5 wt. % of the (meth)acrylic acid monomer unit;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019">(a<b>2</b>) 0.01 to 5 wt. % of the hydroxyl group-containing monomer unit;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">(a<b>3</b>) 1 to 20 wt. % of the terminal end carboxy group-containing monomer unit represented by the general formula (1); and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">(a<b>4</b>) 55 to 97 wt. % of a (meth)acrylate monomer unit having an alkyl group having 4 to 24 carbon atoms.<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0022">&#x3c;4&#x3e;</li></ul></p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">The adhesive composition according to any one of &#x3c;1&#x3e; to &#x3c;3&#x3e;, wherein the flame retardant (C) is contained in an amount of 1 to 100 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of the acrylic resin (A).<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0024">&#x3c;5&#x3e;</li></ul></p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">An adhesive agent obtained by crosslinking the adhesive composition according to any one of &#x3c;1&#x3e; to &#x3c;4&#x3e;.<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0026">&#x3c;6&#x3e;</li></ul></p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">An adhesive tape including a substrate and the adhesive agent according to &#x3c;5&#x3e; applied to the substrate.<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0028">&#x3c;7&#x3e;</li></ul></p><p id="p-0024" num="0029">An airtight waterproof adhesive tape constituted by the adhesive tape according to &#x3c;6&#x3e;.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0030">An adhesive composition according to the present disclosure contains the acrylic resin (A) that contains the (meth)acrylic acid monomer (a<b>1</b>) unit and the hydroxyl group-containing monomer (a<b>2</b>) unit, the epoxy crosslinking agent (b<b>1</b>), the isocyanate crosslinking agent (b<b>2</b>), and the flame retardant (C). In the case of an adhesive composition that contains either the epoxy crosslinking agent (b<b>1</b>) or the isocyanate crosslinking agent (b<b>2</b>) as a crosslinking agent, improvement in flame retardancy is typically limited even when a flame retardant is added to the adhesive composition, and the adhesive composition cannot satisfy the flame retardancy specified in the European construction material fire safety standard EN13501-1 (EN standard). In contrast, in the case of the adhesive composition according to the present disclosure, the effect of improving flame retardancy is significant and the adhesive composition can satisfy the flame retardancy specified in the EN standard, and when compared with the case where a flame retardant is added to an adhesive composition containing either one of the crosslinking agents, flame retardancy that is significantly higher than expected can be imparted to the adhesive composition according to the present disclosure. Moreover, although a holding force of an adhesive tape typically significantly decreases when a flame retardant is added, the adhesive composition according to the present disclosure is excellent in both adhesiveness and the holding force while having high flame retardancy.

The flat yarn cloth is used in a state where intersections between flat yarns constituting the warp and the weft of the woven cloth are fixed through heat fusion to prevent misalignment.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0147">Examples of the release liner include: a plastic film made of plastics, examples thereof including polyolefin resin such as polyethylene, polyester resin such as polyethylene terephthalate, vinyl acetate resin, polyimide resin, fluorine resin, and cellophane; paper such as kraft paper and Japanese paper; a rubber sheet made of natural rubber, butyl rubber, or the like; a foamed sheet obtained by foaming polyurethane, polychloroprene rubber, or the like; metal foil such as aluminum foil and copper foil; and a composite of these. Surface treatment such as corona treatment may be performed on one or both of the surfaces of the release liner.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0148">Examples of the release liner further include: paper obtained by laminating a polyethylene film or the like on glassine paper, kraft paper, or clay coated paper; paper coated with resin such as polyvinyl alcohol or an acrylic acid ester copolymer; and a synthetic resin film that is made of polyester, polypropylene, or the like and coated with a releasing agent such as fluorine resin or silicone resin.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0149">Any one of these may be used alone or two or more of these may be used in combination.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0150">Of these, a paper release liner can be easily teared by hand and thus is preferable, and a release liner made of paper that has a paper weight of 40 to 120 g/m<sup>2</sup>, or preferably 50 to 80 g/m<sup>2 </sup>is particularly preferable. The thickness of the release liner is preferably 40 to 180 &#x3bc;m, particularly preferably 60 to 140 &#x3bc;m, and further preferably 80 to 120 &#x3bc;m. If the thickness is too small, the production tends to be difficult due to creases being formed when the release liner is wound, for example, and if the thickness is too large, the release liner tends to be difficult to tear by hand.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0151">A commonly used coating device can be used to coat one surface of the substrate or the release liner with the adhesive agent. Examples of the coating device include a roll knife coater, a die coater, a roll coater, a bar coater, a gravure roll coater, a reverse roll coater, a dipping device, and a blade coater.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0152">The thickness of the dried adhesive layer is preferably 5 to 200 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 10 to 150 &#x3bc;m, and further preferably 15 to 130 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0153">If the thickness is too large, application of the adhesive agent tends to be difficult, and if the thickness is too small, sufficient adhesiveness is unlikely to be obtained.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0154">The adhesive tape according to the present disclosure may be a one-sided adhesive tape or a double-sided adhesive tape. Adhesive layers of the double-sided adhesive tape may have the same composition or different compositions.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0155">In a case where release liners are respectively layered on the adhesive layers of the double-sided adhesive tape, it is preferable to select the release liners such that the release liners layered on the two surfaces have different peel forces, to improve work efficiency. For example, work efficiency is improved when the release liners are selected such that the peel force of a release liner layered on a surface of the double-sided adhesive tape that is to be attached first is smaller than the peel force of a release liner layered on a surface of the double-sided adhesive tape to be attached next.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0156">Conditions of the drying step described above can be selected such that the solvent and residual monomers in the adhesive agent are dried and removed through the drying and, when the crosslinking agent (B) is used, functional groups contained in the acrylic resin (A) and the crosslinking agent (B) react with each other to form a crosslinked structure. For example, the drying is preferably performed at 60&#xb0; C. to 120&#xb0; C. for about 1 to 5 minutes. After the drying, it is possible to cause the crosslinking reaction to further proceed by aging the adhesive layer in a state of being sandwiched between sheet-shaped substrates.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0157">The adhesive tape according to the present disclosure may be formed into a roll, a sheet, or various other shapes.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0158">In the case where the adhesive tape is a double-sided adhesive tape in the form of a sheet, it is preferable to provide release liners on the surfaces of both of the two adhesive layers. In the case where the adhesive tape is in the form of a roll, it is preferable to provide a release liner only on the surface of one of the two adhesive layers.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0159">Thus, the adhesive tape according to the present disclosure is obtained. Adhesive properties of the adhesive tape according to the present disclosure are not degraded with respect to even an adherend and a substrate that degrade adhesive properties, and the adhesive tape also has a good holding force. Furthermore, when a substrate that is tearable by hand is used as the substrate film, the adhesive tape can be easily cut by hand at any position in the width direction of the tape without a need to use a tape cutter or the like, and can be used particularly advantageously as an adhesive tape.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0160">Regarding the adhesiveness of the adhesive layer in the adhesive tape, it is typically preferable that the adhesive tape has a 180&#xb0; peel strength of 1 to 100 N/25 mm in accordance with JIS 20237 with respect to an adherend used.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0161">In particular, when a test plate made of SUS304 steel, which has relatively high polarity, is used as the adherend, the 180&#xb0; peel strength is preferably 25 N/25 mm or more, particularly preferably 30 N/25 mm or more, and further preferably 35 N/25 mm or more. Note that the upper limit of the 180&#xb0; peel strength is typically about 100 N/25 mm.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0162">Note that the adhesiveness varies depending on the composition (material) and surface conditions (surface roughness) of the adherend, treatment (washing) conditions, and the like, and therefore, is not limited to the above-described range of the peel strength.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0163">The adhesiveness is measured in accordance with JIS 20237. Specifically, the adhesiveness can be measured using a method described later in Examples.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0164">In the case where the test piece is a double-sided adhesive tape, an adhesive surface that is not tested can be covered with a polyethylene terephthalate film (Lumirror S10 manufactured by Toray Industries, Inc.) with a nominal thickness of 25 &#x3bc;m specified in JIS C2318 during measurement.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0165">Regarding the holding force of the adhesive layer in the adhesive tape according to the present disclosure, when the holding force is measured using a method described below in &#x3c;Method for Measuring Holding Force&#x3e;, specifically a method described later in Examples, it is particularly preferable that the test piece does not fall off from a test plate when 24 hours (1440 minutes) has elapsed, and even if the test piece falls within 24 hours, it is preferable that the test piece is held for 100 minutes or more, more preferably 150 minutes or more, and particularly preferably 500 minutes or more.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">&#x3c;Method for Measuring Holding Force&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0160" num="0166">The adhesive layer of the adhesive tape cut to have a width of 25 mm and a length of 75 mm and a SUS plate are bonded under pressure such that the area of contact between the adhesive layer and the SUS plate has a width of 25 mm and a length of 25 mm, then a 1000-g weight is attached to the SUS plate such that the adhesive tape is vertically suspended, and the time it takes for the adhesive tape to fall is measured in an environment at 40&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0167">Furthermore, the adhesive layer in the adhesive tape preferably has a gel fraction of 30 to 70 wt. %, more preferably 35 to 60 wt. %, and particularly preferably 40 to 50 wt. %, from the viewpoint of adhesiveness and the holding force. If the gel fraction is too low, the holding force with respect to adherends tends to decrease, and if the gel fraction is too high, adhesiveness to adherends tends to decrease. An adhesive composition that has a gel fraction within the preferable range and in which the epoxy crosslinking agent (b<b>1</b>) and the isocyanate crosslinking agent (b<b>2</b>) are used in combination has high adhesiveness and a strong holding force in a well-balanced manner, and is likely to stably maintain the strong holding force even when subjected to a high temperature and a high humidity, and thus is preferable.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0168">The gel fraction serves as an index of a crosslinking degree (the degree of curing), and can be measured using a method described later in Examples, for example.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0169">The gel fraction of the adhesive agent can be adjusted to fall within the above-described range by adjusting the type and the amount of the crosslinking agent (B), for example.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0170">The adhesive tape according to the present disclosure preferably has a high tensile strength, and is required to be strong enough to be stretched so as not to skew when attached to an adherend or the like and to be peeled off to correct its position. The tensile strength of the adhesive tape is preferably 20 N/25 mm or more, more preferably 30 N/25 mm or more, and further preferably 40 N/25 mm or more. The upper limit of the tensile strength is typically 250 N/25 mm. An adhesive tape that has a high tensile strength can be obtained by using a substrate film that has a tensile strength equivalent to or higher than the target tensile strength of the adhesive tape.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0171">The adhesive tape according to the present disclosure is excellent in both adhesiveness and the holding force, while being flame retardant. Therefore, the adhesive tape has a wide variety of uses including packaging tapes such as flame retardant adhesive tape, flame retardant bonding tape, craft paper-backed tape, OPP tape, and cloth adhesive tape, cellophane adhesive tape for light packaging, foamed tape for automobiles, damping sheet, housing curing tape, soundproofing seal, double-sided tape for fixing carpets, vinyl tape for electrical insulation, outdoor anticorrosion tape, indoor display tape, slip prevention tape, airtight waterproof adhesive tape, medical band aid and other patch base, surgical tape, adhesive bandage, tape for electrical and electronic devices, double-sided tape for optical uses, dicing tape for semiconductors, heat conductive tape, heat resistant tape, and electrically conductive tape, for example.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0172">Also, the adhesive tape can be used particularly for construction uses, for example, for a structure of a house, a member of the structure, a space between members, and can be preferably used as an airtight waterproof adhesive tape.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0167" num="0173">The following describes the present disclosure more specifically using examples, but embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to the following examples as long as such embodiments do not deviate from the gist of the present disclosure.

disclosure in which the epoxy crosslinking agent (b<b>1</b>) and the isocyanate crosslinking agent (b<b>2</b>) were used in combination had excellent flame retardancy.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0227">In contrast, the flame retardancy was insufficient in Comparative Examples 1 and 2 in which only the isocyanate crosslinking agent (b<b>2</b>) was used as the crosslinking agent (B) and in Comparative Examples 3 and 4 in which only the epoxy crosslinking agent (b<b>1</b>) was used as the crosslinking agent (B). Also, the adhesive tape of Comparative Example 1 in which the flame retardant (C) was not used had a high peel strength and the holding force of the adhesive tape did not decrease significantly. However, the holding force decreased significantly in Comparative Example 2 in which the flame retardant (C) was added.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0228">That is, it can be found that an adhesive tape obtained using an adhesive composition that contains an acrylic resin (A) obtained by copolymerizing copolymerization components (a) including a (meth)acrylic acid monomer (a<b>1</b>) and a hydroxyl group-containing monomer (a<b>2</b>), an epoxy crosslinking agent (b<b>1</b>), an isocyanate crosslinking agent (b<b>2</b>), and a flame retardant (C) is excellent in both adhesiveness and the holding force and have well-balanced adhesive properties, while having excellent frame retardancy.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0229">Also, as for all of the adhesive tapes described above, water penetration was not observed in the test for water penetration resistance around nails in accordance with AAMA. Accordingly, the adhesive tapes can be used for a structure of a house, a member of the structure, a space between members, and the like, and can be preferably used as an airtight waterproof adhesive tape.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0230">Although specific embodiments of the present disclosure are described in the Examples, the Examples are merely examples and should not be construed as limiting the present disclosure. Various alterations that are obvious for those skilled in the art are intended to be within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p-0215" num="0231">The adhesive composition according to the present disclosure is excellent in flame retardancy, as well as in both adhesiveness and the holding force. Therefore, the adhesive composition has a wide variety of uses including packaging tapes such as craft paper-backed tape, OPP tape, and cloth adhesive tape, cellophane adhesive tape for light packaging, foamed tape for automobiles, damping sheet, flame retardant adhesive tape, flame retardant bonding tape, housing curing tape, soundproofing seal, double-sided tape for fixing carpets, vinyl tape for electrical insulation, outdoor anticorrosion tape, indoor display tape, slip prevention tape, airtight waterproof adhesive tape, medical band aid and other patch base, surgical tape, adhesive bandage, tape for electrical and electronic devices, double-sided tape for optical uses, dicing tape for semiconductors, heat conductive tape, heat resistant tape, and electrically conductive tape, for example.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230002649A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230002649A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230002649A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230002649A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230002649A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230002649A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230002649A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230002649A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230002649A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002649A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
