Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates generally to a method for changing a structure of a camera module of an electronic device, and more particularly, to a method for changing a structure of the camera module with a change in a structure of the electronic device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various types of electronic devices are under development that are bendable, foldable, or slidable with a plurality of housings.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A camera module is included in the various types of electronic devices. Since camera modules having many fields of view are provided in the electronic devices, the users can obtain images of various fields of view.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The structure of a camera module does not change even if the structure of an electronic device changes, which may make it difficult to change a focal distance or an optical magnification. For example, it is difficult for a lens of the camera module to move due to a space provided within the module. Therefore, when the camera module does not change in size even if the electronic device increases in size, it may be difficult to change the focal distance or the optical magnification.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, for a slidable electronic device, the electronic device increases in size with a movement of a housing of the electronic device. Therefore, even if a display area visible from the outside is extended, a space resulting from the extension cannot be used by the camera module.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A camera module may be connected to each housing of an electronic device, and a structure of the camera module may change together with a change in a structure of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an electronic device is provided that includes a first housing, and a second housing coupled to the first housing in a movable manner with respect to the first housing. The electronic device also includes a flexible display disposed on the first housing and the second housing, and having a structure that is changeable with a movement of the second housing. The electronic device also includes a camera module in which an optical magnification can be set, and a processor electrically coupled to the flexible display and the camera module. The camera module includes a first camera holder connected to the first housing and including a first lens module disposed along a first optical axis, and a second camera holder connected to the second housing and including at least a second lens module disposed along the first optical axis. The second camera holder is movable along the first optical axis with respect to the first camera holder with the movement of the second housing. The processor is configured to identify the movement of the second housing, identify an arrangement state of lens modules that satisfies the identified movement of the second housing and the optical magnification, and move the first lens module and the second lens module to be in the identified arrangement state.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an electronic device is provided that includes a first housing, and a second housing coupled to the first housing in a movable manner with respect to the first housing. The electronic device also includes a flexible display disposed on the first housing and the second housing. A size of an exposed area of the flexible display that is visible from a front face of the electronic device is capable of being changed with a movement of the second housing. The electronic device further includes a camera module in which an optical magnification can be set. The camera module includes a first camera holder connected to the first housing and including a first lens module disposed along a first optical axis, and a second camera holder connected to the second housing and including at least a second lens module disposed along the first optical axis. The second camera holder is movable along the first optical axis with respect to the first camera holder with the movement of the second housing. The electronic device also includes a processor electrically coupled with the flexible display and the camera module. The processor is configured to identify a size of the exposed area of the flexible display, identify a first position corresponding to a current position of the second lens module and third lens module, identify a second position at which the second lens module and the third lens module satisfy a set optical magnification of the camera module, and move the second lens module and third lens module to the second position.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Since a camera module included in an electronic device changes in structure together with a change in a structure of the electronic device, an existing unused space may be utilized, and the electronic device may have an adaptive structure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A length of the camera module may increase as a length of the electronic device increases, thereby further increasing a movement range of lenses disposed inside the camera module.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Since the electronic device identifies the length of the camera module, which is dependent on an extension of the display, a position of lenses corresponding to the changed length of the camera module may be adjusted based on optical magnification and focus.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Advantageous effects that can be obtained in the disclosure are not limited to the aforementioned advantageous effects, and other advantageous effects can be
