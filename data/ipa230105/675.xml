Injections of therapeutic via the eye can be painful, involve some risk of infection, hemorrhage and retinal detachment. Depending on the frequency, intra-ocular injections can be time-consuming for both patient and physician. Consequently, in at least some instances the drug may be administered less often than the prescribed frequency resulting in sub-optimal treatment benefit. Further, bolus intra-ocular injections may not provide the ideal pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. A bolus injection of drug into the vitreous humor of a patient can result in a peak drug concentration several times higher than the desired therapeutic amount and then before the patient is able to get the next injection drop to a drug concentration that is far below therapeutic effectiveness.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an aspect, described is a device for injecting a therapeutic agent into an ocular implant, the implant being at least partially implanted in an eye, the implant further providing at least a first resistance to outflow of therapeutic agent into the eye. The device includes an injection lumen configured to provide a pathway for injecting the therapeutic agent into the ocular implant; an outlet lumen configured to provide a pathway through which pre-existing fluid in the ocular implant exits the ocular implant; and a collection chamber fluidly coupled to the outlet lumen. The collection chamber is configured to receive the pre-existing fluid that exits the ocular implant via the outlet lumen. The collection chamber provides a first fluid outflow resistance and a second fluid outflow resistance. The first fluid outflow resistance is lower than the first resistance to outflow of the implant, and the second fluid outflow resistance is greater than a force imparted onto the implant by intraocular pressure of the eye. Injection of therapeutic agent into the ocular implant via the injection lumen causes the pre-existing fluid to exit the ocular implant and enter the collection chamber via the outlet lumen and causes a second pre-existing fluid to displace from the collection chamber.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The implant can be expandable once implanted in the eye from a first, collapsed configuration to a second, enlarged configuration. A first porous structure operatively coupled to the collection chamber can provide the first fluid outflow resistance and the second fluid outflow resistance. The first porous structure operatively coupled to the collection chamber can have the first fluid outflow resistance to gas outflow and the second fluid outflow resistance to liquid outflow. The implant can include a second porous structure that provides the first resistance to outflow. The first fluid outflow resistance of the first porous structure of the collection chamber can be less than the first resistance provided by the second porous structure of the implant. The second fluid outflow resistance of the first porous structure of the collection chamber can be greater than the first resistance of the implant. The second pre-existing fluid can be a gas. The gas can be air. The air can be under vacuum. The second pre-existing fluid can be displaced from the collection chamber via a vent. The second pre-existing fluid can be displaced from the collection chamber via a valve. The implant can be expandable once implanted in the eye from a first, collapsed configuration to a second, enlarged configuration. The first porous structure of the collection chamber can prevent collapse of the implant away from the second, enlarged configuration after filling.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The first porous structure of the collection chamber can be a hydrophobic membrane, a fabric, a porous fabric, a semipermeable membrane, an air permeable material, a moisture vapor transfer waterproof fabric, a hydrophilic porous material, or a porous sintered material. The first porous structure of the collection chamber can be positioned within an annular element positioned near an upper end of the collection chamber. The annular element can form a fixed upper limit of the collection chamber. The collection chamber can be concentric with a longitudinal axis of the injection lumen. The collection chamber can be offset relative to a longitudinal axis of the injection lumen. The collection chamber can be tubular. The collection chamber can extend between an opening into the tubular collection chamber and terminate at the second porous structure. The tubular structure can have a uniform inner diameter over a length of the tubular structure. The tubular structure can have an inner diameter that enlarges proximally to a second inner diameter. The tubular structure can be coiled. The coiled tubular structure can provide a uniform fill pattern that minimizes trapping of the second pre-existing fluid displaced from the collection chamber.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some variations, one or more of the following can optionally be included in any feasible combination in the above methods, apparatus, devices, and systems. More details of the devices, systems, and methods are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

It is to be understood that devices described herein may include features not necessarily depicted in each figure.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Described herein are implantable devices, systems and methods of use for the delivery of one or more therapeutics for the treatment of diseases and methods and apparatus to exchange a fluid of the implantable device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The devices and systems described herein maximize reservoir volume and capacity while minimizing overall device invasiveness and impact on eye anatomy and vision. In some implementations, the devices described herein include an expandable reservoir that can be compressed into a first configuration for minimally-invasive delivery into the eye, for example, through the sclera and expanded into a second, enlarged configuration upon filling with therapeutic agent following implantation in the eye. When in the second configuration, the reservoir can avoid interfering with the visual axis of the eye as well as remain a safe distance away from certain anatomical structures of the eye so as to avoid damage and impacting vision. As will be described herein, in some implementations the expandable reservoir in the expanded configuration takes on a shape that is eccentric, asymmetrical, or otherwise off-set from the axis of placement of the device into the eye tissue, for example an axis of insertion through the sclera. This off-set can result in a majority of the expanded volume of the reservoir being directed away from certain critical structures of the anterior segment of the eye, for example, the lens, the ciliary body, the choroid, as well as the sclera and surrounding internal tissue layers through which the device was inserted. The expandable reservoir in the expanded configuration can also remain symmetrical or coaxial with a central axis of the device, but can be shaped such that at least a portion of the device is curved, angled, or otherwise off-set relative to the axis of insertion. For example, the expanded reservoir can be shaped into an arc or other curvilinear shape relative to the axis of insertion. Alternatively, the expanded reservoir can be shaped to form an angle relative to the axis of insertion. In these implementations, the overall length of the device can be increased while still remaining outside the visual axis or significantly impacting the visual field. These and other features of the devices described herein will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">After an amount of time, the fluid of the implantable device may be replaced exchanged, or the device otherwise refilled to provide additional amounts of therapeutic agent to extend the therapy. Described herein are apparatus and methods to place therapeutic fluids in a device already implanted in the eye. The apparatus provides improved sampling and replacement of the fluid with optimum exchange efficiency, little or no leakage resulting from the pressure of the injection, and a clinically acceptable exchange time.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It should also be appreciated that the devices and systems described herein can be positioned in many locations of the eye and need not be implanted specifically as shown in the figures or as described herein. The devices and systems described herein can be used to deliver therapeutic agent(s) for an extended period of time to one or more of the following tissues: intraocular, intravascular, intraarticular, intrathecal, pericardial, intraluminal and intraperitoneal. Although specific reference is made below to the delivery of treatments to the eye, it also should be appreciated that medical conditions besides ocular conditions can be treated with the devices and systems described herein. For example, the devices and systems can deliver treatments for inflammation, infection, and cancerous growths. Any number of drug combinations can be delivered using any of the devices and systems described herein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The materials, compounds, compositions, articles, and methods described herein may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of specific aspects of the disclosed subject matter and the Examples included therein.

The eye <b>10</b> is generally spherical and is covered on the outside by the sclera <b>24</b>. The bulk of the eye <b>10</b> is filled and supported by the vitreous body <b>30</b> (referred to herein as vitreous humor or just vitreous), a clear, jelly-like substance disposed between the lens <b>22</b> and the retina <b>26</b>. The retina <b>26</b> lines the inside posterior segment of the eye <b>10</b> and includes the macula <b>32</b>. The retina <b>26</b> registers the light and sends signals to the brain via the optic nerve. The fovea centralis is the part of the eye located in the center of the macula <b>32</b> of the retina <b>26</b> and is the region responsible for sharp central vision, for example in order to read or drive. An imaginary line passing from the midpoint of the visual field to the fovea centralis is called the visual axis <b>27</b>. The hypothetical straight line passing through the centers of curvature of the front and back surfaces of the lens <b>22</b> is the optic axis <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The elastic lens <b>22</b> is located near the front of the eye <b>10</b>. The lens <b>22</b> provides adjustment of focus and is suspended within a capsular bag from the ciliary body <b>20</b>, which contains the muscles that change the focal length of the lens <b>22</b>. A volume in front of the lens <b>22</b> is divided into two by the iris <b>18</b>, which controls the aperture of the lens <b>22</b> and the amount of light striking the retina <b>26</b>. The pupil is a hole in the center of the iris <b>18</b> through which light entering anteriorly passes. The volume between the iris <b>18</b> and the lens <b>22</b> is the posterior chamber. The volume between the iris <b>18</b> and the cornea <b>12</b> is the anterior chamber. Both chambers are filled with a clear liquid known as aqueous humor.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The cornea <b>12</b> extends to and connects with the sclera <b>24</b> at a location called the limbus <b>14</b> of the eye. The conjunctiva <b>16</b> of the eye is disposed over the sclera <b>24</b> and the Tenon's capsule extends between the conjunctiva <b>16</b> and the sclera <b>24</b>. The eye <b>10</b> also includes a vascular tissue layer called the choroid <b>28</b> that is disposed between a portion of the sclera <b>24</b> and the retina <b>26</b>. The ciliary body <b>20</b> is continuous with the base of the iris <b>18</b> and is divided anatomically into pars plica and pars plana <b>25</b>, a posterior flat area approximately 4 mm long.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The devices described herein can be positioned in many locations of the eye <b>10</b>, for example in the pars plana region away from tendon of the superior rectus muscle and one or more of posterior to the tendon, anterior to the tendon, under the tendon, or with nasal or temporal placement of the therapeutic device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the devices described herein can be positioned along an axis of insertion A through the sclera <b>24</b> in the pars plana region and expanded such that the device avoids interfering with the visual field, and in particular, the visual and optic axes <b>27</b>, <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Surgical placement of trans-scleral ocular implants designed to penetrate the globe such that certain regions of the implant occupy supra-scleral, trans-scleral, sub-scleral, and intravitreal aspects of the ocular anatomy in the pars plana region involves a risk of acute vitreous hemorrhage (VH) following surgery. The devices described herein incorporate one or more features that mitigate the risk of vitreous hemorrhage at the time of surgical implantation and lead to improved healing following surgery.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Treatment Devices</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The devices described herein are referred to as drug delivery devices, treatment devices, therapeutic devices, port delivery systems, and the like. It should be appreciated that these terms are used interchangeably herein and are not intended to be limiting to a particular implementation of device over another. The devices and systems described herein can incorporate any of a variety of features described herein and the elements or features of one implementation of a device and system described herein can be incorporated alternatively or in combination with elements or features of another implementation of a device and system described herein as well as the various implants and features described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,399,006; 8,623,395; PCT Pat. Publication No. WO 2012/019136; PCT Pat. Publication No. WO 2012/019047; PCT Pat.

For the sake of brevity, explicit descriptions of each of those combinations may be omitted although the various combinations are to be considered herein. For example, the devices described herein can include non-rigid walled reservoirs configured to enlarge following implantation such as by filling with treatment solution. The expandable reservoirs described herein may be used with any of the various implementations of a device or system. Further, reference to an expandable reservoir can include a reservoir wall that is pliable and able to be folded, compressed, contracted, etc. into a low profile configuration that is suitable for insertion into the eye in a manner that minimizes the size of penetration. The wall of an expandable reservoir may be pliable or flexible, but need not be stretchy or elastomeric in order to enlarge in size to hold the treatment solution. The expandable reservoir can include a reservoir wall that tents, unfolds, expands, stretches, or otherwise enlarges the overall cross-sectional size of the reservoir compared to the low profile configuration suitable for insertion. It should be appreciated that the terms unfold, expand, enlarge, and other terms used to refer to this shape change of the reservoirs described herein may be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Additionally, described herein are different methods for implantation and access of the devices. The various implants can be implanted, removed, filled, refilled, aspirated, and/or flushed, etc. according to a variety of different methods and using a variety of different devices and systems. Provided are some representative descriptions of how the various devices may be implanted and accessed, however, for the sake of brevity explicit descriptions of each method with respect to each implant or system may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The porous structures (also referred to herein as a drug release mechanism, drug release element, release control element, RCE, or frit) as described herein can be used with a number of various different implantable therapeutic devices including one or more of those devices described U.S. Pat.

The device <b>100</b> can include a proximal retention structure <b>105</b> having a smooth protrusion or flange element <b>110</b>, a porous drug release element <b>120</b>, and an expandable reservoir <b>130</b>. An access port <b>111</b> can extend through the retention structure <b>105</b> and a penetrable element <b>115</b> can be positioned within at least a portion of the access port <b>111</b>. The penetrable element <b>115</b> and the access port <b>111</b> allow for access to an inner volume of the reservoir <b>130</b>, for example, to fill, refill, aspirate, and/or flush materials in the reservoir <b>130</b>. In some implementations, the access port <b>111</b> can be formed by an opening through the retention structure <b>105</b> into the reservoir <b>130</b> and covered by a penetrable material and/or the penetrable element <b>115</b>. The penetrable element <b>115</b> can be a septum configured to be penetrated and resealed such that material does not leak out of the reservoir <b>130</b> following penetration of the material during in situ refilling of the reservoir <b>130</b>. Alternatively, one or more regions of the flange element <b>110</b> itself can be formed of a penetrable material.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The drug release element <b>120</b> can be positioned in a variety of locations within the device <b>100</b> such that the volume of the reservoir <b>130</b> is in fluid communication with the drug release element <b>120</b>. For example, the drug release element <b>120</b> can be positioned near a distal end region of the device <b>100</b> such as within an outlet <b>125</b> of the device <b>100</b>, for release of the one or more therapeutic agents contained within the reservoir <b>130</b> into the eye. The drug release element <b>120</b> can also be positioned in a region of the device proximal of the distal end region. The drug release element <b>120</b> can also be positioned towards a particular area to be treated, such as the retina.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The device <b>100</b> can be implanted in the eye such that at least a portion of the device <b>100</b>, for example the reservoir <b>130</b>, the drug release element <b>120</b> and one or more outlets <b>125</b>, are positioned intraocularly. In some implementations, the device <b>100</b> can be positioned so as to extend through the sclera <b>24</b> from the pars plana region so as to release the therapeutic agent into the vitreous body <b>30</b>. As mentioned above, the device <b>100</b> can be positioned in the eye along an axis of insertion A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The flange element <b>110</b> can form a smooth protrusion configured for placement along the sclera <b>24</b>. The flange element <b>110</b> can remain generally external to the eye to aid in retention of the device <b>100</b> while the remainder of the device <b>100</b> is at least partially positioned intraocularly. The flange element <b>110</b> can have any of a variety of shapes, for example, oval, ovoid, elliptical, circular, or other shape as will be discussed in more detail below. In some implementations, the flange element <b>110</b> can be generally curved so as to have a contour along a surface of a sphere. An outer-facing surface <b>112</b> of the flange element <b>110</b> can have a convex shape and an inner-facing surface <b>113</b> can have a concave shape such that the flange element <b>110</b> can better conform to the curvature of the eye. In other implementations, the flange element <b>110</b> can be generally flat. The edges of the flange element <b>110</b> can be generally smooth and rounded. In some implementations, when the flange element <b>110</b> is positioned such that the inner-facing surface <b>113</b> of the flange element <b>110</b> can contact the sclera <b>24</b> and the outer-facing surface <b>112</b> of the flange element <b>110</b> can be positioned under the conjunctiva <b>16</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) such that the conjunctiva <b>16</b> covers the outer-facing surface <b>112</b> of the flange element <b>110</b> and protects the therapeutic device <b>100</b>. The conjunctiva <b>16</b> covering the outer-facing surface <b>112</b> of the flange element <b>110</b> can allow access to the device <b>100</b> while decreasing the risk of infection to the patient. When the therapeutic agent is inserted or injected into the device <b>100</b> through the access port of the flange element <b>110</b>, the conjunctiva <b>16</b> may be lifted away, incised, or punctured with a needle to access the therapeutic device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the retention structure <b>105</b> can include the proximal flange element <b>110</b> as well as a neck positioned adjacent the flange element <b>110</b>. The neck can include a proximal region <b>116</b> and a distal extension <b>117</b>. The proximal region <b>116</b> of the neck can be sized along a cross-section to fit a penetration site through the sclera <b>24</b>, such as an incision and/or a puncture. For example, the proximal region <b>116</b> can be narrowed relative to the flange element <b>110</b> to fit more snugly within the penetration site in the sclera <b>24</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a first cross-sectional view of the narrowed proximal region <b>116</b> of the neck. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a second cross-sectional view of the narrowed proximal region <b>116</b> of the neck taken along a plane orthogonal to the first cross-sectional view. The proximal region <b>116</b> of the neck can have a first cross-sectional distance across when taken along a first plane and a second cross-sectional distance across when the cross-section is taken along a second, orthogonal plane and the first cross-sectional distance can be different from the second cross-sectional distance.

In some implementations, the cross-sectional shape of the proximal region <b>116</b> of the neck can complement a shape of the incision, puncture or other penetration site through which the device <b>100</b> is inserted. The cross-sectional shape of the proximal region <b>116</b> of the neck can be elongated, including but not limited to one of a lentoid, oval, and ellipse shape. In some implementations, the cross-sectional shape of the proximal region <b>116</b> of the neck is a first curve along a first axis and a second curve along a second axis that is different from the first curve.

The distal extension <b>117</b> can be arranged coaxial with the insertion axis A of the device and can extend a distance away from the proximal portion <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The distal extension <b>117</b> of the neck can provide stabilization to the penetrable region of the device <b>100</b> while eliminating contact between the expandable reservoir <b>130</b> and inner surfaces of the eye adjacent the proximal end of the device <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an implementation of a device <b>100</b> having a reservoir <b>130</b> that in the expanded configuration makes contact with one or more internal surfaces of the eye adjacent the proximal end of the device <b>100</b>. The proximal end of the reservoir <b>130</b> can wedge against the internal tissue surfaces surrounding the penetration site through the sclera <b>24</b> and can act to stabilize the penetrable region of the device <b>100</b>. In some implementations, contact between the reservoir <b>130</b> and the internal tissue surfaces is prevented to avoid irritation and/or damage of the delicate tissues of the eye. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the proximal end of the reservoir <b>130</b> in the expanded configuration can be separated or off-set a distance D&#x2032; from one or more internal tissue surfaces surrounding the penetration site. The distal extension <b>117</b> of the neck can aid in preventing contact between portions of the device <b>100</b> and tissues adjacent the penetration site while still providing stabilization to the penetrable region of the device <b>100</b>. For example, the distal extension <b>117</b> of the neck can be sufficiently long and contoured such that the reservoir <b>130</b> of the device is located a distance away from the adjacent tissue layers of the penetration site even when the reservoir <b>130</b> is in the expanded configuration. In some implementations, the distal extension <b>117</b> of the neck has a length and contour configured to prevent any portion of the device <b>100</b> distal to the extension <b>117</b> from contacting any of the internal structures of the eye except the vitreous <b>30</b> within which it is implanted. In some implementations, upon implantation and expansion of the device <b>100</b> in the eye, the flange element <b>110</b> and the proximal region <b>116</b> of the neck come into contact with the tissue layers of the eye (e.g. conjunctiva, sclera, ciliary body, and/or choroid. The distally extending portions of the device <b>100</b>, such as the reservoir <b>130</b>, the drug release element <b>120</b>, and distal portions of the extension <b>117</b>, may avoid contact with the tissue layers of the eye and come into contact only with the vitreous <b>30</b>. The shape of the reservoir <b>130</b> in the expanded configuration can also aid in preventing this contact as will be discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As mentioned above, the devices described herein can include one or more drug release elements <b>120</b>. The drug release element <b>120</b> can be positioned adjacent and/or within the one or more outlets <b>125</b> such that the drug release element <b>120</b> can control or regulate the delivery of the one or more therapeutic agents from the reservoir <b>130</b> through the one or more outlets <b>125</b>. The contents of the reservoir <b>130</b> can be delivered gradually via diffusion rather than expelled as a fluid stream. In some implementations, the one or more drug release elements <b>120</b> can be disposed within a region of the reservoir <b>130</b>, such as a distal end region, or a region proximal to the distal end region of the device. In some implementations, the drug release element <b>120</b> can be a covering or lining having a particular porosity to the substance to be delivered and can be used to provide a particular rate of release of the substance. The drug release element <b>120</b> can be a release control element, including but not limited to a wicking material, permeable silicone, packed bed, small porous structure or a porous frit, multiple porous coatings, nanocoatings, rate-limiting membranes, matrix material, a sintered porous frit, a permeable membrane, a semi-permeable membrane, a capillary tube or a tortuous channel, nano-structures, nano-channels, sintered nanoparticles and the like. The drug release element <b>120</b> can have a porosity, a cross-sectional area, and a thickness to release the one or more therapeutic agents for an extended time from the reservoir. The porous material of the drug release element <b>120</b> can have a porosity corresponding to a fraction of void space formed by channels extending through the material. The void space formed can be between about 3% to about 70%, between about 5% to about 10%, between about 10% to about 25%, or between about 15% to about 20%, or any other fraction of void space. The drug release element <b>120</b> can be selected from any of the release control elements described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 8,277,830, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As mentioned above, the devices described herein include a reservoir <b>130</b> configured to expand, unfold, or otherwise enlarge from a generally minimally-invasive insertion configuration to an expanded configuration with an increased volume. The insertion configuration of the devices described herein has a three-dimensional shape that is relatively low profile such that the device <b>100</b> can be inserted at least partially into the eye using a small gauge device, or directly into the eye through a small incision. Many of the devices described herein can be inserted using an incision or puncture that is minimally-invasive, for example in a range of about 1 mm to about 5 mm. In some implementations, the incision is a 3.2 mm incision. It should also be appreciated that in some implementations, the device <b>100</b> can have column strength sufficient to permit the device <b>100</b> to pierce through eye tissue without an internal structural support member or members. The device can be inserted through the sclera <b>24</b> without a prior incision or puncture having been made in the eye. For example, the device can be inserted using a needle cannula member extending through an interior of the device and the drug release element <b>120</b> pressed or secured inside at a distal tip of the cannula member.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Generally, when in the insertion configuration the portion of the device <b>100</b> configured to penetrate the eye (e.g. the reservoir <b>130</b>) can have a smaller cross-sectional diameter compared to the cross-sectional diameter of the portion of the device <b>100</b> configured to remain external to the eye (e.g. the flange element <b>110</b>). In some implementations, the cross-sectional diameter of the reservoir <b>130</b> (e.g. collapsed around a central core element <b>135</b> as will be described in more detail below) in the insertion configuration can be about 1.3 mm to about 1.5 mm in diameter, the diameter of the proximal portion <b>116</b> of the neck can be about 2.7 mm long and about 1.5 mm wide, and the flange element <b>110</b> can be about 4.5 mm long and about 3.8 mm wide. In some implementations, the device <b>100</b> can be approximately 25 gauge such that the device <b>100</b> can be inserted through a needle bore. In this implementation, the flange element <b>110</b> can be of a resilient material (such as shape memory or a flexible silicone) such that it can be housed in the needle bore during implantation and released out the distal end of the needle bore at which point the flange element <b>110</b> can retake its shape. Further, the cross-sectional shape of the eye-penetrating portion of the device <b>100</b> when in the insertion configuration can vary including circular, oval, or other cross-sectional shape. Also, when in the insertion configuration the device <b>100</b> can have a substantially uniform diameter along its entire length or the cross-sectional dimension and shape can change along the length of the device <b>100</b>. In some implementations, the shape of the device <b>100</b> in the insertion configuration can be selected to facilitate easy insertion into the eye. For example, the device <b>100</b> can be tapered from the proximal end region to the distal end region.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The length of the device <b>100</b> can vary depending on where and how the device <b>100</b> is to be implanted in the eye. Generally, the length is selected so as not to impact or enter the central visual field or cross the visual axis <b>27</b> of the eye upon implantation and filling of the device <b>100</b>. In some implementations, the total length of the device can be between about 2 mm to about 10 mm. In some implementations, the total length of the device can be between about 3 mm to about 7 mm. In some implementations, the length of the intraocular region of the device is about 4 mm to about 5 mm long.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The reservoir <b>130</b> of the devices described herein can enlarge into a particular contour or shape that can maximize its overall capacity while minimizing its impact on the internal eye anatomy. The insertion configuration of the reservoir <b>130</b> can have a first three-dimensional shape and the expanded configuration can have a second three-dimensional shape that is different from the first. Again with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the reservoir <b>130</b> in the expanded configuration can be generally symmetrical relative to the insertion axis A. In this implementation, both the first three-dimensional shape and the second three-dimensional shape can be generally concentric with the longitudinal axis of the device <b>100</b> and the insertion axis A. In another implementation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the reservoir can be configured to enlarge from an insertion configuration having a first three-dimensional shape to an expanded configuration having a second three-dimensional shape, wherein the second three-dimensional shape is eccentrically positioned or generally asymmetrical relative to the insertion axis A. In this implementation, the first three-dimensional shape can be generally concentric with the insertion axis A and the second three-dimensional shape can be eccentric with the insertion axis A. Depending on the folding approach used to obtain the low profile insertion configuration of the reservoir, the first three-dimensional shape of the symmetrical or eccentric reservoirs may be offset as opposed to generally concentric. The first three-dimensional shape of the generally symmetrical reservoir <b>130</b> may be slightly offset from the longitudinal axis of the device and the insertion axis A such that even though the reservoir expands into a generally symmetrical second three-dimensional shape, the first three-dimensional shape is somewhat non-concentric. The same can be true for the eccentrically positioned reservoir <b>130</b>. The first three-dimensional shape may depend on the overall shape of the reservoir <b>130</b> as well as on the folding approach used to obtain the low profile insertion configuration and can be somewhat non-concentric.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a top down view of a device <b>100</b> and illustrates an axis of insertion A. A plane can be drawn parallel to the axis of insertion A and orthogonal to the surface of the sclera <b>24</b> through which the device is inserted. In some implementations, more of the expanded volume of the reservoir <b>130</b> can be located on a first side of this plane than on the opposite side of this plane such that the expanded volume on the first side extends towards a posterior region of the eye or enlarges away from the lens <b>22</b> of the eye such that contact with the lens <b>22</b> is mitigated (see, e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). Thus, a portion of the overall volume of the reservoir <b>130</b> in the expanded configuration enlarged away from the lens of the eye and is greater than the remaining portion of the reservoir <b>130</b> volume. Further, the reservoir <b>130</b> can enlarge such that a majority of the reservoir volume extends away from the inner surface of the sclera through which the device was inserted such that the expanded reservoir <b>130</b> avoids contacting interior surfaces of the eye that can contribute to choroidal effusions, hemorrhage or cause other unintentional contact, damage or irritation between the eye and the device <b>100</b>, such as with the ciliary body or choroid. Further, when in the expanded configuration the entire reservoir <b>130</b> can remain generally outside the central visual field, such as outside the visual axis of the eye.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The expandability of the reservoir <b>130</b> from a low profile dimension for insertion to an expanded profile dimension after insertion allows for the device to be inserted in a minimally-invasive manner and also have an increased reservoir capacity. This increased reservoir capacity, in turn, increases the duration of drug delivery from the device for a given release control element such that the device <b>100</b> need not be refilled as frequently, and/or can reach the targeted therapeutic concentration of drug in the eye. In some implementations, the volume of the reservoir <b>130</b> can be between about 0.5 &#x3bc;L to about 100 &#x3bc;L. In some implementations, the volume of the reservoir <b>130</b> can be at least about 1 &#x3bc;L, 2 &#x3bc;L, 3 &#x3bc;L, 4 &#x3bc;L, 5 &#x3bc;L, 10 &#x3bc;L, 15 &#x3bc;L, 20 &#x3bc;L, 25 &#x3bc;L, 30 &#x3bc;L, 35 &#x3bc;L, 40 &#x3bc;L, 45 &#x3bc;L, 50 &#x3bc;L, 55 &#x3bc;L, 60 &#x3bc;L, 65 &#x3bc;L, 70 &#x3bc;L, 75 &#x3bc;L, 80 &#x3bc;L, 85 &#x3bc;L, 90 &#x3bc;L, 95 &#x3bc;L, 96 &#x3bc;L, 97 &#x3bc;L, 98 &#x3bc;L, 99 &#x3bc;L, 100 &#x3bc;L, 105 &#x3bc;L, 110 &#x3bc;L, 115 &#x3bc;L, 120 &#x3bc;L, 125 &#x3bc;L, or other volume.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">An outer wall of the reservoir <b>130</b> can be formed of a substantially non-compliant material that is expandable yet rigid and/or non-distensible material. As such, the reservoir <b>130</b> can be filled into the expanded configuration, but the material of the reservoir <b>130</b> is configured to maintain its shape and does not stretch so as to avoid an unintentional driving force created by the memory of the wall material of the reservoir <b>130</b>. In other implementations, the outer wall of the reservoir <b>130</b> can be a compliant material such that a controllable pressure can be provided by the compliant wall of the reservoir <b>130</b> up to the point of pressure equalization, for example, to provide a small initial boost of drug delivery from the reservoir after filling. Examples of expandable, non-distensible, substantially non-compliant materials are provided herein, including but not limited to PET, Nylon, and acrylics. Examples of expandable, compliant materials are also provided herein, including but not limited to silicone, urethane, and acrylics.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some implementations, the volume of the reservoir <b>130</b> and the shape of the reservoir <b>130</b> in the expanded configuration are selected to maximize the payload capacity as well as maximizing the distance away from the lens <b>22</b> and/or the sclera <b>24</b> adjacent the penetration site. For example, in some implementations, the volume of the reservoir <b>130</b> can be 60 &#x3bc;L and the shape of the reservoir <b>130</b> in the expanded configuration can be D-shaped, C-shaped, elliptical, eccentric, or other shape that can extend away from the insertion axis A of the device (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). Thus, compared to a symmetrically expanded reservoir of smaller capacity, the eccentric or asymmetrically expanded reservoir <b>130</b> can maintain a greater distance D away from the lens <b>22</b>. The reservoir <b>130</b> in the expanded configuration also can be tapered on a proximal end to maximize the distance D&#x2032; the expanded reservoir <b>130</b> is off-set from the sclera <b>24</b> through which the device extends. Maintaining a greater distance D&#x2032; helps to prevent contact between the expanded reservoir <b>130</b>, for example the proximal end of the expanded reservoir <b>130</b>, and the internal tissue surfaces surrounding the penetration site and other neighboring tissue layers of the eye such as the retina <b>26</b>, choroid <b>28</b>, sclera <b>24</b>, ciliary body <b>20</b>, and/or the lens <b>22</b>. The proximal tapering of the reservoir <b>130</b> also allows for improved removal of the device <b>100</b> from the eye. The shape of the reservoir <b>130</b> can alternatively or additional be tapered on a distal end. A distal end taper can further help the device to avoid entering the visual axis and avoid contact with certain internal structures such as the lens. Further, a smooth and gradual transition to the end of the device can also improve the ease of insertion as will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the devices described herein can include a central core element <b>135</b> extending between the proximal end region of the device <b>100</b> and the distal end region of the device <b>100</b>. The central core element <b>135</b> can be a generally cylindrical and relatively rigid element positioned around a longitudinal axis of the device <b>100</b> such that it is generally concentric with the axis of insertion A. The central core element <b>135</b> can include an inner lumen <b>137</b> and one or more openings <b>139</b> extending through a wall of the central core element <b>135</b>. In some implementations, the central core element <b>135</b> can include an inlet <b>138</b> on a proximal end positioned relative to the penetrable element <b>115</b> in the access portion to receive material injected into the device, which will be described in more detail below. The inlet <b>138</b> or a portion of the central core element <b>135</b> near the inlet <b>138</b> can be surrounded by the distal extension <b>117</b> of the retention structure <b>105</b>. The central core element <b>135</b> can also include an outlet located a distance away from the inlet <b>138</b> that can form the outlet <b>125</b> from the device <b>100</b>, for example near a distal end of the central core element <b>135</b>. The drug release element <b>120</b> can be positioned within the outlet such that therapeutic agent can be released from the reservoir <b>130</b> into the eye. The central core element <b>135</b> can protect the material of the reservoir <b>130</b> from unintended penetration or puncture. For example, during filling a portion of the central core element <b>135</b> near the inlet <b>138</b> can receive a fill needle configured to inject material into the device. The central core element <b>135</b> can be formed of a material that is relatively rigid and less likely to snag on the sharp tip of the fill needle compared to the substantially non-compliant yet thinner material of the reservoir <b>130</b>. Thus, the rigid core element <b>135</b> can prevent penetration of reservoir material near the inlet <b>138</b> by the needle during filling. The core element <b>135</b> can also aid in surgical control during insertion and/or removal by providing a degree of rigidity along the longitudinal axis A of the device.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The one or more openings <b>139</b> in the wall of the central core element <b>135</b> allow for fluid communication between the inner lumen <b>137</b> of the central core element <b>135</b> and the reservoir <b>130</b>. Material introduced through the penetrable element <b>115</b> such as via a delivery element can be injected within the lumen <b>137</b> and the flow of fluid directed through the one or more openings <b>139</b> into the reservoir <b>130</b>. The introduction of material into the reservoir <b>130</b> expands the inner volume of the reservoir <b>130</b> and causes the pliable walls of the reservoir <b>130</b> to move away from the longitudinal axis of the device and/or move away from the central core element <b>135</b>. Expansion of the reservoir volume changes the reservoir from the initial, insertion configuration to the expanded configuration, which will be described in more detail below. Optimizing the size of the one or more openings <b>139</b> in relation to the diameter of the inner lumen <b>137</b> can help to direct flow through the central core element <b>135</b> through the one or more openings <b>139</b> into the reservoir <b>130</b>. The size and number of the one or more openings <b>139</b> can vary. In some implementations, the opening(s) <b>139</b> through the wall of the central core element <b>135</b> are smaller in diameter than an outer diameter of the insertion tool <b>1400</b> and/or an outer diameter of the needle <b>270</b> of the exchange needle apparatus <b>200</b>. This prevents the insertion tool <b>1400</b> or needle <b>270</b> from inadvertently inserting through the opening(s) <b>139</b>. The smaller size openings <b>139</b> can protect against punctures or other damage to the flexible reservoir <b>130</b> from the insertion tool <b>1400</b> and/or the tip <b>212</b> of the needle <b>270</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). The smaller size of the one or more openings <b>139</b> can be compensated for by increasing the number of openings <b>139</b> present. In some implementations, the central core element <b>135</b> can have at least about 2 openings <b>139</b>, at least about 10 openings <b>139</b>, at least about 20, 30, 40, 50, up to about 100 openings <b>139</b> extending through the wall of the central core element <b>135</b>. In some implementations, at least about 1000 openings <b>139</b> can extend through the wall of the central core element <b>135</b>. The openings <b>139</b> can be less than 150 um openings. In some implementations, the openings <b>139</b> can be about 10 um up to about 150 um. The smaller and more numerous openings <b>139</b> prevent the tip <b>212</b> of the needle <b>270</b> or the insertion tool <b>1400</b> from protruding through opening(s) <b>139</b> in the wall of the central core <b>135</b> during use. The opening(s) <b>139</b> can be any geometric shape (or combinations of shapes) and distributed in any arrangement or pattern in the wall of the central core <b>135</b>. A few specific configurations are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b></figref>, and <b>11</b> for exemplary purposes only. Many other configurations are possible as understood by those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The central core element <b>135</b> can also include a flow director <b>140</b> to facilitate filling/refilling of the reservoir <b>130</b> and increase efficiency of filling/refilling (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some implementations, the flow director <b>140</b> can include a first cylindrical region <b>142</b> coupled to a second cylindrical region <b>144</b> by a funnel shaped region <b>146</b> to direct flow through the one or more openings <b>139</b>. The first cylindrical region <b>142</b> can be positioned proximal to the second cylindrical region <b>144</b> the second cylindrical region <b>144</b>. The first cylindrical region <b>142</b> can have a larger cross-sectional diameter than the second cylindrical region <b>144</b>. Further, the one or more openings <b>139</b> of the flow director <b>140</b> can be smaller in size than in an implementation of the device without a flow director <b>140</b>. In another implementation, the flow director <b>140</b> positioned within the inner lumen <b>137</b> of the central core element <b>135</b> can be a penetrable barrier, for example an element through which a delivery element extends (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). In this implementation, the flow director <b>140</b> can be a silicone element that has an outer diameter sized and shaped to wedge within the inner lumen <b>137</b> of the core element <b>135</b>. For example, the flow director <b>140</b> that is a penetrable element can be penetrated by a fill/refill needle or other delivery element such that the device <b>100</b> can be filled/refilled from the bottom up. The material can be initially injected in a distal end region of the device until the proximal end region of the device is also filled and expanded. The fill/refill needle is described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The devices described herein having a flow director <b>140</b> or other core structure with optimized openings <b>139</b> can leverage paths of least resistance for evacuation of pre-existing materials from the device being filled. This, in turn, can improve refill efficiency at lower refill volumes for example, by preventing backflow and/or directing bottom-up or bottom-first filling. Bottom-up filling can be improved, even without the presence of a flow director, by leveraging fluid density differences of the liquids being exchanged. The fluid density of the new solution being added to a device can be greater than the fluid density of the pre-existing material in a device. Temperature differences between the liquids being exchanged impact fluid density as well and can be leveraged to improve exchange efficiency in bottom-up filling. For example, the temperature of the pre-existing material in the device is at body temperature whereas the temperature of the new solution can be at room temperature or colder temperatures such that it is denser compared to the warmer material in the device. These density differences allow for bottom-up filling/exchange to occur in a more efficient manner with less mixing. Additionally or alternatively, high volume exchange can be used to flush and/or refill the device with a new solution.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some implementations, implant orientation and/or tilt angle during refilling can improve the refill efficiency of the reservoir, particularly where there is a solution density difference between the fluid being injected and the contents of the implant remaining in the reservoir prior to refill. The patient can be positioned during a refill procedure to maintain the implant reservoir (or a majority of the reservoir) below the level of the proximal openings in the implant core (i.e. the openings nearest the septum). The refill of the implant can be performed similarly as an intravitreal injection. The needle path penetration techniques used is generally along the longitudinal axis of the implant to avoid snagging the needle tip on the inner core. The implant can be positioned through the sclera with the elongate cross-sectional profile aligned with an incision along the pars plana so as to extend from the pars plana region into the vitreous. Refill of the implant can be performed by inserting the refill needle along the longitudinal axis of the device. The patient having an implant extending through the sclera of an eye such that the reservoir positioned within the vitreous can be oriented relative to gravity to maintain a majority of the reservoir below the level of the proximal openings in the core to achieve the greatest refill efficiency.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some implementations, controlled aspiration of the reservoir <b>130</b> can be used to improve refill efficiency. Aspiration can improve refill efficiency without relying on fluid density differences, high volume exchange, and/or a flow director. For example, aspiration can be applied to remove material from the reservoir chamber prior to filling the device with new solution. The new solution can be injected into the reservoir chamber emptied by aspiration, such as by applying positive pressure through an injection lumen. Optionally or additionally, the new solution can be drawn into the reservoir chamber as a result of the aspiration used to evacuate the pre-existing material from the reservoir chamber. This evacuation and refilling can be a two-step process (i.e. aspiration step to evacuate followed by an injection step to fill) or can be performed in an essentially one-step process (i.e. aspiration step to evacuate leading to filling by drawing fluid into the reservoir). For example, a vacuum can be applied through a first channel in the exchange apparatus such that new solution is drawn in from a reservoir through a second channel of the exchange apparatus. The configuration of such an exchange apparatus can vary.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The configuration of the flow director <b>140</b> can vary. The central core <b>135</b> can include one or more directional fins or projections internal to the central core <b>135</b>. The projections in the central core <b>135</b> can change direction of flow out the openings in the central core <b>135</b>. For example, the projections can slope towards the openings to direct flow towards the distal edges of the walls of the reservoir <b>130</b>. The projections can optimize flow patterns of injected therapeutic agent and encourage additional mixing in possible low-flow regions of the device. In bottom-up type exchange as described above, it is desirable to minimize mixing between the pre-existing material in the device with the new solution being added. However, in some instances some degree of mixing between the pre-existing material and the new solution may be desirable. The device may have regions where displacement during exchange is difficult due to geometry of the interior of the device (e.g. corners, edges) and some mixing with the flow director <b>140</b> may be helpful during the exchange.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">As mentioned above, the treatment devices described herein can be held by an insertion tool and inserted through the puncture or incision into the target region. As such, the distal end region of the devices can be shaped in order to ease initial wound entry. A distal end region of the device having a larger diameter and/or a flatter distal tip can be more difficult to find and insert through an incision or puncture as small as 3.2 mm. Further, abrupt edges in the outer contour of the device due to bonding between structural elements of the device (e.g. where a distal edge of the reservoir material bonds to the central core element) can negatively impact tissue entry. In some implementations, the distal end region of the treatment device is beveled, tapered or has a bullet-point tip or other element such that it smoothly penetrates the tissue during implantation.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As mentioned above, the central core element <b>135</b> can be bonded at a proximal end to an upper portion of the reservoir <b>130</b> and at a distal end to a lower portion of the reservoir <b>130</b>. The bond between the central core element <b>135</b> and the reservoir <b>130</b> as well as the central core element <b>135</b> and the drug release element <b>120</b> can be achieved by adhesives such as a two-part epoxy like Epotech <b>301</b>. In some implementations, thermal fusing between the components is used. For example, if the central core element <b>135</b> and the reservoir material can both be made from thermally bondable materials, such as nylon or polysulfone (PSU), the two may be thermally bonded together using heat and compression providing a simpler manufacturing process and more reliable bond than adhesive. The central core element <b>135</b> also can be formed of a metal material and designed to accept the flow of plastic such that it can be joined to the reservoir using heat and compression despite not be formed of the same thermally bondable material. In some implementations, the distal and/or proximal region of the central core element <b>135</b> can incorporate a plurality of small holes to accept the flow of a polymer material such as a small hole pattern laser drilled into the core. If the reservoir material and the central core element are made from similar materials or the core has features designed to accept the flow of a polymer material an ultrasonic welding process can be used to provide energy required to create the bond between them. In further implementations, the central core element <b>135</b> can be formed of a thermoplastic that can allow for the development of an over-molding process between the drug release element <b>120</b> to create a bond joint between the drug release element <b>120</b> and the central core element <b>135</b> at the distal end of the device.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">It should be appreciated that the devices described herein need not include a flow director <b>140</b> or a central core element <b>135</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows an implementation of a device <b>100</b> having an expandable reservoir <b>130</b> coupled on a proximal end to a retention structure <b>105</b> having a flange element <b>110</b>, a penetrable barrier <b>115</b> positioned within an access port <b>111</b> and a distal extension <b>117</b>. The expandable reservoir <b>130</b> is coupled on a distal end region to an outlet <b>125</b> having a drug release element <b>120</b> positioned therein. However, there is no central core element <b>135</b> or flow director <b>140</b> incorporated. The material of the reservoir <b>130</b> can provide sufficient rigidity to the device such that it can be inserted through a penetration site along an axis of insertion A without collapsing in on itself or warping away from the insertion configuration or axis of insertion A. In some implementations, the material of the reservoir <b>130</b> is Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and has a wall thickness in the range of about 0.0005 mm to about 0.05 mm such that the device has column strength and is generally rigid enough to insert into the eye without a central core element or flow director. In some implementations, the devices described herein can be implanted using a stylet or other rigid, longitudinal element that can be inserted within a region of the reservoir at the time of placement and then removed once the necessary column strength has been imparted and the device has penetrated through the sclera. The material of the reservoir <b>130</b> can also include Urethane, Nylon, Pebax&#xae;, Polyurethanes, cross-linked polyethylene, FEP, PTFE, and similar materials and blends of materials. The materials may also include multiple layers of the above materials and other materials known in the art for manufacturing expandable elements.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As discussed above, the device can include a proximal retention structure <b>105</b> having a smooth protrusion or flange element <b>110</b> configured to remain generally external to the eye to aid in retention of the device <b>100</b> when the remainder of the device <b>100</b> is implanted intraocularly. In some implementations, the flange element <b>110</b> can be designed to provide an identifiable orientation of the device <b>100</b> for implanting in the eye such that the direction of expansion of an eccentrically expanding reservoir <b>130</b> is predictable and according to a desired orientation. The reservoir <b>130</b> once implanted within the vitreous <b>30</b> may not be directly visualized. Thus, an orientation indicator <b>150</b> on a portion of the device <b>100</b>, such as the flange element <b>110</b>, that can be visualized from outside the eye allows a user to know the expansion of the reservoir <b>130</b> will be in the correct plane. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an orientation indicator <b>150</b> that is a dot or other visual indicator on an upper surface of the flange element <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates an orientation indicator <b>150</b> that is a shape of the flange element <b>110</b> that indicates the orientation of the eccentric volume of the reservoir. For example, because the expandable reservoirs <b>130</b> can be designed to enlarge along a particular orientation relative to the longitudinal axis of the device and/or the insertion axis A, the relative orientation of that portion of the expandable reservoir <b>130</b> around the axis A can be critical in ensuring the device does not impinge on certain intraocular structures. In some implementations, the flange element <b>110</b> can incorporate a mark or other orientation indicator <b>150</b> on an upper surface <b>112</b> that is visible to a user to indicate orientation of reservoir filling. The orientation indicator <b>150</b> can be any of a variety of shapes, colors or combination of shapes and colors providing guidance regarding where the eccentric volume is located. Alternatively or additionally, the orientation indicator <b>150</b> can be the shape of the flange element <b>110</b> itself. For example, the flange element <b>110</b> can be shaped in such a way to provide directional guidance to a user for implantation of the device. The flange element <b>110</b> can have a variety of shapes such as an ovoid, elliptical, polygonal, triangular, or diamond shape or other shape such as an arrow having a side or angle or portion that indicates where the reservoir <b>130</b> is designed to have a greater expansion compared to another side of the reservoir <b>130</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates a flange element <b>110</b> having a particular shape indicating orientation of the eccentric region of the reservoir <b>130</b>. Upon filling, the orientation indicator <b>150</b> will indicate to a user the portion of the reservoir <b>130</b> that will enlarge away from one or more internal structures of the eye, such as the lens <b>22</b>. It should be appreciated that the flange element <b>110</b> can be keyed or configured to couple with a fill device having keyed features that also provides visual feedback to the user regarding the orientation of the eccentric volume of the device prior to fill or refilling.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The penetrable element <b>115</b> may additionally or alternatively include a color or other indicator to improve guidance during injections. At least a portion of the material of the penetrable element <b>115</b> can be colored or a colored element added to an outer surface of the penetrable element <b>115</b>. The color selected can vary, including, but not limited to black, white, red, blue, orange, yellow, green, purple, or other variants in between. The material of the penetrable element <b>115</b> can also be translucent such that it appears dark from above due to the reservoir chamber underneath it. The color of the material of the penetrable element <b>115</b> can also be made into a pattern, such as stripes or hatched appearance, or a shape, such as a circle or target. Generally, the color of the material of the penetrable element <b>115</b> is selected to provide heightened contrast relative to the remainder of the device as well as the tissues surrounding the device upon implantation.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The devices described herein can incorporate expanding reservoirs that are also symmetrically distributed in the expanded configuration. As previously shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the reservoir <b>130</b> can enlarge from the insertion configuration to an expanded configuration such that the volume of the reservoir <b>130</b> is symmetrically distributed about the longitudinal axis of the device as well as the axis of insertion A. In another implementation, the devices described herein can have expanded configurations that are symmetrically distributed, but the overall shape of the device itself can be formed into a curvilinear or other shape that is not aligned with the axis of insertion A.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The treatment devices described herein can be designed for prolonged retention in the eye to deliver drug to the vitreous for an extended period of time. The way in which the treatment devices described herein are retained in the eye can vary. For example, in some implementations the treatment device can include a proximal retention structure having a flange element that is configured to reside extra-sclerally and work in concert with portions of the device residing trans- or sub-sclerally to affix the device to the eye and provide stability during use. Other implementations of the treatment devices described herein have no extra-scleral retention structure per se and rely upon suturing to the sclera to affix the device to the eye. For example, the device can be implanted trans- and/or sub-sclerally and a proximal region of the device sutured to the sclera to affix the device to the eye. In further implementations, the treatment devices described herein may have an extra-scleral retention structure providing fixation that is further enhanced by suturing. For example, the flange element of the retention structure can incorporate one or more anchor features to enhance fixation or stabilization of the device in the eye, including, but not limited to holes, indentations, or other features that provide a location for suturing of the device to the eye. Some additional retention and stabilization features for use with the treatment devices will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As described elsewhere herein the proximal aspects of the implants (sometimes referred to herein as the &#x201c;upper region&#x201d; or &#x201c;trans-scleral region&#x201d; or &#x201c;neck&#x201d;) allow for re-charging of the implant depot/reservoir from outside the eye. For example, the arrangement of the retention structure, if present, relative to the eye tissue ensures the penetrable element is accessible from outside the eye such that techniques commonly employed for direct intravitreal injections of the eye can be used to refill and/or flush the reservoir of the implant. As will be described in more detail below, placement of the implants described herein can involve the temporary resection of the conjunctiva followed by creation of an incision of fixed length (e.g. 3.22 mm) in the pars plana region using a flat surgical blade. Implants such as those described herein can allow for persistent physical access such as via a needle-type accessory and can physically contact trans-scleral tissues including one or more of the sclera, scleral blood vessels, the choroid, and possibly adjacent retinal and/or ciliary body tissues. The insertion of the implant in the trans-scleral region can cause a physical interference between the implant and the tissues of the eye adjacent the implantation site that can disrupt the edges of the incision and prevent the tissues from returning to a more natural or relaxed state around the implant. Further, the choroid can be disturbed upon penetration of the trans-scleral and sub-scleral components of the implant at the time of surgical implantation, which can increase risk of acute delamination of the tissue layers and contribute to the risk of bleeding at the site of implantation at the time of surgery that can lead to vitreous hemorrhage. The devices described herein can incorporate features that although they may pass through the scleral interface with the choroid for proper implantation in the eye, the risk of delamination and vitreous hemorrhage is minimized while still providing sufficient fixation in the eye, and a resealing septum region to provide effective sealing following multiple needle penetrations over time for prolonged treatment with the device.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some implementations, the major diameter of the trans-scleral region of the device (as well as any portion of the device passing through the sclera) is no greater than the length of the incision, and preferably smaller than the length of the incision, which can be between about 1 mm to about 5 mm. The dimensions of the treatment devices described herein generally avoid stretching of the incision during implantation and subsequent use. In some implementations, the minor diameter of the retention structure <b>105</b>, which is primarily responsible for &#x2018;propping&#x2019; open the tissue edges of the incision, can be minimized. Minimization of the trans-scleral regions of the device allows for the device to be inserted in a manner that does not enlarge the incision and allows for the tissue edges to be in a more relaxes state around the implant neck or upper end region and minimize disturbance to ocular wall tissue structures (e.g. choroid). In some implementations, the largest minor diameter of the trans-scleral region of the implant can be no greater than and preferably less than 3.3 mm, 3.2 mm, 3.1 mm, 3.0 mm, 2.9 mm, 2.8 mm, 2.7 mm, 2.6 mm, or 2.5 mm. In some implementations, the largest minor diameter of the trans-scleral region is between about 1.0 mm to about 2.6 mm.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The penetrable barrier of any of the treatment devices described herein can include those described in U.S. Publication No. 2014/0296800, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 62/318,582, filed Apr. 5, 2016, which are incorporated by reference herein. The penetrable barrier can incorporate one or more features providing enhanced retention of the penetrable barrier within the access port using any of a number of features as described therein. For example, the penetrable barrier can be shaped to mate with a corresponding region within the access port. The penetrable barrier can incorporate one or more features such as a skirt region configured to extend past the access port into the reservoir volume to further support retention. The device can include a cover to improve the integrity of the penetrable barrier and its sealing engagement with the access port. The access port can include an inner anchor feature such as a donut-shaped element configured to encircle at least a region of the penetrable barrier and/or a secondary penetrable barrier positioned above and/or below the primary penetrable barrier. The penetrable barriers described herein need not be a septum formed of a penetrable material. For example, any of the treatment devices described herein can incorporate a valve mechanism with or without a septum as the penetrable barrier. The valve can be configured to receive an elongate fill device through it, such as a blunt needle or elongate cannula, for filling of the reservoir with a drug. The valve can be configured to open upon application of a force in the distal direction by the fill device. The opening of the valve can permit the fill device to form a fluid tight engagement and allow fluid communication between a fluid container attached to the fill device and the reservoir of the treatment device. The valve and the fill device can be configured to seal during injection such that fluid enters the reservoir in a manner that prevents fluid from leaking between the valve/fill device interface. The configuration of the valve can vary, including, but not limited to a split septum, a check valve, a ball valve, a flap valve, a disc valve, a duckbill valve, or other valve configuration. In some implementations, the penetrable barrier can be a twist valve. The twist valve can include a tortuous path that prevents fluid from entering or exiting the device. The fill needle can include a sharp element for penetration of an outer septum material and a blunt obturator for insertion through the tortuous path. As the obturator is inserted through the tortuous path it straights the path until a distal tip of the fill needle is located within the reservoir such that material can be inserted/withdrawn from the reservoir. Upon removal of the fill needle from the path, the tortuosity of the path returns maintaining the fluid-tight seal.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Any of the device implementations described herein can incorporate one or more features that provide for fixation of the device in the eye in any combination. The features can include the proximal retention structure having a flange element configured to be positioned in a supra-scleral location when the treatment device is in use. The features can also include the relative shape of the upper end of the treatment device (i.e. proximal region and distal extension) to improve trans-scleral and/or sub-scleral fixation. The features can also include features that allow for suturing of the treatment device. These features can be used alone or in combination. For example, the treatment devices described herein can rely only upon suturing in place or suturing can be incorporated as an enhanced fixation feature. The treatment devices described herein need not rely upon suturing for fixation and can rely upon one or more features of the upper end of the treatment device to maintain the device in place. Thus, the features for fixation of the treatment device can be sub-scleral, intra-scleral, and or supra-scleral features.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">It should be appreciated that the treatment devices described herein can be used in a variety of locations and implanted in a variety of ways. The implantation method and use of the treatment devices described herein can vary depending on the type of treatment device being implanted and the intended location and drug for treatment. As will be described in more detail below, the treatment devices described herein can be primed, implanted, filled, refilled, aspirated, and/or explanted using one or more devices. Where the treatment device is described as being primed prior to filling with therapeutic solution, the device may also be implanted without priming. For example, the device may be implanted &#x201c;dry&#x201d; and the air expelled from the device as the device is filled with therapeutic solution or passively dissolved after implantation. Similarly, where the treatment devices are described herein as being removed from the eye, they may also be left implanted indefinitely without delivering therapeutic material.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In one implementation of treatment device implantation, a sclerotomy is created according to conventional techniques. The sclerotomy can be created posterior to an insertion site of the treatment device through the sclera <b>24</b> or the sclerotomy can be created directly above the insertion site of the post through the sclera <b>24</b>. The conjunctiva <b>16</b> can be dissected and retracted so as to expose an area of the sclera <b>24</b>. An incision in the conjunctiva <b>16</b> can be made remote from the intended insertion site of the treatment device. A scleral incision or puncture can be formed. The scleral incision or puncture can be made with a delivery device tool or using a distal tip of the treatment device, as described above. In some implementations, the treatment device is implanted using sutureless surgical methods and devices. In other implementations, the treatment device can be positioned sub-sclerally such as under a scleral flap. The post can be inserted into the eye (such as within the vitreous or the anterior chamber, etc.) until at least one of the outlets is positioned within or near the target delivery site and, if a flange element is present, until the inner-facing surface of the flange element can abut an outer surface of the eye. An additional fixation element can be used such as a suture or other element if needed following implantation of the treatment device in the eye as described elsewhere herein. The treatment device can remain in position to deliver the one or more therapeutic agents to the eye for a period of time including, but not limited to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 days or any number of days, months and year, up to at least about 3 years. After the therapeutic agent has been delivered for the desired period of time, the treatment device can be refilled for further delivery or removed.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Generally, the implementations of the treatment devices described herein contain drug solutions, drug suspensions and/or drug matrices. The treatment devices described herein can also contain therapeutic agents formulated as one or more solid drug core or pellets formulated to deliver the one or more therapeutic agents at therapeutically effective amounts for an extended period of time. The period of time over which the treatment device delivers therapeutically effective amounts can vary. In some implementations, the treatment device is implanted to provide a therapy over the effective life of the device such that refill of the device is not necessary.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>D</figref> show a generalized tool <b>1400</b> designed to prime, fill and/or refill the treatment devices described herein. The tool <b>1400</b> can include a trocar introducer cannula or outer sheath <b>280</b> having an internal lumen through which an internal fill cannula or needle <b>270</b> can extend. The sheath <b>280</b> can extend through the penetrable element <b>115</b> in the proximal region of the device <b>100</b> until the distal end of the sheath <b>280</b> enters a proximal end region of the reservoir <b>130</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>) and/or the proximal end of the central core element <b>135</b>, if present. A region of the tool <b>1400</b> can have a stop (not shown) to prevent the distal tip <b>212</b> from extending too far into the reservoir <b>130</b>. The needle <b>270</b> can extend through the internal lumen of the sheath <b>280</b> and into at least the proximal end region of the reservoir <b>130</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>). The needle <b>270</b> can extend further into the reservoir <b>130</b> towards a distal end region of the reservoir <b>130</b>. The overall length of the needle <b>270</b> can be selected based on the treatment device with which it will be used such that the needle <b>270</b> can extend towards a distal end region of the reservoir <b>130</b> or the central core element <b>135</b>, if present. Or if the device includes a flow director <b>140</b>, the needle <b>270</b> can have a length configured to extend through at least a region of the flow director <b>140</b>. The needle <b>270</b> can include a distal tip <b>212</b> having an opening <b>214</b> through which material may flow out of the needle <b>270</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>D</figref>). The distal tip <b>212</b> can be sharp or can be blunted. The flow of material through the needle <b>270</b> and out the opening <b>214</b> near the distal tip <b>212</b> allows for filling of the reservoir <b>130</b> in a bottom-up manner. A distal end region of the sheath <b>280</b> can be configured to receive pre-existing material from the reservoir <b>130</b> such that it can be flushed out from the reservoir <b>130</b> upon filling with new material through the needle <b>270</b>. This in combination with a flow director <b>140</b> can increase refill efficiency.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The tool <b>1400</b> can incorporate one or more features of other refill devices described, for example, in U.S. Pat.

However, it should be appreciated that the reservoir <b>130</b> can be filled during or after final seating the treatment device <b>100</b> fully within the incision as will be described in more detail below. In some implementations, the fill needle can be a 30 gauge needle that has a hub providing visual feedback via its fluid return path when the treatment device <b>100</b> has been filled. For example, the fill needle can include a transparent or translucent chamber for viewing return fluid. The fill needle can also include one or more return fluid path holes. The fill needle can be used to inject therapeutic fluid into the device <b>100</b> until the prime fluid is removed from the treatment device <b>100</b>. The reservoir <b>130</b> expands as the device <b>100</b> is filled with fluid. The device <b>100</b> can be slightly overfilled to ensure maximum expansion.

No. 14/937,784, published as U.S. 2016/0128867, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. For example, one or more of the therapeutic agent or a stabilizer can increase the density of the therapeutic fluid. In many embodiments the therapeutic fluid having the greater density comprises a stabilizer, such as trehalose, and the therapeutic agent such as a protein comprising an antibody fragment. Alternatively or in combination, the therapeutic formulation can include an amount of therapeutic agent sufficient to provide a density greater than the fluid of the implanted device. The difference in density can be within a range from about 1% to about 10% and can depend on the density of the fluid within the reservoir chamber of the therapeutic device and density of the therapeutic fluid placed in the reservoir chamber with the exchange apparatus. The density of the therapeutic fluid may correspond to a density of the therapeutic agent and a density of the stabilizer (when present). In many embodiments, the density of the fluid of the reservoir chamber may correspond to a density of phosphate buffered saline, or plasma, or an amount of therapeutic fluid remaining in the reservoir from a prior exchange, or combinations thereof, for example. As described elsewhere herein, differences in fluid density as a result of temperature differences between the exchanged fluids can improve bottom-up filling efficiency. As mentioned above, implant orientation and/or tilt angle between the implant and the exchange needle during refilling can improve refill efficiency where there is a solution density different between the fluid being injected and the contents of the implant. Aspiration can be incorporated to aid in the efficiency of the exchange as well.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">When injected into a device implanted within the patient, the distance <b>204</b> may correspond to no more than approximately the length of the device <b>140</b>.

The sheath <b>280</b> can include an inside diameter sized larger than the outside diameter of needle <b>270</b> so as to provide an annular channel <b>239</b> extending axially between the needle <b>270</b> and the sheath <b>280</b> from the plurality of openings <b>236</b> to the opening <b>285</b>. The diameter of each of the openings <b>236</b> can be within a range from about 0.0001 inches to about 0.1 inches, for example within a range from about 0.001 inches to about 0.01 inches. The diameter of each of the plurality of openings <b>236</b> can be uniform or can vary in size as well as shape. The plurality of openings <b>236</b> can be one or more of many shapes and can be arranged in many ways. Each row can include from about 1 to about 20 holes, for example, and can be circular, oval, elliptical or other shapes, for example.

Each of the four rows may extend axially along the sheath <b>280</b>. The rows can be spaced angularly at 90 degrees to each other, for example. The sheath <b>280</b> can include a sheath <b>280</b>B having about two rows, each row comprising about four holes, each hole having a diameter of no more than about one eighth of the diameter of the outside diameter of the sheath <b>280</b>.

The sheath <b>280</b> can include sheath <b>280</b>D having at least about three rows of at least about 3 holes, each hole having a diameter of no more than about one quarter of the diameter of the outside diameter of the sheath <b>280</b>. The rows can be spaced apart circumferentially at about 120 degrees, for example. The sheath <b>280</b> can include sheath <b>280</b>E having at least about 40 holes, each hole having a diameter of no more than about one tenth of the diameter of the outside diameter of the sheath <b>280</b>.

For example, the opening <b>214</b> can be configured to change direction of flow from the needle <b>270</b> into the reservoir <b>130</b> to impact refill efficiency. The opening <b>214</b> can include one or more side openings located near the distal tip <b>212</b> of the needle <b>270</b> similar such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C-<b>14</b>D</figref>. The openings <b>236</b> in the sheath <b>280</b>, the openings <b>214</b> in the needle <b>270</b>, the density/viscosity of the therapeutic fluid being injected, the presence of one or more flow director type features within the device <b>100</b> can all impact the effective flow patterns within the device to improve exchange efficiency.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Again with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>C</figref>, the collection chamber <b>250</b> of the exchange needle apparatus <b>200</b> can have a volume (e.g., no more than about 200 uL, or no more than about 150 uL, or no more than about 100 uL, or no more than about 50 uL) and a porous structure <b>256</b> located within at least a region of the collection chamber <b>250</b> along the vent path. The porous structure <b>256</b> can be formed of a material having a low resistance to air and other gasses while substantially inhibiting flow of a liquid, such as the liquid from the device <b>100</b>. The material of the porous structure <b>256</b> can be a hydrophobic membrane, a fabric, a porous fabric, a semipermeable membrane, an air permeable material, a moisture vapor transfer waterproof fabric, a hydrophilic porous material, or a porous sintered material. The porous structure <b>256</b> can have a low resistance to gas flow and a higher resistance to liquid. The liquid resistance is also greater than the liquid resistance through the porous structure (i.e. RCE) of the device <b>100</b>. Thus, if additional volume of therapeutic fluid is injected once the exchanged liquid contacts the porous structure <b>256</b>, a bolus can be released through the porous structure device into the eye. This allows for a controlled bolus to be driven into the eye (if desired) following the initial fill or exchange of liquids.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">A device having a pliable, expandable reservoir wall is directly impacted by forces of intraocular pressure (TOP) once implanted. For example, the eye can be viewed as a closed system in equilibrium that has an internal pressure (intraocular pressure &#x201c;TOP&#x201d;) that is greater than atmospheric pressure. An unobstructed vent in an exchange apparatus creates a pathway from inside the eye (higher pressure) to the atmosphere (lower pressure) upon penetration of the closed system, for example, by injecting therapeutic into the reservoir positioned within the vitreous. The higher pressure of TOP presses against the pliable reservoir wall positioned within the vitreous due to this unobstructed vent to the atmosphere thereby urging the wall to collapse inward. Thus, during filling of the device, TOP can impact fill efficiency and overall payload.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-<b>19</b>C</figref> illustrate fluid exchange of an implanted device <b>100</b> having an expandable reservoir <b>130</b> using an exchange apparatus <b>200</b> having an unrestricted vent <b>258</b> and no porous structure <b>256</b> within the collection chamber <b>250</b>. The walls of the expandable reservoir <b>130</b> are pliable such that they can be moved by forces applied to their outer surface by TOP when a path to atmospheric pressure exists, such as via the unrestricted vent <b>258</b> of the exchange apparatus <b>200</b>. Intraocular pressure can vary from patient to patient, but is generally within a range of 10 mmHg to about 21 mmHg, but can be higher than 21 mmHg in patients suffering from ocular hypertension. The IOP pressing against the walls of the implanted reservoir <b>130</b> urges liquid <b>505</b> in the reservoir <b>130</b> through the openings <b>236</b>, out pathway <b>239</b>, and into the empty chamber <b>250</b> immediately upon insertion of the elongate structure <b>201</b> through the penetrable barrier <b>115</b> into the reservoir <b>130</b> because an unrestricted path to atmospheric pressure is created (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>). This causes the walls of the reservoir <b>130</b> to collapse slightly. Air <b>405</b> present within the empty collection chamber <b>250</b> escapes through vent opening <b>258</b> as the liquid <b>505</b> is expelled and begins collecting in the chamber <b>250</b>. Application of positive pressure through the lumen <b>219</b> of the needle <b>270</b> to inject the therapeutic solution into the reservoir <b>130</b> increases internal pressure within the reservoir <b>130</b> to above TOP. The forces against the inner surface of the reservoir wall overcome the forces of TOP against the outer surface of the reservoir wall thereby urging the walls of the reservoir <b>130</b> to enlarge outward as the reservoir <b>130</b> fills with new solution (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>). Air <b>405</b> in the chamber <b>250</b> continues to escape through vent opening <b>258</b> and liquid <b>505</b> from the reservoir <b>130</b> is further urged into the openings <b>236</b>, out the pathway <b>239</b>, and into the chamber <b>250</b>. Once the application of positive pressure through the lumen <b>219</b> of the needle <b>270</b> to inject therapeutic into the reservoir <b>130</b> is terminated, the pressure within the reservoir <b>130</b> drops. The forces against the inner surface of the reservoir wall once again approach the forces of TOP against the outer surface of the reservoir wall, which allows the TOP to urge the walls of the reservoir <b>130</b> inward. Inward movement of the reservoir walls while the path to atmospheric pressure remains open (i.e. via the elongate structure <b>201</b>) can force the newly added liquid into the openings <b>236</b>, out the pathway <b>239</b>, and into the chamber <b>250</b> at least until the elongate structure <b>201</b> is removed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>C</figref>). Thus, unrestricted venting through vent opening <b>258</b> allows for the TOP to drive the newly added therapeutic out of the reservoir <b>130</b> into the collection chamber <b>250</b> resulting in a loss in delivery payload.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">To counteract the forces of TOP on the pliable, expandable reservoir wall <b>130</b>, the chamber <b>250</b> can include a porous structure <b>256</b> rather than unrestricted venting (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-<b>20</b>C</figref>). The porous structure <b>256</b> has a resistance sufficient to counteract the forces of TOP once filling is complete and maintain the increased pressure within the reservoir <b>130</b> and thereby prevent loss of new solution due to partial collapse of the wall. As described above, a path to atmospheric pressure is created immediately upon insertion of the elongate structure <b>201</b> of the exchange needle apparatus <b>200</b> through the penetrable barrier <b>115</b> into the reservoir <b>130</b>. The IOP pressing against the walls of the implanted reservoir <b>130</b> urges liquid <b>505</b> (i.e., a pre-existing fluid that is a liquid) in the reservoir <b>130</b> from the device <b>100</b> through the openings <b>236</b>, into an outlet lumen <b>239</b> that is fluidly coupled to the collection chamber <b>250</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>). The walls of the reservoir <b>130</b> collapse slightly. The air <b>405</b> present within the empty collection chamber <b>250</b> escapes through vent opening <b>258</b> and the porous structure <b>256</b> as the liquid <b>505</b> begins collecting in the chamber <b>250</b> because the porous structure <b>256</b> has a low resistance to air. Application of positive pressure through the injection lumen <b>219</b> of the needle <b>270</b> to inject the therapeutic solution into the reservoir <b>130</b> increases internal pressure within the reservoir <b>130</b> to at or above IOP. The forces against the inner surface of the reservoir wall overcome the forces of IOP against the outer surface of the reservoir wall thereby urging the walls of the reservoir <b>130</b> to enlarge outward as the reservoir <b>130</b> fills with new solution (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>). Air <b>405</b> in the collection chamber <b>250</b> continues to escape through the vent opening <b>258</b> and the porous structure <b>256</b> and liquid <b>505</b> from the reservoir <b>130</b> is further urged into the openings <b>236</b>, out the pathway <b>239</b>, and into the collection chamber <b>250</b>. The increased pressure during injection continues to counteract the IOP forces against the outer surface of the reservoir wall, which keeps the reservoir expanded during filling. Once the preexisting liquid <b>505</b> has been exchanged with the newly injected therapeutic agent, all the air <b>405</b> (i.e. a pre-existing fluid that is not a liquid) in the collection chamber <b>250</b> has passed through the porous structure <b>256</b> and out a vent opening <b>258</b> of the apparatus and the collection chamber <b>250</b> is filled substantially with the newly injected therapeutic agent. The liquid <b>505</b> contacts and wets the porous structure <b>256</b> of the collection chamber <b>250</b>. Once wetted, the porous structure <b>256</b> has a resistance to liquid flow that is sufficient to counteract the forces of intraocular pressure (TOP) on the outside surface of the pliable, expandable reservoir wall <b>130</b>. The liquid resistance of the wetted porous structure <b>256</b> restricts the flow of the liquid <b>505</b> through the porous structure <b>256</b> and further venting is greatly reduced. The pressure inside the device is maintained at or higher than IOP and the reservoir wall stays expanded even when application of positive pressure through the lumen <b>219</b> of the needle <b>270</b> is discontinued. The retained increased pressure (i.e. at or higher than IOP) inside the reservoir <b>130</b> prevents IOP-driven collapse of the reservoir walls (FIG. <b>20</b>C). Thus, the liquid resistance of the porous structure <b>256</b> prevents collapse of the reservoir wall <b>130</b> that would otherwise be caused by forces of TOP against the outside surface of the wall <b>130</b> thereby preventing the newly added solution in the reservoir from being driven out of the implant leading to payload loss. The resistance to liquid flow through the wetted porous structure <b>256</b> can be higher than the resistance to liquid flow through the porous structure <b>120</b> of the device. As such, if a user continues to inject therapeutic agent into the reservoir <b>130</b> through the inlet pathway, an amount of newly injected therapeutic agent can be passed through the porous structure <b>120</b> of the device <b>100</b> and into the eye. This can be advantageous for treatments in which a bolus delivery through the device is desirable.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The device for injecting a therapeutic agent into an ocular implant, the implant being at least partially implanted in an eye and providing at least a first resistance to outflow of therapeutic agent into the eye, can include an injection lumen <b>219</b>, an outlet lumen <b>239</b>, and a collection chamber <b>250</b>. The injection lumen <b>219</b> is configured to provide a pathway for injecting the therapeutic agent into the reservoir <b>130</b> of the ocular implant. The outlet lumen <b>239</b> is configured to provide a pathway through which pre-existing fluid <b>505</b> in the ocular implant exits the ocular implant. The pre-existing fluid <b>505</b> in the ocular implant that is at least partially implanted in the eye is typically a liquid. The liquid can include fluids from the patient (e.g. vitreal fluid) as well as left over liquid from therapeutic formulation that was being delivered by the implant. The collection chamber <b>250</b> is fluidly coupled to the outlet lumen <b>239</b>. The collection chamber <b>250</b> is configured to receive the pre-existing fluid <b>505</b> that exits the ocular implant via the outlet lumen <b>239</b>. The collection chamber <b>250</b> provides a first fluid outflow resistance and a second fluid outflow resistance. The first fluid outflow resistance can be lower than the first resistance to outflow of the implant. The second fluid outflow resistance can be greater than a force imparted onto the implant by intraocular pressure (TOP) of the eye. Injection of therapeutic agent into the ocular implant via the injection lumen <b>219</b>, for example, to refresh and refill the ocular implant with new therapeutic formulation, causes the pre-existing fluid <b>505</b> to exit the ocular implant and enter the collection chamber <b>250</b> via the outlet lumen <b>239</b> and causes a second pre-existing fluid <b>405</b> to displace from the collection chamber <b>250</b>. The second pre-existing fluid <b>405</b> in the collection chamber can be a gas, such as air or air under vacuum. Upon displacement from the collection chamber <b>250</b> of substantially all of the second pre-existing fluid <b>405</b>, the second fluid outflow resistance of the collection chamber <b>250</b> can cause a portion of the newly injected therapeutic agent to pass from the implant into the patient's eye upon injection of an additional amount of the therapeutic agent into the ocular implant. Thus, the relative resistances can allow for exchange of fluids as well as delivery of a bolus amount of the therapeutic agent with a single penetration of the implant. The device for refill is particularly useful where the implant is expandable from a first, collapsed configuration to a second, enlarged configuration, which would tend to collapse upon exposure to TOP when the vented injector is fluidly coupled to the reservoir's contents. A first porous structure <b>256</b> can be operatively coupled to the collection chamber <b>250</b> and provide the first fluid outflow resistance and the second fluid outflow resistance. The first porous structure <b>256</b> operatively coupled to the collection chamber <b>250</b> can have the first fluid outflow resistance to gas outflow and the second fluid outflow resistance to liquid outflow. The implant can include a second porous structure <b>120</b> that provides the first resistance to outflow. The first fluid outflow resistance of the first porous structure <b>256</b> of the collection chamber <b>250</b> can be less than the first resistance provided by the second porous structure <b>120</b> of the implant. The second fluid outflow resistance of the first porous structure <b>256</b> of the collection chamber <b>250</b> can be greater than the first resistance to outflow of the implant. The second pre-existing fluid can be displaced from the collection chamber <b>250</b> via a vent or a valve.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In some implementations, evacuation/filling of the reservoir <b>130</b> involves aspiration. The liquid <b>505</b> in the reservoir <b>130</b> can be evacuated by application of negative forces through pathway <b>239</b> such that liquid <b>505</b> is drawn out of the reservoir <b>130</b> up into chamber <b>250</b>. Upon evacuation of the pre-existing liquid <b>505</b> from the reservoir <b>130</b>, a positive pressure can be applied to fill the reservoir with new solution as described above. Alternatively, negative pressure can continue to be applied through pathway <b>239</b> such that new solution is drawn into the emptied reservoir <b>130</b>. As the reservoir <b>130</b> fills with new solution, the forces against the inner surface of the reservoir wall due to fluid filling overcome the forces of TOP against the outer surface of the reservoir wall thereby urging the walls of the reservoir <b>130</b> to enlarge outward. The pressure within the reservoir is maintained and the walls stay expanded upon wetting of the porous structure <b>256</b> as described above.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The porous structure <b>256</b> can create a fixed upper limit that together with wall <b>252</b> of the chamber <b>250</b> defines the volume of the chamber <b>250</b>. The volume of the chamber <b>250</b> can be sufficient to collect a maximum volume of liquid held by the device <b>100</b>. The volume of the chamber <b>250</b> can also be smaller than the maximum volume of liquid held by the device <b>100</b> such that upon fluid exchange a controlled amount of bolus expression occurs through the porous structure <b>120</b> of the device <b>100</b>. The porous structure <b>256</b> can be a relatively rigid structure such that upon contact with liquid <b>505</b> exiting the device <b>100</b>, the porous structure <b>256</b> resists deformation maintaining a fixed volume of the chamber <b>250</b>. This prevents the structure <b>256</b> from deflecting to allow additional liquid to enter the chamber <b>250</b> after filling that could lead to payload loss. The fixed chamber volume also allows for the controlled bolus to be delivered when used in conjunction with a fixed injection volume.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The geometry of the chamber <b>250</b> as well as the relative position of the porous structure <b>256</b> within the chamber <b>250</b> can vary. Generally, the geometry and relative position of the porous structure <b>256</b> (e.g. at the highest possible point within the chamber <b>250</b>) are designed to provide better venting of gas from the chamber <b>250</b> and predictable liquid filling from the bottom-up. Generally, the geometry of collection chamber <b>250</b> can direct filling to ensure the porous structure <b>256</b> is wetted by the evacuated liquid only after substantially complete air evacuation and, in turn, consistent liquid volume occurs. This ensures there is a &#x201c;shut off&#x201d; after the appropriate volume of new solution is injected. Gravitational forces and/or capillary action can be leveraged to allow for even and predictable filling and to minimize trapping of gas, as will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some implementations (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-<b>20</b>C</figref>), the porous structure <b>256</b> encircles the needle <b>270</b> (or the longitudinal axis of the needle <b>270</b>) concentrically and engages the inner-facing walls of the chamber <b>250</b>. The porous structure <b>256</b> can thereby form a cap creating a fixed upper limit of the chamber <b>250</b> and together with wall <b>252</b> define the volume of the chamber <b>250</b>. The porous structure <b>256</b> can also be a discrete structure positioned within a region of the chamber <b>250</b> as will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a cross-sectional perspective view of an implementation of an exchange apparatus <b>200</b> configured to be used with a syringe <b>300</b> or other container <b>310</b> configured to hold fluid to be delivered to the reservoir <b>130</b>. The exchange apparatus <b>200</b> includes a collection chamber <b>250</b> configured to receive expelled fluid from the reservoir <b>130</b>. The collection chamber <b>250</b> can be defined by a wall <b>252</b> configured to surround the needle <b>270</b> in a generally concentric manner. The wall <b>252</b> can flare out beyond a diameter of the syringe, for example, to collect larger volumes up to about 200 uL. An upper end region of the chamber <b>250</b> can be engaged with a spacer ring <b>265</b> having an inner diameter sized to encircle the needle hub assembly <b>500</b> and an outer diameter sized engage the wall <b>252</b>.

A user's view of the needle tip (not shown) can be enhanced by modifying the shape of the needle cannula passage <b>267</b>. For example, the needle cannula passage <b>267</b> can extend along a first axis A at a proximal end region and extend along a second axis B at a distal end region near the needle tip. As such, the needle cannula is routed from the first axis A to the second axis A such that is it routed away from the offset body <b>251</b> and the needle tip is no longer concentric to the hub assembly <b>500</b> or the syringe barrel connected to the hub assembly <b>500</b>. Fluid expelled from the device into a return pathway is directed into the narrow collection chamber <b>250</b> through opening <b>285</b>. In this implementation, the collection chamber <b>250</b> can be a tubular structure <b>269</b> having a lumen extending between the opening <b>285</b> into the tubular structure <b>269</b> and terminating at the porous element <b>256</b>. Fluid expelled from the device through opening <b>285</b> enters the lumen of the tubular structure <b>269</b>. The tubular structure <b>269</b> can have a relatively uniform inner diameter over its entire length. Inner diameter and length of the tubular structure <b>269</b> can vary depending on the overall volume capacity desired. The tubular structure <b>269</b> can be between 0.5 inches and 3.0 inches long and have an inner diameter between 0.125 inches and 0.5 inches. The tubular structure <b>269</b> can have an inner diameter such that capillary action can assist in pulling the exchanged liquid expelled from the reservoir <b>130</b> of the device <b>100</b> into and up through the lumen. Depending on the length the tubular structure <b>269</b> the end of the tubing away from the opening <b>285</b> into the lumen (i.e. within the body of the exchange apparatus) can be coiled. The number of coils varies with the length of the tubing. Thus, the coiled tube style collection chamber <b>250</b> can have a wider range in volume capacity while maintaining generally the same form factor. The coiled tube style collection chamber <b>250</b> provides for a uniform and controlled fill pattern, minimizing the risk of trapping air within the chamber <b>250</b> during exchange.

The refill needle and the fill needle can be the same type of needle or can be distinct from one another.

In some implementations, such as when redundant barrier systems are incorporated, the needle may include one or more reinforcement structures to accommodate the longer travel through the septum or a concentration of return holes near the distal end of the refill needle in order to refill the system efficiently. For example, to access the reservoir of a device having an elongated upper end region and incorporating, for example, a redundant septum or a penetrable element that does not reside within the proximal portion of the neck a needle may incorporate one or more features to provide for better penetration including, but not limited to a longer length, a reinforcement structure surrounding at least a region of its length, and/or concentration of return fluid holes near the distal end of the needle.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Once the expanded volume of the implanted reservoir is achieved, the device can be refilled at predictable intervals (e.g. every 3, 4, 5, 6 months or as along as every 12 months). However, changing the volume of the expanded device once implanted in the eye may not be desirable (e.g. movement in the eye once implanted may lead to potential trauma to surrounding structures or fluctuations in intraocular pressure) and is thus something to be avoided. The treatment devices described herein once implanted and expanded can maintain a consistent volume such that the outer diameter or contour of the reservoir does not change substantially throughout the use of the device and regardless of fill status. Further, the treatment devices described herein can maintain substantially the same expanded shape. For example, drug passively diffuses through the porous drug delivery element and out of the expanded reservoir over time. Despite this drug release into the eye, the expanded reservoir can remain filled with fluid, for example, fluid that enters the reservoir from the vitreous and drug formulation fluid remaining in the reservoir. The reservoir material can be formed of a substantially non-compliant material that tends to maintain its physical structure regardless of whether the interior of the reservoir is filled with drug. Further, refill of the treatment devices described herein can be performed such that a negative pressure and/or an excessive positive pressure do not build within it.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A-<b>26</b>C</figref> show an implementation of an exchange apparatus <b>200</b> having an elongate structure <b>201</b> having a needle <b>270</b> extending through a removable sheath <b>280</b> and a collection chamber <b>250</b> that is removable from the exchange needle apparatus <b>200</b>.
