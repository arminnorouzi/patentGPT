Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In beverage use cans, printing is usually performed on the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part, and a protection layer is formed on the image formed by the printing. This forms the image and the protection layer on the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In contrast thereto, the image and the protection layer are not formed on the bottom part, and thereby the bottom part is left exposed. In addition, a chemical conversion treatment is often performed on the beverage use can; however, the liquid used for the chemical conversion treatment is difficult to stay on the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part, and the effect of the chemical conversion treatment on the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part is likely to be small.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to protect an outer circumferential surface of a bottom part of a beverage use can.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method for forming a beverage use can, to which the present invention is applied, in which the beverage use can is provided with a cylindrical part with one end portion and the other end portion, and a bottom part positioned at the one end portion of the cylindrical part, the bottom part having an outer circumferential surface with an outer diameter gradually increasing with a move toward the other end portion of the cylindrical part, includes a protection layer forming process applying ink to the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part to form a protection layer on the outer circumferential surface.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Here, when an image is formed on an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part by using ink, the protection layer may be formed by applying ink on the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the protection layer may be formed by applying ink on the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part by using an image forming unit forming an image on an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, the method may further include an image forming process forming an image on an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part, wherein formation of an image in the image forming process and application of ink to the outer circumferential surface in the protection layer forming process may be performed by a common inkjet head.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, ink may be ejected from an inkjet head to an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part to form an image on the outer circumferential surface, and ink may be ejected from an inkjet head to the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part to form the protection layer, and an ink ejection condition when ink is ejected from the inkjet head to the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part may be different from an ejection condition when ink is ejected from the inkjet head to the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, an amount of ink per a single droplet when ink is ejected from the inkjet head to the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part may be different from an amount of ink per a single droplet when ink is ejected from the inkjet head to the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, an image may be formed on the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part by applying the ink to the outer circumferential surface, and a bottom part image, which is an image formed on the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part, may be formed to cause a design pattern included in the bottom part image to continue to a design pattern included in a cylindrical part image, which is an image formed on an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, an image composed of inks of plural colors may be formed on an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part, and, in the protection layer forming process, ink of part of the plural colors may be applied to the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part to form the protection layer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, the method may further include an image forming process forming an image on an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part, wherein, in the image forming process, a colored underlayer may be formed on the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part, and then ink may be applied on the colored underlayer to form an image on the underlayer, the beverage use can may be made of metal, and, in the protection layer forming process, ink may be applied onto a metal base positioned on the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part to form the protection layer on the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover, the method may further include an image forming process applying ink to an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part by using one ink application method and forming an image on the outer circumferential surface, and, in the protection layer forming process, ink may be applied to the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part by using another ink application method, which is different from the one ink application method, to form the protection layer.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, in the image forming process, ink may be applied to the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part by using a plate printing method to form an image on the outer circumferential surface, and, in the protection layer forming process, ink may be applied to the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part by using an inkjet head method to form the protection layer.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Moreover, in the case where the present invention is grasped as a beverage use can, a beverage use can to which the present invention is applied includes: a cylindrical part with one end portion and the other end portion; and a bottom part positioned at the one end portion of the cylindrical part, wherein the bottom part has an outer circumferential surface with an outer diameter gradually increasing with a move toward the other end portion of the cylindrical part, and the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part is provided with a protection layer formed by adhesion of ink and curing of the ink.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Here, a design pattern may be formed in the protection layer.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, a continuous design pattern may be formed from an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part to the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, a character string along a circumferential direction of the beverage use can may be formed in the protection layer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">From another standpoint, a beverage use can to which the present invention is applied includes: a cylindrical part with one end portion and the other end portion; and a bottom part positioned at the one end portion of the cylindrical part, wherein the bottom part has an outer circumferential surface with an outer diameter gradually increasing with a move toward the other end portion of the cylindrical part, and the outer circumferential surface of the bottom part is provided with a protection layer containing a coloring material.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Moreover, in the case where the present invention is grasped as a printing device, a printing device performing printing onto a beverage use can, to which the present invention is applied, in which the beverage use can is provided with a cylindrical part with one end portion and the other end portion, and a bottom part positioned at the one end portion of the cylindrical part, the bottom part having an outer circumferential surface with an outer diameter gradually increasing with a move
