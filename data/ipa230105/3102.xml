However, these automation systems may still require people for effective monitoring and controlling of various equipment in these areas in order to achieve desired operations. The risk of injury to the people or personnel increases when the people are in the proximity to the equipments which are moving and/or rotating continuously on the drill floor.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There exists a need for an improved drill floor and/or wellsite safety methods and apparatus.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an objective of the present invention to provide improvements over the state of the art in at least one of the abovementioned areas, or at least to provide alternatives to known technology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to a method for controlling drilling operations. The method comprises a step of defining a plurality of operation zones in a drilling operation area, each operation zone comprising at least one equipment arranged to operate in the operation zone.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method may comprise repeatedly performing the steps of: determining the position of at least one person in the drilling operation area; determining whether the respective determined position is within any of the defined operation zones and associating each person to the operation zone in which the person is located; determining whether the respective determined position is within a safety zone in proximity to the one or more equipments; determining one or more actions to be performed with regard to each operation zone in which a person has been determined to be present, wherein the at least one action is determined dependent on whether the position of the person is in the safety zone or not; and transmitting one or more control signals for controlling the drilling operations in accordance with the determined one or more actions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thereby, intelligent management of operation zones in a drilling operation area can be achieved. The operation zones can be defined based on type of equipment operating in the respective zone and which types of operations are presently carried out by the equipment in the respective zone. If for example operation of an equipment has been temporarily stopped, there is no need to define an operation zone corresponding to this equipment during the stop. When operation of the equipment is resumed, an operation zone associated to that equipment can then be formed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The positions of persons moving in the drilling operation area can then be assessed in relation to updated and relevant operation zones. Further, as actions are determined in relation to whether the persons determined to be present in the operation zones are in a safety zone in proximity to the equipment, or outside the safety zone, the actions taken are adequate for the situation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This solution is especially useful in situations, where it is not possible to avoid that people are present while equipments are operating. For example offshore drilling rigs are crowded and it is not always possible to avoid presence of people where equipment is operating.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This solution allows for eliminating unnecessary people in the safe zone(s) while managing &#x201c;must have&#x201d; personnel.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Drilling operations may be optimized while safety in the safety zone(s) can be maximized.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the step of determining one or more actions comprises determining a first type action when a person has been determined to be in the safety zone and determining a second type action when no person has been determined to be in the safety zone. For example, the first type action may comprise stopping operation of the equipment. The second type action may comprise reducing the speed of the equipment. For example, the speed of the equipment may be reduced to <b>50</b>%.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the second type action is determined based on the number or persons which has been determined to be present within the operation zone. For example, when the second type action comprises reducing the speed of the equipment, the speed reduction may be dependent on the number of persons present in the operation zone. The second type action may also or instead be dependent on where in the operation zone person(s), who are not in the safety zone, are present.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, at least one of the operation zones comprises multiple sub-zones, wherein one of the multiple sub-zones is the safety zone.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the extension of the plurality of operation zones, and/or the extension of the sub-zones, are defined in accordance with a type of operations carried out by equipment in the respective operation zone.

As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the drill floor <b>100</b> comprises various drilling components such as a derrick <b>102</b>, a pipe handling machine <b>104</b>, and a plurality of hoisting cylinders <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c</i>. The drilling operation area comprises further in the illustrated example a driller's cabin <b>108</b> situated external to the drill floor <b>100</b>. The drill floor <b>100</b> may include many other drilling components other than the components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for performing various drilling operations on the drill floor <b>100</b> with various equipments.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0098">The driller's cabin <b>108</b> may include various control equipments, control system nodes, required control circuitry and other monitoring systems. The various control equipments in the driller's cabin <b>108</b> may have communication with the equipments on the drill floor <b>100</b> or wellsite via equipment sensors coupled to each equipment or one or more rig sensors located on the drill floor <b>100</b> for monitoring various operations of the equipments <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>on the drill floor <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0099">Although many of the equipments on the drill floor <b>100</b> are automated and/or operated remotely (e.g., such as from the driller's cabin <b>108</b> or from a control room located away from the equipments), there are still numerous personnel often working on, or adjacent to the drill floor <b>100</b> during an oil and gas operation. The personnel are required to be involved for monitoring and controlling various equipments and operations of those equipments on the drill floor <b>100</b>. However, the risk of injury to the personnel increases when the personnel are in the proximity of equipments rotating and/or moving on the drill floor <b>100</b>. Therefore, it is the objective of the present disclosure to provide an improved drill floor <b>100</b> that provides some safety indications to the personnel who are in the proximity of the equipments and to automatically control the equipments when the personnel are in proximity.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0100">In an embodiment, a plurality of operation zones namely operation zone <b>1</b>, operation zone <b>2</b>, operation zone <b>3</b> and operation zone <b>4</b> are defined on the drill floor <b>100</b> as illustrated in FIG. l.

For example, the operation zone associated to the derrick <b>102</b> on the drill floor <b>100</b> comprises three sub-zones namely sub-zone <b>1</b>, sub-zone <b>2</b> and sub-zone <b>3</b>. One of the sub-zones i.e., either sub-zone <b>1</b> or sub-zone <b>2</b> or sub-zone <b>3</b> may be defined as a safety zone for the derrick <b>102</b>. For example, sub-zone <b>1</b> which is closer to the derrick <b>102</b> can be defined as a safety zone.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0103">Therefore, it should be noted that the drill floor <b>100</b> may include plurality of operation zones, where each operation zone covers a part of drill floor <b>100</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Further, the operation zone may be divided into a plurality of sub-zones, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0104">The operation zones may be equipped with sensors for monitoring the operations of various equipments <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c</i>. In some examples, each equipment <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c</i>,<b>108</b> on the drill floor <b>100</b> can have equipment sensor(s) which may have wired and/or wireless communication with one or more control nodes or control system nodes in the driller's cabin <b>108</b>. The equipment sensors may be attached to the equipments <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>and can be configured to transmit one or more signals corresponding to the location of the specific equipment. The signals received from the equipment sensors may be used to monitor and/or control the operation of the equipments <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0080" num="0105">In some examples, the personnel may be wearing one or more sensors. These sensors may be used to track the location of the personnel wearing the sensor by transmitting the signals corresponding to the location of the sensors to the control nodes possibly located in the driller's cabin <b>108</b>. The sensors can include, a global positioning system (GPS), radio frequency identification (RFID), a video camera or a motion sensor capable of monitoring the position of the personnel. The sensors may be embedded in clothing of the personnel or coupled to the pair of gloves worn by the personnel.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0106">A control node possibly located the driller's cabin <b>108</b> may be adapted to receive and process signals from the sensors to determine positions of personnel and/or equipments. For example, a GPS enabled transmitting sensor may provide geographical location and time information to the control node to determine position or location of the personnel.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0107">The control node determines the position of at least one person in the drilling operation area and determines whether the respective determined position is within any of the defined operation zones. Each person is the associated to the operation zone in which the person is located.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0108">Further, the control node identifies a position of a person in the drilling operation area relative to each equipment <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>,<b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>in the operation zones using the equipment sensors and/or the sensors worn by the personnel. Further, the control node may be configured to evaluate whether the person is in proximity to the one or more equipments based on the identified position. For example, the control node obtains the position information of the equipment from the equipment sensors and the position information of the person using the sensors worn by the personnel. The control node then evaluates whether the person is within a safety zone in proximity to the one or more equipments based on the position information of the equipment and/or the position information of the person.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0109">If the control node determines that the person is in within the operation zone, then the control node may perform one or more actions for automatically or manually controlling the operations of equipments in the drilling operation area and/or for notifying person(s) present in the operation area and/or for notifying an operator of the equipment. The actions may include, for example, stopping operation of the equipment(s) when the person is within the safety zone, reducing speed of the equipment(s), altering path of the equipment(s), altering movement of the equipment(s) and notifying an operator of the equipment(s).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an example illustration of a position of a person relative to an equipment <b>110</b> on the drill floor <b>100</b>.

These bounding boxes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>d </i>are provided such that they enclose the outer perimetry of the person or the equipments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>a </i></figref>similarly illustrates a top view of a part of a drill floor, wherein a bounding box <b>112</b><i>d </i>is defined around an equipment, and two zones, Zone <b>1</b> and Zone <b>2</b>, are defined in relation to the equipment and its actual or planned operation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>b</i></figref>, a person has moved into Zone <b>2</b>, which may trigger a first response, as described above and below, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>c</i></figref>, a person has moved into Zone <b>1</b>, which may trigger a different or additional response, as described above and below.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0112">The determination of whether the position of a person is in a safety zone may as discussed above determined by the position of the person within an operation zone relative to the equipment <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>,<b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>of that operation zone. The determination of whether the position of a person is in a safety zone may be determined based on a relative position between the bounding box <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the person and the bounding boxes <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>d </i>of the equipments. For example, the control node may determine the position of the person by monitoring the movement of the bounding box <b>110</b><i>a </i>enclosing the person. Further, the control node may determine the movement of the equipments by monitoring the movement of the bounding boxes which enclose the equipments. Therefore, the control node may determine whether the person is near or within a safety zone by determining a relative position between the bounding box <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the person and the bounding boxes <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>d </i>of the equipment(s). Thus, the control node may determine movement of the bounding box <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the person and the movement of the bounding boxes <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>d </i>of the equipment(s) to determine whether the person is near or within a safety zone of the equipment <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrate example safety indications provided to the person based on a position of a person relative to an equipment on a drill floor. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, the person is moving towards the equipment <b>112</b> operating in safety zone <b>1</b> (i.e., a safety zone of the equipment <b>112</b>). The control node may be configured to determine the movement of the bounding box <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the person and the movement of the bounding boxes <b>112</b><i>b</i>-<b>112</b><i>d </i>of the equipment <b>112</b> to determine whether the person is near or within a safety zone of the equipment <b>112</b>. When the person is determined to be nearing the safety zone of the equipment <b>112</b>, the control node may be configured to provide a safety indication to the person by automatically close the barrier <b>114</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>in order to stop the person from entering the safety zone of the equipment <b>112</b>. The barrier <b>114</b> may be a gate, a barricade, a safety boom, an enclosed structure, or the like which may alert or indicate the person about an impending risk of entering the safety zone of the equipment <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0114">In an example, the barrier <b>114</b> may be activated automatically upon determining that the person is entering the safety zone of the equipment <b>112</b>. Alternatively, the barrier <b>114</b> may be displayed as graphical element or a graphical object such as a safety icon which indicates the person about an impending risk of entering the safety zone of the equipment <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0115">In another example, a safety indication to the person about an impending risk of entering the safety zone of the equipment <b>112</b> can be provided with a light indicator <b>116</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>. For example, the person is indicated about not to enter the safety zone of the equipment <b>112</b> by activating a red light on the light indicator <b>116</b> (the light at the top of the indicator). The yellow light (middle light of the indicator) when activated indicates the person to wait for a time interval for completing an ongoing operation by the equipment <b>112</b>. The green light indication (the light at the bottom of the indicator) allows the person to enter the safety zone of the equipment.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0116">In some examples, an alarm or a buzzer may be activated automatically upon detecting the user entering the safety zone of the equipment <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0117">Thus, the person may be indicated about safety by activating the barrier <b>114</b>, the light indicator <b>116</b>, an alarm or a buzzer, or the like, where these safety indications may be activated automatically. Alternatively, these safety indications may be activated with manual control of the barrier <b>114</b>, the light indicator <b>116</b>, an alarm or a buzzer, or the like. Therefore, the control node enables one or more safety indications to the person on the drill floor through the one or more indications as described above.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a control system node <b>500</b> comprising various modules <b>502</b>-<b>516</b> for monitoring operations in a drilling operation area such as a drill floor <b>100</b>, as disclosed in this disclosure.

The communicator <b>502</b> can be adapted to support one or more suitable communication protocols to receive and process signals from the equipment sensors and/or the sensors worn by the personnel.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0120">The zone classifier <b>504</b> can be configured to define plurality of operation zones in a drilling operation area, such as operation zone <b>1</b>, operation zone <b>2</b>, operation zone <b>3</b> and operation zone <b>4</b> in the drilling operation area as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Further, the zone classifier <b>504</b> can be configured to define the plurality of sub-zones for example sub-zone <b>1</b>, sub-zone <b>2</b> and sub-zone <b>3</b> for an equipment in a drilling operation area, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Thus, the zone classifier <b>504</b> can be configured to define the plurality of operation zones on the drill floor <b>100</b> and/or it can be configured to define plurality of sub-zones for each equipment, wherein the sub-zones may include the safety zone. In some examples, the zone classifier <b>504</b> can be configured to redefine the plurality of operation zones in accordance with a type of operations carried out by the equipment in said operation zone. For example, after the equipment executes a first action (such as rotation of a pipe) in a sequence of tasks in the drilling operation area, the zone classifier <b>504</b> can be configured to redefine the plurality of operation zones in accordance with a second task to be executed by the equipment before starting execution of this second task in the sequence of tasks of the equipment. Thus, the zone classifier <b>504</b> may be configured to redefine the plurality of operation zones in accordance with the type of operations performed in the drilling operation area.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0121">The position identifier <b>506</b> can be configured to identify the position of a person in a drilling operation area. The position identifier <b>506</b> can be configured to extract data or information related to the position of the person through one or more sensors installed in the plurality of zones.
