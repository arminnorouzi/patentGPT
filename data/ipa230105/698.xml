The framework <b>12</b> is configured to be mountable to a frame <b>16</b> of a wheelchair <b>18</b> so that the framework <b>12</b> extends upwardly from a rear <b>20</b> of the wheelchair <b>18</b>. The framework <b>12</b> comprises a pair of siderails <b>22</b>, a top rail <b>24</b>, and a bottom rail <b>26</b>. The top rail <b>24</b> is engaged to and extends between the siderails <b>22</b> defining an upper end <b>28</b> of the framework <b>12</b>. The bottom rail <b>26</b> is engaged to and extends between the siderails <b>22</b> defining a lower end <b>30</b> of the framework <b>12</b>. The bottom rail <b>26</b> may be dimensionally longer than the top rail <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Thus configured, an upper section <b>32</b> of the framework <b>12</b> is configured to be positioned between push handles <b>34</b> that extend from the rear <b>20</b> of the wheelchair <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Each siderail <b>22</b> may comprise an upper segment <b>36</b>, a lower segment <b>38</b>, and a medial segment <b>40</b>. The upper segment <b>36</b> is engaged to and extends perpendicularly from the top rail <b>24</b>. The lower segment <b>38</b> is engaged to and extends perpendicularly from the bottom rail <b>26</b>. The medial segment <b>40</b> is engaged to and extends transversely between the upper segment <b>36</b> and the lower segment <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A plurality of connectors <b>42</b> is engaged to the framework <b>12</b> proximate to the lower end <b>30</b> of the framework <b>12</b>. The connectors <b>42</b> are configured to selectively engage the frame <b>16</b> of the wheelchair <b>18</b> so that the framework <b>12</b> is removably engaged to the wheelchair <b>18</b>. Each connector <b>42</b> may comprise a tube clamp <b>44</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, or other connecting means, such as, but not limited to, quick connects, piping clamps, and the like.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each of a plurality of rods <b>46</b> is engaged to and positioned between the framework <b>12</b> and a respective connector <b>42</b> so that the framework <b>12</b> is offset from the rear <b>20</b> of the wheelchair <b>18</b>. The plurality of rods <b>46</b> comprise four rods <b>46</b> positioned two apiece on opposed sides <b>48</b> of the framework <b>12</b>. The rods <b>46</b> extend substantially perpendicularly from the framework <b>12</b> so that the framework <b>12</b> is substantially parallel to the rear <b>20</b> of the wheelchair <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The canopy <b>14</b> is hingedly engaged to the upper end <b>28</b> of the framework <b>12</b> and is selectively positionable in a stowed configuration and a deployed configuration. In the stowed configuration, the canopy <b>14</b> is substantially parallel to and in abutment with the framework <b>12</b>. In the deployed configuration, the canopy <b>14</b> extends above a seat <b>50</b> of the wheelchair <b>18</b> and is configured to shield a user positioned upon the seat <b>50</b> from one or more of precipitation and sunlight.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The canopy <b>14</b> comprises a pair of sidebars <b>52</b>, an end bar <b>54</b>, and a canvas <b>56</b>. Each sidebar <b>52</b> may comprise a pair of nested sections <b>58</b> so that the sidebar <b>52</b> is selectively extensible. The end bar <b>54</b> is engaged to and extends between the sidebars <b>52</b> distal from the framework <b>12</b>. The canvas <b>56</b> is engaged to and extends between the sidebars <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A handle <b>60</b> is engaged to the end bar <b>54</b> and is configured to be grasped in a hand of the user, positioning the user to selectively extend the sidebars <b>52</b>. The present invention anticipates a pair of first actuators (not shown but comprising servomotors, linear actuators, and the like) being engaged nested sections <b>58</b> for selectively extending the sidebars <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each of a pair of posts <b>62</b> is engaged to and extends from the upper end <b>28</b> of the framework <b>12</b>, such that the pair of posts <b>62</b> and the framework <b>12</b> are substantially coplanar. Each of a pair of hinges <b>64</b> is operationally engaged a respective post <b>62</b> and the canopy <b>14</b>. The hinges <b>64</b> are configured for 270&#xb0; hinging of the canopy <b>14</b> relative to the framework <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The present invention anticipates a pair of second actuators (not shown but comprising servomotors and the like) engaged to the hinges <b>64</b> and being configured for selectively motivating the canopy <b>14</b> between the stowed configuration and the deployed configuration.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A set of roller panels <b>66</b> is engaged to a perimeter <b>68</b> of the canopy <b>14</b>. Each roller panel <b>66</b> is selectively extensible from a rolled position to a deployed position. In the deployed position, the roller panel <b>66</b> extends from the canopy <b>14</b> to proximate to the seat <b>50</b> of the wheelchair <b>18</b>. The set of roller panels <b>66</b> is configured to shield the user positioned on the seat <b>50</b> of the wheelchair <b>18</b>. The roller panels <b>66</b> are transparent so that the user can see through the roller panels <b>66</b>. The roller panels <b>66</b> may be spring loaded or clutch driven such that the roller panels <b>66</b> are biased to the rolled position. The present invention anticipates the roller panels <b>66</b> being weighted to help them remain in position when exposed to wind. The set of roller panels <b>66</b> comprises a pair of side screens <b>70</b>, which are engaged singly to the sidebars <b>52</b>, and a front screen <b>72</b>, which is engaged to the end bar <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In use, the canopy <b>14</b> and the roller panels <b>66</b> are selectively deployable in inclement weather to protect the user from exposure to rain, snow, and the like, when other sheltering options are not available. The wheelchair shielding device <b>10</b>, unlike an umbrella, shields the user without requiring use of their hands, thus freeing their hands for other tasks, such as rolling or otherwise operating the wheelchair <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure. In this patent document, the word &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; is used in its non-limiting sense to mean that items following the word are included, but items not specifically mentioned are not excluded. A reference to an element by the indefinite article &#x201c;a&#x201d; does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the element is present, unless the context clearly requires that there be only one of the elements.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>I claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
