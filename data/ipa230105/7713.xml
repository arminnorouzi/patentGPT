With the evolution of new business scenarios and the emergence of new business scenarios, the technical solutions according to the embodiments of the disclosure are also applicable to similar technical problems.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a structural schematic diagram of a wireless communication system according to an embodiment of the disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the wireless communication system is a communication system based on cellular mobile communication technology, and the wireless communication system may include several terminals <b>110</b> and several base stations <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The terminal <b>110</b> may be a device that provides voice and/or data connectivity to a user. The terminal <b>110</b> may communicate with one or more core networks via a radio access network (RAN), and the terminal <b>110</b> may be an Internet of things (IoT) terminal such as a sensor device, a mobile phone (or a &#x201c;cellular&#x201d; phone), and a computer with the IoT terminal. For example, the terminal <b>110</b> may be a fixed, portable, pocket, hand-held, built-in computer or a vehicle-mounted apparatus. For example, the terminal <b>110</b> may be a station (STA), a subscriber unit, a subscriber station, a mobile station, a mobile, a remote station, an access point, a remote terminal, an access terminal, a user terminal, a user agent, a user device, or a user equipment (UE). Alternatively, the terminal <b>110</b> may also be a device of an unmanned aerial vehicle. Alternatively, the terminal <b>110</b> may also be a vehicle-mounted device, for example, a trip computer with a wireless communication function, or a wireless communication device connected to the external trip computer. Alternatively, the terminal <b>110</b> may also be an infrastructure, for example, a streetlight, a signal light, or other infrastructure with a wireless communication function.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The base station <b>120</b> may be a network-side device in a wireless communication system. The wireless communication system may be the 4th generation mobile communication (4G) system, also known as a long term evolution (LTE) system. Alternatively, the wireless communication system may also be a 5G system, also known as new radio (NR) system or 5G NR system. Alternatively, the wireless communication system may also be a next-generation system of the 5G system. The access network in the 5G system may be called a new generation-radio access network (NG-RAN).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The base station <b>120</b> may be an evolved base station (eNB) used in the 4G system. Alternatively, the base station <b>120</b> may also be a base station (gNB) that adopts a centralized distributed architecture in a 5G system. When the base station <b>120</b> adopts the centralized distributed architecture, it usually includes a central unit (CU) and at least two distributed units (DUs). The CU is provided with protocol stacks of a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer, a radio link control (RLC) protocol layer, and a medium access control (MAC) layer. The DU is provided with a protocol stack of a physical (PHY) layer. The specific implementation of the base station <b>120</b> is not limited in this embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A wireless connection may be established between the base station <b>120</b> and the terminal <b>110</b> through a wireless air interface. In different embodiments, the wireless air interface is a wireless air interface based on the fourth generation mobile communication network technology (4G) standard or a wireless air interface based on the fifth generation mobile communication network technology (5G) standard. For example, the wireless air interface is a new air interface. Alternatively, the wireless air interface may also be a wireless air interface based on a 5G next-generation mobile communication network technology standard.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, an end-to-end (E2E) connection may also be established between the terminals <b>110</b>, for example, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication and vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) communication and other communication scenes in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the wireless communication system may further include a network management device <b>130</b>. In such embodiments, several base stations <b>120</b> are connected to the network management device <b>130</b>. The network management device <b>130</b> may be a core network device in a wireless communication system. For example, the network management device <b>130</b> may be a mobility management entity (MME) in an evolved packet core (EPC). Alternatively, the network management device may also be other core network devices, such as a serving gateway (SGW), a public data network gateway (PGW), a policy and charging rules function (PCRF) or a home subscriber server (HSS), etc. The implementation of the network management device <b>130</b> is not limited in this embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the 5G NR system, especially when the communication frequency band is in a frequency range 2 (above 6 GHz), due to fast attenuation of a high-frequency channel, the terminal and the base station need to use beam-based transmission and reception to ensure the coverage. To ensure the coverage, beams are usually used for transmission and reception. In the related art, it is considered that the base station sends information to the terminal by using an antenna panel, and the terminal receives the information sent by the base station by using an antenna panel, which may lead to a problem of insufficient spatial diversity during information transmission.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In embodiments of the disclosure, communication between a terminal and a cell may be understood as communication between the terminal and a base station corresponding to the cell.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the embodiment provides a method for wireless communication, which is applied to a terminal with a plurality of antenna panels. The method includes the step at S<b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">At S<b>110</b>, different antenna panels are used to communicate with a first cell and a second cell respectively. The first cell is a serving cell of the terminal, and the second cell is not the serving cell of the terminal.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the terminal has two or more antenna panels, the terminal may use different antenna panels to communicate with different cells through different connections.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment of the disclosure, a terminal with a plurality of antenna panels may use different antenna panels to communicate with different cells. For example, the terminal may use different antenna panels simultaneously to communicate with the first cell and the second cell, respectively. The first cell may be a current serving cell of the terminal. The second cell may be a neighboring cell of the serving cell, but is not limited to a neighboring cell. The second cell may be a cell with which the terminal may communicate at the current location through the antenna panel. The second cell is a cell different from the first cell.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this way, the terminal may use its own multi-antenna panel to communicate with a plurality of cells at the same time, so that the terminal located in an overlapping area of the plurality of cells may use different antenna panels to communicate with different cells, thus reducing a phenomenon where the communication effect is poor due to poor communication quality in a single serving cell when performing communication with a single serving cell, and ultimately improving the communication quality of the terminal.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, in some embodiments, the terminal may communicate with the first cell using one or more first antenna panels while one or more additional second antenna panels are used to communicate with the second cell.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the method further includes the step at S<b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">At S<b>100</b>, downlink control information (DCI) is received on a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH). The DCI indicates one or more transmission configuration indication (TCI) states. The TCI state is configured to indicate at least one beam for transmitting a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), and one or more TCI states correspond to the first cell and/or the second cell.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">At this time, the S<b>110</b> may include: receiving PDSCH transmission of the first cell and/or the second cell based on the TCI states indicated by the DCI.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The TCI state is received on one PDCCH, and one PDCCH may belong to one cell.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this embodiment of the disclosure, the PDCCH may be the PDCCH of the first cell. In some specific cases, the PDCCH on which the DCI indicating TCI states is sent may also be the PDCCH of the second cell.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The DCI for indicating TCI states received on one PDCCH of the first cell may be used to indicate one or more TCI states, and the TCI states may be used to indicate beams for PDSCH transmission.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The PDSCH transmission here is one of the communications between the terminal and the first cell and/or the second cell.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The antenna panel may include a reception panel for data reception and a transmission panel for data transmission.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, when the DCI indicates a plurality of TCI states, each of the TCI states corresponds to a different reception panel of the terminal, and different reception panels of the terminal use the plurality of TCI states indicated by the DCI to receive PDSCH data sent by a plurality of transceiver points (TRPs) or antenna panels for the serving cell, respectively.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In other embodiments, when the DCI indicates a plurality of TCI states, each of the TCI states corresponds to a different receiving panel of the terminal, and different receiving panels of the terminal use the plurality of TCI states indicated by the DCI to receive PDSCH data sent by a plurality of transceiver points (TRPs) or antenna panels for a neighboring cell respectively. The neighboring cell here is the aforementioned second cell.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, when the DCI indicates a plurality of TCI states, each of the TCI states corresponds to a different receiving panel of the terminal. For different receiving panels of the terminal that use the plurality of TCI states indicated by the DCI, some receiving panels are configured to receive the PDSCH data sent by the transceiver points (TRPs) or antenna panels for the serving cell through the corresponding TCI states, while other receiving panels are configured to receive the PDSCH data sent by the plurality of transceiver points (TRPs) or antenna panels for the neighboring cell through the corresponding TCI states. The neighboring cell here is the aforementioned second cell.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">That is, the DCI may dynamically instruct a plurality of antenna panels of the terminal to receive the PDSCH data sent from the transceiver Points (TRPs) or antenna panels for the serving cell and/or the neighboring cell through the corresponding TCI states.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this way, when the terminal receives the corresponding DCI, it may determine which beam to serve for the PDSCH transmission based on the TCI states indicated by the DCI. Further, the terminal may receive the PDSCH data from the first cell and/or the second cell through one or more reception beams on one or more antenna panels of the terminal based on the TCI states indicated by the DCI. The PDSCH data here is data transmitted by using the PDSCH, and the PDSCH data may include data and control signaling.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, time units corresponding to the plurality of TCI states are the same or different.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the time units corresponding to the plurality of TCI states are the same, it means that the terminal simultaneously receives data from different beam transmission directions by using the reception beams corresponding to the plurality of TCI states, that is, time domain resources corresponding to the received data by using the plurality of TCI states are the same. For example, in the same slot or the same mini-slot, the serving cell transmits data to the terminal by using a beam transmission direction <b>1</b> of one antenna panel, while the neighboring cell also transmits data to the terminal by using a beam transmission direction <b>2</b> of another antenna panel.

The second cell here may be any cell other than the current serving cell of the terminal, for example, a neighboring cell of the serving cell or a cell with other network types within the serving cell.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0159">The terminal obtains the reference signal configuration for beam measurement, which includes a plurality of methods.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0160">The base station to which the second cell belongs, sends the reference signal configuration for beam measurement to a serving base station to which the first cell of the terminal belongs. The serving base station then sends the reference signal configuration for beam measurement to the terminal.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0161">A plurality of TCI states are transmitted to the terminal on the same PDCCH. Here, the TCI states are used for beam indication of downlink PDSCH reception, and the plurality of TCI states correspond to the same cell or different cells.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0162">The plurality of TCI states correspond to the same time unit, or different time units. Corresponding to the same time unit means that the terminal uses the plurality of TCI states to simultaneously receive data.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0163">Corresponding to different time units means that the terminal uses different TCI states to receive data at different times.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0164">When the corresponding time units are different, the plurality of time units may all be mini-slots, the plurality of time units are in the same slot, and a plurality of time units may also be a plurality of slots.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0165">The data content transmitted in the plurality of time units may be the same, i.e., sending repeatedly to improve reliability. The data content may also be different to improve throughput.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0166">Since the DCI state may indicate a plurality of TCI states, which may be the same cell or different cells, a plurality of TCI states (such as 128 or 64 TCI states) need to be configured for different cells when configuring the TCI state for the terminal by the RRC state.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0167">The TCI states activated by the MAC signaling are N TCI states among the plurality of TCI states configured by the RRC signaling, for example, N is equal to 8 or 16. The TCI states activated by the MAC signaling need to include the TCI states of different cells at the same time.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0168">The MAC signaling may also include a correspondence between TCI state combinations and one or more TCI states activated by the MAC. For example, 8 TCI states are activated, the first cell corresponds to TCI #i, TCI #i+3, TCI #i+6 and TCI #i+15, and the second cell corresponds to TCI #j, TCI #j+2, TCI #j+7 and TCI #j+11. The correspondence between TCI combinations and one or more TCI states is shown in the above Table 1.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0169">The DCI indicates TCI states:</p><p id="p-0173" num="0170">The DCI may indicate the TCI states corresponding to the renumbered values of the MAC-activated TCI states, for example, a plurality of MAC-activated TCI states are firstly grouped and sorted according to the cells.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0171">For example, the TCI state serial number of the first cell is at the front, and the TCI state serial number of the second cell is at the back. Numbering is then performed according to the TCI state ID in each cell, and a new serial number is still smaller after the TCI state with a smaller original serial number is renumbered. After the plurality of TCI states are renumbered, new serial numbers are as shown in the above Table 2. In some embodiments, the second cell may include: a target cell to be accessed by the terminal.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0172">That is, the DCI state directly corresponds to the new serial number after renumbering. For example, when the DCI is 3 bits, &#x201c;000&#x201d; corresponds to the renumbered TCI #0, &#x201c;001&#x201d; corresponds to the renumbered TCI #1, . . . , &#x201c;111&#x201d; corresponds to the renumbered TCI #7. The details may refer to the above Table 2.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0173">a) the DCI may also correspond to the TCI state combination ID in the mapping table given by the MAC signaling, for example, &#x201c;000&#x201d; identifies a TCI state corresponding to the TCI state combination #0, &#x201c;001&#x201d; identifies a TCI state corresponding to the TCI state combination #1, . . . , &#x201c;111&#x201d; identifies a TCI state corresponding to the TCI state combination #7.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0174">b) The number of bits used by the DCI to indicate the TCI states may be 3 bits or 4 bits or more, which is determined based on the TCI states activated by the MAC and whether the MAC signaling includes a mapping relationship between the TCI state combinations and one or more TCI states.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0175">For example, when the number of TCI states activated by the MAC signaling is large, the number of bits used by the DCI to indicate the TCI states is large; when the MAC signaling indicates a mapping relationship between TCI state combinations and one or more TCI states, the number of bits used by the DCI to indicate the TCI states is small.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a block diagram of a device <b>800</b> for wireless communication according to an embodiment.
