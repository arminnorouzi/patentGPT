In particular, it relates to DNA repair rate analysis which can assess rates of DNA double strand break repair mechanisms.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">DNA repair pathways are frequently defective in human cancers. DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs) are most often repaired by either homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Alterations in repair pathways can indicate sensitivity to therapeutic agents such as PARP inhibitors, cisplatin, and immunotherapy. Thus, functional assays to measure rates of HR and NHEJ are of significant interest. Several methods have been developed to measure rates of HR or NHEJ; however, there is a need for functional cell-based assays that can measure rates by both DNA DSB pathways simultaneously. Described herein are methods to assess rates of HR and NHEJ mediated repair of Cas9 programmed DSB simultaneously using a novel fluorescence switching reporter system, wherein the method can include a flow cytometry assay. The assay exhibits low background signal and is capable of detecting rare repair events in the 1 in 10,000 range. The utility of the assay was demonstrated by measuring the potency of inhibitors of ATM (KU-60019, KU-55933), DNA-PK (NU7441), and PARP (Olaparib) on modulating DSB repair rates in HEK293FT cells. The selective ATM inhibitor KU-60019 inhibited HR rates with IC50 of 915 nM. Interestingly, KU-60019 exposure led to a dose responsive increase in rates of NHEJ. In contrast, the less selective ATM inhibitor KU-55933, which also has activity on DNA-PK, showed inhibition of both HR and NHEJ. The selective DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 inhibited NHEJ efficiency with an IC50 of 299 nM, and showed a dose responsive increase in HR. The PARP inhibitor Olaparib showed lower potency in modulating HR and NHEJ. The assay was then used the to assess how pharmacological and genetic inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) impacted rates of HR and NHEJ. The DNMT inhibitor decitabine reduced HR, but increased rates of NHEJ, both in a dose responsive manner, in both HEK293FT and HCT116 cells (IC50 for HR of 187 nM and 1.4 uM respectively). Knockout of DNMT1 and DNMT3B increased NHEJ, while knockout of DNMT3B, but not DNMT1, reduced HR. These results illustrate the utility of RepairSwitch as a functional assay for measuring changes in rates of DSB repair induced by pharmacological or genetic perturbation. Furthermore, the findings illustrate the potential for one DNA repair mechanism to compensate in part for loss of another. Finally, it was shown that inhibition of DNMT can lead to reduction of HR and increase in NHEJ, providing some additional insight into recently observed synergy of DNMT inhibitors with PARP inhibitors for cancer treatment.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Provided herein are methods for determining a rate of DNA double strand repair on a DNA strand in a cell, the method comprising: (a) delivering a reporter gene, a gene-editing agent, and a gene-repair template into a cell, wherein the gene-editing agent generates a DNA double strand break on the DNA strand; (b) detecting a change in reporter gene expression, wherein the change in reporter gene expression indicates the presence of a DNA double strand repair event; and (c) analyzing the change in reporter gene expression, thereby determining the rate of DNA double strand repair on the DNA strand in the cell.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the reporter gene comprises a DsRed, an EGFP, a BFP reporter gene, or any combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the gene-editing agent comprises CRISPR/Cas9 components.

Additionally, it was utilized to provide statistical analyses of p value using unpaired t-tests.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 1&#x2014;Overview of RepairSwitch Assay Principles</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0067">The RepairSwitch assay was developed to measure the balance of HR- and NHEJ-mediated double-strand break (DSB) repair. To accomplish this, it was necessary to design assay vectors that could be lenti-virally transduced into cells and would thereby be incorporated into the genome. It was determined that a fluorescent dual reporter system, using CMV-DsRed and EF1a-EGFP, would be most effective (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). This design gave a strong expression of both fluorescent markers. Additionally, it allowed DsRed to serve as a transduction control to ensure vector integration at an MOI of 0.3, while EGFP served as a target for CRISPR/Cas9 induced DSB. Utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system as a means of DNA damage induction allowed to ensure targeted DSB events to the fluorophore of the EGFP locus at a rate of 1 DSB per cell. Additionally, in conjunction with the administration of the CRISPR/Cas9 EGFP gRNA, exogenous single stranded DNA oligos were administered in excess and act as the repair template. In this system, the resulting fluorescence, post CRISPR/Cas9 cutting at the target locus, is dependent on the method of repair. Upon utilization of the repair template in repair via homologous recombination (HR) the resulting locus will be converted from EGFP to BFP. This is possible due to the sequence similarity of these fluorescent proteins, which differ in only two bases, resulting in the substitution of two adjacent amino acids. However, if the repair template is not utilized and repair occurs via the non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ), there are two possible outcomes. Either, the EGFP fluorescence will be extinguished due to the error prone repair, or it is possible for the EGFP protein to be repaired correctly or with a silent mutation via NHEJ, thereby producing a viable fluorescent signal. However, those rare events will be indistinguishable from the DsRed+GFP+ population comprised of cells that did not experience cutting by CRISPR/Cas9. This can be due to lack of transfection by the vector or due to inaccessibility of the EGFP locus resulting from its integration in a heterochromatic region of the genome. A schematic of the RepairSwitch assay readout (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) provides a concise overview of the possible fluorescent outcomes and their respective implications.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Example 2&#x2014;Assay Performance with Control/Reference Samples</heading><p id="p-0071" num="0068">This assay was performed in both HEK293FT and HCT116 cells. Flow cytometry was used to quantify results, utilizing a gating strategy designed to reduce noise while maintaining a high degree of sensitivity, detecting rare events in the 1 in 10,000 range (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). The results show that the expression of BFP, indicating HR has occurred, will only take place in the presence of both the CRISPR/Cas9 EGFP gRNA and the repair template (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>). However, this is not the case for NHEJ. In HEK293FT but not HCT116 cells, EGFP signal loss is increased upon transfection of the ssDNA oligo repair template alone, indicating NHEJ has occurred at the EGFP locus without the presence of the CRISPR/Cas9 EGFP gRNA. As expected, in both cell types, the CRISPR/Cas9 EGFP gRNA alone induces loss of EGFP signal as a result of repair by NHEJ, as no repair template is available. Interestingly, the addition of both the repair template and the CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA has an additive effect on the rate NHEJ in HEK293FT cells, as seen by the higher rates of NHEJ when in combination with either of the components on their own. However, this was not observed in HCT116 cells. In HCT116 cells, the addition of both repair template and CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA results in a lower rate of NHEJ than with the gRNA alone. These results show that the RepairSwitch assay is both modular and sensitive.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 3&#x2014;Impact of Genetic Modulation of Repair Factors on Rates of Repair</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0069">In order to verify the RepairSwitch assay's efficacy in measuring rates of HR and NHEJ, the impact of genetic modulation of ATM was tested, an important and well-studied HR repair protein, in CWR22Rv1 cell lines. As expected, there was a significant reduction in the rate of HR in the ATM&#x2212;/&#x2212; line as compared to WT (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). However, surprisingly, there was also a significant increase in the rate of NHEJ in the ATM&#x2212;/&#x2212; cells as compared to WT (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 4&#x2014;Impact of Pharmacological Inhibition of DNA Repair Enzymes on Rates of Repair</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0070">Utilizing a number of drugs targeting several repair factors as detailed in Table 1, the impact of pharmacological inhibition on rates of HR and NHEJ in HEK293FT cells was tested. Continuing the focus on ATM, two drugs that target the ATM protein were used, with varying degrees of potency and specificity, to ascertain whether pharmacological inhibition produced similar results to genetic manipulation of the ATM protein. KU-60019 is a potent and specific ATM inhibitor, while KU-55933 is both less potent and less specific. To ensure these drugs were non-toxic to the cells, proliferation was assayed using the Incucyte system, which showed that these drugs minimally attenuate cell growth even at higher doses. These results can be found in the supplemental material (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>). For both KU-60019 and KU-55933, HR was reduced in a dose responsive manner with an IC50 of 915 nM and 2.6 uM respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>). However, rates of NHEJ for the two drugs differed due to their difference in target specificity. The high degree of specificity of KU-60019 for ATM and the HR pathway, can be observed by the lack of negative impact on the rate of NHEJ with its usage. Interestingly, the rate of NHEJ can be seen to increase in a dose responsive manner as a result of KU-60019 usage. These results are consistent with our previous findings regarding the impact of genetic manipulation of ATM on the rates of HR and NHEJ. In contrast, KU-55933 has been shown to have off target effects on DNA-PK at high doses, an important component of the NHEJ pathway. This is reflected in the dose responsive reduction in rates of NHEJ in following treatment with this drug (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">The pharmacological inhibition of NHEJ components was then observed, namely DNA-PK, to assess its impact on rates of HR and NHEJ in HEK293FT cells. To do so, NU-7441 was utlized, a potent and specific inhibitor of DNA-PK. Incucyte cell proliferation assays were performed to assess the toxicity of this drug, and it was found to inhibit cell growth at higher doses (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>). Therefore, doses that were high enough to impact cell growth were removed from this dose curve so as not to impact the data. As expected, the usage of this DNA-PK inhibitor results in a dose-dependent reduction in rates of NHEJ (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). However, interestingly, rates of HR also increase in a dose responsive manner. This is similar to the effect on NHEJ seen when components of HR are inhibited.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">Lastly, the RepairSwitch assay was used to provide insight into the repair function of PARP by evaluating the impact of its inhibition on rates of HR and NHEJ. These results show a subtle reduction in rates of HR and a corresponding subtle increase in the rates of NHEJ (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>-5B). Proliferation was assessed during Olaparib treatment as well, and shows it to minimally attenuate cell growth at higher doses (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 5&#x2014;Impact of Donor Template DNA Methylation on Rates of Repair</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0073">As shown previously, the RepairSwitch Assay is designed to be versatile, and can be used to explore numerous variables that may impact rates of repair by HR and NHEJ. Here the impact of donor template DNA methylation on rates of repair was investigated. This was accomplished by using donor template DNA that is either devoid of methylation or fully methylated at all seven CpG sites within the approximately 100 bp ssOligo. This experiment was performed in both HEK293FT cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref>) and HCT116 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C-<b>6</b>D</figref>). These results show a significant decrease in the rates of both HR (p=&#x3c;0.0001) and NHEJ (p=0.0004) in HEK293FT cells when a methylated template is provided versus an unmethylated one. However, the same cannot be said of HCT116 cells, in which there was no significant difference in HR with the methylated template as compared to unmethylated. Additionally, NHEJ (p=0.0232) repair shows a small but significant increase in rates when using the methylated template as compared to unmethylated. To ensure that these results are not due to differences in how the cells recognize methylated versus unmethylated donor template DNA, statistical analysis was performed on samples that received the control template alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>D</figref>). These results showed that there were no significant differences in the rates of either HR or NHEJ upon use of either template.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Example 6&#x2014;Impact of DNMT Inhibitors on Rates of Repair</heading><p id="p-0077" num="0074">In order to investigate the potential role of the DNA methylation machinery in repair, pharmacological inhibition of DNA-methyltransferases was used to assess the impact of loss of these pathway components on rates of HR and NHEJ. This experiment was performed in both HEK293FT and HCT116 cells. As DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors can be toxic to cells, Incucyte cell proliferation assays were performed to ensure doses at which cell growth was inhibited were excluded from our analysis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>B</figref>). Decitabine, a cytidine analog that traps DNMTs on the DNA, was used in these experiments. Tesults show that treatment with Decitabine results in a dose responsive decrease in the rates of HR, and a compensatory increase in the rates of NHEJ in HEK239FT cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>). These results were also consistent in HCT116 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C-<b>7</b>D</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Example 7&#x2014;Impact of Genetic Manipulation of DNMT Genes on Rates of Repair</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0075">In order to get a clearer understanding of the role of DNMTs in repair, it was determined whether these results are consistent when genetic manipulation of these components are applied. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic manipulation are complementary approaches with distinct differences. Where pharmacological inhibition of DNMTs will trap these proteins and deplete them through proteolytic degradation, genetic manipulation will remove the proteins entirely and prevent any engagement with DNA to begin with. Using HCT116 WT, DNMT1 KO, and DNMT3B KO cells, rates of HR and NHEJ (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>) were compared. DNMT1 KO cells had slightly increased rates of HR as compared to WT, whereas DNMT3B KO cells exhibited a drastic decrease in rates of HR as compared to WT HCT116 cells. NHEJ was significantly increased in both HCT116 DNMT KO and DNMT3B KO cells as compared to WT. This is consistent with what was seen with pharmacological inhibition using Decitabine.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230003718A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230003718A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230003718A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230003718A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230003718A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230003718A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230003718A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230003718A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230003718A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230003718A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230003718A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230003718A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
