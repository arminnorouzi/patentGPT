The same or similar reference numerals refer to the same or similar elements or elements having the same or similar functions.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, a method for preparing a semiconductor device is provided. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method includes the following operations S<b>101</b> to S<b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">At the operation of S<b>101</b>, a substrate is provided, and a first dielectric layer is formed on one side of the substrate. The substrate includes an array area and a peripheral area arranged outside of the array area.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">At the operation of S<b>102</b>, an initial mask pattern is formed on the first dielectric layer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">At the operation of S<b>103</b>, at least two patterning processes are performed on the initial mask pattern, to form a first mask pattern in the array area and to form a second mask pattern in the peripheral area. The first mask pattern has a first height. The second mask pattern has a second height. The second height is greater than the first height. Both of the array area and the peripheral area are exposed by each of the at least two patterning processes.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should be noted that an optical proximity effect is that the energy distribution and phase distribution of an image intensity spectrum have a certain distortion relative to an ideal image spectrum due to the nonlinear spatial filtering during a partially coherent imaging process. And finally the imaging quality is greatly reduced, i.e., the optical proximity effect is induced. The ideal image intensity spectrum distribution depends on the characteristic size, shape and distribution law of the lines on the mask, and the corners or the sharp lines provide more high-frequency components for the spectrum. However, due to the limitation of diffraction, these high-frequency components cannot reach the corners corresponding to an actual spatial image plane through the system, which will inevitably lead to the mismatch of light intensity distribution of a spatial image at the corners, so as to cause rounding or distortion of the lines of the actual spatial image at the corners.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the method for preparing the semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the disclosure, a complete mask pattern may be obtained by at least two patterning processes including the exposure, i.e., the mask pattern in the peripheral area may be split, and a complex mask pattern may be split into a plurality of simple patterns for exposing for several times. Therefore, the optical proximity effect can be reduced, the rounded corners of the mask pattern in the peripheral area can be avoided, and the appearance of the mask pattern of the peripheral area can be improved, thereby improving the manufacturing yield of the mask pattern in the peripheral area, and also reducing the leakage current of the semiconductor device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be noted that, in the method for preparing the semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the disclosure, the at least two patterning processes may be performed on the initial mask pattern to form the first mask pattern and the second mask pattern, and subsequently the first mask pattern and the second mask pattern may be transferred to the first dielectric layer and the substrate sequentially by taking the first mask pattern and the second mask pattern as a mask. The areas, corresponding to the first mask pattern and the second mask pattern, on the substrate may be active areas of the semiconductor. And the area, other than the first mask pattern and the second mask pattern, on the substrate may be a conductive area (i.e., a source and drain contact area).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, at the operation of S<b>101</b>, the first dielectric layer may be formed on one side of a substrate.
