Each year, over 60 million surgical procedures are performed in the United States. While great care may be taken to prevent surgical complications, one commonly overlooked and under-addressed problem is the risk of developing hypothermia before, during, or after surgery (referred to as &#x201c;inadvertent perioperative hypothermia&#x201d; or &#x201c;IPH&#x201d;). For example, patient temperatures can drop precipitously during surgery due to the effects of general anesthesia, lack of insulating clothing, and/or exposure to cold operating room temperatures. Even with modem standards of care, approximately 30-50% of surgical patients may develop hypothermia.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Hypothermia often causes much more than patient discomfort. Patients who suffer even mild IPH can face a significantly elevated risk of developing surgical site infections, cardiac morbidities, intraoperative bleeding, and other avoidable complications. Together, these complications can significantly increase recovery time and overall length of hospital stay, leading to increased costs for all parties. By some estimates, the unmanaged risk for IPH is a $15 billion problem in the United States alone, and yet it is largely overlooked.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Perioperative heat loss can occur predominantly via convective heat transfer, particularly through the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and exposed surgical site surface area. During preoperative care, patients are often dressed solely in a gown and are often exposed to relatively cold waiting areas with little to no insulation. Although patients are generally only anesthetized at the start of surgery, patients often arrive at the surgical theater moderately hypothermic. This can put a patient at greater risk for developing severe hypothermia once anesthesia has been administered. Postoperative drops in core temperature can increase the likelihood of developing additional comorbidities, such as morbid cardiac outcomes, surgical site infections, and blood loss, any of which can prolong recovery and hospitalization.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Patients undergoing surgery can develop hypothermia during the surgical procedure itself, especially when the procedure involves the patient's core area, such as procedures involving the posterior or anterior sides of the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic regions. Surgeries of the core involve the exposure of vital internal organs to the colder environment and thus carry a greater risk of hypothermia. Furthermore, core surgeries often necessitate uncovering of the trunk and chest, which render blankets and many other currently-available interventions inadequate. Once in the operating room, patients may be naked and exposed to a room temperature well below 36 degrees Celsius and to cold liquids used to wash the surgical site during sterilization preparation. At the onset of surgery, delivered anesthetics can immediately impair the normal autonomic thermoregulatory controls. Colder blood may be transferred from the peripheries of the body to the core through a phenomenon known as redistributive hypothermia. Vasodilatation and reduction in muscle tone can cause a significant drop in core temperature within the first half-hour of surgery.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Overall, compared to non-hypothermic patients, those who suffer from IPH experience greater rates of surgical site infections, bleeding, and cardiac complications. Such issues may require additional monitoring and/or increase the length of stay and/or subjective discomfort. The development of IPH is strongly correlated with a multitude of physiological organ system changes impacting the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, immunologic, hematologic, drug-metabolic, and wound-healing mechanisms. The incidence of several post-surgical complications can be increased due to even mild hypothermia.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Intraoperatively, hypothermia can cause a decrease in cardiac output and heart rate, which can lead to ventricular dysrhythmias. Platelet functions can become impaired and there can be a decrease in coagulation factors, which can, in turn, lead to greater intraoperative bleeding and blood loss. Impaired immune functions can increase the rate of surgical site infections. Hypothermia is associated with a four-fold increase in surgical wound infection and twice as many morbid cardiac events. In select procedures such as colorectal, gynecologic, or spinal surgery, where infection rates are normally higher than other surgeries, hypothermia can be exceedingly dangerous to the intraoperative and postoperative recovery. These complications and others are supported in multiple studies and can result in both clinical and economic burdens.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Current methods of preventing hypothermia often are not completely effective. Even with the current interventions, up to 46% of patients are reported to be hypothermic at the start of surgery, and 33% are hypothermic upon arrival to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Assuming the cost savings for maintaining normothermia in one patient is approximately $5,000 per patient, and approximately 30% of the 17 million high-risk surgical patients are hypothermic, a system-wide cost savings of $15 billion could be realized by keeping these patients normothermic. With rising healthcare costs and recent initiatives mandating the maintenance of perioperative normothermia, hospital administrators are in need of new, efficacious and cost-effective devices to address perioperative hypothermia, a product space that has seen little innovation since the introduction of the forced-air warming blanket nearly three decades ago.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Some solutions for perioperative warming may implement forced-air temperature management devices (e.g., warming blankets). For example, some temperature management solutions utilize high-heat transfer conduction heating blankets and intraoperative hand-warming devices. In embodiments in which heated fluid exits a blanket device towards the patient and/or into the surgical environment, such air may introduce certain contaminants into the surgical environment, which can result in infection or other medical issues. That is, it may be desirable for the surgical environment to be substantially sterile to prevent exposure of the patient anatomy, which may be of a particular concern with respect to internal patient anatomy that may be exposed to the surgical environment during the relevant procedure/operation. Forced-air, blanket-type heating systems may further present a relatively cumbersome physical structure that can get in the way, such as when the blanket is disposed in an area near the surgical site. Furthermore, in some situations, operating room staff may turn down the temperature on a forced-air device in consideration of their own comfort, as forced-air systems can heat the surrounding air/environment. Moreover, certain devices may not be used in preoperative warming for one or more of the following reasons, among others: (1) some devices may immobilize the upper limbs, impeding patient mobilization; (2) devices may be cumbersome (e.g., a device may float on the patient and get blown off or fall off during use and/or transport, and they require large, predominantly floor-based blowers that may not be mobile; (3) they may not attach to the patient and/or can become dislodged during transport and obstruct the bed and other monitors and devices; and (4) they can require a conscious administrative decision to implement.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Embodiments of the present disclosure advantageously provide certain improved devices, methods, and systems for maintaining a patient's core body temperature before, during, and/or after surgery. In some embodiments, lower limbs of patients may be leveraged to provide therapy and/or enable mobility. For example, some devices described herein may provide flexibility and/or one or more spaces around a knee, ankle, and/or other portions of a patient's body to allow the patient to flex and/or extend the limbs. Such patient mobility may provide a variety of benefits, including allowing patients to stand up to use the restroom without removing and reapplying the device.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Some embodiments of temperature management devices disclosed herein may be configured to provide warming to one or more arteries and/or veins passing along the patient's lower limbs. Moreover, some embodiments may utilize electrical heating pads comprising one or more electrical conductors configured to radiate heat in response to the flow of electrical current therethrough. Such heating pads may advantageously have certain slits/cut-outs and/or shapes/features designed to permit the pad to assume an uneven topology, thereby allowing for the pad(s) to be placed against, and conform to, an uneven anatomical surface, such as the surface of the popliteal fossa and/or sole of the foot.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Temperature-Management Sleeves and Systems</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of a surgical system <b>100</b> including a patient-heating subsystem <b>120</b> in accordance with one or more embodiments. The system <b>100</b> includes a sleeve-type patient-heating subsystem <b>120</b>, which can represent an alternative to a blanket-type heating system as referenced above. The sleeve-type heating subsystem <b>120</b> can include one or more temperature-management sleeves <b>30</b> disposed over and/or on portion(s) of one or more lower limbs <b>10</b> (e.g., legs) of the patient <b>5</b>. The sleeve(s) <b>30</b> can include one or more heating elements/devices (referred to herein as &#x201c;heaters,&#x201d; &#x201c;heating pads,&#x201d; &#x201c;heating pad assemblies,&#x201d; etc.), wherein at least one of such heating elements or devices <b>34</b> is positioned on or over the sole <b>3</b> of the foot <b>6</b> of the patient <b>5</b> when the sleeve <b>30</b> is disposed on the lower limb <b>10</b>, whereas another heating element/device <b>32</b> is placed on or over the popliteal fossa <b>9</b> of the lower limb <b>10</b>, on an opposite side of the limb <b>10</b> from the knee <b>8</b>. The heating pads <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> can have any of the features described herein and may advantageously be flexible and include one or more cut-outs, slits, breaks, channels, or the like that provide hinges and/or other flexible bend points to allow for contortion of the pads to fit the target anatomical topology.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The sleeve <b>30</b> may advantageously be open around the knee <b>8</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, thereby providing flexibility, comfort, and/or access to the knee <b>8</b> when the sleeve <b>30</b> is disposed on the patient's leg <b>10</b>. The opening around the knee may further advantageously guide placement of the heating pad <b>32</b>, such that it is positioned in a desirable position over the popliteal fossa. Furthermore, implementation of the sleeve <b>30</b> such that the knee portion is open and/or uncovered may be tenable due to the heating in that region of the leg <b>10</b> being focused on and/or limited to the popliteal fossa area <b>9</b>, which is generally behind the knee on the backside of the leg <b>10</b>. That is, the sleeve <b>30</b> may advantageously not heat the front of the leg in the area of the knee <b>8</b>, which may be desirable to avoid overheating of the leg and/or knee portion thereof, which may result in injury and/or other complications to the patient <b>5</b>. Furthermore, the absence of heating pads/devices in the area of the front of the knee can allow for a cut-out in the area of the knee, as shown and described throughout the present disclosure, which can provide improved flexibility/mobility for the limb <b>10</b> when the sleeve <b>30</b> is secured (e.g., relatively tightly) on the limb <b>10</b>. Focusing and/or limiting the heating in the upper portion of the sleeve <b>30</b> to the popliteal fossa region/area <b>9</b> can be effective due to the proximity of certain blood vessels to the skin in the area of the popliteal fossa relative to other areas of the leg, such as the front side of the leg and/or knee <b>8</b>, where blood vessels may not be as close to the skin, and therefore heating (or cooling) in such areas may not be as effective with respect to increasing (or reducing) and/or maintaining the core temperature of the patient <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The temperature-management sleeve <b>30</b> may further include one or more fluid-fillable bladders/chambers <b>38</b>, which may be used for implementing intermittent compression with respect to the leg <b>10</b> when the sleeve <b>30</b> is disposed on the leg <b>10</b> of the patient <b>5</b>. For example, in some implementations, intermittent compression in the calf area <b>1</b> of the leg <b>10</b> may be implemented simultaneously with the application of thermal energy/heat to the sole <b>3</b> of the foot and the popliteal fossa <b>9</b> to facilitate heating of the venous and arterial blood of the patient <b>5</b>, which may serve to increase the core temperature of the patient. Although fluid-filled bladders are described herein, it should be understood that references to fluid-filled bladders or the like may refer to any type of compression element, whether inflatable, fluid-containing, or any other type of compression element. For example, such compression elements may include certain elastic compression features. In some embodiments, compression elements associated with sleeve devices/structures of the present disclosure can include physical straps and/or smart material(s) configured to implement squeezing and/or relaxing around at least a portion of the calf.

The thermal-management sleeve <b>330</b> can include one or more physical connectors <b>342</b>, which may include one or more straps, clips, clasps, folds, elastically-deformable materials or components, wraps, or other physical components of the sleeve that may be used to secure the sleeve to the limb of the patient.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The sleeve <b>330</b> can include one or more compression bladders <b>338</b>, which may be configured to receive fluid through one or more fluid interfaces/connectors <b>396</b> from a fluid source <b>322</b> of a control unit or system <b>320</b>. In some embodiments, the sleeve <b>330</b> includes 2, 3, or more compression bladders, which may be individually inflatable and/or depletable to provide sequential compression of the limb of the patient. Although described as compression bladders for convenience, it should be understood that the feature(s) <b>338</b> may comprise any type of compression elements. In some embodiments, certain electrical wiring or other electrical connectivity component(s) may be coupled to each compression element <b>338</b> for providing electrical power to the respective compression element.

The heating conductors/traces <b>710</b> can be configured/designed to traverse the area of the substrate in a manner as to complete a circuit with a positive and negative electrical connections, thereby allowing for electrical current injection therethrough. The slits/channels, tabs, projections/extensions, and other shaped implemented in connection with embodiments of the present disclosure can allow the heating pad substrate to conform to any, or most, body forms.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Implementation of flexible, conformal heating pad substrates with slits and tabs as described herein can help eliminate or reduce air gaps between the heating pad and the patient's skin, and can improve efficiency of heat transfer to arterial and veinous blood vessels close to the skin surface, thereby effectively heating the blood and raising core body temperature of the patient. Furthermore, some embodiments provide layer(s) of insulation behind heating pads and/or layer(s) of heat-transfer medium (e.g., silicone), which may provide additional flexibility/conformity and insulation for the heating pad. In some embodiments, straps, bands, and/or tapes can be implemented that are specifically designed for particular body parts to aid in conforming the planer substrate/film (e.g., with slits and unique shapes) to conform to the body topology. In some embodiments, adhesive(s) may be implemented with heating pads that aid in conforming the planer substrate/film with inventive slit and shape/tab combinations to conform to the body. In some embodiments, thermistor(s) may be adhered to the heating pad and/or other component of a heating pad assembly in a configuration that is substantially (e.g., directly) over the target veinous/arterial area based on locating topography and/or graphics of the strap system.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, the heating pads <b>700</b> (e.g., heating pads <b>700</b><i>d</i>, <b>700</b><i>e</i>) include substrate cut-outs around at least a portion of the thermistor(s) <b>768</b>. For example, the thermistor(s) <b>768</b> may be disposed in a central area or region of the heating pad with respect to the width W and/or length L thereof. As with the embodiments <b>700</b><i>d </i>and <b>700</b><i>e</i>, unlike the slit cut-outs <b>735</b>, <b>737</b>, <b>739</b>, which are open at a perimeter of the heating pad <b>700</b> and/or substrate <b>750</b>, the cut-out <b>708</b> around the thermistor(s) <b>768</b> may be substrate-locked and not open to the perimeter of the heating pad <b>700</b> in some embodiments. The thermistor cut-out <b>708</b> may have any suitable or desirable shape, size, or form. For example, in some embodiments, the cut-out <b>708</b> is at least partially elongated and/or has a lengthwise component that allows for deflection of the thermistor <b>768</b> and/or portion of the substrate <b>750</b> associated therewith to be deflected away from the plane Pi of the heating pad <b>700</b> and/or away from the substrate <b>750</b> immediately around the cut-out <b>708</b>. References herein to the &#x201c;plane&#x201d; of a heating pad, with respect to the orientations of the heating pads <b>700</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>1</b>-<b>7</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, may refer to the plane of the page. That is, when a heating pad is flat and not contorted/flexed, such heating pad may generally lie in a plane, wherein the flexibility characteristics of heating pads of the present disclosure may allow for deflection of various tabs or other portions of the flexible substrate thereof away from the plane of the heating pad, such as into or out of the page with respect to the illustrated orientations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>-<b>1</b>-<b>7</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. The images of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>-<b>1</b>-<b>7</b>-<b>5</b></figref> show example shapes of a thermistor cut-out features <b>708</b>, which have a generally pear/bulb-type shape including a stem/trunk portion <b>761</b> and a bulb portion <b>762</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The cut-out <b>708</b> around the thermistor(s) <b>768</b> may provide certain benefits and/or advantages for the heating pads having such features. For example, the cut-out <b>708</b> may provide an airgap or other gap between the thermistor(s) <b>768</b> and the substrate <b>750</b> immediately adjacent thereto and/or surrounding the cut-out <b>7008</b>, which may provide thermal and/or electrical isolation for the thermistor(s) <b>768</b>. Such isolation may reduce the risk of corruption of thermistor signals and/or the risk of thermistor readings being undesirably influenced by the thermal conditions of the adjacent portions of the substrate <b>750</b>. For example, the thermistor <b>768</b> may be utilized primarily to determine the temperature at a surface of the patient's skin, rather than the temperature of the heating pad itself, and therefore at least partial thermal isolation from the heating pad may be desirable.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The cut-out <b>708</b> may further advantageously provide flexibility to allow for independent deflection of the thermistor(s) <b>768</b> out of the plane of the heating pad, which may be desirable for various reasons. For example, the thermistor <b>768</b> may be deflected as a means to allow for the thermistor <b>768</b> to be protruded/passed through one or more layers of material, such as thermally-conductive medium layer(s) and/or cloth layer(s) that may be disposed generally between the heating pad <b>700</b> and the patient's skin when fitted on a patient. That is, such deflection may allow the thermistor to be inserted/threaded/punctured through such layer(s) to come into closer proximity with the patient's skin. Deflection of the thermistor <b>768</b> may further be advantageous as allowing the thermistor <b>768</b> to maintain a position relatively close to the patient's skin when the heating pad <b>700</b> is contorted/flexed to conform to the surface of the patient's anatomy. That is, where the heating pad portions are bent in a manner as to fit/nest within/against an at least partially concave surface, such as the depression of the popliteal fossa and/or arch of the foot, such contortion may cause one or more tabs or other portions of the heating pad to deflect away from the patient-facing side of the center of the heating pad <b>700</b>. That is, with respect to the orientations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>-<b>1</b>-<b>7</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the contortion of the heating pads <b>700</b> to fit against the at least partially concave anatomy may cause deflection of one or more tabs or portions of the heating pads away from the patient (i.e., into the page). When such contortion occurs, the cut-out <b>708</b> around the thermistor(s) <b>768</b> may allow for the thermistor <b>768</b> to be deflected toward the patient's skin (i.e., out of the page with respect to the illustrated orientation) to thereby position the thermistor(s) <b>768</b> relatively closer to the patient's skin as a result of such deflection. For example, the thermistor <b>768</b> may be biased (e.g., via shape memory) to deflect toward the patient when the substrate <b>750</b> is contorted away from the patient in one or more areas around the thermistor <b>768</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, the heating pads <b>700</b> may include electrical contacts <b>711</b> which may be configured to electrically couple to certain control circuitry of the heating system via one or more connections. For example, the contacts <b>711</b> may include one or more thermistor contacts <b>715</b> configured to inject an electrical current through the thermistor(s) <b>768</b>. For example, the contacts <b>715</b> may include an input pin/contact and an output pin/contact to allow for a circuit through the thermistor(s) <b>768</b>. The contacts <b>711</b> may further include one or more heating conductor contacts <b>716</b>. For example, the contacts <b>716</b> may include input and output pins/contacts that allow for current to flow through the conductor(s) <b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, such as in the embodiment <b>700</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, the heating pad <b>700</b> may include one or more corner slits/cut-outs <b>735</b>, which may provide flexibility for out-of-plain deflection of transverse/side <b>733</b>, longitudinal/parallel <b>732</b> and/or corner <b>736</b> tabs substantially independently of one another, wherein such tabs may be defined by slits/cut-outs on multiple sides thereof. The resistive heating traces <b>710</b> may be routed in a manner as to cover and/or occupy a substantial portion of the area of the respective heating pad <b>700</b>. Therefore, such traces may be routed around, through, and/or traverse the various tabs <b>732</b>, <b>733</b>, <b>736</b> of the respective heating pads <b>700</b> in a manner as to cover a substantial portion of the area thereof. In some embodiments, heating pads <b>700</b> are substantially symmetrical, at least with respect to a width dimension W thereof, such as about a lengthwise line/dimension <b>745</b>, which may bifurcate the heating pad <b>700</b> about a central point along the width of the respective heating pad <b>700</b> in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the heating traces <b>710</b> may traverse the respective heating pads <b>700</b> on a first side of the bifurcation line <b>745</b> and then move across the bifurcation line in an area <b>721</b> from where the trace proceeds to traverse the other side of the line <b>745</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">For heating pad embodiments that include flexibility-enhancing slits <b>735</b>, <b>739</b>, <b>737</b>, the routing of the heating traces <b>710</b> may advantageously run around the perimeter of the heating pad and follow along/around the various slits/cut-outs/channels to allow for traversal from one tab (e.g., <b>733</b>, <b>736</b>.<b>732</b>) to an adjacent tab around the slit/cut-out/channel separating such tabs. In some embodiments, the resistive heating traces <b>758</b> traverse the transverse tabs <b>733</b> and/or a subset thereof around a perimeter of the tabs and around the intervening slits/channels <b>739</b> through a plurality of transverse tabs <b>733</b>, wherein the traces then double back <b>759</b> through the same tabs to provide additional coverage of the heating traces <b>710</b>. In some embodiments, as in the heating pad <b>700</b><i>d </i>and <b>700</b><i>e </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>4</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the secondary/interior double-back traces/conductor portions <b>759</b> include a zig-zag and/or key-type design/routing to fill in the area between the path of the perimeter traces <b>758</b> around the perimeter of the tab <b>733</b> to thereby increase the heat transfer associated with a given tab <b>733</b>. Such key-type interior trace design is shown in the tabs <b>733</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>4</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. In some embodiments, corner tabs <b>736</b> may include heating trace routing that includes multiple layers/rows of overlapping/passing traces in a maze-type design, as shown in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>4</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. Such additional double-backing of routing within the tabs <b>736</b> may be desirable to cover the area of such tabs in embodiments where such tabs are larger than the transverse tabs <b>733</b>, and therefor provide greater substrate area to be covered to provide efficient heat transfer therefrom. For the embodiment <b>700</b><i>e </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the distal corner tabs <b>736</b><i>e </i>may be rounded and have a radius of curvature that is approximately circular (i.e., curved transverse and distal longitudinal sides approximate a quarter circle), such as within 5-10% of exactly circular.
