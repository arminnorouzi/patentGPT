It can be understood that the specific embodiments described herein are only used to explain the present disclosure and are not intended to limit the present disclosure. It should be noted that any combinations of embodiments and features of the embodiments of the present disclosure without conflict are possible. In addition, it should be further noted that for ease of description, only a part and not all structures related to the present disclosure are shown in the drawings.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Using WLAN as an example of a wireless network, common devices include an AP and a wireless STA, and STA and AP may be collectively referred to as wireless communication nodes. A next-generation WLAN supports multi-access point transmission between at least one AP and at least one STA. In a case of the wireless communication nodes sharing a channel, conflict detection in a wireless environment is difficult.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a hidden node. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a STA <b>1</b> and a STA <b>2</b> send data to an AP at the same time. As the STA <b>1</b> and the STA <b>2</b> are both outside the coverage of each other, a conflict may occur when the STA <b>1</b> and the STA <b>2</b> send data to the AP at the same time. The STA <b>2</b> is a hidden station relative to the STA <b>1</b>. Collision with the hidden station can be avoided by including a protected channel access time (namely, a duration field) in a Media Access Control (MAC) header in a radio frame. During a time period after the end of the radio frame, other listening stations that receive the radio frame including the protected channel access time will each set a NAV stored locally, so that the listening station will not send data during the duration, avoiding collision with the hidden station due to channel contention. The listening station can send data only after the NAV is reduced to zero.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a process of multi-access point transmission, other listening stations that can receive the data packet each need to set a NAV according to information included in the data packet, and cannot send data when the NAV is not zero, thus avoiding conflicts with communication nodes participating in multi-access point transmission. In this case, if a communication node acts as a participant in multi-access point transmission rather than an initiator, the communication node is also regarded as a listening station. If a NAV is set according to a relevant mechanism, the communication node will fail to normally participate in multi-access point transmission, thus affecting normal implementation of the transmission process.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, there is provided a transmission method for a wireless network applied to a first communication node, which is a communication node that is triggered to perform multi-access point transmission. As a participant in multi-access point transmission, the first communication node prevents a data transmission process from being affected through reasonable setting of a NAV, thereby ensuring normal implementation of multi-access point transmission and further improving a system throughput.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of a transmission method for a wireless network according to an embodiment. A first communication node in this embodiment is equivalent to an AP. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the method provided in this embodiment includes step <b>110</b> and step <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">At step <b>110</b>, a PPDU which carries first identifier information is received.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At step <b>120</b>, a locally stored NAV is kept unchanged, or the locally stored NAV is updated and the updated NAV is ignored in a process of multi-access point transmission.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this embodiment, the first communication node receives the PPDU which carries the first identifier information, so that it is clear that the PPDU is used to trigger one multi-access point transmission. In this case, the first communication node keeps the locally stored NAV unchanged, or updates the locally stored NAV according to protected duration reserved by the PPDU but ignores the updated NAV in the process of multi-access point transmission. In other words, the first communication node does not need to wait for the duration specified in the NAV, but can participate in and perform transmission to a third communication node instantly according to parameters in the PPDU, thereby ensuring normal implementation of the multi-access point transmission.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an embodiment, each communication node stores a NAV locally, including two different types: a Basic Service Set (BSS) NAV and a basic NAV. The AP establishes a BSS, and a STA can be associated with the AP through processes such as scanning, authentication, and association. One AP and multiple STAs associated with the AP form one BSS. Taking 802.11 as an example, two operation modes are defined: a Distributed coordination function (DCF) and a Point Coordination Function (PCF), as well as improvements for these two operation modes: Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) and Hybrid Coordination Function Controlled Channel Access (HCCA). The DCF is the fundamental operation mode employing a carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism to enable multiple stations to share a wireless channel. The EDCA is an enhanced operation mode, which maps upper-layer data to four different queue Access Categories (AC): Access Categories voice (AC_VO), Access Categories video (AC_VI), Access Categories best effort (AC_BE), and Access Categories background (AC_BK), each queue access category uses different parameters for channel contention to distinguish priorities. The EDCA employs the CSMA/CA mechanism to make multiple queues with different priorities share a wireless channel and reserve a transmission opportunity (Transmission Opportunity, TXOP). When receiving a radio frame, the first communication node determines whether the frame belongs to the local BSS. In response to the frame belonging to the local BSS, a local BSS NAV is set. In response to the frame not belonging to the local BSS or failing to determine whether the frame belongs to the local BSS, a basic NAV is set. When a specific condition is met, a value of the local BSS NAV can be ignored, but a value of the basic NAV cannot be ignored. It is considered that a virtual channel is sensed to be idle only when the values of both NAVs are reduced to 0, and data transmission can be started at this time.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this embodiment, after receiving the PPDU which carries the first identifier information, the first communication node may not set the locally stored NAV, that is, keep the locally stored value unchanged, or update the locally stored NAV (the local BSS NAV) and ignore the NAV in the process of multi-access point transmission, that is, instantly participate in the multi-access point transmission.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, the first identifier information is used to trigger a multi-access point transmission operation. The method further includes: performing the multi-access point transmission operation according to the first identifier information.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment, a second communication node triggers the first communication node to perform multi-access point transmission by sending the PPDU. There is at least one first communication node, and a receiver for data in the multi-access point transmission may be at least one third communication node (for example, a wireless station). The PPDU includes the first identifier information, which is used to trigger the first communication node to perform multi-access point transmission.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of triggering multi-access point transmission according to an embodiment. With continuous evolution of the WLAN technology, multiple APs can communicate with at least one STA simultaneously or non-simultaneously, that is, multi-AP transmission. Taking simultaneous transmission of multiple APs to one STA as an example, the simultaneous transmission of multiple APs is generally triggered by a specific functional entity, which may be a specific AP or a specific device in a network. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the trigger entity is a second communication node, which triggers two first communication nodes to transmit data to a STA <b>1</b> simultaneously. As the multiple first communication nodes synchronize transmission moments, signals of the multiple first communication nodes do not interfere with each other and affect reception of the STA. In this process, if a triggering process is completed through an air interface, the second communication node usually needs to send a radio frame with a function of triggering transmission to the first communication node. As a result, the radio frame includes first identifier information used to trigger a multi-access point transmission operation, and may further include a protected channel access time and a receiver.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of triggering multi-access point transmission according to another embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the second communication node triggers the first communication node and the second communication node to transmit data to a STA <b>1</b> at the same time, that is, the communication nodes that perform multi-access point transmission may include the trigger entity itself.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the above embodiments, the second communication node may be an access point, and the first communication node may be an access point in a WLAN environment such as a home network, a commercial network, or an industrial network. The second communication node may notify whether the second communication node supports multi-access point transmission, which includes the following modes: multi-access point joint transmission (multiple APs transmit data to a STA at the same time), multi-access point selective transmission (one of multiple APs at a time transmits data to a STA), multi-access point cooperative transmission (multiple APs transmit data to respective associated STAs at the same time). The multi-access point cooperative transmission includes cooperative Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), cooperative frequency multiplexing, and the like. The STA notifies the AP whether the STA supports multi-access point transmission and the mode of the supported multi-access point transmission.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment, keeping a locally stored NAV unchanged includes: classifying a PPDU as a PPDU outside a BSS according to first identifier information, and keeping the locally stored NAV unchanged.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this embodiment, after receiving the PPDU, the first communication node determines whether to classify the PPDU as a PPDU inside the local BSS according to the first identifier information. If the PPDU is not classified as a PPDU inside the local BSS, the locally stored NAV is kept unchanged, that is, the locally stored NAV is not updated, and data is sent until the locally stored NAV is reduced to 0.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment, updating the locally stored NAV and ignoring the NAV in a process of multi-access point transmission includes: classifying the PPDU as a PPDU inside a BSS according to the first identifier information; and updating the locally stored NAV and ignoring the updated NAV in the process of multi-access point transmission.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this embodiment, after receiving the PPDU, the first communication node determines whether the PPDU is classified as a PPDU inside the local BSS according to the first identifier information. If the PPDU is classified as a PPDU inside the local BSS, the locally stored NAV is updated, but the updated NAV is ignored in the process of multi-access point transmission. In other words, the first communication node does not need to wait for the duration specified in the NAV, but can participate in and perform transmission to a third communication node instantly according to parameters in the PPDU.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an embodiment, in response to the PPDU including the first identifier information, the first communication node determines that the PPDU belongs to the local BSS. Alternatively,</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">in response to at least one AP establishing a multi-AP transmission group, and the first communication node belonging to the multi-AP transmission group, the first communication node determines that the PPDU belongs to the local BSS. Alternatively,</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">in response to at least one AP making a multi-AP transmission agreement, and the first communication node participating in the multi-AP transmission agreement, the first communication node determines that the PPDU belongs to the local BSS.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment, keeping the locally stored NAV unchanged, or updating the locally stored NAV and ignoring the NAV in the process of multi-access point transmission includes: in response to the PPDU further including second identifier information, determining whether to participate in the multi-access point transmission according to the second identifier information; in response to determining to participate in the multi-access point transmission, updating the locally stored NAV and ignoring the updated NAV in the process of multi-access point transmission; and in response to determining not to participate in the multi-access point transmission, keeping the locally stored NAV unchanged.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this embodiment, the PPDU further includes the second identifier information, which is used to indicate a receiver of a radio frame. After receiving the PPDU, the first communication node determines whether to participate in multi-access point transmission according to the second identifier information. If the first communication node determines to participate in the multi-access point transmission, the first communication node updates the locally stored NAV, but ignores the updated NAV in the process of multi-access point transmission. In other words, the first communication node does not need to wait for the duration specified in the NAV, but can participate in and perform transmission to the third communication node instantly according to the parameters in the PPDU. If the first communication node determines not to participate in the multi-access point transmission, the first communication node keeps the locally stored NAV unchanged and sends data until the NAV is reduced to 0.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an embodiment, that the locally stored NAV is updated includes: comparing the locally stored NAV (a local BSS NAV) with protected channel access duration corresponding to the PPDU, and setting a greater value of the two as a new local BSS NAV.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an embodiment, the first identifier information is indicated by a first setting field in a MAC header in a radio frame in the PPDU, or indicated by a second setting field in a physical-layer signaling field in the PPDU; and in response to the PPDU further including second identifier information, the second identifier information is indicated by a third setting field in the MAC header in the radio frame in the PPDU, or indicated by a fourth setting field in the physical-layer signaling field in the PPDU.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first identifier information has multiple representations. For example, the first identifier information is located in the MAC header in the radio frame in the PPDU, which may be specifically at least one bit in a frame control field in a MAC header in a trigger frame used to trigger another wireless communication node to perform transmission. It indicates that the radio frame is used to trigger or notify at least one first communication node to perform one multi-access point transmission. For another example, the first identifier information may be represented by a trigger type field in the MAC header in the trigger frame, indicating that the radio frame is used to trigger at least one first communication node to perform one multi-access point transmission. For another example, the first identifier information is located in the physical-layer signaling field in the PPDU, indicating that the radio frame is used to trigger at least one first communication node to perform one multi-access point transmission.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment, the PPDU may further include the second identifier information to indicate the receiver, which may specify a specific communication node as the receiver, or indicate a multicast or broadcast form.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second identifier information has multiple representations. For example, the second identifier information is located in the MAC header in the radio frame in the PPDU, with a form of a MAC address or identifier of the third communication node, and a communication node corresponding to the second identifier information is the receiver. The second identifier information may alternatively be in a form of a multicast or broadcast address or identifier, indicating that the receiver is at least one third communication node. For another example, the second identifier information refers to several values reserved from a value range of an Association ID (AID) assigned to the wireless station, for assigning to the wireless communication nodes. For example, if the value range of AID is 0 to N, the 0<sup>th </sup>to M<sup>th </sup>values or the (N-M)<sup>th </sup>to N<sup>th </sup>values in the value range are assigned to the wireless communication nodes. The AID assigned to the wireless communication nodes may be negotiated between the wireless communication nodes, or completed by a specific entity, for example, a central control node in the network.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a frame structure in a WLAN according to an embodiment.
