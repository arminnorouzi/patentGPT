level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Aspects of the disclosure are described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and which show, by way of illustration, example features. The features can, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the combinations set forth herein; rather, these combinations are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Interior millwork for residential and commercial housing are decorative, nonstructural components normally made of strips of wood and used to cover transition areas between surfaces. These components, called &#x201c;mouldings&#x201d; or &#x201c;moldings,&#x201d; include casings/case moldings, base moldings, and crown moldings, and can be used to trim the perimeter of windows, doors, and locations where walls meet a floor or a ceiling. Vertical and horizontal millwork trim pieces that cover door openings are called door jambs. Vertical door jambs bear the weight of the door through applied hinges and latches. Two vertical jamb sides and a head jamb may be referred to as a door jamb set. A door jamb set hinged to a door may be referred to as a prehung door. The accuracy of the plumb and strength of a door jamb is important to the overall operational durability and security of a door. Today, millwork also encompasses items that are made using alternatives to wood, including synthetics, plastics, and wood-adhesive composites. Millwork may be painted or stained (e.g., after installation).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>32</b></figref>, composite trim molding assemblies, such as door jamb assemblies <b>100</b> for a door jamb set are described. A door jamb assembly <b>100</b> can include an outer one-piece shell <b>102</b> covering a strengthening and stiffening core <b>104</b>. The door jamb assemblies <b>100</b> can be used for interior doorway applications. For example, a door <b>106</b> can be attached to an interior door jamb assembly <b>100</b> by hinges <b>108</b> fastened to the door jamb assembly <b>100</b> by fasteners (e.g., screws <b>110</b>) extending into the door jamb assembly <b>100</b>. A door jamb assembly <b>100</b> can also include other hardware, such as a strike plate <b>112</b> and so forth. A door jamb assembly <b>100</b> can be fastened to the doorframe by fasteners (e.g., nails <b>114</b>) extending through a side of the door jamb assembly <b>100</b> and into the framing studs (e.g., jack stud <b>101</b>) and/or header <b>103</b> of the doorframe. For example, a doorframe may be formed by a king stud <b>101</b> and a jack stud <b>101</b> on one side of the doorframe (with additional framing studs mirrored on the other side of the doorframe) and a header <b>103</b> at the top of the doorframe. The side of the door jamb set formed by a door jamb assembly <b>100</b> that attaches the hinges <b>108</b> can include hinge cutouts <b>107</b> and forms a hinge jamb <b>109</b>. In other embodiments, the door jamb assembly <b>100</b> does not necessarily include the hinge cutouts <b>107</b>. For instance, cutouts may be added during installation of the door <b>106</b>. The other side of the door jamb set formed by a door jamb assembly <b>100</b> that attaches the strike plate <b>112</b> can include a mortise <b>111</b> (e.g., for the strike plate <b>112</b>) and forms a latch jamb <b>113</b>. The top of the door jamb set formed by a door jamb assembly <b>100</b> forms a head jamb <b>115</b>. The door can include a latch bolt bore <b>117</b> for a latch bolt to interface with the strike plate <b>112</b>/mortise <b>111</b> and a lockset bore <b>119</b>. After the door jamb set is anchored to the rough opening, finishes such as drywall <b>121</b> and casings <b>123</b> can be added to complete the installation.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The shell <b>102</b> can be formed of a composite material (e.g., engineered wood formed from wood dust (e.g., sawdust), shavings, fibers, fillers, etc.) and shaped into a flat jamb <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the shell <b>102</b> may also include one or more surface features, such as a stop <b>118</b>. In embodiments of the disclosure, the shell <b>102</b> can be molded from slurry, pressed from a flat composite panel, and so forth. For example, in some embodiments, the shell <b>102</b> can be molded cellulosic fiberboard, which can be formed from a pre-consolidated mat. The pre-consolidated mat can be formed into consolidated medium-density fiberboard (MDF), hardboard, softboard, low-density fiberboard, and so forth. For instance, hardwood and/or softwood residuals can be broken down into fillers or fibers (e.g., using a defibrator or another pulping machine, grinding, explosion hydrolysis, etc.), and the resulting wood fillers or fibers can be formed into a loose mat along with a binding agent and/or resin and/or wax and compressed under high temperature and pressure to form a shell <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the pre-consolidated cellulosic mat may be planar. However, when molded to form the shell <b>102</b>, various shaped molds may be used to form surface features (e.g., an embossed texture, such as a faux wood grain pattern surface texture <b>126</b>) and/or contours (e.g., an interior extension or depression, such as stop <b>118</b>). In some embodiments, a shell <b>102</b> may also have one or more smooth exterior surfaces. Further, the edges and/or sides of the door jamb assembly <b>100</b> may include various edge details, including, but not necessarily limited to: back beveled details (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>17</b></figref>), square details (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>), trim guide details (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> through <b>21</b></figref>), and so on. For instance, edge details may be provided for resting and/or registering the casing <b>123</b>. In some embodiments, the shell <b>102</b> may not completely extend around the core <b>104</b>. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b> and <b>32</b></figref>, a portion of the core <b>104</b> may be wider than the interior cavity of the shell <b>102</b> and may extend to be parallel to, for instance, edges of the shell <b>102</b>. As described, the shell <b>102</b> may have a generally uniform cross-sectional thickness.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the pre-consolidated cellulosic mat can be formed in a wet process, e.g., where cellulosic fillers or fibers in a slurry having a high moisture content (e.g., about ninety percent (90%) water or more by weight) and a synthetic resin binder (e.g., phenol-formaldehyde resin) are deposited onto a water permeable support (e.g., a fine screen, mesh, wire, etc.). Moisture is then removed to leave a wet mat of cellulosic material having a lower moisture content (e.g., about fifty percent (50%) water by weight). The wet mat can then be molded under high temperature and pressure to form the composite material shell <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the pre-consolidated cellulosic mat can be formed in a wet-dry process, e.g., where a large amount of moisture from a wet mat is evaporated prior to molding (e.g., leaving the mat with a water content of about ten percent (10%) or less by weight). Further, a pre-consolidated cellulosic mat can be formed in a dry process, e.g., where cellulosic fibers are conveyed mechanically or in a gas stream rather than in a liquid. For example, cellulosic fibers may be coated with thermosetting resin binder (e.g., phenol-formaldehyde resin) and formed into a mat by blowing the coated fibers onto a support.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the shell <b>102</b> may be formed as a thin-layered wood composite including lignocellulose/lignocellulosic fiber and a polymer resin. The term lignocellulose refers to plant dry matter (biomass) including carbohydrate polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose) and an aromatic polymer (lignin). The lignocellulose composite mixture may have about 70% to about 99% by weight lignocellulosic fiber. The lignocellulosic fiber can have a range of moisture levels and may be dehydrated prior to treatment with the resin. For example, the lignocellulosic fiber can have from about 2% to about 20% moisture content by weight. In embodiments, the resin may be a formaldehyde-based resin, an isocyanate-based resin, and/or another thermoplastic or thermoset resin. In some embodiments, the amount of resin may range from about 1% to about 25% by weight of the composite. The lignocellulosic composite mixture may also include one or more waxes (e.g., a natural wax and/or a synthetic wax, such as paraffin wax, polyethylene wax, polyoxyethylene wax, microcrystalline wax, shellac wax, ozokerite wax, montan wax, emulsified wax, slack wax, etc.). The thin-layer composites may also include a pre-press sealer (e.g., a liquid material applied to the surface of a mat used to formulate the thin-layer composite prior to the mat entering a press). The lignocellulosic mixtures may be pressed into a thin-layer using flat or molded dies at high temperature and/or pressure. The mixture may initially be formed into a loose mat then placed into a die press.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, a two-part mold, such as a die press <b>130</b> (e.g., having a first die <b>132</b> and a second die <b>134</b>) may be used to form the shell <b>102</b>. For example, a pre-consolidated mat can be placed into the die press <b>130</b> and formed into consolidated medium-density fiberboard (MDF), hardboard, softboard, low-density fiberboard, and so forth. As described, hardwood and/or softwood residuals broken down into fillers or fibers can be formed into a loose mat along with a binding agent and/or resin and/or wax and compressed under high temperature and pressure in the die press <b>130</b> to form the shell <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, one or more walls <b>136</b> of the first die <b>132</b> and/or the second die <b>134</b> may be formed with a negative camber or positive draft (e.g., for more easily releasing from the die press <b>130</b>). For example, walls <b>136</b> of the first die <b>132</b> and/or the second die <b>134</b> may slope outwardly and downwardly when viewed from an end, allowing the shell <b>102</b> to more easily release from the dies after formation. In some embodiments, one or more walls <b>136</b> of the first die <b>132</b> and/or the second die <b>134</b> may be formed with a zero camber or zero draft (e.g., at an angle of about ninety (90) degrees from an adjacent surface, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b> and <b>35</b></figref>). In some embodiments, one or more walls <b>136</b> of the first die <b>132</b> and/or the second die <b>134</b> may be formed with a positive camber or negative draft. For example, walls <b>136</b> of the first die <b>132</b> and/or the second die <b>134</b> may slope inwardly and downwardly when viewed from an end, providing a back bevel.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b> and <b>35</b></figref>, in an example configuration where, for instance, walls <b>136</b> of the first die <b>132</b> and/or the second die <b>134</b> are formed with a negative camber or positive draft and/or with a zero camber or zero draft, a back bevel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>) and/or trim guide (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>) feature may be provided by a trimming or machining operation. For example, a back bevel <b>138</b> and/or a trim guide <b>140</b> may be provided by cutting, shaving, milling, or otherwise trimming material from the shell <b>102</b> to thin the shell from a first thickness t<sub>1 </sub>to a second thickness t<sub>2</sub>. However, a trimming or machining operation is provided by way of example and is not meant to limit the present disclosure. In other embodiments, a die (e.g., first die <b>132</b> and/or second die <b>134</b>) may include a movable segment configured to form a feature that provides positive camber or negative draft. In this configuration, the movable segment may be positioned to create a feature with positive camber or negative draft (e.g., the back bevels shown on the shells <b>102</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>17</b></figref> and/or the notches shown on the interior of the shells <b>102</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref>). The movable segment may then be moved out of position to allow the shell <b>102</b> to release form the die press <b>130</b> and the dies <b>132</b> and/or <b>134</b>. It should also be noted that the ends <b>142</b> of a shell formed from a pre-consolidated cellulosic mat may be rough after manufacturing, and the ends <b>142</b> may be trimmed (e.g., machined, milled) after the shell <b>102</b> has been formed in the die press <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">However, a pre-consolidated cellulosic mat is provided by way of example and is not meant to limit the present disclosure. In other embodiments, a pre-formed planar fiber board may also be molded to form a composite material shell <b>102</b>. For instance, an MDF board may be heat treated to its softening point and then deformed in a press. In some embodiments, a shell <b>102</b> may also be corrugated (e.g., in the manner of cardboard). When the shell <b>102</b> is formed (e.g., using a wet process, a wet-dry process, a dry process, a fiber hoard process, or another process), various surface features and/or contours can be formed in the shell <b>102</b> using various mold or press features. For example, a shell <b>102</b> having a thickness of about one-eighth of an inch (&#x215b;&#x2033;) can be formed and textured using a mold or press with a complementary relief pattern that forms a wood grain pattern on one or more surfaces of the shell <b>102</b>. Additionally, a shell <b>102</b> can be formed of more than one molded or pressed composite material segment joined together (e.g., using an adhesive binder or another adhesive at contact points along mating surfaces of the shell segments). Further, in some embodiments, a shell <b>102</b> can be formed using another process, such as extrusion. For example, the shell <b>102</b> may be formed using one or more extruded plastic materials, vinyl materials, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials, fiber glass materials, and so forth. In a similar manner to a molded material that forms a composite shell <b>102</b>, various surface features and/or contours may be formed in an extruded shell <b>102</b> (e.g., using various mold and/or press features).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Once the shell <b>102</b> has been formed under high temperature and pressure, a number of different surface finishes and/or treatments may be applied to the shell <b>102</b>. For example, one or more layers of primer, paint, and/or stain can be applied to the surface of the shell <b>102</b>. An interior door jamb assembly <b>100</b> may be sold as a primed and ready-to-paint unit. In some embodiments, a veneer, such as a wood veneer, may also be applied to one or more surfaces of the shell <b>102</b>. The shell <b>102</b> may be glued (e.g., using an adhesive binder or another adhesive) to the core <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The core <b>104</b> can be formed of a wood material (e.g., scrap wood), a composite material (e.g., particle board (PB), MDF, plywood, laminated veneer lumber (LVL), wafer board, finger-jointed wood, and so forth) having a generally rectangular cross-sectional area. For example, the core <b>104</b> can be cut to fit and then glued in behind the shell <b>102</b>. It should be noted that because the cavity of the outer shell <b>102</b> hides the inner core <b>104</b>, the core <b>104</b> may be rough and/or unfinished (e.g., not finely milled). For instance, the core <b>104</b> can be formed from edge glued blocks, finger jointed blocks (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>), and so forth. In some embodiments, the core <b>104</b> can be made of particle board and/or MDF (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). In some embodiments, the core <b>104</b> can be made of a laminated lumber, such as plywood (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>21</b></figref>). Further, in some embodiments, reinforcing blocks of a different material (e.g., milled lumber) can be positioned proximate to key areas of the jamb <b>116</b> (e.g., behind the hinges <b>108</b> as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). For example, MDF may have better screw holding ability compared to, for example, particle board, and MDF may be used behind hinges <b>108</b> while particle board or another less expensive material is used for the remainder of the core <b>104</b>. In another example, plywood, LVL, or wafer board may have better screw holding ability and/or moisture resistance compared to particle board and MDF, and one or more of these materials (e.g., plywood, LVL, wafer board) may be used behind hinges <b>108</b> while particle board, MDF, and/or another less expensive material is used for the remainder of the core <b>104</b>. LVL, finger-jointed wood and/or other materials that exhibit dimensional stability may also be desirable for strategic positioning along the core <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The techniques and apparatus of the present disclosure may provide for improved raw material utilization. For example, wood residuals, particle board, and/or MDF segments used for the inner core <b>104</b> may be milled from smaller sections of wood into the shape of the cavity in the outer shell <b>102</b> (e.g., as opposed to typical door jambs and stops, which are milled from larger sections of wood). Further, in embodiments where the inner core <b>104</b> has a generally rectangular cross-sectional profile, the core <b>104</b> may be cut from a standard thickness flat panel by sawing rather than by milling larger wood sections using, for instance, a molder. It should also be noted that forming the outer shell <b>102</b> from a slurry and/or a pressed panel may save approximately twenty percent (20%) in material (e.g., in comparison to milling the jambs and stops from larger sections of wood).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The outer shell <b>102</b> can be made from wood fiber and can include small trees that would otherwise be too small to process into typical jambs and stops, as well as including branches, knots, and small and/or short wood scraps. Further, the composite shell <b>102</b> can be made from tree species not typically used in the manufacturing of door jambs (e.g., due to stability issues, size, abundance, and/or other factors). Additionally, it is noted that typical door stops are nailed or stapled into the face of a door jamb through the face of the stop. The holes are then filled prior to finishing (e.g., painting) the door jamb. However, in accordance with the present disclosure, there are not necessarily holes through the stop <b>118</b> that are filled. Further, as opposed to door jambs with a stop nailed to the jamb, there is also not a gap or a seam between the jamb <b>116</b> and the stop <b>118</b>, which would otherwise be caulked prior to finishing (e.g., painting) the jamb. However, a door jamb assembly <b>100</b> with a seamless stop <b>118</b> is provided by way of example and is not meant to limit the present disclosure. In some embodiments, a door jamb assembly <b>100</b> may be formed with a flat jamb <b>116</b>, and an additional stop <b>118</b> may be nailed onto the jamb <b>116</b> (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should also be noted that the surface of a molded door jamb assembly <b>100</b> can be matched to the surface of, for example, a molded 6-panel door (e.g., having an MDF exterior). For instance, a door jamb assembly <b>100</b> can have a primer coat applied, which may be similar or comparable to the door mating to the door jamb assembly <b>100</b>. The door jamb assembly <b>100</b> can also have a surface texture <b>126</b>, such as an embossed wood grain pattern (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) or another surface texture <b>126</b> (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), similar to or comparable to the door mating to the door jamb assembly <b>100</b>. Additionally, wood product defects in the exterior of the door jamb assembly <b>100</b>, such as splits, tear outs, knots, pitch bleeds, resin bleeds, and the like may be reduced or eliminated using the systems, techniques, and apparatus disclosed herein. Furthermore, the incidence of typical wood distortion found in existing wood products, e.g., cupping, warping, twisting, crooking, and so forth, may be reduced or eliminated, e.g., due to the shape of the composite outer shell <b>102</b>, which can stabilize the inner core <b>104</b>. Further, in some embodiments, a core <b>104</b> may include structural features configured to further strengthen a door jamb assembly <b>100</b> and/or reduce or minimize dimensional distortion/cupping. For example, one or more features, such as longitudinal channels and/or grooves <b>124</b> may be formed in the core <b>104</b> (e.g., on a back side of the core as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>). In some embodiments, the grooves <b>124</b> may run the length of the core <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Additionally, improved utilization of wood and/or reduction of material waste of wood over typical manufacturing may be achieved using the systems, techniques, and apparatus disclosed herein. Also, areas with an abundant wood fiber supply but a lesser supply of larger sections of wood for milling one-piece jamb parts can benefit from the ability to locally manufacture the door jamb assemblies <b>100</b> disclosed herein, incurring, for example, reduced shipping costs due to domestic production. It should also be noted that the defect rate may be reduced (e.g., in comparison to milling wood components) as described herein.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the edges and/or sides of a door jamb assembly <b>100</b> may be hack beveled (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> and <b>34</b></figref>), square (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>), trim guide (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> through <b>21</b> and <b>35</b></figref>), and so forth. Further, the width of a door jamb assembly <b>100</b> can vary based upon, for instance, door opening size, wall thickness, and so forth. The shape of the stop <b>118</b> may also vary. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b></figref>, the stop <b>118</b> may be colonial shaped. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, the stop <b>118</b> may also have square edges. However, these shapes are provided by way of example and are not meant to limit the present disclosure. In other embodiments, a stop <b>118</b> may have a different shape, including, but not necessarily limited to: a one-radius edge (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref>), a two-radius edge (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>), and so forth. The width and/or height of a stop <b>118</b> may also vary. Further, the door jamb assembly <b>100</b> may have different end work, including, but not necessarily limited to: a straight cut (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>), a miter cut (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>), a coped end cut (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>), and so forth.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the thickness of the outer shell <b>102</b> can be at least approximately the thickness of a hinge <b>108</b>. During assembly (e.g., of a door jamb set), the shell <b>102</b> can be routed through to expose the inner core <b>104</b>, and the hinge <b>108</b> can be attached to the door jamb using fasteners (e.g., screws <b>110</b>) connected to the inner core <b>104</b>. However, routing through a door jamb assembly <b>100</b> during assembly is provided by way of example and is not meant to limit the present disclosure. In other embodiments, a door jamb assembly <b>100</b> may be machined/finished (e.g., for hinges <b>108</b>) prior to sale and/or assembly as a door jamb set. The door jamb set formed of the door jamb assemblies <b>100</b> can include the door <b>106</b>, and the pre-hung door can be attached to the door opening by fastening (e.g., nailing or screwing) through the flat of the jamb, i.e., through the outer shell <b>102</b>, through the inner core <b>104</b>, and into the door rough opening.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the stop <b>118</b> can be hollow (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>20</b></figref>). The interior cavity of the hollow stop <b>118</b> can be left empty, or, in some embodiments, a protrusion <b>120</b> of the core <b>104</b> can extend into the cavity of the stop <b>118</b> (e.g., again as described optionally with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>20</b></figref>). For example, an additional piece of wood, additional wood fragments, or another material can be glued or otherwise fastened to the rough and/or unfinished (e.g., not finely milled) edge glued blocks, finger jointed blocks, particle board, and/or MDF forming the core <b>104</b>. Such additional wood or other material disposed in the cavity of the stop <b>118</b> may form, for example, a door stop core. However, in other embodiments, the stop <b>118</b> may be solid (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>21</b></figref>). For example, when the shell <b>102</b> is molded from slurry and/or pressed from a flat composite panel, the stop <b>118</b> can be formed from a portion of the slurry and/or pressed panel which is less compressed than the remainder of the shell <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the stop <b>118</b> can be formed from a loose mat and binding agent/resin/wax arrangement, where the raw material mat thickness is increased in the area of the stop <b>118</b>. Further, in some embodiments, the stop <b>118</b> can include interior strengthening/stabilizing features <b>122</b>, including, but not necessarily limited to: latticing, honeycombing, cross-bracing, and so forth (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b> through <b>29</b></figref>). These features <b>122</b> may also be formed of slurry or panel material that is less compressed than the remainder of the shell <b>102</b>. Further, such features <b>122</b> may be formed of separate material glued or otherwise attached to the shell <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the interior of the stop <b>118</b> may also be corrugated (e.g., in the manner of cardboard).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">While the description herein has detailed door jamb assemblies <b>100</b> including jambs <b>116</b> and stops <b>118</b> for interior doorway applications with some specificity, it is noted that these particular trim molding applications are provided by way of example and are not meant to limit the present disclosure. In other embodiments, the systems, techniques, and apparatus described herein can be used for various other interior trim molding applications, including, but not necessarily limited to, interior millwork applications that can use a molded outer surface shell with a rough wood stiffener inside, such as base moldings, case moldings, crown moldings, etc.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above.
