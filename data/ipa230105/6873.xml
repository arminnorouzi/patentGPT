Furthermore, the mobile station transmits SRSs periodically (e.g. at 1-subframe intervals=at 1 ms intervals), according to command from the base station. Furthermore, a plurality of bandwidths, such as 1.25 MHz, 5 MHz and 10 MHz, are provided for the SRS transmission bandwidth, and a bandwidth corresponding to the propagation condition of the mobile station is set. For example, a mobile station located at a cell edge where the propagation condition is poor and transmission power is limited does not have power necessary to transmit a wideband SRS, and so the mobile station transmits a narrowband (e.g. 1.25 MHz) SRS. When such a narrowband SRS is used, wideband CQI estimation is performed over a plurality of transmission time fields by performing frequency hopping.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, the 3GPP RAN LTE is studying the use of random access preamble (hereinafter abbreviated as a &#x201c;preamble&#x201d;) for initial access of a mobile station, updating of transmission timing and CQI estimation on uplink from a mobile station to a base station (e.g. see Non-Patent Document 2). A preamble is a signal including identification information about a mobile station, and each mobile station randomly selects one of a plurality of code sequences set up in advance by a base station or selects one code sequence according to command from the base station. Each mobile station then transmits a preamble generated based on the selected code sequence to the base station. According to the 3GPP RAN LTE, the preamble is formed with one subframe, for example, and the time length of the preamble is 1 ms (=14 LBs) including the CP, the preamble and the guard time, which is a non-transmission period. Furthermore, the mobile station transmits preambles periodically (e.g. at 10-subframe intervals=10 ms intervals), according to command from the base station as in the case of SRS. Furthermore, for the preamble transmission bandwidth, for example, 1.08 MHz is set (=6 RBs (Resource Blocks)). Furthermore, when the preamble is transmitted, frequency hopping is performed to provide frequency diversity gain and improve the preamble detection performance as in the case of the SRS.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, a preamble transmitted from a mobile station which has not established synchronization with a base station on uplink entails a delay matching the round trip propagation delay time (RTD) at reception timing at the time of reception in the base station. Therefore, a guard time is set in the preamble as described above to prevent the preamble from delaying and causing interference with the signal of the next subframe.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When transmitting an SRS, resources of the time domain and frequency domain may be assigned thereto exclusive of other signals (e.g. see Non-Patent Document 3).

Moreover, suppose the system bandwidth is 24 RBs, the preamble transmission bandwidth is 6 RBs and the SRS transmission bandwidth is 6 RBs. Furthermore, different mobile stations transmit SRS <b>1</b> and SRS <b>2</b> respectively. Furthermore, both the preamble and the SRS are subjected to frequency hopping whereby the transmission band is changed per transmission time field.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0099">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, association rule setting section <b>402</b> sets association rules such that the preamble transmission band matches the SRS transmission band in a transmission time field that satisfies 1&#xd7;(preamble transmission time interval)=5&#xd7;(SRS transmission time interval).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0100">Since the preamble transmission time interval inputted from preamble transmission field determining section <b>401</b> is 5 subframes, SRS transmission field determining section <b>403</b> determines the SRS transmission time interval to be 1 subframe from (m/n)&#xd7;(preamble transmission time interval), based on equation 1. Furthermore, SRS transmission field determining section <b>403</b> determines the transmission band in which the SRS transmission band and the preamble transmission band match, in a transmission time field that satisfies equation 1.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0101">That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the SRS is included in part of the preamble in the preamble transmission time field. By this means, the preamble transmission band can include the preamble and SRS in the preamble transmission time field, and therefore it is possible to assign the remaining transmission band, for example, to PUSCH, for data transmission.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0102">Thus, according to the present embodiment, when a preamble and SRS are subjected to frequency hopping, the preamble transmission band and the SRS transmission band are made to match each other. This makes it possible to maintain a frequency diversity effect through frequency hopping and transmit an SRS in the same transmission time field and the same transmission band as those for a preamble. Therefore, the present embodiment can reduce the communication resources used for SRSs.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0103">A case has been described with the present embodiment where the SRS transmission band is determined such that the SRS frequency hopping pattern matches the preamble frequency hopping pattern in a transmission time field in which the preamble and the SRS match each other. However, according to the present disclosure, the preamble transmission band may be determined so that the preamble frequency hopping pattern matches the SRS frequency hopping pattern.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0104">Furthermore, a case has been described with the present embodiment where there is one SRS in the transmission time field in which the preamble and the SRS match each other, but the present disclosure is also applicable to a case where there are a plurality of SRSs in the transmission time field in which the preamble and the SRS match each other. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, when SRS <b>1</b> and SRS <b>2</b> are arranged in different transmission bands in the same transmission time field, a transmission band that matches that of the preamble may be given to SRS <b>1</b> and SRS <b>2</b> evenly. To be more specific, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, in the preamble transmission time field, both transmission bands of SRS <b>1</b> and SRS <b>2</b> are made to match two different preamble transmission bands respectively. This allows the effect of the present disclosure resulting from the match between the preamble and the SRS transmission fields to be given to a plurality of SRSs evenly. Moreover, the influence of interference resulting from the match between the preamble and the SRS transmission fields can also be distributed evenly over a plurality of SRSs.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0105">Furthermore, when there are a plurality of SRSs in the transmission time field in which the preamble and the SRS match each other, a transmission field that matches that of the preamble may be preferentially assigned to only a specific SRS. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the SRS having the smallest transmission bandwidth (SRS <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) of a plurality of SRSs (SRS <b>1</b> and SRS <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) may be designated as a specific SRS. Thus, for an SRS having a small transmission bandwidth (SRS of a narrowband), it is possible to improve the accuracy of CQI estimation using a preamble as an SRS. For example, SRS <b>1</b> may be assigned to a mobile station located at a cell edge, which has a small system bandwidth and which requires improvement of the accuracy of CQI estimation. Here, when a preamble is used as an SRS, the base station indicates the code sequence to use as the preamble to the mobile station in advance. This eliminates collision between preambles from different mobile stations at the base station and allows the base station to use preambles in the same way as SRSs to be subjected to CQI estimation.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0106">Embodiments of the present disclosure have been explained so far.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0107">As discussed above, a preamble may be associated with an SRS using equation 1. However, with the present disclosure, it is equally possible to associate a preamble with an SRS by making m and n in following equation 1 unequal. For example, the relationship m&#x2264;n may be assumed between m and n in equation 1. That is, a preamble and SRS may be associated to constantly satisfy the relationship: preamble transmission time interval&#x2265;SRS transmission time interval.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0108">Furthermore, the association rules in the embodiments above may be changed according to the system bandwidth. For example, the 3GPP RAN LTE is studying 1.25/2.5/5/10/15/20 MHz for the system bandwidth. Thus, the preamble and SRS association rules may be changed for each of the above-described system bandwidths. This allows the rate at which the preamble and SRS transmission fields match each other to be set to an optimum rate for each system bandwidth. Here, the smaller the system bandwidth, the smaller the amount of communication resources available. Therefore, by increasing the rate at which the preamble and SRS transmission time fields match each other as the system bandwidth decreases, it is possible to provide greater effect of reducing SRS communication resources.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0109">Furthermore, the embodiments above may adopt a configuration for determining whether or not to transmit the SRS in the preamble transmission field according to the cell radius and how often the SRS is transmitted. Especially, applying the present disclosure to only a case where the cell radius is small allows transmission and reception without interference between preambles and SRSs. Here, the &#x201c;cell of a small cell radius&#x201d; refers to a cell that satisfies following equation 3.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Max.<i>RTD&#x2264;GT</i>&#x2212;(<i>CP+SRS</i>)&#x2003;&#x2003;(Equation 3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">where Max.RTD denotes the maximum RTD of the cell.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Furthermore, the embodiments above may also adopt a configuration in which the mobile station determines whether or not to transmit an SRS in the preamble transmission time field according to the distance between the base station and the mobile station estimated from a path loss level of a received signal. For example, when the distance between the base station and the mobile station is small, the mobile station transmits an SRS in the preamble transmission time field. This allows the base station to prevent interference between the preamble and the SRS. On the other hand, when the distance between the base station and the mobile station is large, the mobile station does not transmit any SRS in the preamble transmission time field. This allows the preamble to be transmitted without interference in the preamble transmission time field. In this case, even if the mobile station does not transmit any SRS, the base station may judge that the channel quality (CQI) is very low because the distance between the base station and the mobile station is large. This makes CQI estimation unnecessary, preventing frequency scheduling using CQI estimate values from being affected.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Furthermore, a case has been described above in the embodiments above where a preamble and an SRS are transmitted from different mobile stations, but when the preamble and the SRS have the same transmission time field from one mobile station, the preamble and the SRS may be transmitted simultaneously. For example, the mobile station may arrange an SRS in a guard time of a preamble to be transmitted in the preamble transmission field that matches the SRS transmission field and simultaneously transmit the preamble and the SRS arranged in the guard time of the preamble.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Furthermore, in the embodiments above, code sequences may be used which have a small cross-correlation between a code sequence used as a preamble and a code sequence used as an SRS. This allows the base station to reduce interference between the preamble and the SRS caused by a delay of the preamble reception timing.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Furthermore, a case has been described with the present embodiment where a preamble is transmitted, but similar effects can also be obtained by applying the present disclosure to a signal with a guard time set in the transmission time field and transmitted periodically by the mobile station to the base station.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Furthermore, a case has been described with the present disclosure where an SRS is transmitted, but similar effects can also be obtained by applying the present disclosure to signals transmitted periodically from the mobile station to the base station.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Moreover, although cases have been described with the embodiments above are configured by hardware, the present disclosure may be implemented by software.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Each function block employed in the description of the aforementioned embodiments may typically be implemented as an LSI constituted by an integrated circuit.
