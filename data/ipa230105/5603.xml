barcode information related to barcode labels to be used for delivering a collected material collected from the body of a patient in a medical facility to a culture facility or delivering a drug cultured from the collected material in the culture facility to the medical facility for a regenerative medicine process related to autologous cells.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, autologous cell transplantation has been performed in which cells collected from the body of a patient are cultured, a drug is generated, and the drug is transplanted into the body of the patient. In order to perform this autologous cell transplantation, a cell culture center (hereinafter, &#x201c;culture facility&#x201d;) in which the collected cells are expertly cultured is required.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In autologous cell transplantation, different dedicated containers have to be used as a first container used exclusively for delivering cells collected from the body of a patient in a medical facility to a culture facility and a second container used exclusively for delivering a drug cultured in the culture facility to the medical facility where the patient is present, because the first and the second containers are different in storage capacity, storage temperature, storage humidity, and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a conventional medical facility, the name of a patient is described in order to specify the patient and the pathological material. For example, in a case where the pathological material is a biopsy specimen, the pathological material is collected in an endoscopy room or the like and carried to a pathology laboratory. Therefore, the name of the patient displayed on a pathological-material container is copied to an endoscopy-room nursing record or a pathological request document created in the endoscopy room in order to manage the pathological material. Further, in the pathology laboratory, the name of the patient described on the pathological-material container is copied to pathological-material reception records, an issued pathological number ledger, or the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since the name of the patient described on the pathological-material container is copied to the endoscopy-room nursing record, the pathological request document, the pathological-material reception records, the issued pathological number ledger, or the like as described above, mix-up of patients or mix-up of pathological materials may occur because of a copying error.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to provide a pathological-material container that can prevent mix-up of patients or pathological materials and can surely manage a pathological material collected from a patient, Patent Literature 1 discloses a technique characterized by including a container body in which a fixative for fixing a pathological material collected from a patient is accommodated, a lid for sealing the container body, and a multi-label including a plurality of labels that are connected to each other in a disconnectable manner and indicate the same container serial number. One of the labels is attached to the lid, and the remaining labels are attached to the container body.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In Patent Literature 1, one of the labels indicating the same container serial number is attached to the lid, and the remaining labels are attached to the container body. A person who carries a biopsy specimen collected in the endoscopy room carries the pathological-material container and a pathological request document from the endoscopy room to the pathology laboratory for pathological examination. A pathologist assistant in the pathology laboratory confirms that the biopsy specimen is present in the carried pathological-material container, and confirms that the container serial numbers of the label attached to the pathological-material container and the label attached to the pathology request document match each other.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2018-4619</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in a case of diverting the invention described in Patent Literature 1 to the above-described regenerative medicine process related to autologous cells, the following problems arise.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000">(1) In Patent Literature 1, the pathologist assistant visually confirms that the container serial numbers of the label attached to the pathological-material container and the label attached to the pathology request document match each other, and therefore a work burden is imposed on the pathologist assistant. However, when such a technique based on visual confirmation by human is diverted to a delivery system of a delivery company that delivers a large number of articles, there arises a problem that a large work burden is imposed on a delivery person of the delivery company.<br/>(2) Patent Literature 1 discloses a technique in which a barcode reader connected to a terminal constituting a pathology subsystem is used to read a two-dimensional barcode of the label attached to the pathological-material container and to input the container serial number. However, there is no disclosure of how the pathology subsystem performs the confirmation process.<br/>(3) Patent Literature 1 discloses that the pathological material collected from a patient is accommodated in a pathological-material container and carried from the endoscopy room to the pathology laboratory in the same medical facility. However, there is no description that delivery of the pathological-material container is requested to the delivery company, and the container is delivered while being accommodated in a larger carrying container. Further, Patent Literature 1 fails to disclose mix-up of carrying containers each accommodating therein such a pathological-material container.<br/>(4) For example, when the pathological-material container is kept warm at a predetermined temperature, the pathological-material container needs to be accommodated in a heat insulating container larger than the pathological-material container. Therefore, in order to acquire the container serial number from the label attached to the pathological-material container, the heat insulating container needs to be opened once, which results in temporal temperature rise during heat insulation and exposes the pathological-material container to a dangerous situation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Therefore, for a regenerative medicine process related to autologous cells, in which a collected material collected from the body of a patient in a medical facility is delivered to a culture facility and a drug cultured from the collected material in the culture facility is delivered to the medical facility, there are demands for preventing mix-up of a plurality of different kinds of delivered articles including, for example, a collection container accommodating therein the collected material, a drug package accommodating therein the drug, and a delivery container accommodating therein the collection container or the drug package and for automating a verification process.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">An embodiment of the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and an object of the embodiment is to prevent mix-up of a plurality of different kinds of delivered articles without opening a delivery container and to automate a verification process, for a regenerative medicine process.</p><heading id="h-0007"

the barcode sheet includes a first barcode label indicating a serial number related to the article, a barcode-image portion indicating the serial number related to the article, and a second barcode
