The piping member and the duct are usually connected via a sealing material called a grommet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">By the way, since it is difficult to control a wall thickness in blow molding, when the duct is formed by the blow molding, the wall thickness of the duct tends to vary. The grommet is attached to the opening of the duct by engaging a groove on an outer peripheral surface of the grommet with an edge of the opening of the duct. Therefore, when the wall thickness of the duct fluctuates, the grommet becomes wobbly or the edge of the opening of the duct has difficulty engaging the groove of the grommet, as a result a sealing performance at a connection portion between the duct and the piping member may deteriorate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention has been made by taking the afore-mentioned circumstances into consideration. The present invention provides a duct structure with superior sealing at a connection portion between a duct and a piping member.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the present invention, a duct structure comprising a duct and a piping member is provided. The duct includes an opening in a tubular portion. The piping member includes a piping portion. The piping portion is inserted into the opening and connected to the duct. And a foamed rubber sealing material is disposed in a compressed state between an outer peripheral surface of the piping portion and an edge of the opening.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the duct structure of the present invention, the foamed rubber sealing material is disposed in a compressed state between the outer peripheral surface of the piping portion and the edge of the opening of the duct. The compressed foamed rubber sealing material is pressed against the edge of the opening of the duct and the piping portion by its own restoring force, so even if a wall thickness of the duct changes, a sealing performance at a connection portion between the duct and the piping member does not deteriorate, the sealing performance at the connection portion between the duct and the piping member is excellent.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Hereinafter, various embodiments of the present invention will be described.

Any of the embodiments described below can be combined with each other. Respective features independently form the invention.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a duct structure <b>1</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention is a vehicle duct structure arranged on an instrument panel or a ceiling of a vehicle, and the duct structure <b>1</b> includes a duct <b>2</b> and a piping member <b>3</b>. The piping member <b>3</b> is a member for connecting a sterilizing ion generator (not shown) and the duct <b>2</b>. The sterilizing ion generated from the sterilizing ion generator is introduced into the duct <b>2</b> through the piping member <b>3</b>. One example of the sterilizing ion is nanoe ion. In the present embodiment, the piping member <b>3</b> is supposed to connect the sterilizing ion generator and the duct <b>2</b>, but the piping member <b>3</b> may connect a device that generates another component (for example, an aroma component) to the duct <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the duct <b>2</b> includes a pair of tubular portions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, a pair of suction ports <b>2</b><i>b</i>, and a pair of air outlets <b>2</b><i>c</i>. An air sent from an air conditioner (not shown) enters the duct <b>2</b> from the suction ports <b>2</b><i>b</i>, passes through a ventilation path in the tubular portions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, and is blown out from the air outlets <b>2</b><i>c</i>. A number of the tubular portion <b>2</b><i>a</i>, the suction port <b>2</b><i>b</i>, and the air outlet <b>2</b><i>c </i>can be changed as appropriate. For example, it is possible to configure an air entering from one suction port <b>2</b><i>b </i>to be blown out from four outlets <b>2</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, an opening <b>2</b><i>d </i>is provided in the tubular portion <b>2</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>3</b>A</figref>, a piping portion <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the piping member <b>3</b> is inserted into the opening <b>2</b><i>d </i>and connected to the duct <b>2</b>. A foamed rubber sealing material <b>4</b> is disposed in a compressed state between an outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> of the piping portion <b>3</b><i>c </i>and an edge of the opening <b>2</b><i>d</i>. The compressed foamed rubber sealing material <b>4</b> is pressed against the edge of the opening <b>2</b><i>d </i>and the outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> by its own restoring force, so even if a wall thickness of the duct <b>2</b> changes, a sealing performance at a connection portion between the duct <b>2</b> and the piping member <b>3</b> does not deteriorate, the sealing performance at the connection portion between the duct <b>2</b> and the piping member <b>3</b> is excellent.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The duct <b>2</b> is preferably a foam duct. Since a wall thickness of the foam duct tends to vary widely, a technical significance of applying the present invention is particularly remarkable. A foaming ratio of the foam duct is, for example, 1.5 to 5 times, preferably 2 to 4 times, and specifically for example, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 or 5.0 times, and can be in the range between the two values exemplified herein. An average wall thickness of the tubular portion <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the duct <b>2</b> is, for example, 1 to 5 mm, preferably 2 to 4 mm, and specifically for example, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 or 5 mm, and can be in the range between the two values exemplified herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The sealing material <b>4</b> has a sheet shape and is preferably wound around the outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>. A planar shape of the sheet is preferably rectangular. A value of [a width of the sealing material <b>4</b> (a length in a wall thickness direction of the tubular portion <b>2</b><i>a</i>)/the wall thickness of the tubular portion <b>2</b><i>a</i>] is preferably 3 to 20, more preferably 5 to 15. If this value is too small, the sealing performance may deteriorate, and if this value is too large, it may lead to an increase in cost, or a part arranged in the tubular portion <b>2</b><i>a </i>may become long, leading to abnormal noise during ventilation. Specifically, this value is, for example, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20, and can be in the range between the two values exemplified herein.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">An outer peripheral diameter of the piping portion <b>3</b><i>c </i>is smaller than an inner peripheral diameter of the opening <b>2</b><i>d</i>, but the outer peripheral diameter of the sealing material <b>4</b> in a state in which the sealing material <b>4</b> is wound around the outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> is larger than the inner peripheral diameter of the opening <b>2</b><i>d</i>. Therefore, in a state in which the sealing material <b>4</b> is wound around the outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>, the sealing material <b>4</b> is pressed and compressed, and in that state, the piping portion <b>3</b><i>c </i>and the sealing material <b>4</b> are inserted into the opening <b>2</b><i>d</i>, and then an external force applied to the sealing material <b>4</b> is removed. Then, the sealing material <b>4</b> tries to return to an original shape and is pressed against an edge of the opening <b>2</b><i>d </i>and the outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>, and the connecting portion between the duct <b>2</b> and the piping member <b>3</b> is sealed. In the present specification, the outer peripheral diameter means a diameter of a circumscribed circle, and the inner peripheral diameter means a diameter of an inscribed circle.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">If the sealing material <b>4</b> is an annular member, it is troublesome to attach the sealing material <b>4</b> to the outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>, but in the present embodiment, since the sealing material <b>4</b> has a sheet shape and it is able to attach to the outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> simply by winding the sealing material <b>4</b> around the outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>, it is excellent in assembleability. In addition, since the sheet shaped sealing material <b>4</b> is usually cheaper than a grommet, it is able to reduce a manufacturing cost by adopting the sheet shaped sealing material <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in the present embodiment, a bent portion <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>3</b> is provided near a tip of the piping portion <b>3</b><i>c</i>. In this case, if the sealing material <b>4</b> is an annular member, it is particularly troublesome to attach the sealing material <b>4</b> to the outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>, so that a technical significance of adopting the sheet shaped sealing material <b>4</b> is particularly remarkable. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the piping member <b>3</b> is connected to the duct <b>2</b> so that a part <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>4</b> on a tip side faces the air outlet <b>2</b><i>c </i>side rather than the bent portion <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>3</b>. Therefore, the sterilizing ion smoothly joins the air from the air conditioner.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, it is preferable that the sealing material <b>4</b> is wound around the outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> so that an overlapping portion <b>4</b><i>a </i>is formed. This is because if the overlapping portion <b>4</b><i>a </i>is not formed, an air may leak from a gap between both ends of the sealing material <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>7</b> to <b>8</b></figref>, a protrusion <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>2</b> protruding from the outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> is provided in the piping portion <b>3</b><i>c</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>8</b></figref>, the sealing material <b>4</b> is wound around the outer peripheral surface <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> to cover at least a part of the protrusion <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>2</b>. In the present embodiment, the sealing material <b>4</b> covers a part of the protrusion <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>2</b>, but the sealing material <b>4</b> may cover the whole of the protrusion <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the protrusion <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>2</b> is disposed to be located outside the tubular portion <b>2</b><i>a </i>with the piping portion <b>3</b><i>c </i>inserted into the opening <b>2</b><i>d</i>. At a part in which the sealing material <b>4</b> covers the protrusion <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>2</b>, the outer peripheral diameter of the sealing material <b>4</b> is increased by the amount of the protrusion <b>3</b><i>c</i><b>2</b>, and it is impossible or very difficult to insert the part into the opening <b>2</b><i>d</i>.
