Blanks often are die cut, from various materials, into specific shapes and sizes to create various types of boxes. The blanks typically include lines of weakness (such as perforated or scored lines) at points along the blank. These lines of weakness aid in folding and shaping the blank to form the resulting box.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some blanks include additional lines of weakness or features that allow the formed boxes to be used for additional purposes. While boxes may be used to store or transport items, they can also be used to display items. One such example known in the art is the use of one or more perforated sections on a box that can be removed. The result is a portion of the box remaining that provides a different shape and/or carrying capacity of the box so that the objects inside the box may be more easily accessed or displayed, such as on retail shelves.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The removed portions of the box are generally discarded. As such, while part of the box may be used, most of the box is discarded after objects are removed from the box. Therefore, there is an additional need to provide display options for objects, both for ease in displaying (such as to display objects for sale to consumers), and to provide additional uses for the box transporting the objects.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention generally relates to a blank for forming a box, where the box can also be modified to create a variety of displays.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The general object of the invention can be attained, at least in part, through a blank for forming a box for packaging and displaying objects, specifically objects for retail sale. The blank includes a flexible sheet having a plurality of panels that fold into a box, a perforated line of weakness extending between rows of the plurality of panels, and a plurality of tabs in a lateral row along at least one row of the plurality of panels. The plurality of panels includes a row of lateral panels along the flexible sheet, a row of top panels above the lateral panels, and a row of bottom panels below the lateral panels. The row of top panels forms a top of the box. The top includes a lid flap and two opposing side flaps.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The row of bottom panels foul's a bottom of the box. The bottom of the box includes two sets of transverse flaps. The two sets of transverse flaps fit inside one another or abut one another to form the bottom of the box. The row of lateral panels includes four lateral panels that form four walls of the box. The four walls include a front wall, a rear wall, a first side wall, and a second side wall.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A first panel of the row of lateral panels includes a circular perforation. The circular perforation is at one end of the tabs, in line with the tabs. The row of lateral panels includes a first line of weakness extending transversely across a width of the row of lateral panels. The row of lateral panels also includes a second line of weakness extending transversely across the width of the row of lateral panels. The second line of weakness is parallel to the first line of weakness. The first line of weakness and the second line of weakness are preferably perforated, forming a perforated strip. The perforated strip is thus removable from the sheet.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first panel of the row of lateral panels preferably includes a void on a first outside edge of the sheet. The void is aligned with the perforated strip. The perforated strip includes a tear tab for detaching the perforated strip from the sheet. The tear tab extends through the void.

The sealing flap includes a void aligned with the perforated strip.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The sheet also preferably includes a perforated line of weakness between the fourth panel and the sealing flap. This perforated line of weakness extends a length of the sealing flap.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The sheet also preferably includes a line of weakness between each panel of the row of lateral panels. The lines of weakness extend longitudinally, down a length of the row of lateral panels. The sealing flap attaches to the first outside edge of the sheet, thereby connecting the fourth panel to the first panel, when creating the box. The row of lateral panels folds along the lines of weakness.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The general object of this invention can also be attained through a box for holding and displaying a plurality of articles. The box includes a top with a foldover flap, and two side flaps. The foldover flap is moveable between a closed position and an opened position. The box also includes a bottom with a plurality of bottom flaps for closing the bottom of the box and a plurality of side walls foldably connected to a sealing flap. A first side wall of the plurality of side walls is foldably connected to a side flap of the two side flaps along a perforated line of weakness. The first side wall is foldably connected to a bottom flap of the plurality of bottoms flaps along a scored line of weakness.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A first perforated line of weakness preferably extends transversely across a width of the plurality of side walls. A second perforated line of weakness preferably extends transversely across the width of the plurality of side walls. The second line of weakness is parallel to the first line of weakness, forming a perforated strip. A plurality of tabs are included in a lateral row along the plurality of side walls. The lateral row is configured along a centerline between the first perforated line of weakness and a top of the plurality of side walls. There is also a circular perforation on the first side wall along the lateral row.

The void is aligned with the perforated strip. The perforated strip includes a tear tab extendable into the void. The perforated strip is removed from the box with the tear tab to create a tray to display the plurality of articles. The tray includes the bottom of the box and a portion of the plurality of side walls.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The foldover flap and the two side flaps of the top of the box are removed from the plurality of side walls at the perforated lines of weakness. The sealing flap is removed from the fourth side wall at the perforated line of weakness to create a display strip to display the plurality of articles. The display strip creates a hangable display by the circular perforation. Each article of the plurality of articles can be hung on the hangable display on a respective tab.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another embodiment of this invention includes a blank for forming a box for packaging and displaying objects. The blank includes a plurality of panels adapted to fold into the box, a first perforated line of weakness extending between rows of the plurality of panels, and a second perforated line of weakness extending between rows of the plurality of panels. The second perforated line of weakness is parallel to the first perforated line of weakness. The blank also includes a plurality of tabs in a lateral row along at least one row of the plurality of panels and a circular perforation on an end of the lateral row. U-bends of the tabs point towards the circular perforation.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The plurality of panels includes a series of top panels. The series of top panels are removed from the plurality of panels at a plurality of perforated points. The first perforated line of weakness and the second perforated line of weakness comprise a removeable strip.

The box is used to store and transport objects or other items or articles. After transport, the box can be dually used to display the objects. The box includes a variety of types and positions of lines of weakness which allow modifications to the box so that the box can be transformed into a display for the objects.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a blank <b>100</b> for forming a box according to one embodiment of the invention. The blank <b>100</b> is made of a flexible sheet <b>106</b>. The flexible sheet can be made from a variety of materials, preferably cardboard. The flexible sheet <b>106</b> includes a variety of panels <b>108</b>. These panels <b>108</b> are subsequently folded into a box (shown later in additional figures). The panels <b>108</b> are split into three general rows: a row of top panels <b>108</b><i>a</i>, a row of lateral panels <b>108</b><i>b</i>, and a row of bottom panels <b>108</b><i>c</i>. The rows of panels are separated by at least one perforated lines of weakness <b>110</b> that extends between the rows of panels.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Regarding the row of top panels <b>108</b><i>a</i>, the top panels include a lid flap or foldover flap <b>113</b>, and two opposing side flaps <b>115</b>. Regarding the row of bottom panels <b>108</b><i>c</i>, the bottom panels include two sets of transverse flaps <b>118</b>, <b>119</b>. The first set of transverse flaps <b>118</b> are of like size and shape. The second set of transverse flaps <b>119</b> are also of like size and shape. The sets of the transverse flaps are arranged so that the sets are arranged to alternate with one another on the blank <b>100</b> (from left to right on the blank as shown: <b>118</b>, <b>119</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>119</b>). The sets of bottoms flaps <b>118</b>, <b>119</b> are of a particular size and shape so that the flaps fit into one another to form a bottom of a box when the blank is folded. Alternatively, the flaps may overlay each other and be fastened with tape or glue. The lid flap and side flaps <b>113</b>, <b>115</b> are of a particular size and shape so that these flaps fold and fit into or onto one another to form a top of a box when the blank is folded and the box is in a closed position. However, the top and bottom of the box can be folded and arranged in a variety of ways with a variety of types of top and bottom flaps. For example, the top and/or bottom of the box can be created by folding the flaps in a complimentary matter such as those shown in the subject embodiment. The top and/or bottom of the box can also include flaps that need to be folded and sealed such as with glue or tape.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Regarding the row of lateral panels <b>108</b><i>b</i>, the lateral panels include four lateral panels <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>120</b><i>c</i>, and <b>120</b><i>d </i>arranged in a row from left to right on the blank <b>100</b>.

Likewise, the size, shape and location of the tabs and circular perforation may also vary according to the characteristics of the objects. In one embodiment, the box <b>102</b> holds objects <b>104</b>. Preferably, the objects <b>104</b> are stored inside the box <b>102</b> for transporting the objects. Once transported, the objects <b>104</b> are displayed by modifying the box <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a tray <b>156</b> formed from a portion of the box. The tray <b>156</b> is used to display the objects <b>104</b>. The tray <b>156</b> is created by removing the perforated strip <b>128</b> from the box <b>102</b>. The perforated strip <b>128</b> can be grasped at the tear tab <b>134</b> to then remove the strip <b>128</b> at the perforated lines <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> from around the perimeter of the box. This results in a bottom portion of the box <b>102</b> becoming the tray <b>156</b>, by splitting the box into two pieces. Boxes according to embodiments of this invention may include features other than the perforated strip to split the box into two pieces (such as a single perforated line of weakness, a cutting guide for a knife/scissors, a removable wire around the perimeter of the box, among others). As the objects <b>104</b> were already in the box <b>102</b>, the objects <b>104</b> can simply remain in the same position as they were during transport. In addition, the objects are now conveniently displayed in the tray <b>156</b>. The remaining top portion of the box that was removed after removing the perforated strip <b>128</b> can either be discarded or further modified into another display option.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a display strip <b>158</b> formed from another portion of the box. The display strip <b>158</b> is formed after the perforated strip <b>128</b> is removed from the box. The top <b>114</b> of the box is also removed by detaching the lid flap <b>113</b> and two side flaps <b>115</b> from the walls <b>121</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>b </i>and <b>121</b><i>c </i>at the line of weakness <b>110</b>. The line of weakness <b>110</b> is preferably perforated. The line of weakness <b>110</b> can also be scored and the flaps <b>113</b>, <b>115</b> cut from the box. The sealing flap <b>136</b> is left attached to the front wall <b>121</b><i>a</i>, but the sealing flap <b>136</b> is detached from the second side wall <b>121</b><i>d </i>at the line of weakness <b>142</b>. This line of weakness <b>142</b> is also preferably perforated for easy removal. After detachment of the front wall <b>121</b><i>a </i>from the second side wall <b>121</b><i>d </i>at the line of weakness <b>142</b>, the row of lateral panels <b>108</b><i>b </i>can be unfolded from a box-shape, into the display strip <b>158</b>. The display strip is preferably rectangular, although other shapes may be used as well.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The display strip <b>158</b> is oriented so that the circular perforation <b>122</b> can be punctured, and the display strip <b>158</b> hung from a hole left by the circular perforation <b>122</b>. The display strip <b>158</b> can be hung in a variety of ways depending on need. For example, in a retail setting, the display strip <b>158</b> can be hung on a retail clip strip, a wire display, or a ball waterfall, among other fixtures. The circular perforation <b>122</b> can also be die-cut into the sheet that forms the blank and may include other shapes and sizes. The tabs <b>112</b> are punctured and pulled slightly away from the plane of the row of lateral panels <b>108</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, the display strip <b>158</b> may include tabs <b>111</b>. Tabs <b>111</b> can be printed with a color contrasting the surrounding color of the display strip. As such, tabs <b>111</b> are easily recognized for positioning and hanging objects. The tabs can also be die-cut into the sheet that forms the blank. In some embodiments of the invention, the tabs may be aligned in other patterns and locations across the display strip.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">An object <b>104</b> from the plurality of objects <b>104</b> is then hung on a tab <b>112</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Preferably, each object of the plurality of objects <b>104</b> has an aperture <b>160</b> through which a tab can be inserted. The aperture can be a die-cut portion of the object, or the object can include a hook feature as a part of the object design or a container design that encloses the object. A variety of designs, shapes and styles can be used to hang the objects from the tabs. In one embodiment of the invention, the box holds six objects. The box therefore also has six tabs for holding each of the six objects.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a box <b>102</b> according to one embodiment of the invention.
