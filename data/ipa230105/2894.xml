description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Process chambers for thermally processing semiconductor wafers are frequently made of quartz (vitreous silica) or similar material because quartz is substantially transparent to radiant energy. Thus, radiant heaters may be positioned adjacent or near the exterior of the chamber (e.g., top of the chamber, bottom of the chamber), and a wafer being processed in the chamber can be heated to elevated temperatures without having the chamber walls heated to the same level. On the other hand, quartz is desirable because it can withstand very high temperatures. Quartz is also desirable because of its inert characteristics that enable it to generally withstand degradation by various processing gases and because of its high purity characteristics.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Due to the high temperatures associated with thermally activated chemical vapor deposition processes, the walls and other components of and/or in the process chamber often heat up to a certain degree, and chemical particulates are deposited thereon. These particulates may arise from chemicals in the gases that pass through the reaction chamber and can cause serious problems with the purity of the resulting processed wafer. For example, such impurities can cause devitrification (e.g., wrinkles within a surface of the crystal instead of smooth or glossy surface) or other deterioration of quartz surfaces. As a result, there has been a large effort to reduce the buildup of particulate matter on reaction chamber walls. One solution is to periodically etch the insides of the process chambers to remove the particulate matter before it accumulates to a harmful level. Unfortunately, quartz process chambers take a long time to heat up due to their high transparency to radiant heat. These periodic slow etch cycles thus reduce the maximum throughput of the machine. Moreover, etching may not address the underlying deterioration of the quartz from the devitrification. When running certain processes (e.g., thick layering processes), devitrification of the quartz increases and causes flakes and particles that exacerbate the impurities in the processing chamber.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The temperature gradient across the substrate or other element in the reaction chamber may be generally nonuniform from a leading edge to a trailing edge (defined by the gas flow direction), which may make certain portions of the reactor elements more susceptible to devitrification. The temperature of the gas can further be influenced by its proximity to the heat-absorbing susceptor (substrate support) underneath the wafer. As the gas approaches and passes over the susceptor, it heats up fairly quickly to a maximum temperature towards the downstream edge of the susceptor, and then drops off after traveling past that point. Thus, devitrification tends to accumulate on the quartz surfaces nearest the susceptor, particularly near a downstream edge of the susceptor due to the direction of the flow of gas.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The reaction chamber may include a getter plate or other getter element used to improve reaction efficiency. The getter can be supported at least in part by a getter support. The getter support may generally comprise, consist essentially of or consist of quartz. Due to the proximity of the getter support to the susceptor, the getter support may experience devitrification. A getter support is a component positioned towards the exhaust portion of the reaction chamber. The getter support holds the getter plate intact. The getter plate can absorb the thermal radiation that reduces (e.g., prevents) the chamber coating.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Accordingly, a need exists for improved chamber elements, such as a getter support and/or susceptor, that can be made of quartz or other inert materials to serve their respective reactor functions and yet withstand the deterioration that occurs on quartz surfaces near the susceptor.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an exemplary high temperature process, a reactant gas is passed over the heated substrate, causing the chemical vapor deposition (&#x201c;CVD&#x201d;) of a thin layer of the reactant material onto a surface of the substrate. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;processing gas,&#x201d; &#x201c;process gas,&#x201d; and &#x201c;reactant gas&#x201d; generally refer to gases that contain substances, such as silicon-containing gases, to be deposited on a substrate. As used herein, these terms do not include cleaning gases. Through subsequent processes, the layers of reactant material deposited on the substrate are made into integrated circuits. The process gas flow over the substrate is often controlled to promote uniformity of deposition across the top or front side of the substrate. Deposition uniformity can be further promoted by rotating the substrate holder and substrate about a vertical center axis during deposition. The &#x201c;front side&#x201d; or &#x201c;face&#x201d; of a substrate may refer to the substrate's top surface, which typically faces away from the substrate holder during processing, and the &#x201c;backside&#x201d; of a substrate refers to the substrate's bottom surface, which typically faces the substrate holder during processing.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Reference will now be made to the figures, in which like numerals generally refer to like parts throughout. It will be appreciated that the figures are not necessarily to scale. It will further be appreciated that the apparatuses may vary as to configuration and as to details of the parts, and that the methods may vary as to the specific steps and sequence, without departing from the basic concepts as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, one embodiment of a reaction chamber <b>10</b> for chemical vapor processing and the like is illustrated. As can be seen, the chamber <b>10</b> has an elongated, generally flattened configuration which in cross section has a generally lenticular shape. Other shapes, such as a rectangular prism, are possible, and the lenticular shape with opposed biconvex surfaces is for illustrative purposes. The chamber has an upper wall <b>12</b>, and a lower wall <b>14</b> connected by vertically short side rails <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. The side rails <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> may be taller in some embodiments (e.g., to substantially form a rectangular prism). The side rails <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> may be referred to as &#x201c;side walls&#x201d; or &#x201c;sidewalls&#x201d;. These walls and side rails are further joined by an upstream inlet end flange <b>20</b> and a downstream outlet end flange <b>22</b>. Upstream and downstream relate to the direction of process gas flow, as will be described, and are synonymous in the present description with front and rear. The term &#x201c;wall&#x201d; or &#x201c;sidewall&#x201d; may be used interchangeably with &#x201c;boundary&#x201d; herein. Wall may not be restricted to a generally vertical component but may additionally or alternatively refer to a generally horizontal component, and the walls described herein can be any suitable shape to form a chamber boundary defining a deposition chamber. For example, the chamber boundaries can define a generally horizontal chamber passage configured to conduct gas flow along a gas flow direction therethrough.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The chamber height can be less than the chamber width. In this respect, a longitudinal direction for the chamber <b>10</b> extends from the inlet end flange <b>20</b> to the outlet end flange <b>22</b>, or along the section line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>. A lateral direction extends between the short side rails <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, or along the section line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>. The height direction is perpendicular to both the longitudinal and lateral axes. Looking at the end view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the chamber <b>10</b> has a major dimension extending between the side rails <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, and a minor dimension extending between the apexes of the upper and lower walls <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, both the upper wall <b>12</b> and the lower wall <b>14</b> may be thin, curved plate-like elements having a rectangular flat vertical projection. The walls <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may, in some embodiments, have a circular radius of curvature and may be formed by segments cut from a cylindrical tube made of quartz or similar material. In larger chambers, the walls <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may be constructed by heating and forming flat quartz plates. Unwanted stresses are introduced in curved walls with varying radii and thus a circular wall with a constant curvature can be implemented. In some embodiments, the upper wall <b>12</b> and lower wall <b>14</b> have a radius of curvature of approximately 24 inches. In some embodiments, one or both of the upper wall <b>12</b> and the lower wall <b>14</b> have a thickness of between 4 and 6 millimeters, and more preferably the wall thickness is approximately 5 millimeters. Although quartz is preferred, other materials having similar desirable characteristics may be substituted. Some of these desirable characteristics include a high melting point, the ability to withstand large and rapid temperature changes, chemical inertness, and high transparency to light.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The side rails <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> may be machined from a quartz rod of rectangular cross section or otherwise formed into the cross sectional shape illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. More specifically, each side rail <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> can include a reinforced main body having an upper surface <b>24</b> that forms a continuation of the curved exterior surface of the upper wall <b>12</b>, and a lower surface <b>26</b> which is curved to form a continuation of the exterior surface of the lower wall <b>14</b>. The laterally exterior surface <b>28</b> of each side rail <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> is flat and extends vertically. The interior surface of each side rail <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> is formed with longitudinally extending upper and lower recesses <b>30</b><i>a, </i><b>30</b><i>b </i>that create upper, middle and lower stub wall segments <b>32</b><i>a, </i><b>32</b><i>b, </i><b>32</b><i>c, </i>respectively. In the embodiment shown, the upper and lower stub wall segments <b>32</b><i>a, </i><b>32</b><i>c </i>mate with the side edges of the upper and lower walls <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> at longitudinal weld joints <b>39</b>. In some embodiments, the main body of the side rails <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> has a thickness or width dimension of about 20 mm and a height of about 21 mm.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments a flat, rectangular support plate <b>40</b> can extend between the side rails <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the support plate <b>40</b> includes an aperture <b>42</b> defining a void or opening <b>44</b> extending across the width of the chamber <b>10</b> and dividing the support plate into an inlet section <b>46</b><i>a </i>and an outlet section <b>46</b><i>b. </i>The inlet section <b>46</b><i>a </i>extends from the inlet flange <b>20</b> to an upstream edge of the opening <b>44</b>, and the outlet section <b>46</b><i>b </i>extends from a downstream edge of the opening <b>44</b> to the outlet flange <b>22</b>. As may be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the inlet section <b>46</b><i>a </i>of the support plate may be shorter in the longitudinal direction than is the outlet section <b>46</b><i>b. </i>The inlet section can be, for example, about 70% of the length of the outlet section. That proportional arrangement relates to the process gas flow through the chamber rather than to the strength characteristics of the chamber walls.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each of the side rails <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> includes the inwardly extending central stub wall <b>32</b><i>b </i>that in effect forms an extension of the support plate <b>40</b>. In this respect, the support plate <b>40</b> in practice terminates at the main body of the side rails <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, or, in other words, at the laterally outer extent of the recesses <b>30</b><i>a, </i><b>30</b><i>b. </i>Longitudinal joints <b>48</b> indicate the welded connection between the lateral edges of the support plate <b>40</b> and the central stub walls <b>32</b><i>b </i>of each of the side rails <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The central stub walls <b>32</b><i>b </i>may bisect the upper and lower walls <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, and the support plate <b>40</b> may thus lie on the centerline or center plane therebetween. This desirable location creates stresses generally within the plane of the plate <b>40</b> imposed by lateral displacement of the side rails <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. Such displacement occurs in reduced pressure processing as the walls <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> try to flatten out and exert outward forces thereto.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, each of the end flanges <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> can comprise outer, generally rectangular slabs <b>50</b>, <b>51</b>, respectively, having chamfered corners <b>52</b> and inner lenticular shaped extensions <b>54</b>. As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the inner extensions <b>54</b> conform to the shapes of the upper and lower walls <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and the central support plate <b>40</b>. More particularly, short longitudinal portions extend from the slabs <b>50</b> to join with each of these plate-like members. At each end of the chamber <b>10</b>, curvilinear weld joints <b>56</b> are formed between the curved upper and lower walls <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and the upper and lower portions of the extension <b>54</b>, while linear joint lines <b>58</b> are defined between central portions of the extension <b>54</b> and the longitudinal ends of the support plate <b>40</b>. The slab <b>50</b> of the inlet flange <b>20</b> includes a laterally extending aperture <b>60</b> in an upper portion which leads into a region <b>66</b> within the chamber <b>10</b> above the support plate <b>40</b> and below the upper wall <b>12</b>. The slab <b>51</b> of the outlet flange <b>22</b>, in contrast, includes a pair of laterally extending apertures <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. The upper aperture <b>62</b> communicates with the upper region <b>66</b> of the chamber <b>10</b> previously described, while the lower aperture <b>64</b> communicates with a lower region <b>68</b> of the chamber <b>10</b> below the support plate <b>40</b> and above the lower wall <b>14</b>. The rounded recesses <b>30</b><i>a, </i><b>30</b><i>b </i>in the side rails <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> define lateral boundaries of the upper and lower regions <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>. As will be described below, the wafer processing is done in the upper region <b>66</b> only, with the support plate <b>40</b> defining the lower boundary of the process zone.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The opening <b>44</b> is dimensioned to receive a susceptor <b>84</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, and a temperature compensation ring <b>72</b> which surrounds the susceptor. The compensation ring <b>72</b> can be referred to as a one-piece ring (OPR). The susceptor <b>84</b> can be adapted to rotate within the stationary ring <b>72</b> and is preferably spaced therefrom across a small annular gap of about 0.5 to 1.0 mm. The general perimeter of an aperture in the ring <b>72</b> which can receive the susceptor is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> by the broken line circle <b>74</b> shown therein. The shape of the aperture <b>42</b> in the support plate <b>40</b> surrounding the ring <b>72</b> can also be circular so that the edges of the opening <b>44</b> can be in close proximity to the ring. In some embodiments, a rectangular aperture <b>42</b> has rounded corners, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The support plate sections <b>46</b><i>a, </i><b>46</b><i>b </i>may be configured to provide those exact or approximate shapes; or for manufacturing convenience, short, somewhat triangular sections <b>76</b> of fill, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, may be welded to the plate sections and the chamber side rails <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> to provide the desired configuration. The support plate section <b>46</b><i>b </i>may serve as a getter support in some embodiments, as described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the circle <b>74</b> is not centrally positioned with respect to the upstream and downstream ends of the chamber, or with respect to opening <b>44</b>. This is because in some embodiments the upstream or leading edge of the circle <b>74</b> is closer to the downstream edge of the inlet plate section <b>46</b><i>a </i>than is the downstream or trailing edge of the circle <b>74</b> to the upstream edge of the outlet plate section <b>46</b><i>b. </i>This arrangement may help maintain the strength of the chamber by reducing the rate of devitrification of the upstream edge of the outlet plate section <b>46</b><i>b. </i>That is, the gas flow heats up as it passes over the susceptor so that the temperature within the chamber walls tends to be the greatest just downstream from the susceptor. The upstream edge of the outlet plate section <b>46</b><i>b </i>can therefore be exposed to significant thermal cycling and devitrification if positioned too close to the susceptor, and thus the susceptor is offset forwardly within the opening <b>44</b> to increase the spacing therebetween. In some configurations, this offset arrangement also affects the flow of the process gases through the chamber. The wafer placed upon the susceptor which is surrounded by the ring is positioned close to the downstream edge of the inlet plate section <b>46</b><i>a </i>to reduce or minimize the amount of reaction gases which pass through the opening <b>44</b> upstream of the wafer. This reduces or minimizes the amount of reaction gas which can deposit underneath the susceptor and/or on the backside of the wafer in the lower portion <b>68</b> of the chamber <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the temperature compensation ring <b>72</b> can be supported by one or more (e.g., three) support elements (e.g., elbow-shaped) having vertically extending portions being welded to the support plate sections. In some embodiments, a front support element or finger <b>80</b> is welded to the rear of the front plate section midway between the rails <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> of the chamber, and the horizontal portion of the element extends rearwardly into the opening <b>44</b> so as to be positioned under the leading edge of the temperature compensation ring <b>72</b>. A pair of spaced elements or fingers <b>82</b> have elongated horizontal portions that extend forwardly beneath the trailing edge of the compensation ring <b>72</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. The compensation ring <b>72</b> can thus be supported in a horizontal plane at one or more points by upstanding pins (not shown) in the fingers <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>. The pins may eventually deteriorate from repeated thermal cycling and exposure to process and etch gases, but they can be replaced fairly readily.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A susceptor <b>84</b> is shown supported on arms <b>86</b> of a suitable support <b>88</b> connected to the upper end of a rotatable shaft <b>90</b> that extends through a tube <b>92</b> depending from the bottom wall of the chamber. The susceptor <b>84</b> is shown approximately level with the upper edge of the ring <b>72</b> and with the upper surface of the support plate <b>40</b>. This enables a wafer to be positioned above the susceptor <b>84</b> and in the upper portion <b>66</b> of the process chamber <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the inlet flange <b>20</b> is adapted to be connected to an inlet component <b>94</b> having a horizontally elongated slot <b>96</b> through which a wafer may be inserted, and having an elongated inlet <b>98</b> for introducing process gas into the upper portion <b>66</b> of the chamber after an isolation valve leading from the slot <b>96</b> to a wafer handling chamber (not shown) has been closed. Correspondingly, the outlet flange <b>22</b> is adapted to mate with an outlet component <b>100</b> for exhausting process gas from the chamber <b>10</b>, as well as applying a vacuum to the chamber. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the outlet flange <b>22</b> is open to the lower portion <b>68</b> of the chamber beneath the support plate as well as the portion <b>66</b> above the support plate.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A plurality of thermocouples <b>102</b> may be included that each extend through the outlet component <b>100</b> and into the lower portion <b>68</b> of the process chamber <b>10</b>. The thermocouples <b>102</b> extend into proximity of the susceptor <b>84</b> to sense the local temperature surrounding the susceptor <b>84</b> and wafer positioned there above. The advantageous positioning of the sensing ends of the thermocouples <b>102</b> surrounding the susceptor <b>84</b> allows comprehensive feedback regarding the temperature of the wafer and enables adjustment of radiant heating lamps surrounding the chamber <b>10</b> to compensate for temperature irregularities. More particularly, a leading edge thermocouple <b>104</b> terminates proximate the front end of the susceptor <b>84</b>, a trailing edge thermocouple <b>106</b> terminates proximate a rear edge of the susceptor and a lateral thermocouple (not shown) terminates proximate a lateral edge of the susceptor. Each of the thermocouples <b>102</b> enters the temperature compensation ring <b>72</b> which is formed of two parts to provide a hollow interior therein. The temperature compensation ring <b>72</b> includes generally L shaped inner and outer bodies which cooperatively define an annular passage through the ring for receiving the thermocouples <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Preferably, the temperature compensation ring <b>72</b> is constructed of graphite or other such high heat absorbency material. The ring <b>72</b> provides several advantages in the processing environment, primarily reducing edge heat losses from the susceptor <b>84</b>. More specifically, the ring <b>72</b> closely surrounds the edge of the susceptor <b>84</b> and is maintained at a similar temperature during processing, as the materials are similar. The susceptor and ring thus radiate heat toward one another to effectively cancel any radiant losses therebetween. Another advantage of the temperature compensation ring <b>72</b> is preheating and postheating of the reactant gas in the region of the wafer. Specifically, the reactant gas enters the chamber at an ambient, non-reacting temperature and is heated to a temperature suitable for deposition as it passes over the susceptor and wafer. The surrounding temperature compensation ring <b>72</b> thus preheats the reactant gas stream before it reaches the leading edge of the susceptor, and, subsequently, the leading edge of the wafer. The process gas may reach an approximately steady state temperature before traveling over the edge of the wafer. The temperature of the gas may not significantly drop off after passing the downstream edge of the wafer as the temperature compensation ring <b>72</b> extends the downstream heating region. Further advantages of the temperature compensation ring <b>72</b> will be described below with reference to modified rings.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The gas flow through the chamber is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Reactant gas enters through the inlet component <b>94</b> with a predetermined lateral velocity profile, such as the profile described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,221,556, which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. The predetermined velocity profile provides a larger gas flow towards the central portion of the reaction chamber <b>10</b> than the laterally outer edges to compensate for the longer deposition travel path over the center of the circular wafer supported on the susceptor <b>84</b>. A greater amount of reactant gas may be needed over the central portion of the wafer due to reactant depletion along that flow path over the wafer. Further, the cross sectional shape of the chamber <b>10</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, accommodates greater gas flow at the center of the chamber where greater reactant gas flow is needed, rather than at the lateral edges where less reactant gas flow is needed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The reactant gas continues longitudinally rearward as indicated by arrow <b>112</b> and exits through the outlet component <b>100</b> and downward through exhaust conduits <b>114</b>, as indicated with arrow <b>116</b>. Purge gas may be supplied upward through the hollow tube <b>92</b> surrounding the shaft <b>90</b>, the tube being sized to provide a gas passage surrounding the shaft. The purge gas enters the lower portion <b>68</b> of the chamber <b>10</b> as indicated by arrows <b>118</b>. The purge gas prevents unwanted deposition of particulates underneath the susceptor <b>84</b> and exits through the lower longitudinal aperture <b>64</b> in the outlet flange <b>22</b>, as indicated by arrow <b>120</b>. The purge gas then mixes with the spent reaction gas and continues down along the path of arrow <b>116</b> through the exhaust conduits <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, purge gas can be supplied through an opening in the lower portion of the chamber (e.g., on the left hand side as shown), and flow from the left to the right, exiting through the aperture <b>64</b> and exhaust <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The end flanges <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are preferably translucent and fabricated from quartz having nitrogen bubbles dispersed therein. The central thin walls <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and support plate <b>40</b>, on the other hand, are transparent to radiant energy, allowing radiant heating of the susceptor and wafer in the chamber <b>10</b>, without creating high temperatures in these structures. The translucent flanges <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> scatter radiant energy to reduce &#x201c;light-piping&#x201d; therethrough. This protects <b>0</b>-rings <b>122</b> outside of the flanges <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> from exposure to extreme temperatures generated within the chamber <b>10</b>. Preferably, a section of the tube <b>92</b> below the lower wall <b>14</b> is similarly translucent from nitrogen bubbles dispersed therein.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The chamber <b>10</b> may utilize rectangular cross-sectional chambers, which may increase the utility of a low, wide shape. A rectangular chamber shape can beneficially enable the wafers to be inserted from one end, and enable replacement susceptors and/or rings to be inserted from the other end of the chamber. Such an arrangement may additionally or alternatively enables the gas flow to be introduced from end-to-end through the chamber with the gas flowing above the internal support plate approximately aligned with the wafer to be processed within the chamber.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Modified Rings and Getter Support Elements</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As noted above, devitrification can problematically occur within a reaction chamber, particularly downstream of the susceptor, which may radiate the most heat within the reaction chamber during use. Some solutions to reducing devitrification downstream of the susceptor are described herein. A getter support element (e.g., the outlet support section <b>46</b><i>b</i>) and/or a susceptor support ring (e.g., the stationary ring <b>72</b> described above), and/or other elements described below, may be modified to reduce the devitrification described above.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, one or more elements can include (e.g., be coated with) a non-crystalline material that is resistant to devitrification. The non-crystalline material may be a semiconductor, such as silicon carbide (SiC). The one or more elements may be substantially or fully formed from this material. However, in some embodiments, the one or more elements may be coated with one or more layers of the material.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">For example, a getter support (e.g., the outlet support section <b>46</b><i>b </i>described above) may be coated with SiC. Because SiC is resistant to devitrification, the coated getter support can advantageously prevent devitrification of the getter support while simultaneously performing the other functions that a getter support formed from quartz serve (e.g., high melting point, ability to withstand large and rapid temperature changes, chemical inertness). While quartz is also generally transparent to radiant heat energy, which makes it an advantageous material for the walls of the reaction chamber (as described above), the getter support does not rely on its transparency to perform its function. Instead, the getter support serves to prevent reactant gas from entering the lower portion of the reaction chamber (e.g., the lower portion <b>68</b> of the chamber <b>10</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) while also supporting a getter plate within the reaction chamber. As noted above, the getter plate can absorb the thermal radiation to reduce coating of the chamber walls and other chamber elements. Thus, a SiC-coated getter support can perform most or all of the functions that a quartz getter support previously performed, while also reducing or altogether avoiding devitrification thereof.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A thickness of the coating of material may be sufficiently thick to reduce the likelihood of penetration which could expose the material below the coating, while also not being thicker than necessary to avoid excess cost of manufacture. For example, SiC tends to be an expensive material, so a balancing of thickness of coating may be advantageous. The thickness of the coating may be therefore about 5 microns, about 10 microns, about 15 microns, about 20 microns, about 25 microns, about 30 microns, about 40 microns, about 50 microns, about 60 microns, about 70 microns, about 80 microns, about 90 microns, about 100 microns, about 120 microns, about 140 microns, about 150 microns, about 180 microns, about 200 microns, about 250 microns, any value therein, or fall within a range having endpoints of any of these values therein. For example, in some embodiments the thickness is between about 100 microns and about 120 microns. In some embodiments, the thickness of the coating may be at least as thick as one of the values above. For example, in some embodiments the coating is at least about 50 microns thick. The material on which the coating is layered may be graphite.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a top perspective view of an example reaction chamber assembly that includes a susceptor support ring <b>204</b>, a getter support <b>208</b>, and a getter support shelf <b>212</b>.

The susceptor support ring <b>204</b> may include an aperture <b>216</b> that is adapted to receive a susceptor therein. The aperture <b>216</b> may be substantially circular. The aperture <b>216</b> may centered approximately centrally within the susceptor support ring <b>204</b>, but in some embodiments a center of the aperture <b>216</b> may be slightly off-center within the susceptor support ring <b>204</b> (e.g., as described above with respect to the circle <b>74</b> above).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The susceptor support ring <b>204</b> may be generally rectangular with rounded corners <b>232</b>. The downstream rounded corner <b>232</b> may generally track a corresponding upstream rounded portion <b>236</b> of the getter support <b>208</b>. As such, the rounded corner <b>232</b> can be positioned slightly laterally inwardly, relative to a lateral edge of the ring <b>204</b> as shown, such that the lateral edge of the ring <b>204</b> is approximately parallel (e.g., collinear) with a corresponding lateral edge of the getter support <b>208</b>. The rounded corners <b>232</b> and/or corresponding upstream rounded portions <b>236</b> may be configured to form generally curvilinear transverse portions of edges of the respective component. The susceptor support ring <b>204</b> and the getter support <b>208</b> may be configured such that a gap <b>224</b> may be formed between the susceptor support ring <b>204</b> and the getter support <b>208</b>. In some embodiments a maximum distance across the gap <b>224</b> may be small enough to avoid allowing reactant gas from passing into a lower portion of the chamber, while still providing thermal isolation between the susceptor support ring <b>204</b> and the getter support <b>208</b>. The maximum distance can be about 0.5 mm, about 1 mm, about 2 mm, about 3 mm, about 4 mm, about 5 mm, about 6 mm, about 7 mm, about 8 mm, about 9 mm, about 10 mm, about 11 mm, about 12 mm, any value therein, or fall within a range having any of these values as endpoints. For example, in some embodiments, the maximum distance is between about 1 mm and 10 mm. The maximum distance can be optimized for each embodiment depending on the need. The larger the maximum distance, the greater the reduction in downstream devitrification. On the other hand, the larger the maximum distance, the greater the amount of reactant gas will be able to pass to a lower part of the reaction chamber, which can cause impurities and deposits on the underside of elements within the reaction chamber (as mentioned above).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The rounded corner <b>232</b> and/or the rounded portion <b>236</b> of the getter support <b>208</b> can have a radius of curvature (e.g., a curvature corresponding to a radius) of about 30 mm, about 35 mm, about 40 mm, about 50 mm, about 60 mm, about 65 mm, about 70 mm, about 80 mm, about 90 mm, any value therein, or falling within a range having any of these values having endpoints therein. For example, in some embodiments the radius of curvature is between about 50 mm and about 80 mm.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The getter support <b>208</b> may advantageously have a width <b>226</b> along the longitudinal direction D and in a central portion of the getter support <b>208</b>. The width <b>226</b> may be an important consideration based on a number of factors. The width <b>226</b> may advantageously extend at a value high enough to allow for the reactant gas to sufficiently cool down before coming in contact with the getter support shelf <b>212</b>, to reduce the likelihood of devitrification. On the other hand, a longer width <b>226</b> puts structural stresses on components within the reaction chamber. Accordingly, the width chosen above will depend on a variety of factors, including the type of equipment to be used, the processing temperatures to be used, the dimensions of the reaction chamber, and the materials of the reaction chamber components. The width <b>226</b> may be about 1 mm, about 5 mm, about 10 mm, about 20 mm, about 30 mm, about 50 mm, about 60 mm, about 80 mm, about 100 mm, about 120 mm, about 150 mm, about 175 mm, about 180 mm, about 200 mm, about 250 mm, about 280 mm, about 300 mm, about 350 mm, about 400 mm, about 450 mm, about 500 mm, any value therein, or fall within a range having any of these values as endpoints therein. For example, in some embodiments the width <b>226</b> is between about 1 mm and about 150 mm.

As noted above, due to certain restrictions (e.g., cost of manufacture), not all components within the reaction chamber may include (e.g., be coated with) the inert material (e.g., SiC). For example, the getter support shelf <b>212</b> may comprise uncoated quartz (e.g., may consist essentially of or consist of quartz).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The getter support shelf <b>212</b> may advantageously be included to allow the getter support <b>208</b> to be supported without requiring it to contact another quartz component within the upper chamber.

However, in embodiments where the getter support <b>208</b> comprises a material, such as graphite, that is coated with an inert material (e.g., SiC), the getter support <b>208</b> may become hotter than such a getter support <b>208</b> made of another material (e.g., quartz), which may cause devitrification at any couplings (e.g., attachments, supports) between the getter support <b>208</b> and the quartz reaction chamber wall within the upper portion of the reaction chamber. Accordingly, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> allows the getter support <b>208</b> to be supported within the reaction chamber by the getter support shelf <b>212</b> without needing to be supported by any wall within the reaction chamber. Thus, the getter support <b>208</b> may have a lateral dimension that is less than an interior lateral dimension (e.g., a lateral distance between opposing sidewalls) of the reaction chamber. Additionally or alternatively, the getter support <b>208</b> may not contact one or both lateral walls of the reaction chamber in order to avoid or reduce this devitrification risk.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The getter support shelf <b>212</b> may include an upper portion <b>248</b>, a lower portion <b>246</b>, a support portion <b>247</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), and one or more legs <b>244</b>. These are described in more detail below. A gap <b>234</b> may be formed between the getter support <b>208</b> and the getter support shelf <b>212</b>. The gap <b>234</b> may be implemented to thermally isolate a selected portion of the support shelf <b>212</b> and the getter support <b>208</b>. For example, a longitudinal gap can be positioned between the upper portion <b>248</b> and the getter support <b>208</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In some embodiments a maximum distance across the gap <b>234</b> may be selected to be large enough provide thermal isolation, yet small enough to avoid allowing reactant gas from passing into a lower portion of the chamber across the gap <b>234</b>. For example, the maximum distance can be about 0.5 mm, about 1 mm, about 2 mm, about 3 mm, about 4 mm, about 5 mm, about 6 mm, about 7 mm, about 8 mm, about 9 mm, about 10 mm, about 11 mm, about 12 mm, any value therein, or fall within a range having any of these values as endpoints. For example, in some embodiments, the maximum distance is between about 1 mm and 10 mm.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A face <b>230</b> of the getter support shelf <b>212</b> may be approximately coplanar with a face <b>218</b> of the susceptor support ring <b>204</b> and/or with a face <b>228</b> of the getter support <b>208</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the face <b>218</b> of the getter support <b>208</b> may be approximately coplanar with the face <b>228</b> of the getter support <b>208</b>. Coplanar faces may promote laminar flow of the reactant gas across a corresponding gap <b>224</b>, <b>234</b> while reducing a flow of reactant gas to the lower portion of the chamber across that gap.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">An edge of the susceptor support ring <b>204</b> and/or getter support <b>208</b> (e.g., of the rounded corner <b>232</b> and/or the rounded portion <b>236</b>) can be sloped or curved (e.g., into the faces <b>218</b>/<b>228</b>, and/or into the underside of the support ring <b>204</b> and/or getter support <b>208</b>), to form a chamfer. For example, the chamfer can be on lower edge of the rounded corner <b>232</b> and/or the rounded portion <b>236</b>. The chamfer can advantageously create additional separation from the portions of the getter support <b>208</b> that may otherwise be susceptible to devitrification and thus further reduce the devitrification, while also maintaining a relatively smaller gap <b>224</b> between the susceptor support ring <b>204</b> and the getter support <b>208</b> and thus reducing the flow of reactant gas to the lower part of the chamber. The chamfer can have a width of about 0.5 mm, about 1 mm, about 2 mm, about 3 mm, about 4 mm, about 5 mm, about 6 mm, any value therein, or falling within a range of any of these values having endpoints therein. For example, in some embodiments the width of the chamfer is between about 1 mm and about 4 mm.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The getter support <b>208</b> and/or the getter support shelf <b>212</b> may include one or more recesses <b>220</b><i>a, </i><b>220</b><i>b, </i><b>220</b><i>c. </i>The one or more recesses <b>220</b><i>a, </i><b>220</b><i>b, </i><b>220</b><i>c </i>may be configured to receive corresponding one or more getter support elements therein. The one or more support elements can support a getter (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>; see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) thereon. The material of each of the getter support elements may be the same or different, relative to each other. In some embodiments, the material of the getter support element may be selected based upon which of the one or more recesses <b>220</b><i>a, </i><b>220</b><i>b, </i><b>220</b><i>c </i>the respective getter support element is coupled. For example, the material of any getter support element may substantially include the material of the corresponding component having the corresponding one or more recesses <b>220</b><i>a, </i><b>220</b><i>b, </i><b>220</b><i>c. </i>For example, a first getter support element coupled to a first recess <b>220</b><i>a </i>in the getter support <b>208</b> may be graphite coated with an inert material (e.g., SiC). A second getter support element coupled to a second recess <b>220</b><i>b </i>may have include the same material as the first getter support element. Additionally or alternatively, a third getter support element coupled to a third recess <b>220</b><i>c </i>within the getter support shelf <b>212</b> may have a material that corresponds to a material of the getter support shelf <b>212</b>, such as quartz. If the material of the getter support element is substantially similar to a material of the corresponding getter support <b>208</b> and/or getter support shelf <b>212</b>, this may further reduce any devitrification risk that may be associated with putting thermally conductive materials (e.g., graphite) in close proximity or even contact with quartz. Although the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> contemplates two getter support elements coupled to the getter support <b>208</b> and one getter support element coupled to the getter support shelf <b>212</b>, this is only by way of example.
