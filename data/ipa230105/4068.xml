Frame <b>11</b><i>a </i>is a portion that is subjected to decoration, such as coating, which does not allow light to pass therethrough. Transmission part <b>12</b> is a portion that is not subjected to decoration, that is, a transparent portion.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an area around the camera and the cover opening and closing device according to the first exemplary embodiment. Frame <b>11</b><i>a </i>includes camera <b>16</b> that is an example of an object. The cover opening and closing device according to the present exemplary embodiment includes guide <b>13</b> disposed between frame <b>11</b><i>a </i>and camera <b>16</b> and fixed to frame <b>11</b><i>a</i>, and cover <b>15</b> movable within guide <b>13</b>. That is, guide <b>13</b> accommodates cover <b>15</b>.

In addition, in order not to affect an operation of cover <b>15</b>, guide <b>13</b> is made of a material, such as resin, which does not have a magnetic force by itself and can transmit a magnetic force. Cover <b>15</b> can move, along guide <b>13</b>, between a first position where cover <b>15</b> overlaps camera <b>16</b> and shields camera <b>16</b> as illustrated in FIG. <b>3</b> and a second position where cover <b>15</b> does not shield camera <b>16</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> will be described later. Guide <b>13</b> has a lateral dimension more than twice a lateral dimension of cover <b>15</b> such that cover <b>15</b> moved to the second position does not shield camera <b>16</b>. A lateral direction of guide <b>13</b> corresponds to a longitudinal direction of guide <b>13</b>, for example. A lateral direction of cover <b>15</b> corresponds to a longitudinal direction of cover <b>15</b>, for example.

For attraction, cover <b>15</b> is disposed with its pole different from that of magnet <b>17</b> being directed to a surface of frame <b>11</b><i>a</i>. For repulsion, cover <b>15</b> is disposed with its pole the same as that of magnet <b>17</b> being directed to the surface of frame <b>11</b><i>a</i>. Cover <b>15</b> has a thickness less than a depthwise dimension of guide <b>13</b>.

For example, an elastic body has, for example in its height direction, an upper portion including a magnetically attractive material or a magnetically repulsive material, and is attracted to or repelled by magnet <b>17</b> and then moved in the height direction. This causes heightwise deformation of cover <b>35</b>, and allows cover <b>35</b> to be positionally moved by being moved in the lateral direction while keeping the deformed state. When the magnet is brought away from cover <b>35</b> after the movement of cover <b>35</b>, the heightwise deformation of cover <b>35</b> is restored, and the elastic forces act in both directions of a height.
