More particularly, it relates to a system and a method for assisting the design of manufactured components (or parts) requiring post-processing. In an embodiment, the system and method allow prediction of geometrical deviations between an original 3D model of a component to be fabricated and the final post-processed component and the corresponding adjustments of the 3D model of the component, in order to compensate for dimensional changes which will occur during the manufacturing and post-processing phases.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of industrial component manufacturing, it is often required to manufacture components having specific engineering requirements such as, for example and without being limitative, dimensional characteristics, surface roughness, tolerances, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, a common method used to perform such manufacturing is additive manufacturing, where material is joined to make objects from 3D model data, for example, layer upon layer. This process can however cause deviations, distortions or deformations during the manufacturing process, which leads to components not meeting the geometrical precision requirements. For example and without being limitative, one problem associated with additive manufacturing is associated to part shrinkage which occurs during manufacturing and can lead to the manufactured parts being outside of the accepted dimensional tolerances.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to alleviate, this issue, different methods for predicting deviations during the additive manufacturing process and compensating for the predicted deviation have been used. Such methods include 3D printing shrinkage compensation, compensating 3D shape deviations, distortion prediction, minimization for additive manufacturing, etc.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,886,526B2 describes a system and method for compensation of the dimensions for anticipated shrinkage calculated based on the shrinkage information that is associated with a selected shape from a database of different shapes and their associated shrinkage values, which most closely corresponds to the shape of a layer to be printed. The document also describes modifying the information indicative of the shape of the layer to be printed based on the calculated compensation, to minimize errors cause by shrinkage.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">US patent application no. US20160320771A1 describes another possible method for predicting deformation errors and compensating for shape deviation in additive manufacturing. In this document, the technology described encompasses scanning a model component manufactured using a specific additive manufacturing machine and generating a point cloud file for the manufactured model component; and comparing the scanned model to the original design (i.e. the CAD model) to generate compensations to be performed from the original design to compensate for deformation during the manufacture of the component by the additive manufacturing machine.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 9,950,476B2 describes yet another possible method for minimizing distortions in a workpiece manufactured by additive manufacturing. The method described therein uses finite element analysis on a finite element model of the component to conduct a thermomechanical analysis for predicting warping and post-printing deformation. The predicted deformation is used for introducing alterations to the workpiece prior to or during fabrication of the component, to compensate for the predicted deviations.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other documents describing solutions for minimizing deviations in a workpiece occurring during the manufacture of the workpiece includes, for example, US patent application no. 2018/0341248A1, which describes the use of machine learning-based methods and systems for automated object defect classification of a design geometry of an object (i.e. an original 3D Computer Assisted Design (CAD) model) and adaptive, real-time control of additive manufacturing and/or welding processes for this object.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the above, solutions for compensating for deviations occurring during the manufacturing process of a component (e.g. in the course of an additive manufacturing process) have been proposed. As can be seen, the above-mentioned solutions are, however, all concerned with deviations produced during the additive manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, an additional concern with manufactured components (e.g. components manufactured using additive manufacturing techniques or other manufacturing techniques such as casting or subtractive manufacturing) is that the components often suffer from poor surface finish. Hence, in many cases, components are required to go through post-processing procedures in order to meet initial engineering dimensional and surface finish requirements. For example, and without being limitative, post-processing can be performed through subtraction (i.e. by removing material), or by addition (i.e. by adding material such as coatings). Often, the post-processing procedures, can unfortunately result in the component being altered to fall out of dimensional specification and/or surface specification requirements. In fact, in many cases, the order of magnitude of geometrical deviations produced during manufacturing is significantly smaller than the geometrical deviation from the manufactured part to the final post-processed part. When post-processing is performed, it is therefore required for the design dimensions of the component to take into account the required post-processing procedures, in order to evaluate the material removal/addition which will occur after manufacturing (i.e. during the post-processing procedures) and compensate for deviations performed during these specific post-processing procedures, such that the final component meets both the surface characteristics requirements and the geometrical precision requirements.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">One skilled in the art would understand that there are major differences between the process of predicting the geometrical deviation of a manufactured component manufactured using additive manufacturing and the process of predicting the geometrical deviation of a manufactured component following a surface finishing post-processing, which are completely different by their nature. Where one predicts the deviation from a building/shaping process from an additive (multi-layer welding) manufacturing method for a desired nominal geometry, the other predicts the deviation from a material removal process and/or a coating process from a surface treatment post-processing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (prior art), a typical design and manufacturing cycle for 3D manufactured components, using additive manufacturing, is shown. In the embodiment shown, the process involves the initial design phase of defining the engineering requirements, including, for example and without being limitative, the dimensions, surface finish characteristics (i.e. surface roughness conditions), tolerances and materials for the manufacture of the component (step <b>101</b>). These engineering requirements are the basis on which the original model of the component (or CAD model) is subsequently generated (step <b>102</b>).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Once the original model has been generated, the CAD data associated to the original model (i.e. the data of the original model of the component (CAD model)) can be transferred to a slicer software (step <b>103</b>) generating machine instructions for an associated additive manufacturing apparatus (or 3D printer). At this stage, the additive manufacturing parameters of the component such as, for example and without being limitative, the layer thickness, the print speed, the orientation of the component in the printer while the component is manufactured, etc., are defined. One skilled in the art will understand that the parameters which are defined at this stage have a high impact on the potential deviations, the quality of the manufactured components and the characteristics thereof, such as surface finish characteristics or the like. Indeed, a large layer thickness, for example and without being limitative, can result in a coarse surface finish. In addition, the printing orientation greatly influence the finishing of the different side surfaces of each component. Furthermore, the selected material, the printing technology, and the geometry of the component are additional factors which impact the quality of the manufactured components and the characteristics thereof. For example, small holes with dimensions approaching the printer resolution are most likely to have inaccurate dimensions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Once the machine instructions for the associated additive manufacturing apparatus (3D printer) are generated by the slicer program, a 3D printer can perform the additive manufacturing process (3D printing) (step <b>104</b>). However, due to the above-mentioned bias which can occur depending on the selected printing parameters and the multiple variables involved in the process, components manufactured using additive manufacturing technologies commonly require subsequent post-processing procedures, in order to make the component usable for the intended purpose. Hence, in order to meet the engineering requirements, the manufactured component often requires an additional aging or heat treatment procedure (step <b>105</b>) and/or surface post-processing and surface treatment procedures (step <b>106</b>).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The step of performing the surface post-processing and finishing procedures (step <b>106</b>) on the component commonly entails removing material from specific surfaces (for example using cutting, drilling, machining, abrasive flow machining, electrochemical polishing, automatic lapping, tumble finishing or the like) until the surface finish is within finishing requirement specifications. In many cases, this creates a discrepancy between the dimensions of the finished component and those of the original design (i.e. the dimensions of the original CAD model as specified in the engineering requirements). Indeed, while removing material to achieve the required surface roughness and quality, the geometrical dimensions of the component can deviate from the specified tolerance values, thereby resulting in non-compliance of the component with the dimensional engineering requirements and can lead to discarding of the component. One skilled in the art will understand that the rate at which the material is removed from the component during post-processing, depends on several factors such as the procedure used, the component material, the geometry and features of the component being processed, etc. For example, and without being limitative, a small diameter hole will lose material at a different rate from a curved outer surface of a component. One skilled in the art will also understand that, in alternative embodiments, the post-processing and finishing procedures on component could also entail adding material (for example a coating being applied) on specific surfaces or features of the component.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Hence, one skilled in the art will easily understand that, predicting how much material will be lost through different post-processing and/or finishing processes, for different component materials and geometries would provide several advantages and can save lots of time on design iterations and materials. It will also increase the repeatability and precision of components manufactured, for example, using additive manufacturing. It will also be understood that the same could be said for predicting how much material would be added through a post-processing procedure and/or finishing processes, when treating different component materials and geometries.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In view of the above, there is a need for an improved system and method for assisting the design of manufactured components requiring post-processing, which would be able to overcome or at least minimize some of the above-discussed prior art concerns.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with a first general aspect, there is provided a system for assisting the design of manufactured components requiring post-processing, through prediction of geometrical deviations created by at least one post-processing procedure to be performed on a component following a manufacture thereof.

The system <b>10</b> is designed and configured to accurately predict the geometrical deviations to occur during the post-processing procedures following the manufacturing process and to adjust the original CAD model <b>26</b> and to compensate such deviations. The system <b>10</b> can therefore generate an adjusted CAD model <b>32</b>, which can subsequently be used to manufacture components which will comply with dimensional engineering requirements, following the post-processing procedures.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the course of the present application, the expression &#xab;post-processing procedures&#xbb; is used to refer to all conventional or special surface finishing processes which impact on the external or internal surfaces of the component (i.e. add or subtract material from the surface) and result in the surfaces of the component meeting the surface finish engineering requirements. One skilled in the art will understand that the post-processing procedures can be a chemical procedure and/or a mechanical procedure or can combine both a chemical procedure and a mechanical procedure. For example, and without being limitative post-processing procedures can include cutting, drilling, machining, abrasive flow machining, electrochemical polishing, automatic lapping, tumble finishing, etc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In view of the above, one skilled in the art will understand that, in most cases, the geometrical deviations created by the post-processing procedures correspond to material loss caused by the required removal of material to meet the surface finish requirements and therefore require compensation by addition of material to the features of the component defined in the original CAD model <b>26</b>. One skilled in the art will however understand that, in alternative embodiments, the deviation could also be the result of addition of material, which could, for instance, occur as a result of a coating being applied to selected features or to a section of the component. In such embodiments. Compensation are performed by subtraction of material from the features of the component defined in the original CAD model <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As will be described in more details below, in an embodiment, the system <b>10</b> for assisting the design of manufactured components requiring post-processing uses the engineering requirements for the component to be manufactured as well as other parameters regarding the manufacture of the component as inputs in order to predict the deviations which will occur during the post-processing process. In an embodiment the system <b>10</b> can also use the engineering requirements for the component to be manufactured as well as the other parameters regarding the manufacture of the component, to predict the deviations which will occur during the manufacturing thereof. For example and without being limitative, in an embodiment, the parameters used can include data regarding the initial design dimensions of the component, the manufacturing process, the material of the component, the geometry of the component and the post-processing process being applied to the component following the manufacture thereof. Considering the input parameters, the system <b>10</b> can generate dimension compensations for the different features of the component (i.e. generate specific compensations for different segments (or portions) of the component). These compensation values can therefore be added or subtracted from the original CAD model <b>26</b> of the component for each feature, therefore generating an adjusted CAD model <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In view of the above, it will be understood that, using the present system <b>10</b>, once the adjusted CAD model <b>32</b> has been generated, the component can be manufactured according to the adjusted CAD model <b>32</b> and be post-processed to meet the surface finish requirements. The manufactured and post-processed components based on the adjusted CAD model <b>32</b> can therefore meet both the dimensional and surface finish requirements specified in the engineering requirements of the original design data <b>22</b> for the component (i.e. be post-processed without falling out of spec due to the deviations generated during the post-processing procedures).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As will be described in more details below, in an embodiment, the system <b>10</b> can use machine learning in order to predict accurate compensation values for the component, based on the original design data <b>22</b>. In such an embodiment, the system <b>10</b> therefore encompasses artificial intelligence algorithms generating deviation prediction models stored in a memory of a computing device, using a training dataset <b>58</b><i>a</i>. In an embodiment, the training dataset <b>58</b><i>a </i>can be updated, using data obtained from manufactured and post-processes components over time. Hence, in such an embodiment, the Artificial Intelligence capability of the system <b>10</b> will cooperate with the other modules of the system <b>10</b>, to allow the system <b>10</b> to become more precise and versatile over time.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an embodiment, the training dataset <b>58</b><i>a </i>comprises measurement data relative to geometric deviations caused by different post-processing procedures and for different component features, component geometries and component materials. In an embodiment, the training dataset <b>58</b><i>a </i>can be stored in a deviation data database <b>58</b>, with the data of the deviation data database <b>58</b> being repeatedly updated by the system <b>10</b>, based on data acquired or generated therefrom.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Therefore, in an embodiment the training dataset <b>58</b><i>a </i>includes data gathered following instances of post-processing procedures of components and identifying the variation in the measurement of the different features of the components caused by the specific post-processing procedure, for the specific component material and component features of each instance and stored in the deviation data database <b>58</b>. In other words, the data included in the training dataset <b>58</b><i>a </i>can be generated by experimentation using an array of post-processing and finishing procedures, finishing materials, component materials, and component geometries and features generated through operation of the system <b>10</b>, as will be described in more details below. Each component used in the experimentations can be designed using specific engineering requirements and defined by an original CAD model <b>26</b>. The components can subsequently be manufactured, post-processed and precisely measured, to assess the geometrical deviations (e.g. the material loss) for each one of the different component features, in the associated post-processing procedure, with the data generated being stored in the deviation data database <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an embodiment of the system <b>10</b> for assisting the design of manufactured components requiring post-processing is shown.
