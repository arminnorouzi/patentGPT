An electrical controlling of the drive assembly is here carried out by an electronic control device of the brake system. In the case of electrical controlling of the drive assembly, the thus actuated pressure-producing unit conveys a pressure medium inside a brake circuit from a supply container of the brake system to connected wheel brakes. A brake pressure thereupon builds up in the wheel brakes in a manner proportional to the conveyed volume of pressure medium.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the aid of additional control devices that are controllable by the electronic control device, this brake pressure can be adapted in wheel-individual fashion to the slip conditions prevailing currently at each of the associated wheels of the vehicle. In this way, wheel slippage can be prevented, consequently improving the driving stability of a vehicle. In addition, braking processes can be carried out independently by the driver as a function of the traffic situation at that moment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In these control and/or regulation processes, the volume of pressure medium displaced by the pressure-producing unit is a decisive characteristic variable that can be determined from the actuation signals of the pressure-producing unit. For this purpose, sensor devices acquire the angle of rotation of the rotor of the drive assembly, and forward the measured rotational angle signal to the electronic control device for evaluation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such sensor devices are made up of a signal transmitter that rotates with the motor shaft and an associated signal receiver that in contrast is situated in stationary fashion.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An electrically controllable drive assembly is described, for example, in German Patent Application No. DE 10 2017 218 648 A1. Such a drive assembly <b>10</b> is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> herein. This drive assembly <b>10</b> includes an electric motor <b>12</b> having a rotor <b>14</b> that can be driven to execute a rotational movement, as well as a motor shaft <b>16</b> connected in rotationally fixed fashion to rotor <b>14</b>. Rotor <b>14</b> has a conventional design and has an iron core, as well as a plurality of coils wound thereon and situated next to one another in the circumferential direction of the iron core. In a known manner, when current flows through the coils, the coils form magnets that interact with magnets situated in stationary fashion on an oppositely situated inner surface of a housing <b>18</b> of drive assembly <b>10</b>, in such a way that rotor <b>14</b> and motor shaft <b>16</b> execute a rotational movement. For this purpose, as an example motor shaft <b>16</b> is rotatably mounted in housing <b>18</b> by roller bearings <b>20</b>. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as an example a plurality of eccentric elements <b>22</b> are situated on motor shaft <b>16</b> in order to actuate devices (not shown) that are situated transverse to motor shaft <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Detail X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a signal transmitter <b>24</b> of a sensor device for the electronic acquisition and evaluation of the angle of rotation of rotor <b>14</b>. This signal transmitter <b>24</b> is situated on the end face of motor shaft <b>16</b> facing away from rotor <b>14</b>. It has a magnetic element <b>26</b> that is indirectly fastened to motor shaft <b>16</b> via a holding element <b>28</b>. Holding element <b>28</b> is fashioned in the shape of a cup and is made of a magnetically non-conductive material. From a base of holding element <b>28</b> there protrudes a projection <b>30</b> with which holding element <b>28</b> is pressed into an associated center bore <b>32</b> of motor shaft <b>16</b>, and is glued therein. On the opposite side of holding element <b>28</b> there is a blind hole-type recess <b>34</b> that is outwardly open in which magnetic element <b>26</b> is placed with a positive fit and so as to terminate flush outwardly. A fixing of magnetic element <b>26</b> in this recess <b>34</b> of holding element <b>28</b> is also accomplished by a glued connection.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Under operating conditions of this drive assembly, rotor <b>14</b> is often strongly accelerated or decelerated. The dynamic, axial, and radial forces that then occur place loads on the described glued connections and can have the result that magnetic element <b>26</b> of signal transmitter <b>24</b> carries out undesired movements, in particular axial ones, relative to motor shaft <b>16</b>. These relative movements result in inaccuracies in the acquisition of the traveled angle of rotation of motor shaft <b>16</b>, and consequently may cause errors in the electrical controlling of electric motor <b>12</b> of drive assembly <b>10</b>, or in the controlling of the displaced volume of pressure medium. The latter has an undesirable influence on the brake pressure regulation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An electrically controllable drive assembly in accordance with the present invention, in contrast, may have the advantage that the fastening of the signal transmitter to the motor shaft is done without glued connections. This eliminates elasticities, and the acquisition of the angle of rotation signal takes place with greater accuracy. Increased accuracy brings an improvement in the electrical controllability of the drive assembly, and consequently a reduction in possible deviations between an actually conveyed volume of pressure medium and a desired target value. Apart from this, the omission of the glued connections simplifies the manufacturing process of the drive assembly in large-series production, and saves manufacturing time and costs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, these advantages are achieved by a holding element that is realized as a hollow cylinder in the interior of which the magnetic element of a signal transmitter is accommodated. The hollow cylinder has an open first end with which the holding element, including the magnetic element placed therein, is fastened to the motor shaft, as well as a second end, situated opposite thereto, having holding element segments that extend into the open cross-section of the hollow cylinder. The magnetic element of the signal transmitter abuts these holding element segments, and is thereby secured against falling out from the holding element.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The holding element according to an example embodiment of the present invention can be produced at low cost using a deep-drawing method, and holds the magnetic element of the signal transmitter in extremely rigid fashion. As a result, over its life span, and regardless of the loading that occurs, this magnetic element assumes a constant position relative to the associated signal receiver during operation of the drive assembly.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further advantages and advantageous developments of the present invention result from the disclosure herein.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Advantageously, on its end facing the holding element the motor shaft has a segment that is recessed in its outer diameter relative to the outer diameter of the motor shaft. The hollow cylindrical holding element is fastened to this segment with its open first end. The holding element can easily be pushed onto this segment of the motor shaft, and is then at the same time centered relative to the longitudinal axis of the motor shaft. Subsequently, it is materially bonded to the motor shaft by a first weld connection. A transition from the segment to the circumference of the motor shaft forms a shoulder that acts as an axial stop for the holding element when it is assembled onto the motor shaft. The coaxial configuration of the holding element, or of the signal transmitter, relative to the longitudinal axis of the motor shaft, as well as the length tolerance of the motor shaft-holding element unit, can be kept within relatively narrow limits due to the described constructive features of the components.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the magnetic element of the signal transmitter is held stationary by a clip element inside the holding element. For its part, the clip element is connected with a material bond to the holding element by a second weld connection. The weld connection increases the resistance to deformation of the unit made up of the holding element, signal transmitter, and motor shaft, and in addition the clip element, together with the second weld connection itself, ensures the fixing of the magnetic element in the holding element even when there are changes in temperature. In addition, the clip element makes it possible to set a constant air gap between an end face of the motor shaft and the magnetic element. The air gap deflects the magnetic flux in the direction of the signal receiver, which benefits the signal strength, or promotes the acquisition of the signal. The clip element can be produced at low cost, for example without the use of machining.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in the figures, and is explained in detail in the following description.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a drive assembly of the related art.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows detail X of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in an example embodiment according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the signal transmitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> without the magnetic element placed therein, in a perspective view.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows detail X of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in an embodiment according to the present invention.

According to the present invention, holding element <b>28</b> is realized as a hollow cylinder, in the interior of which magnetic element <b>26</b> is accommodated and is fixedly anchored by a clip element <b>36</b>. The hollow cylinder has an open first end with which it is pushed onto a segment <b>38</b> that is recessed relative to an outer diameter of motor shaft <b>16</b>. A transition from the circumference of motor shaft <b>16</b> to the circumference of segment <b>38</b> is shown, as an example, as a right-angled shoulder <b>40</b>. Holding element <b>28</b> abuts this shoulder <b>40</b> with a circumferential, radially protruding collar <b>42</b> that is fashioned on the open end of this holding element <b>28</b>.
