THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Disclosed herein is a method treating cancer using a combination of antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof that bind to human OX40 and human TIGIT.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">OX40 (also known as ACT35, CD134, or TNFRSF4) is an approximately 50 KD type I transmembrane glycoprotein, and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor super family (TNFRSF) (Croft, 2010; Gough and Weinberg, 2009). Mature human OX40 is composed of 249 amino acid (AA) residues, with a 37 AA cytoplasmic tail and a 185 AA extracellular region. The extracellular domain of OX40 contains three complete and one incomplete cysteine-rich domains (CRDs). The intracellular domain of OX40 contains one conserved signaling-related QEE motif, which mediates binding to several TNFR-associated factors (TRAF) including TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAFS, allowing OX40 to link to intracellular kinases (Arch and Thompson, 1998; Willoughby et al., 2017).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">OX40 was initially discovered on activated rat CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and murine and human homologs were subsequently cloned from T cells (al-Shamkhani et al., 1996; Calderhead et al., 1993). In addition to expression on activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, including T helper (Th) 1 cells, Th2 cells, Th17 cells, as well as regulatory T (Treg) cells, OX40 expression has also been found on the surface of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, natural killer (NK) T cells, neutrophils, and NK cells (Croft, 2010). In contrast, low OX40 expression is found on na&#xef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as well as on most resting memory T cells (Croft, 2010; Soroosh et al., 2007). The surface expression of OX40 on na&#xef;ve T cells is transient. After TCR activation, OX40 expression on T cells is greatly increased within 24 hours and with peaks in 2-3 days, persisting for 5-6 days (Gramaglia et al., 1998).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The ligand for OX40 (OX40L, also known as gp34, CD252 or TNFSF4) is the sole ligand for OX40. Similar to other TNFSF (tumor necrosis factor superfamily) members, OX40L is a type II glycoprotein, which contains 183 AA with a 23 AA intracellular domain and a 133 AA extracellular domain (Croft, 2010; Gough and Weinberg, 2009). OX40L naturally forms a homomeric trimer complex on the cell surface. The ligand trimer interacts with three copies of OX40 at the ligand monomer-monomer interface mostly through CRD1, CRD2, and partial CRD3 regions of the receptor but without the involvement of CRD4 (Compaan and Hymowitz, 2006). OX40L is primarily expressed on activated antigen presenting cells (APC), including activated B cells (Stuber et al., 1995), mature conventional dendritic cells (DCs) (Ohshima et al., 1997), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) (Ito et al., 2004), macrophages (Weinberg et al., 1999), and Langerhans cells (Sato et al., 2002). In addition, OX40L has been found to be expressed on other cells types, such as NK cells, mast cells, subsets of activated T cells, as well as vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (Croft, 2010; Croft et al., 2009).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">OX40 trimerization via ligation by trimeric OX40L or dimerization by agonistic antibodies contribute to the recruitment and docking of adaptor molecules TRAF2, TRAF3, and/or TRAFS to its intracellular QEE motif (Arch and Thompson, 1998; Willoughby et al., 2017). The recruitment and docking of TRAF2 and TRAF3 can further lead to activation of both the canonical NF-&#x3ba;B1 and non-canonical NF-&#x3ba;B2 pathways, which play key roles in regulation of the survival, differentiation, expansion, cytokine production and effector functions of T cells (Croft, 2010; Gramaglia et al., 1998; Huddleston et al., 2006; Rogers et al., 2001; Ruby and Weinberg, 2009; Song et al., 2005a; Song et al., 2005b; Song et al., 2008).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In normal tissues, OX40 expression is low and is mainly on lymphocytes in lymphoid organs (Durkop et al., 1995). However, upregulation of OX40 expression on immune cells have frequently been observed in both animal models and human patients with pathological conditions (Redmond and Weinberg, 2007), such as autoimmune diseases (Carboni et al., 2003; Jacquemin et al., 2015; Szypowska et al., 2014) and cancers (Kjaergaard et al., 2000; Vetto et al., 1997; Weinberg et al., 2000). Notably, the increased expression of OX40 is associated with longer survival in patients with colorectal cancer and cutaneous melanoma, and inversely correlates with the occurrence of distant metastases and more advanced tumor features (Ladanyi et al., 2004; Petty et al., 2002; Sarff et al., 2008). It has also been shown that anti-OX40 antibody treatment could elicit anti-tumor efficacy in various mouse models (Aspeslagh et al., 2016), indicating the potential of OX40 as an immunotherapeutic target. In the first clinical trial in cancer patients, conducted by Curti et al., evidence of anti-tumor efficacy and activation of tumor-specific T cells was observed with an agonistic anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody, indicating that OX40 antibodies have utility in boosting anti-tumor T-cell responses (Curti et al., 2013).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The mechanism of action of agonistic anti-OX40 antibodies in mediating anti-tumor efficacy have been studied primarily in mouse tumor models (Weinberg et al., 2000). Until recently, the mechanism of action of agonistic anti-OX40 antibodies in tumors was attributed to their ability to trigger a co-stimulatory signaling pathway in effector T cells, as well as the inhibitory effects on the differentiation and functions of Treg cells (Aspeslagh et al., 2016; Ito et al., 2006; St Rose et al., 2013; Voo et al., 2013). Recent studies have shown that in both animal tumor models and cancer patients, tumor infiltrating Tregs express higher levels of OX40 than effector T cells (both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>) and peripheral Tregs (Lai et al., 2016; Marabelle et al., 2013b; Montler et al., 2016; Soroosh et al., 2007; Timperi et al., 2016). Therefore, the secondary effects by which anti-OX40 antibodies trigger anti-tumor responses rely on their Fc-mediated effector functions in depleting intra-tumoral OX40<sup>+</sup> Treg cells via antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) (Aspeslagh et al., 2016; Bulliard et al., 2014; Marabelle et al., 2013a; Marabelle et al., 2013b; Smyth et al., 2014). This work demonstrates that agonistic anti-OX40 antibodies with Fc-mediated effector function could preferentially deplete intra-tumoral Tregs and improve the ratios of CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells to Tregs in the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in improved anti-tumor immune responses, increased tumor regression and improved survival (Bulliard et al., 2014; Carboni et al., 2003; Jacquemin et al., 2015; Marabelle et al., 2013b). Based on these findings, there is an unmet medical need to develop agonistic anti-OX40 antibodies with both agonistic activities and Fc-mediated effector functions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To date the agonistic anti-OX40 antibodies in the clinic are mostly ligand-competitive antibodies which block the OX40-OX40L interaction (e.g. WO2016196228A1). Since OX40-OX40L interaction is essential for enhancing effective anti-tumor immunity, blockade of OX40-OX40L restricts the efficacy of these ligand-competitive antibodies. Therefore, OX40 agonist antibodies that specifically bind to OX40 while not interfering with OX40 interacting with OX40L have utility in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disorders via both monotherapy and combination therapy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Up-regulation of TIGIT expression in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has been reported in many types of cancers such as lung (Tassi, et al., Cancer Res. 2017 77: 851-861), esophageal (Xie J, et al., Oncotarget 2016 7: 63669-63678), breast (Gil Del Alcazar C R, et al. 2017 Cancer Discov.), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Kong Y et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2016 22: 3057-66) and melanoma (Chauvin J M, et al., J Clin Invest. 2015 125: 2046-2058). The increased expression of TIGIT in AML is associated with poor prognosis for the patient (Kong Y et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2016 22: 3057-66). Not only does up-regulation of TIGIT signaling play important roles in immune tolerance to cancer, but also to chronic viral infection. During HIV infection, expression of TIGIT on T cells was significantly higher and positively correlated with viral loads and disease progression (Chew G M, et al., 2016 PLoS Pathog. 12: e1005349). In addition, blockade of TIGIT receptor alone or in combination with other blockade could rescue functionally &#x201c;exhausted&#x201d; T cells both in vitro and in vivo (Chauvin J M, et al., J Clin Invest. 2015 125: 2046-2058; Chew G M, et al., 2016 PLoS Pathog. 12: e1005349; Johnston R J, et al. Cancer Cell 2014 26: 923-937). In the cases of cancer and viral infections, activation of TIGIT signaling promotes immune cell dysfunction, leading to the cancer outgrowth or extended viral infection. Inhibition of TIGIT-mediated inhibitory signaling by therapeutic agents may restore the functional activities of immune cells including T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells (DCs), therefore enhancing immunity against cancer or chronic viral infection.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure is directed a combination of agonistic anti-OX40 antibodies and anti-TIGIT antibodies and methods of using the combination of these antibodies in the treatment of cancer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the disclosure provides for anti-OX40 antibodies in combination with anti-TIGIT antibodies.

Treatment of a cell encompasses contact of a reagent to the cell, as well as contact of a reagent to a fluid, where the fluid is in contact with the cell. The term &#x201c;administration&#x201d; and &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; also means in vitro and ex vivo treatments, e.g., of a cell, by a reagent, diagnostic, binding compound, or by another cell. The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; herein includes any organism, preferably an animal, more preferably a mammal (e.g., rat, mouse, dog, cat, rabbit) and most preferably a human. Treating any disease or disorder refer in one aspect, to ameliorating the disease or disorder (i.e., slowing or arresting or reducing the development of the disease or at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof).

Within the antigen, the variable region of the antibody &#x201c;arm&#x201d; interacts through non-covalent forces with the antigen at numerous sites; the more interactions, the stronger the affinity.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0098">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; as used herein refers to a polypeptide of the immunoglobulin family that can bind a corresponding antigen non-covalently, reversibly, and in a specific manner. For example, a naturally occurring IgG antibody is a tetramer comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs arranged from amino-terminus to carboxyl-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies can mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0099">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; includes, but is not limited to, monoclonal antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies. The antibodies can be of any isotype/class (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), or subclass (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0100">In some embodiments, the anti-OX40 antibodies comprise at least one antigen-binding site, or at least a variable region. In some embodiments, the anti-OX40 antibodies comprise an antigen-binding fragment from an OX40 antibody described herein. In some embodiments, the anti-OX40 antibody is isolated or recombinant.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0101">The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; or &#x201c;mAb&#x201d; or &#x201c;Mab&#x201d; herein means a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the antibody molecules comprised in the population are identical in amino acid sequence except for possible naturally occurring mutations that can be present in minor amounts. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of different antibodies having different amino acid sequences in their variable domains, particularly their complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which are often specific for different epitopes. The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art. See, for example Kohler et al., Nature 1975 256:495-497; U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110; Ausubel et al., CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY 1992; Harlow et al., ANTIBODIES: A LABORATORY MANUAL, Cold spring Harbor Laboratory 1988; and Colligan et al., CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN IMMUNOLOGY 1993. The antibodies disclosed herein can be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG, IgM, IgD, IgE, IgA, and any subclass thereof such as IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4. A hybridoma producing a monoclonal antibody can be cultivated in vitro or in vivo. High titers of monoclonal antibodies can be obtained in in vivo production where cells from the individual hybridomas are injected intraperitoneally into mice, such as pristine-primed Balb/c mice to produce ascites fluid containing high concentrations of the desired antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies of isotype IgM or IgG can be purified from such ascites fluids, or from culture supernatants, using column chromatography methods well known to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0102">In general, the basic antibody structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer includes two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one &#x201c;light chain&#x201d; (about 25 kDa) and one &#x201c;heavy chain&#x201d; (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of the heavy chain can define a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Typically, human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Furthermore, human heavy chains are typically classified as &#x3b1;, &#x3b4;, &#x3b5;, &#x3b3;, or &#x3bc;, and define the antibody's isotypes as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a &#x201c;J&#x201d; region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a &#x201c;D&#x201d; region of about 10 more amino acids.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0103">The variable regions of each light/heavy chain (VL/VH) pair form the antibody binding site. Thus, in general, an intact antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are, in general, the same.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0104">Typically, the variable domains of both the heavy and light chains comprise three hypervariable regions, also called &#x201c;complementarity determining regions (CDRs),&#x201d; which are located between relatively conserved framework regions (FR). The CDRs are usually aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. In general, from N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chain variable domains comprise FR-1 (or FR1), CDR-1 (or CDR1), FR-2 (FR2), CDR-2 (CDR2), FR-3 (or FR3), CDR-3 (CDR3), and FR-4 (or FR4). The positions of the CDRs and framework regions can be determined using various well known definitions in the art, e.g., Kabat, Chothia, and AbM (see, e.g., Johnson et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 29:205-206 (2001); Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et al., Nature, 342:877-883 (1989); Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227:799-817 (1992); Al-Lazikani et al., J. Mol. Biol., 273:927-748 (1997)). Definitions of antigen combining sites are also described in the following: Ruiz et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 28:219-221 (2000); and Lefranc, M.

(ed.), Protein Structure Prediction, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 141-172 (1996). In a combined Kabat and Chothia numbering scheme, in some embodiments, the CDRs correspond to the amino acid residues that are part of a Kabat CDR, a Chothia CDR, or both. For example, the CDRs correspond to amino acid residues 26-35 (HC CDR1), 50-65 (HC CDR2), and 95-102 (HC CDR3) in a VH, e.g., a mammalian VH, e.g., a human VH; and amino acid residues 24-34 (LC CDR1), 50-56 (LC CDR2), and 89-97 (LC CDR3) in a VL, e.g., a mammalian VL, e.g., a human VL.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0105">The term &#x201c;hypervariable region&#x201d; means the amino acid residues of an antibody that are responsible for antigen-binding.

Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, 1977; and Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, 1990, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold. These initial neighborhood word hits act as values for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always &#x3e;0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always &#x3c;0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a word length (W) of 11, an expectation (E) or 10, M=5, N=&#x2212;4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLAST program uses as defaults a word length of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff, (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 10915) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=&#x2212;4, and a comparison of both strands.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0118">The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin and Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787, 1993). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0119">The percent identity between two amino acid sequences can also be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller, Comput. Appl. Biosci. 4: 11-17, (1988), which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. In addition, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined using the Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:444-453, (1970), algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package using either a BLOSUM62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0120">The term &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; is used herein interchangeably with the term &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d; and refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides.

For example, a promoter or enhancer sequence is operably linked to a coding sequence if it stimulates or modulates the transcription of the coding sequence in an appropriate host cell or other expression system. Generally, promoter transcriptional regulatory sequences that are operably linked to a transcribed sequence are physically contiguous to the transcribed sequence, i.e., they are cis-acting. However, some transcriptional regulatory sequences, such as enhancers, need not be physically contiguous or located in close proximity to the coding sequences whose transcription they enhance.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0122">In some aspects, the present disclosure provides compositions, e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable compositions, which include an anti-OX40 antibody described herein, formulated together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.

Nos. 5,624,821 and 5,648,260, both by Winter et al.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0138">In another aspect, one or more amino acid residues can be replaced with one or more different amino acid residues such that the antibody has altered Clq binding and/or reduced or abolished complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). This approach is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551 by Idusogie et al.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0139">In yet another aspect, one or more amino acid residues are altered to thereby alter the ability of the antibody to fix complement. This approach is described in, e.g., the PCT Publication WO 94/29351 by Bodmer et al. In a specific aspect, one or more amino acids of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present disclosure are replaced by one or more allotypic amino acid residues, for the IgG1 subclass and the kappa isotype. Allotypic amino acid residues also include, but are not limited to, the constant region of the heavy chain of the IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 subclasses as well as the constant region of the light chain of the kappa isotype as described by Jefferis et al., MAbs. 1:332-338 (2009).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0140">In another aspect, the Fc region is modified to increase the ability of the antibody to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or to increase the affinity of the antibody for an Fey receptor by modifying one or more amino acids. This approach is described in, e.g., the PCT Publication WO 00/42072 by Presta. Moreover, the binding sites on human IgG1 for Fc&#x3b3;RI, Fc&#x3b3;RII, Fc&#x3b3;RIII and FcRn have been mapped and variants with improved binding have been described (see Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591-6604, 2001).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0141">In still another aspect, the glycosylation of an antibody is modified. For example, an aglycosylated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks or has reduced glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for &#x201c;antigen.&#x201d; Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation can increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861 by Co et al.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0142">Additionally, or alternatively, an antibody can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNac structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. For example, EP 1,176,195 by Hang et al. describes a cell line with a functionally disrupted FUT8 gene, which encodes a fucosyl transferase, such that antibodies expressed in such a cell line exhibit hypofucosylation. PCT Publication WO 03/035835 by Presta describes a variant CHO cell line, Lec13 cells, with reduced ability to attach fucose to Asn (297)-linked carbohydrates, also resulting in hypofucosylation of antibodies expressed in that host cell (see also Shields et al., (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740). PCT Publication WO 99/54342 by Umana et al., describes cell lines engineered to express glycoprotein-modifying glycosyl transferases (e.g., beta(1,4)-N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII)) such that antibodies expressed in the engineered cell lines exhibit increased bisecting GlcNac structures which results in increased ADCC activity of the antibodies (see also Umana et al., Nat. Biotech. 17:176-180, 1999).</p><p id="p-0126" num="0143">In another aspect, if a reduction of ADCC is desired, human antibody subclass IgG4 was shown in many previous reports to have only modest ADCC and almost no CDC effector function (Moore G L, et al. 2010 MAbs, 2:181-189). On the other hand, natural IgG4 was found less stable in stress conditions such as in acidic buffer or under increasing temperature (Angal, S. 1993 Mol Immunol, 30:105-108; Dall'Acqua, W. et al, 1998 Biochemistry, 37:9266-9273; Aalberse et al. 2002 Immunol, 105:9-19). Reduced ADCC can be achieved by operably linking the antibody to IgG4 engineered with combinations of alterations to have reduced or null Fc&#x3b3;R binding or Clq binding activities, thereby reducing or eliminating ADCC and CDC effector functions. Considering physicochemical properties of antibody as a biological drug, one of the less desirable, intrinsic properties of IgG4 is dynamic separation of its two heavy chains in solution to form half antibody, which lead to bi-specific antibodies generated in vivo via a process called &#x201c;Fab arm exchange&#x201d; (Van der Neut Kolfschoten M, et al. 2007 Science, 317:1554-157). The mutation of serine to proline at position 228 (EU numbering system) appeared inhibitory to the IgG4 heavy chain separation (Angal, S. 1993 Mol Immunol, 30:105-108; Aalberse et al. 2002 Immunol, 105:9-19). Some of the amino acid residues in the hinge and &#x3b3;Fc region were reported to have impact on antibody interaction with Fc&#x3b3; receptors (Chappel S M, et al. 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88:9036-9040; Mukherjee, J. et al., 1995 FASEB J, 9:115-119; Armour, K. L. et al. 1999 Eur J Immunol, 29:2613-2624; Clynes, R. A. et al, 2000 Nature Medicine, 6:443-446; Arnold J. N., 2007 Annu Rev immunol, 25:21-50). Furthermore, some rarely occurring IgG4 isoforms in human population can also elicit different physicochemical properties (Brusco, A. et al. 1998 Eur J Immunogenet, 25:349-55; Aalberse et al. 2002 Immunol, 105:9-19). To generate OX40 antibodies with low ADCC, CDC and instability, it is possible to modify the hinge and Fc region of human IgG4 and introduce a number of alterations. These modified IgG4 Fc molecules can be found in SEQ ID NOs: 83-88, U.S. Pat. No. 8,735,553 to Li et al.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">OX40 Antibody Production</heading><p id="p-0127" num="0144">Anti-OX40 antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof can be produced by any means known in the art, including but not limited to, recombinant expression, chemical synthesis, and enzymatic digestion of antibody tetramers, whereas full-length monoclonal antibodies can be obtained by, e.g., hybridoma or recombinant production. Recombinant expression can be from any appropriate host cells known in the art, for example, mammalian host cells, bacterial host cells, yeast host cells, insect host cells, etc.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0145">The disclosure further provides polynucleotides encoding the antibodies described herein, e.g., polynucleotides encoding heavy or light chain variable regions or segments comprising the complementarity determining regions as described herein. In some aspects, the polynucleotide encoding the heavy chain variable regions has at least 85%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% nucleic acid sequence identity with a polynucleotide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 15, 21 or 27. In some aspects, the polynucleotide encoding the light chain variable regions has at least 85%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% nucleic acid sequence identity with a polynucleotide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:17, 23, or 29.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0146">The polynucleotides of the present disclosure can encode the variable region sequence of an anti-OX40 antibody. They can also encode both a variable region and a constant region of the antibody. Some of the polynucleotide sequences encode a polypeptide that comprises variable regions of both the heavy chain and the light chain of one of the exemplified anti-OX40 antibodies. Some other polynucleotides encode two polypeptide segments that respectively are substantially identical to the variable regions of the heavy chain and the light chain of one of the murine antibodies.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0147">Also provided in the present disclosure are expression vectors and host cells for producing the anti-OX40 antibodies. The choice of expression vector depends on the intended host cells in which the vector is to be expressed. Typically, the expression vectors contain a promoter and other regulatory sequences (e.g., enhancers) that are operably linked to the polynucleotides encoding an anti-OX40 antibody chain or antigen-binding fragment. In some aspects, an inducible promoter is employed to prevent expression of inserted sequences except under the control of inducing conditions. Inducible promoters include, e.g., arabinose, lacZ, metallothionein promoter or a heat shock promoter. Cultures of transformed organisms can be expanded under non-inducing conditions without biasing the population for coding sequences whose expression products are better tolerated by the host cells. In addition to promoters, other regulatory elements can also be required or desired for efficient expression of an anti-OX40 antibody or antigen-binding fragment. These elements typically include an ATG initiation codon and adjacent ribosome binding site or other sequences. In addition, the efficiency of expression can be enhanced by the inclusion of enhancers appropriate to the cell system in use (see, e.g., Scharf et al., Results Probl. Cell Differ. 20:125, 1994; and Bittner et al., Meth. Enzymol., 153:516, 1987). For example, the SV40 enhancer or CMV enhancer can be used to increase expression in mammalian host cells.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0148">The host cells for harboring and expressing the anti-OX40 antibody chains can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. <i>E. coli </i>is one prokaryotic host useful for cloning and expressing the polynucleotides of the present disclosure. Other microbial hosts suitable for use include bacilli, such as <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, and other enterobacteriaceae, such as <i>Salmonella, Serratia</i>, and various <i>Pseudomonas </i>species. In these prokaryotic hosts, one can also make expression vectors, which typically contain expression control sequences compatible with the host cell (e.g., an origin of replication). In addition, any number of a variety of well-known promoters will be present, such as the lactose promoter system, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, a beta-lactamase promoter system, or a promoter system from phage lambda. The promoters typically control expression, optionally with an operator sequence, and have ribosome binding site sequences and the like, for initiating and completing transcription and translation. Other microbes, such as yeast, can also be employed to express anti-OX40 polypeptides. Insect cells in combination with baculovirus vectors can also be used.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0149">In other aspects, mammalian host cells are used to express and produce the anti-OX40 polypeptides of the present disclosure. For example, they can be either a hybridoma cell line expressing endogenous immunoglobulin genes or a mammalian cell line harboring an exogenous expression vector. These include any normal mortal or normal or abnormal immortal animal or human cell. For example, a number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting intact immunoglobulins have been developed, including the CHO cell lines, various COS cell lines, HEK 293 cells, myeloma cell lines, transformed B-cells and hybridomas. The use of mammalian tissue cell culture to express polypeptides is discussed generally in, e.g., Winnacker, From Genes to Clones, VCH Publishers, NY, N.Y., 1987. Expression vectors for mammalian host cells can include expression control sequences, such as an origin of replication, a promoter, and an enhancer (see, e.g., Queen et al., Immunol. Rev. 89:49-68, 1986), and necessary processing information sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional terminator sequences. These expression vectors usually contain promoters derived from mammalian genes or from mammalian viruses.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0150">Suitable promoters can be constitutive, cell type-specific, stage-specific, and/or modulatable or regulatable. Useful promoters include, but are not limited to, the metallothionein promoter, the constitutive adenovirus major late promoter, the dexamethasone-inducible MMTV promoter, the SV40 promoter, the MRP polIII promoter, the constitutive MPSV promoter, the tetracycline-inducible CMV promoter (such as the human immediate-early CMV promoter), the constitutive CMV promoter, and promoter-enhancer combinations known in the art.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Methods of Detection and Diagnosis</heading><p id="p-0134" num="0151">The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments of the present disclosure are useful in a variety of applications including, but not limited to, methods for the detection of OX40.

The HRP-linked anti-mouse IgG antibody (Cat: 115035-008, Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc, Peroxidase AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG, Fc&#x3b3; fragment specific) and substrate (Cat: 00-4201-56, eBioscience, USA) were used to develop the color absorbance signal at the wavelength of 450 nm, which was measured by using a plate reader (SpectraMax Paradigm, Molecular Devices/PHERAstar, BMG LABTECH). Positive parental clones were picked up from fusion screening with indirect ELISA. The ELISA-positive clones were further verified by FACS using HuT78/OX40 and HuT78/cynoOX40 cells described above. OX40-expressing cells (10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well) were incubated with ELISA-positive hybridoma supernatants, followed by binding with Anti-Mouse IgG eFluor&#xae; 660 antibodies (Cat: 50-4010-82, eBioscience, USA).

Murine antibodies in the supernatants were applied and bound to a Protein A column (Cat: 17-5438-02, GE Life Sciences) following the manufacturer's guide. The procedure usually yielded antibodies at purity above 90%. The Protein A-affinity purified antibodies were either dialyzed against PBS or if necessary, further purified using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Cat: 28-9893-35, GE Life Sciences) to remove aggregates. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm.

The human IGHV and IGKV genes that are present in human antibody repertoires with high frequencies (Glanville et al., 2009 PNAS 106:20216-20221) and highly homologous to Mu445 were selected as the templates for humanization.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0179">Humanization was carried out by CDR-grafting (Methods in Molecular Biology, Antibody Engineering, Methods and Protocols, Vol 248: Humana Press) and the humanized antibodies were engineered as human IgG1 wild type format by using an in-house developed expression vector. In the initial round of humanization, mutations from murine to human amino acid residues in framework regions were guided by the simulated 3D structure analysis, and the murine framework residues with structural importance for maintaining the canonical structures of CDRs were retained in the first version of the humanized antibody 445 (see 445-1, Table 3). The six CDRs of 445-1 have amino acid sequences of HCDR1 (SEQ ID NO: 3), HCDR2 (SEQ ID NO:13), HCDR3 (SEQ ID NO:5) and LCDR1 (SEQ ID NO: 6), LCDR2 (SEQ ID NO:7), and LCDR3 (SEQ ID NO:8). The heavy chain variable region of 445-1 has an amino acid sequence of (VH) SEQ ID NO: 14 that is encoded by a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 15, and the light chain variable region has an amino acid sequence of (VL) SEQ ID NO: 16 that is encoded by a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 17. Specifically, LCDRs of Mu445 (SEQ ID NO: 6-8) were grafted into the framework of human germline variable gene IGVK1-39 with two murine framework residues (144 and Y71) retained (SEQ ID NO: 16). HCDR1 (SEQ ID NO: 3), HCDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 13) and HCDR3 (SEQ ID NO: 5) were grafted into the framework of human germline variable gene IGHV1-69 with two murine framework (L70 and S<sub>72</sub>) residues retained (SEQ ID NO: 14). In the 445 humanization variants (445-1), only the N-terminal half of Kabat HCDR2 was grafted, as only the N-terminal half was predicted to be important for antigen-binding according to the simulated 3D structure.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0180">445-1 was constructed as a humanized full-length antibody using in-house developed expression vectors that contain constant regions of a human wildtype IgG1 (IgG1 wt) and kappa chain, respectively, with easy adapting sub-cloning sites. 445-1 antibody was expressed by co-transfection of the above two constructs into 293G cells and purified using a protein A column (Cat: 17-5438-02, GE Life Sciences). The purified antibody was concentrated to 0.5-10 mg/mL in PBS and stored in aliquots in &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. freezer.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0181">Using the 445-1 antibody, several single amino acid changes were made, converting the retained murine residues in framework region of the VH and VL to corresponding human germline residues, such as I44P and Y71F in the VL and L701 and S72A in VH. In addition, several single amino acid changes were made in the CDRs to reduce potential isomerization risk and to increase the humanization level. For example, the alterations of T51A and D50E were made in LCDR2 and the alterations D56E, G57A and N61A were made in HCDR2. All humanization changes were made using primers containing mutations at specific positions and a site directed mutagenesis kit (Cat: AP231-11, TransGen, Beijing, China). The desired changes were verified by sequencing.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0182">The amino acid changes in the 445-1 antibody were evaluated for their binding to OX40 and thermal stability. Antibody 445-2 comprising HCDR1 of SEQ ID NO: 3, HCDR2 of SEQ ID NO: 18, HCDR3 of SEQ ID NO: 5, LCDR1 of SEQ ID NO: 6, LCDR2 of SEQ ID NO: 19 and LCDR3 of SEQ ID NO: 8) (see Table 3) was constructed from the combination of specific changes described above. In comparing the two antibodies the results showed that both antibodies 445-2 and 445-1 exhibited comparable binding affinity (see below in Table 4 and Table 5).</p><p id="p-0168" num="0183">Beginning with the 445-2 antibody, several additional amino acid changes in the framework region of the VL were made to further improve binding affinity/kinetics, for example, the alteration of amino acids G41D and K42G. In addition, several single-amino acid changes in the CDRs of both the VH and VL were made in order to lower immunogenicity risk and increase thermal stability, for example, S24R in LCDR1 and A61N in HCDR2. The resulting changes showed either improved binding activities or thermal stability as compared to 445-2.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0184">Humanized 445 antibodies were further engineered by introducing specific amino acid changes in CDRs and framework regions to improve molecular and biophysical properties for therapeutic use in humans. The considerations included removing deleterious post translational modifications, improved heat stability (T<sub>m</sub>), surface hydrophobicity and isoelectronic points (pIs) while maintaining binding activities.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0185">The humanized monoclonal antibody, 445-3, comprising HCDR1 of SEQ ID NO: 3, HCDR2 of SEQ ID NO: 24, HCDR 3 of SEQ ID NO: 5, LCDR1 of SEQ ID NO: 25, LCDR2 of SEQ ID NO:19, and LCDR3 of SEQ ID NO: 8 (see Table 3), was constructed from the maturation process described above, and characterized in detail. Antibody 445-3 was also made into an IgG2 version (445-3 IgG2) comprising the Fc domain of wild-type heavy chain of human IgG2, and an IgG4 version comprising the Fc domain of human IgG4 with S228P and R409K mutations (445-3 IgG4).

Antibodies by SPR</heading><p id="p-0172" num="0186">The anti-OX40 antibodies were characterized for their binding kinetics and affinity by SPR assays using BIAcore&#x2122; T-200 (GE Life Sciences). Briefly, anti-human IgG antibody was immobilized on an activated CM5 biosensor chip (Cat: BR100530, GE Life Sciences). An antibody with human IgG Fc region was flowed over the chip surface and captured by anti-human IgG antibody. Then a serial dilution of recombinant OX40 protein with a His tag (Cat: 10481-H08H, Sino Biological) was flowed over the chip surface and changes in surface plasmon resonance signals were analyzed to calculate the association rates (ka) and dissociation rates (kd) by using the one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIA Evaluation Software, GE Life Sciences). The equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) was calculated as the ratio kd/ka. The results of SPR-determined binding profiles of anti-OX40 antibodies are summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and Table 4. The binding profile with average K<sub>D </sub>of antibody 445-3 (9.47 nM) was slightly better than antibody 445-2 (13.5 nM) and 445-1 (17.1 nM), and similar to that of ch445. The binding profile of 445-3 IgG4 was similar to 445-3 (with IgG1 Fc), indicating that the change in Fc between IgG4 and IgG1 did not alter the specific binding of the 445-3 antibody.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00005" num="00005"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="273pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 4</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Binding affinities of anti-OX40 antibodies by SPR</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Test Parameters</entry><entry>ch445*</entry><entry>445-1</entry><entry>445-2</entry><entry>445-3</entry><entry>445-3 IgG4</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Test 1</entry><entry>ka (M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)</entry><entry>1.74 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup></entry><entry>1.56 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup></entry><entry>2.76 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup></entry><entry>1.82 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup></entry><entry>1.61 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry>kd (s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)</entry><entry>1.43 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup></entry><entry>2.77 &#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup></entry><entry>3.90 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup></entry><entry>1.67 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup></entry><entry>1.61 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry>K<sub>D </sub>(nM)</entry><entry>8.26</entry><entry>17.8</entry><entry>14.2</entry><entry>9.16</entry><entry>10.0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>K<sub>A </sub>(M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)</entry><entry>1.22 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry><entry>0.56 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry><entry>0.71 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry><entry>1.09 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry><entry>1.00 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry></row><row><entry>Test 2</entry><entry>ka (M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)</entry><entry>2.65 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup></entry><entry>2.37 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup></entry><entry>2.06 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup></entry><entry>1.63 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup></entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>kd (s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)</entry><entry>1.67 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup></entry><entry>3.89 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup></entry><entry>2.64 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup></entry><entry>1.59 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup></entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>K<sub>D </sub>(nM)</entry><entry>6.3</entry><entry>16.4</entry><entry>12.8</entry><entry>9.77</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>K<sub>A </sub>(M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)</entry><entry>1.59 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry><entry>0.61 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry><entry>0.78 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry><entry>1.03 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>Mean</entry><entry>K<sub>D </sub>(nM)</entry><entry>7.28</entry><entry>17.1</entry><entry>13.5</entry><entry>9.47</entry><entry>10.0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>K<sub>A </sub>(M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)</entry><entry>1.41 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry><entry>0.59 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry><entry>0.75 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry><entry>1.06 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry><entry>1.00 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup></entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="left" id="FOO-00001">*ch445 is comprised of Mu445 variable domains fused to human IgG1 wt/kappa constant regions</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0028" level="1">Example 5: Determining the Binding Affinity of Anti-OX40 Antibodies to OX40 Expressed on HuT78 Cells</heading><p id="p-0174" num="0187">To evaluate the binding activity of anti-OX40 antibodies to bind OX40 expressed on the surface of live cells, HuT78 cells were transfected with human OX40 as described in Example 1 to create an OX40 expressing line.

In this assay, antibody 445-3, reference antibody 1A7.grl, control huIgG or medium alone was pre-incubated with a human OX40 fusion protein with murine IgG2a Fc (OX40-mIgG2a). The antibody and fusion protein complex was then added to OX40L-expressing HEK293 cells. If an OX40 antibody does not interfere with OX40-OX40L interaction, then the OX40 antibody-OX40 mIgG2a complex will still bind to surface OX40L, and this interaction is detectable using an anti-mouse Fc secondary antibody.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0199">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, antibody 445-3, even at high concentration, did not reduce the binding of OX40 to OX40L, indicating that 445-3 does not interfere with the OX40-OX40L interaction.

In contrast, positive control antibody, 1A7.grl completely blocks OX40 binding to OX40L as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0200">In addition, the co-crystal structure of OX40 in complex with 445-3 Fab was solved and aligned with the OX40/OX40L complex (PDB code: 2HEV) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The OX40 ligand trimer interacts with OX40 mostly through CRD1 (cysteine rich domain), CRD2 and partial CRD3 regions of the OX40 (Compaan and Hymowitz, 2006), while antibody 445-3 interacts with OX40 only through the CRD4 region. In summary, the 445-3 antibody and the OX40L trimer bind at different respective regions of OX40 and antibody 445-3 does not interfere with OX40/OX40L interaction. This result correlates with the epitope mapping data described in the Examples above. CRD4 of OX40 is at amino acids 127-167, and the epitope of antibody 445-3 partially overlaps with this region.

The VH and VL regions of OX86 are provided below. As reported previously in the scientific literature, OX86 has a mechanism of action similar to antibody 445-3, in that it does not block the interaction between OX40 and OX40 ligand (al-Shamkhani Al, et al., Euro J.

In contrast, significantly improved antitumor activity was observed with OX86 in combination with muTIGIT, with a TGI of 56%, an increase in TGI of 25% over OX86 when administered as a single agent (p&#x3c;0.001, combination versus vehicle; p&#x3c;0.05, combination versus OX86 monotherapy; and p&#x3c;0.001, combination versus muTIGIT monotherapy).
