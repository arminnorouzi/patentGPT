In recent years, with the continuous development of wind power generation technology, the wind power industry is about to usher in an entire era of fair price, which requires higher power generation efficiency, lower cost per kilowatt-hour, and higher economic benefits. With technological progress and industrial chain development, small-power units will be further replaced by high-power units. However, as the power becomes larger, the volume and weight of a gearbox are getting larger and larger, which is not only difficult for machining, but also extremely difficult for transportation, assembly, and hoisting. Therefore, &#x201c;lightweight&#x201d; of the wind power unit is a development trend and focus of technology research and development in the wind power industry in the future. The traditional wind power gearbox is connected to a wheel hub through a main shaft, and a rear end of the main shaft is connected to a planetary carrier of the gearbox by a shrink disk or flange to transmit torque, and thus that the structure of the traditional wind power gearbox is relatively complicated and bulky.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, it is necessary to design a new wind power generation transmission system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present application is to provide a wind power gearbox with a compact structure and relatively small space occupation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve this object, the present application adopts solutions described below.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A wind power generation transmission system includes a wind power gearbox including a box body and a planetary gearset disposed in the box body; where the box body includes an inner ring gear cooperating with the planetary gearset, and the planetary gearset includes at least a first-stage planetary gearset and a second-stage planetary gearset; the first-stage planetary gearset includes a first planetary carrier, a plurality of first planetary gears rotatably supported on the first planetary carrier, and a first sun gear rotatably disposed in the box body around a rotation axis of the first-stage planetary gearset; the second-stage planetary gearset includes a second planetary carrier, a plurality of second planetary gears rotatably supported on the second planetary carrier, and a second sun gear rotatably disposed in the box body around a rotation axis of the second planetary gearset; the inner ring gear includes a first inner ring gear cooperating with the plurality of first planetary gears and a second inner ring gear cooperating with the plurality of second planetary gears, each of the plurality of first planetary gears is meshed with both the first inner ring gear and the first sun gear, and each of the plurality of second planetary gears is meshed with both the second inner ring gear and the second sun gear; the first sun gear is a hollow gear, the first sun gear includes a first end surface and a second end surface opposite to the first end surface, the second planetary carrier includes a third connection end, an outer circumferential surface of the third connection end is provided with external splines, an inner circumferential surface of the hollow gear is provided with internal splines, and the third connection end of the second planetary carrier extends from the second end surface to the first end surface and is disposed in the hollow gear so that the external splines of the third connection end are connected to the internal splines of the hollow gear.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a structure view of a wind power generation transmission system according to the present application;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a structure view illustrating that a positioning member positions a first sun gear in a floating manner according to embodiment one of the present application; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a structure view illustrating that a positioning member positions a first sun gear in a floating manner according to embodiment two of the present application.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present application is further described hereinafter in detail in conjunction with drawings and embodiments.
