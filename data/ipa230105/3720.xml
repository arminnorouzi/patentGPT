id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Described herein is a multiplexed and high content screening assay using primary neurons for identifying small molecule modulators of neuronal mitochondrial mitostasis (MnMs). Also described is a high throughput screening assay using primary neurons for identifying small molecules that increase mitochondrial function, identified by measuring the electrochemical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane and ATP generation. Most MnMs that increased mitochondrial content, length and/or health also increased mitochondrial function without altering neurite outgrowth. Some MnMs protect mitochondria in primary neurons from A&#x3b2;(1-42) toxicity, glutamate toxicity, increased oxidative stress and the toxic cellular environment associated with Alzheimer's disease. Some MnMs target mitochondria directly. An MnM also increases the synaptic activity of hippocampal neurons and is potent in vivo, increasing the respiration rate of brain mitochondria after administering the compound to mice. The MnMs were demonstrated to protect the mitochondrial population in neurons in an in vivo model of Alzheimer's Disease. Also described is a method for treating a patient suffering from a disorder characterized by dysfunction of neuronal mitostasis, comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound (MnM), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="255.27mm"

These demands are largely met by neuronal mitostasis, which includes the combined processes that maintain mitochondrial number and quality in the various compartments of the neuron across its lifetime. These processes include the regulation of the cell's content of mitochondria through a balance between biogenesis and turnover, the length of each mitochondrion from a balance between fusion and fission, and other processes such as transport across the length of axons and dendrites. Biogenesis is largely controlled by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1&#x3b1;), which interacts with multiple transcription factors and nuclear hormone receptors to regulate &#x2dc;1500 genes in the nucleus that code for mitochondrial proteins and other factors that coordinate mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation [2]. The dynamic processes of fission, mediated by dynamin related protein 1 (DRP1), and fusion, mediated by mitofusins and other proteins, provide for quality control over the system. Mitochondria can mix their contents upon fusion, spreading metabolites, enzymes, and other constituents throughout the fused mitochondrion. Damaged parts of a mitochondrion can be segregated into a daughter mitochondrion destined for destruction through fission. However, excessive fission leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death. Increases in mitochondrial length, or elongation, caused by enhanced fusion or decreased fission can be beneficial in some situations, increasing the efficiency of the mitochondrial system and offering protection during stressed conditions [3, 4]. Importantly, dysfunctions of neuronal mitostasis are found in most neuropsychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, mood disorders, schizophrenia and others [5-10]. Mitochondrial failure leads to increased oxidative stress and damage to lipids, proteins and nucleic acids from the generated reactive oxygen species [11]. Toxic A&#x3b2; species are reported to accumulate intraneuronally, and within mitochondria, during the development of Alzheimer's disease, impairing energy metabolism, increasing ROS and decreasing ATP production [12].</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Surprisingly, very little effort has been made in identifying new compounds that modulate neuronal mitostasis. A few small molecule screens for enhanced mitochondrial function or dynamics have been performed using yeast, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, or other mammalian cell lines [13-15].</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Brain and other CNS disorders, and particularly neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), motor neuron disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease (PD), cause the failure of many different cellular and molecular systems utilized by the brain for normal function. This has made the development of therapeutics particularly challenging. One of the major systems that fails in nearly all brain disorders is the mitochondrial system in neurons. This system is incredibly important for the function and health of neurons for many different reasons, not the least of which is as a source of energy through the mitochondrial generation of ATP.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Neurodegenerative disorders, for instance, cause three fundamental impairments in the mitochondrial system: (1) There exists increased fragmentation of mitochondria in the disease state due to an imbalance between mitochondrial fission and fusion events. The 6,000-10,000 mitochondria that exist in neurons and supply energy at diverse locations in the cell are in constant flux with each often dividing into two mitochondria. This is balanced by fusion events between mitochondria. These fission:fusion events are placed under the rubric of &#x201c;mitochondrial dynamics.&#x201d; (2) Mitochondria produce their energy through the function of the electron transport chain. The function of the electron transport chain is reduced in neurodegenerative disorders leading to reduced synthesis of ATP. (3) The number of mitochondria per neuron is reduced. This may be due to a defect in the biogenesis of mitochondria in the disease and/or due to increased turnover. Neuronal mitochondrial are in a constant state of flux with new mitochondria being born and others that become defective over time being degraded through distinct cellular processes such as mitophagy. These processes, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy are also included in the rubric of mitochondrial dynamics. These observations indicate that neurodegeneration and other brain disorder is associated with dysfunction of the overall mitochondrial system, including both functional aspects of mitochondria and the processes of mitochondrial dynamics.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although many different systems fail in neurodegeneration, additional systems could fail due to the failure of the mitochondrial system. Thus, dysfunction of the neuronal mitochondrial system can be an upstream failure in the cascade of events leading to eventual neuronal cell death: (1) Mitochondria in neurons are known to become damaged across time due to aging&#x2014;aging is the primary risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as AD; (2) Increased oxidative stress occurs in neurodegenerative disorders&#x2014;Damaged mitochondria are the major source of reactive oxygen species; (3) Hippocampal neurons are reported to undergo changed in activity levels in neurodegenerative disorders&#x2014;Mitochondria are reported to establish the set point for activity levels; (4) Chronic neuroinflammation is a major hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders&#x2014;Oxidized mitochondrial DNA, released from damaged mitochondria, is known to the agonist for the activation of the molecular &#x201c;inflammasome&#x201d;; (5) Synapses are lost in neurodegeneration&#x2014;Mitochondrial function is required for the integrity of synapses and their function, likely through the generation of ATP energy required for synapse function and integrity. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction ties together many of the major systems failures in AD.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The severe mitochondrial pathology associated with neurodegeneration is recognized and advanced by many investigators as a potential target for the development of therapeutics. Yet, the diversity of the compounds in the pipeline is very limited: most are Type2 diabetes drugs selected to increase brain glucose metabolism. In essence, most therapeutics being developed are unitary in their actions. Notably absent are drugs that have positive effects on the important aspects of mitochondrial dynamics and function that become dysfunction from the insults of neurodegeneration.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Drugs that address the deficiencies above can offer broad protection against the three fundamental insults to the mitochondrial system.

Assaying Mitochondrial Morphology in Primary Neurons. (A) Mt mice, work flow and timeline of the screen. Mitochondria were visualized in primary mouse neurons by the Cre-dependent expression of mitochondria-targeted GFP (Mt-GFP). The image shows the transduced neurons in the field expressing GFP in somatic and neuritic mitochondria (maximum-projection image of confocal Z-stacks, 3 slices, z=0.7 &#x3bc;m with a 60&#xd7; objective). (B) Classification of axonal and dendritic mitochondria. Representative images of a neuron (left panel) expressing Cyto-tdTomato and Mt-GFP and zoomed-in segments of a dendrite and two axons. The frequency distributions of mitochondrial length, located either in dendrites or axons, are plotted in the right panel. Best fit lognormal distributions (black lines) show that 15% of the mitochondrial lengths can be found in both axons and dendrites (overlap). n<sub>axonal</sub>=517, n<sub>dendritic</sub>=525. Scalebars=25 &#x3bc;m (left image) and 5 &#x3bc;m (middle and right images). (C) Image analysis. Maximum z-projection of the green channel (Mt-GFP) containing mitochondria and widefield image of neurites (Cyto-tdTomato). After image preprocessing (somatic mitochondria removal from both channels, background subtraction and median filtering of mitochondria, tubeness filtering of neurites), axonal and dendritic mitochondria and neurites were segmented (axonal: 0.5-1.4 &#x3bc;m, dendritic: &#x3e;2.4 inn) by top-hat filtering followed by adaptive thresholding.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

(A) Uncorrelated mitochondrial content and neurite sprouting. Rescreen data of dendritic mitochondrial CA and neurite area of the compounds that significantly increased mitochondrial content (&#x3e;2 robust Z-scores, dashed line). There was no correlation between increased neurite area and increased dendritic mitochondrial CA (Pearson's r=0.13, right panel). Eleven compounds that increased mitochondrial content (gray) increased neurite sprouting (light gray) by &#x3e;2 robust Z-scores. (B) No correlation between dendritic and axonal mitochondrial content. There was no correlation between axonal and dendritic CA (Pearson r=0.22). (C) Coupling of dendritic mitochondrial content and length. Dendritic mitochondrial length correlated with dendritic mitochondrial content (left panel, Pearson r=0.76) and dendritic mitochondrial count (right panel, Pearson r=0.6) after compound treatment. The correlation lines are bounded by a 95% confidence interval (gray shaded area). (D) Representative images showing the coupling of mitochondrial content and elongation. Mt-GFP expressing neurons were treated with a hit compound (12.5 &#x3bc;M) that increased both content and elongation by 12 h after treatment. White arrows indicate the sites of mitochondrial growth. Scalebar is 20 &#x3bc;m. (E) Axonal mitochondrial length is uncoupled with content and count. There was no correlation between axonal mitochondrial length and axonal CA (left panel, Pearson r=&#x2212;0.22) or count (right panel, Pearson r=&#x2212;0.23). (F) Mitochondrial dynamics hits increase mitochondrial function. TMRM signal and ATP production of the rescreened mitochondrial dynamics hits (confirmed hits, n=67) was measured and a functional increase was determined as robust Z-scores &#x3e;2 for TMRM signal or ATP production. Sixty-one increased (91%) one or both functional readouts. (G) Mitochondrial dynamics hit parameters differentiate compounds with increased mitochondrial function. Decreased axonal circularity, increased dendritic length together with increased dendritic CA identified a population of compounds showing increased mitochondrial function measured by ATP production, TMRM signal or both (functional increase, darker points, &#x3e;2 robust Z-scores, average from 4 replicate plates) among the rescreened primary hits (n=149).

(E, F) Mitochondrial respiration in primary neurons exposed to dyclonine for 24 hr. Prior to oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements, DIV13 neurons were treated for 24 hr with DMSO (0.1%, black) or dyclonine (10 &#x3bc;M, gray). OCR rates were measured at baseline respiration (Base) and after addition of mitochondrial substrates Pyruvate (P) and Malate (M) or Succinate (Succ) along with ADP to the permeabilized (Saponin, Sa) neurons (1&#x2032; dashed line, 9) Oligomycin addition (2<sup>nd </sup>dashed line) blocked proton re-entry through ATP synthase, slowing ETC function to levels necessary to maintain &#x394;&#x3c8;<sub>m </sub>(S4<sub>o</sub>; o=oligomycin induced). Addition of FCCP (3<sup>rd </sup>dashed line) short-circuited proton influx to bypass ATP synthase, revealing maximal, uncoupled OCR (S3<sub>U</sub>; u=uncoupler induced). Addition of Rotenone (R)/Antimycin A (AA), Complex I and Complex III inhibitors, respectively, were added to block oxidative phosphorylation and measure non-mitochondrial respiration (4<sup>th </sup>dashed line).

Optimizing the Screen (A) AAV9 vector containing the Cre-recombinase gene. Plasmid map of the vector containing the CaMKII promoter and the iCRE sequence fused with tdTomato via the T2 peptide sequence. The expression of td-Tomato from the virus in the cytoplasm of neurons was negligible and not used for the experiments shown. (B) Time course of Mt-GFP expression in primary neurons. Representative images of a neuron expressing Mt-GFP (upper panels) on different days of culture in vitro (DIV). Normalized fluorescence of Mt-GFP intensity over time showed that on DIV14 the signal was 1.6&#xb1;0.16 times more intense than the background, which plateaued at 2.3 defined by the sigmoidal fit (green line). (C) Correct mitochondrial targeting of the Mt-GFP reporter. Mt-GFP expressing neurons were stained with the mitochondrial dye TMRM (left panels) or MitoTracker Orange (MTO, image not shown). The overlapping Mt-GFP and TMRM signals (white box) are separated and enlarged in the trio of images to the right. Quantification of the overlap was performed by manually measuring the area of individual Mt-GFP expressing mitochondria (n<sub>TMRM</sub>=61, n<sub>MTO</sub>=70) and the area of the corresponding TMRM or MitoTracker Orange signal using ImageJ, validated by linear fits to the data (R<sup>2</sup><sub>TMRM</sub>=0.94, R<sup>2</sup><sub>MTO</sub>=0.95). (D) Candidate screen for positive controls. Twenty-three compounds at 4 concentrations were added with a pintool to 384-well plates on DIV13 and imaged on DIV14. After image and data analysis, none of the compounds increased mitochondrial content (dendritic CA), elongation (dendritic length median) or improved health (axonal circularity median) by more than 2.5 Robust Z-scores compared to DMSO treated neurons.

(A) Mitotoxicity. Mitochondrial health was assessed by measuring axonal mitochondrial circularity with increasing concentrations of FCCP treatment (0-12.5 &#x3bc;M) on DIV13 and collecting data 24 h later. The correlation between axonal mitochondrial circularity and FCCP concentration is linear (R<sup>2</sup>=0.99). Data are mean&#xb1;s.e.m. (12 wells, 4 fields/well) fit with a linear function. (B) Neurotoxicity. The fraction of dead cells was measured 24 h after treatment of neurons with increasing concentrations of FCCP (0-12.5 &#x3bc;M) on DIV13. The correlation between dead cells and FCCP concentration shows that there is an initial lag before cells begin to die with FCCP treatment. Data are mean&#xb1;s.e.m. (6 wells, 6 fields/well) fit with a sigmoidal function constrained at a ceiling of 1 as a theoretical limit for the dead cell fraction. (C) Mitotoxicity and neurotoxicity. The fraction of dead neurons plotted against axonal circularity of mitochondria with increasing concentrations of FCCP treatment. The correlation depicts an initial lag, with mitochondrial damage occurring before neurons start to die.

(A) Example plate heatmap. Neurons were cultured for two weeks and imaged on DIV14 without compound treatment. Robust Z-scores of well values for mitochondrial content and elongation showed 4 false positive hits on the plate (above 2.5 robust Z-scores). Greater edge effects were observed on this plate for the health parameter yielding 10 false positive hits (2.6%, below &#x2212;2.5 robust Z-score). During the screen, columns 1, 2, 23 and 24 were omitted from analysis, and rows A, B, O and P were analyzed as a separate group. (B) Averaged plate heatmaps. Averaging the robust Z-scores of each well at the same position of 4 the replicate plates used during the screen resulted in no false positive hits for any of the hit parameters.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.

Dose-Response of A&#x3b2;(1-42) Oligomers, Peroxide and Glutamate Treatment on Neuronal Mitochondrial Features. A-C) Dose response of A&#x3b2;(1-42) treatment. Sigmoidal dose response curves fit to increasing concentrations (0-15 &#x3bc;M) of A&#x3b2;(1-42) showed that oligomer treatment led to smaller (A) and more circular (B) axonal mitochondria. A&#x3b2;(1-42) treatment also decreased the average length of dendritic mitochondria (C). Data are means&#xb1;s.e.m.

Sigmoidal dose response curves fit to increasing concentrations (0-800 &#x3bc;M) of peroxide showed that peroxide treatment was very similar to A&#x3b2;(1-42) treatment, leading to smaller (D) and more circular (E) axonal mitochondria, and shorter dendritic mitochondria (F). Data are means&#xb1;s.e.m. (12 wells, 4 fields per well, 2 independent experiments) collected 48 h after peroxide treatment on DIV13. G-I) Dose response of glutamate treatment. Sigmoidal dose response curves fit to increasing concentrations (0-200 &#x3bc;M) of glutamate showed that glutamate treatment was very similar to peroxide treatment, leading to smaller (G) and more circular axonal mitochondria (H), and shorter dendritic mitochondria (I).

Development of the high-throughput TMRM and ATP assays. (A) TMRM fluorescence. The excitation and emission spectra of TMRM. (A&#x2032;) TMRM fluorescence as a function of concentration in primary neuronal cultures. DIV14 neurons were loaded with TMRM with serial concentrations from 10 to 160 nM. After 6 h of incubation, neurons were washed briefly, and the intra-mitochondrial fluorescence was measured. TMRM fluorescence increased linearly with increased concentration below 40 nM in the medium. High concentrations within mitochondria triggered self-quenching effects and a deviation from linearity. The mitochondrial TMRM fluorescence across TMRM concentration was fit to a hyperbolic function. Bar plots represent the mean&#xb1;the SEM. (B) Quenching and non-quenching concentrations of TMRM in primary neuronal cultures. DIV14 neurons were loaded with TMRM at 10, 20, 50 and 150 nM for 3 h and then treated for 5-10 m with DMSO (0.1%), the ionophore FCCP (5 and 10 &#x3bc;M) or the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin (5 and 10 &#x3bc;M). Cells were washed and the intracellular TMRM intensity was measured. A &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>hyperpolarization by oligomycin triggered further accumulation of mitochondrial TMRM, thus a further self-quenching effect and decreased fluorescence at high concentrations (150 nM), but increased fluorescence at non-quenching concentrations (10 and 20 nM). In contrast, FCCP collapses &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>and releases mitochondrial TMRM, producing a transient increase of fluorescence at quenching concentrations (150 nM) and a decrease in fluorescence at non-quenching concentrations (10 and 20 nM).

(C) TMRM assay wash steps do not affect the integrity of the cultured neurons. Representative images of TMRM labeled primary neurons before and 0, 15, and 30 m after washing steps, showing that the wash steps neither disturb the cell layer nor alter the morphology of neurons and mitochondria. Scale bar=20 &#x3bc;m. (D) TMRM wash steps are required for an accurate determination of mitochondrial associated TMRM fluorescence. The raw (left) and normalized (right; normalized to each of the DMSO controls) TMRM signal in untreated, DMSO- and FCCP-treated wells, pre- and post-washing steps. Wash steps remove about 40% of the total fluorescence due to the removal of free TMRM in the medium, indicating that approximately 60% of the TMRM is sequestered in mitochondria. FCCP collapses &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m</sub>, strongly reducing the mitochondrial signal in the washed wells but not in those measured before wash. Bar plots represent the mean&#xb1;the SEM. (E) Distribution of TMRM fluorescence in neurons treated with positive hits (red), DMSO (black) and the negative control, FCCP (gray). DIV13 neurons were incubated with DMSO (0.1%), FCCP (12.5 &#x3bc;M) and the selected hits, dyclonine (12.5 &#x3bc;M) or doxepin (12.5 &#x3bc;M), for 24 h and the &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>measured by whole well TMRM fluorescence.

(F) Plate edge effects. In a pilot experiment using two plates with wells treated only with the carrier DMSO, we observed significant edge effects on TMRM fluorescence, with elevated signal in the outer two rows or columns but relatively homogenous signals across the population of inner wells. Heat maps of TMRM fluorescence from columns 2-23 of DMSO treated plates at 4 and 24 h of incubation. The fluorescence is the average per well across two independent plates. Primary neurons in 384-well plates were cultured to DIV13 and incubated with TMRM (10 nM) and DMSO (final concentration 0.1%) in all wells. The TMRM intensity was assayed in a plate reader at 4 and 24 h after the necessary washing steps. No TMRM dye was added in columns 1 and 24 (not illustrated). The auto-fluorescence of the neurons and plastics in the plate bottom in these wells was measured as background and subtracted from the wells to which TMRM was added. The black box represents the &#x201c;inner wells&#x201d; used for the screen. (G) TMRM plate row and column effects. The average whole well TMRM fluorescence across rows and columns at 4 and 24 h. Significant edge-effects were observed across rows A-P, with the outer two rows exhibiting significantly increased TMRM fluorescence relative to inner rows. Data plotted as mean&#xb1;std. To compensate for the significant edge effects, data generated from the outer rows (rows A,B,O,P) and inner wells (rows C-N, columns 3-22) were analyzed separately for the primary screen as described below. The outer rows A, B, O and P were not used for the subsequent rescreen and dose response experiments. Bar plots represent the mean&#xb1;the SEM. (H, I) TMRM assay variability across plates. The MicroSource Spectrum library compounds were pintooled from source plate rows A-P, columns 3-22, and DMSO from a source plate rows A-P, columns 2 and 23. The basal TMRM fluorescence was measured from 32 DMSO (0.1%) control wells in columns 2 and 23 on each plate to monitor variability across the screen. There was no significant difference in average TMRM fluorescence of the DMSO-treated wells at 4 (H) or 24 h (I) of incubation across the four replicates for each of the eight source plates (Spec 1-8). In addition, no significant signal drift was observed from the first to the last plate throughout the primary screen indicating consistency in the primary neuron cultures and assay. Points represent individual wells and the bars represent the mean&#xb1;std. The red horizontal line indicates the basal TMRM fluorescence at 4 (H) or 24 h (I) of incubation, measured from DMSO-treated wells and calculated as the mean across all plates used in the primary screen. This mean showed a &#x2dc;10% reduction between 4 and 24 h of incubation. (H&#x2032;-I&#x2032;) Representative correlation plot of TMRM signals for compound-treated wells of replicates plates 1 (P1) and 2 (P2) for Spectrum source plate 4. The table inset shows the high correlation (R values &#x3e;0.92) for all inter se comparisons among replicate plates. (H&#x2033;, I&#x2033;) The Coefficient of Variation (CV) of four replicates for each of the 2400 compound-treated wells was individually plotted to illustrate variation across replicates. The CV was centered around 3% and was generally &#x3c;8% for almost all nontoxic compounds. Higher CV values were observed in wells treated with toxic compounds (red). (J,K) Population control for data normalization of TMRM fluorescence. We used a &#x201c;non-DMSO-control&#x201d; statistical approach to normalize raw TMRM fluorescence into Z scores and Effect-Size (fold change) for hit identification, based on the fact that the majority of small molecules in HTS assays are absent of biological effects, thus serving as &#x201c;within plate controls&#x201d; (Brideau et al., 2003; Malo et al., 2006). Distribution of TMRM fluorescence from 240 inner wells treated with compounds from source plate 4 at 4 (J) and 24 h (K) showing that most of the wells fall into a normal distribution and can be considered to consist of inactive compounds. Some compounds in the inner wells dramatically reduced the TMRM signal and were classified as toxic compounds; others were identified as auto-fluorescent. The wells containing these compounds were not included in the &#x201c;inactive&#x201d; population. The plots in (J&#x2032;, K&#x2032;) expand the red-highlighted region in (J, K). A bimodal distribution (red line), most obvious in the 24 h data set was observed, identifying putative hits in the shoulder peak. The TMRM fluorescence of &#x201c;inactive&#x201d; compounds within the dominant peak showed a similar plate mean (&#x3bc;<sub>plate</sub>) and standard derivation (&#x3c3;<sub>plate</sub>) calculated from inner DMSO-wells in parallel DMSO-only treated plates. This &#x201c;inactive&#x201d; population from each plate was used for data normalization. Statistically, this subpopulation was defined by using Tukey's fences rule based on the interquartile range (J&#x2032;, K&#x2032;). The black dotted line shows the normal distribution of the &#x201c;inactive&#x201d; subpopulation with TMRM readouts in the range of [Q1-(Q3-Q1/ITQ), Q3+(Q3-Q1)]. Compounds with activity outside of this range were identified as outliers; Q1 and Q3 represent the first (lower) and third (upper) quartiles respectively. A modified box-and-whiskers plot is illustrated below each distribution. Boxes represent the interquartile range, lines within boxes are medians, whiskers represent values of 1.0&#xd7;(interquartile range/ITQ: Q3-Q1) from the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles. (L-N) TMRM assay Z-scores and effect size. The plate mean (&#x3bc;<sub>plate</sub>) and standard deviation (&#x3c3;<sub>plate</sub>) were calculated using the subpopulation trimmed of outliers to normalize compound performance as Z-scores and Effect Size. Z-scores were calculated by subtracting the &#x3bc;<sub>plate</sub>, then dividing by the &#x3c3;<sub>plate </sub>((value<sub>compound</sub>&#x2212;&#x3bc;<sub>plate</sub>)/&#x3c3;<sub>plate</sub>). Effect size was calculated by subtracting the &#x3bc;<sub>plate</sub>, then dividing by the &#x3bc;<sub>plate </sub>to obtain fold change ((value<sub>compound</sub>&#x2212;&#x3bc;<sub>plate</sub>)/&#x3bc;<sub>plate</sub>) Putative hits from the primary screen were identified as enhancing the well fluorescence above the &#x3bc;<sub>plate </sub>by 3&#x3c3;<sub>plate </sub>for inner wells, and by 2.5&#x3c3;<sub>plate </sub>for outer wells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E-F</figref>). (O) Schematic illustration of the luminescence-based ATP assay in the 384-well plate format. (P-P&#x2033;) Testing the assay using a DMSO source plate. 100 nl DMSO (final concentration &#x2dc;0.1%) was pintooled into the inner wells of a 384 well microplate. Cellular ATP was measured using the CellTiter-Glo&#xae; luminescence assay (Promega) and the well luminescence measured. The signal of DMSO-treated wells was aggregated by column (P&#x2032;) or by row (P&#x2033;) and plotted. No significant difference in the average luminescence of DMSO wells across the inner columns or rows (one-way ANOVA) was found. Bar plots represent the mean&#xb1;the SEM. (Q) Orthogonal screen of putative TMRM hits measuring ATP production. 16 putative hits with effects at 4 h (red), and 135 putative hits with effects at 24 h (pink) from the primary screen were tested for ATP production alongside 134 randomly selected non-hit compounds (black) and 40 DMSO controls. The main plot shows the correlation of the effect size of TMRM fluorescence and ATP production in wells after 4 h of incubation for these compounds. The black line represents the fit using a linear regression model using all plotted compounds (R<sup>2</sup>=0.16, p&#x3c;0.0001). The compound-induced effect size on ATP production (right histogram) at 4 h was normalized to the mean value of the 40 &#x201c;within-plate&#x201d; DMSO controls as (value<sub>compound</sub>&#x2212;&#x3bc;<sub>DMSO</sub>)/&#x3bc;<sub>DMSO</sub>. The population of 24 h TMRM hits was significantly different from the non-hit population for ATP effect size (right histogram). The 24 and 4 h TMRM hit populations were significantly different from the non-hit population for TMRM fluorescence effect size (bottom histogram). The 4 h TMRM hits showed a large variation in their effect size on ATP levels (note the distribution of 4 h TMRM points), suggesting that acute increases in &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>only weakly correlate with effects on ATP generation.

OCR measured from permeabilized neurons was displayed in the &#x201c;middle point&#x201d; mode showing a single OCR rate for each measurement period. Two measurements were performed under each condition (Base=baseline respiration, S3=ADP/substrate-stimulated State 3 respiration, S4<sub>o</sub>=oligomycin induced State 4 respiration) except for S3.

The latter parameter, health, can be assayed using an imaging function of &#x201c;circularity.&#x201d; When mitochondria become defective, they assume a small and rounded morphology. In some examples, we used the platform to screen 2400 compounds and identified 67 Modulators of neuronal Mitostasis, abbreviated as &#x201c;MnMs,&#x201d; that modulate mitochondrial content, elongation, and health. Interestingly, more than 90% of the MnMs also increased mitochondrial function as measured by the potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane and ATP generation by the cells, suggesting an extremely high correlation between mitochondrial morphology and function. Importantly, some of the MnMs proved to be protective to cultured neurons against insults that are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including increased oxidative stress, excess glutamate or A&#x3b2;(1-42) induced mito- and neurotoxicity. Using isolated mitochondria, we found that some MnMs which fully protected damaged mitochondria from these insults, target mitochondria directly. One promising compound, dyclonine, was explored in more detail and shown to enhance synaptic activity in cultured hippocampal neurons and increase respiration in brain mitochondria isolated from mice treated with the compound.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0068">The present disclosure further relates to a high-throughput assay and screen using cultured primary neurons to identify compounds that increase mitochondrial function. As illustrated in various embodiments herein described, the assay identified multiple structural and functional clusters of compounds that enhance the function of neuronal mitochondria. The most surprising observation made concerns the large number and diversity of the compounds identified that potentiate mitochondrial function. For example, the modulators identified in the assay include the hormone derivatives yohimbine and genistein, which provide beneficial effects on mitochondrial function and overall neuronal health. These compounds are exemplary positive controls for use in high-throughput screens that assay mitochondria function. Additional classes of hits identified by the assay include topical/local anesthetics as represented by dyclonine, classic tricyclic antidepressants as represented by doxepin, and the anti-psychotics as represented by pimozide and penfluridol. These results offer evidence that these molecules and classes can offer protection against diseases that are associated with neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction. The present disclosure, as illustrated by various embodiments, establishes methods of screening large libraries of compounds for their effects on mitochondrial function directly in neurons, providing a more biologically relevant HTS platform for use in brain disease research.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0069">Thus, in one embodiment is an in vitro method for determining whether a test agent could be useful as a mitotherapeutic in the treatment of a patient suffering from a neurological or psychiatric disorder. The method comprises (a) contacting a test population of brain cells with a mitochondrial reporter for a time sufficient to label mitochondria in live neurons.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0070">Mitochondrial dyes, labels, probes, reporters, and stains are terms that are used interchangeably in this disclosure. Typical mitochondrial dyes, such as fluorescent dyes, are known in the art. For example, a useful mitochondrial reporter is tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate (TMRM). Additional mitochondrial reporters include tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate (TMRE), 6-amino-9-(2-methoxycarbonylphenyl)xanthen-3-ylidene]azanium chloride (Rh123), 5,5,6,6&#x2032;-tetrachloro-1,1&#x2032;,3,3&#x2032; tetraethylbenzimi-dazoylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) and 3,3&#x2032;-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC<sub>6</sub>). Sufficient times for labeling mitochondria, as can be assessed by straightforward imaging as described herein, can vary from one hour to 72 h. After labeling, according to some embodiments, the cells are isolated from the mitochondrial dye so as to not contaminate a further imaging step as described herein.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0071">In this embodiment and others, the method next comprises (b) incubating the cells with the test agent. Automated high-throughput screening methodologies are useful, for example, in assaying a plurality of test agents. A test agent can be any substance, typically an agent known or suspected to be biologically active, such as any of the small molecule compounds described herein.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0072">The methods disclosed herein further comprise (c) imaging the incubated cells to obtain a visual image of labeled mitochondria. Many imaging techniques and instrumentation, suitably matched to the emission profile of a chosen mitochondrial reporter, are known in the art. One example, per one embodiment, is automated confocal imaging as described herein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0073">The method further comprises (d) determining mitochondrial parameters by inspection of the visual image, in comparison to an image of a control population of brain cells not incubated with the test agent. Mitochondrial parameters are readily observable or derived quantities facilitated by the imaging. In various embodiments, these are selected from the (1) concentration of cellular mitochondria, (2) mitochondrial length; and, as a measure of mitochondrial health, (3) mitochondrial circularity.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0074">As used herein, the quantity &#x201c;circularity&#x201d; can be determined in various ways, such as by visual comparison of mitochondria shapes between the image of labeled mitochondria and control image &#x201c;Circularity&#x201d; also can be quantified, in various embodiments, by dividing 4&#x3c0; (area of an individual mitochondria) by (perimeter of the individual mitochondria)<sup>2</sup>. Mitochondrial length and circularity, if quantified, can be independently expressed as their mean and median values. The examples described herein illustrate further embodiments of quantification calculations.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0075">The method further comprises the step of (e) correlating the presence of one or more results with a conclusion that the test agent is useful as a mitotherapeutic. With reference to the mitochondrial parameters described herein, the results are selected from (1) an increase in concentration of cellular mitochondria; (2) an increase in mitochondrial length; and (3) decrease in mitochondrial circularity. In some embodiments, any two of these results are observed. In other embodiments, all three results are observed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0076">Another embodiment is an in vitro method for determining whether a test agent is likely toxic to cellular mitochondria (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>). Many hazardous agents, e.g., compounds, are found in common or everyday items such as electrical components, industrial chemicals, and agricultural chemicals such as weed killers. In this context, the method is a useful assay for determining likely mitochondrial toxicity of these and other agents suspected of being toxic. The method thus comprises (a) contacting a test population of cells with a mitochondrial reporter for a time sufficient to label mitochondria in live neurons; (b) incubating the cells with the test agent; (c) imaging the cells to obtain a visual image of labeled mitochondria; and (d) determining mitochondrial parameters by inspection of the visual image, in comparison to an image of a control population of cells not incubated with the test agent, wherein the mitochondrial parameters are selected from concentration of cellular mitochondria; mitochondrial length; and mitochondrial circularity. The method further comprises the step of (e) correlating the presence of one or more results with a conclusion that the test agent is likely toxic to mitochondria, wherein the results are selected from a decrease in concentration of cellular mitochondria, decrease in mitochondrial length, and an increase in mitochondrial circularity.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0077">In embodiments, the cells described herein are derived from one of various tissue types. In an embodiment, the cells are muscle cells. In another illustrative embodiment, optionally in combination with any other embodiment, the in vitro methods described herein utilize cells harvested from the brain. Thus, in various embodiments, the cells are brain cells and, accordingly, the cellular mitochondria are neuronal mitochondria. Suitable brains, in various embodiments, are mammalian, such as mouse, rat, pig, and monkey. Additional embodiments provide for cells obtained from brains of other laboratory models including invertebrates, such as insects. In some embodiments, the cells are dissociated from the forebrain.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0078">In various embodiments, optionally in combination with any other embodiment described herein, the concentration of dendritic mitochondria is determined.

Thus, in accordance with this choice of mitochondrial reporter, the reporter signal is fluorescence.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0085">The correlating in step (d), per various embodiments, can be facilitated by calculating from the reporter signal an inner mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m</sub>) that, as explained herein, is a well-known quantity for assessing the functional status and integrity of mitochondria. &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>is defined as the difference in electrical potential between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol, and is commonly considered as a semi-quantitative read-out for the full proton-motive force. Marked &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>depolarization is generally correlated with neuronal death, and it may indicate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization during apoptosis or mitochondrial permeability transition during ROS-mediated or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated injury. Small fluctuations in &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>can indicate disrupted respiration, ATP synthesis, or ionic fluxes across the mitochondrial membrane.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0086">Incubation times of test agent and test population of cells can range from about 1 h to about 48 h. Exemplary incubation times include at least 4 h, at least 8 h, at least 12 h, at least 16 h, at least 20 h, and at least 24 h. The incubation time can be adjusted to verify &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>as a reliable indicator of mitochondrial dynamics and function. Thus, as illustrated by examples and data herein, independent measurement of cellular ATP production can be achieved by incubating a test population of cells with a test agent, and then subjecting the incubated cells to an ATP quantitation assay. Any useful method for measuring cellular ATP can be used, such as the widely known CellTiter-Glo&#xae; luminescence assay (Promega). Results from the mitochondrial reporter assay method described herein can be combined with results from the ATP quantitation assay to further screen for test agents that modulate mitochondrial dynamics and function. Thus, for example, an incubation time of about 24 h is suitable for verifying that increased &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>is a reliable and inexpensive surrogate for detecting elevated levels of ATP within cells, such as neurons.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0087">Advantages attaching to compounds described herein, such as those identified by the in vitro assay methods described herein, relate generally to their promotion of cellular, e.g., neuronal mitochondrial content, length and bioenergetics or health.

The mitochondrial system in cells of the central nervous system becomes defective in many different diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyolateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and other neurological and psychiatric diseases. These impairments alter the function of individual mitochondria and also mitochondrial dynamics, the latter including the generation of mitochondria by the cell (biogenesis), the turnover of mitochondria (mitophagy) and the division (fission) and fusion that mitochondria undergo with each other.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Therapeutic Methods and Uses</heading><p id="p-0063" num="0089">The present disclosure also provides, in an embodiment, a method for treating a disorder characterized by dysfunction of neuronal mitostasis or dysfunction of ATP generation.

The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of permeabilized neurons and isolated brain mitochondria (from 9-month old mice) was measured by the XF96 Extracellular Flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). For assays using cultured neurons, primary neurons were dissociated from the forebrains of P0 pups, seeded at 1.9&#xd7;10<sup>4</sup>/well (PDL-coated XF96 plate), cultured to DIV13 and incubated with dyclonine or DMSO (0.1%) for 24 hours. Prior to the start of the OCR measurement, all but 30 &#x3bc;l of Neurobasal A/B27 culture medium was removed from each well. Cells were washed twice with pre-warmed MAS-BSA assay medium (4 mg/ml fatty-acid free BSA, pH=7.2) and incubated in 180 &#x3bc;l at 37&#xb0; C. for 5 min. Following the cartridge calibration, cells were loaded into the XF96 Extracellular Flux analyzer and further equilibrated for 10 min with two cycles of 3 min mixing and 2 min resting prior to the first measurement of basal respiration. OCR were measured at 37&#xb0; C. under basal conditions followed by the sequential injection of pre-warmed 10&#xd7; mitochondrial substrates/ADP (20 &#x3bc;l), oligomycin (22 &#x3bc;l), FCCP (24 &#x3bc;l), and rotenone/antimycin A (26 &#x3bc;l). The final concentrations of injected compounds were as follows: 10 mM mitochondrial substrates (pyruvate/malate or succinate), 1 mM ADP, 1.5 &#x3bc;M oligomycin, 3 &#x3bc;M FCCP, 2 &#x3bc;M rotenone/antimycin A. Saponin (25 &#x3bc;g/ml) was co-injected with substrate/ADP to permeabilize the cells and stimulate ADP-dependent respiration. Two baseline measurements were obtained prior to any injection and 2 response measurements were collected after each injection except for after FCCP addition which consisted of 1 measurement (9 total measurements in each assay). Each measurement cycle consisted of 2 min mixing, 2 min waiting, and 3 min data acquisition. This protocol allowed for sequential assessment of basal cell respiration, maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity (State 3 with substrate/ADP), proton leak (State 4<sub>o </sub>with oligomycin), uncoupled maximal respiration (State 3<sub>U </sub>with FCCP) and non-mitochondrial respiration with the Complex I/Complex III inhibitors, rotenone/antimycin A. Cells were washed twice with MAS buffer to remove residue BSA contained in the assay medium, lysed in 50 &#x3bc;l lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, 1&#xd7; protease and phosphatase inhibitor, pH 7.0 adjusted with NaOH) and total protein was determined by BCA assay.

Wells without mitochondria were used for background correction. The plate was centrifuged at 2000&#xd7;g for 20 min at 4&#xb0; C. to attach the mitochondria. After centrifugation, an additional 160 &#x3bc;l of MAS-BSA buffer+substrate was added to the wells. Mitochondria were checked under the microscope to ensure a homogenous mitochondrial monolayer in each well and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 10 min. The plates were further equilibrated for 8 min by two cycles of 1 min mixing and 3 min rest prior to the measurement of basal respiration. Two baseline measurements were obtained prior to any injection, and one response measurement was obtained after each injection followed by additional 30 sec mixing. The final concentration of compounds after injections were as follows: 10 mM pyruvate/malate or succinate, 1 mM ADP, 2 &#x3bc;M oligomycin, 4 &#x3bc;M FCCP, 2 &#x3bc;M rotenone/antimycin A. Each measurement cycle consisted of 30 sec mixing, and 3 min data acquisition except for the measurement after ADP injection which lasted 6 min to observe the transition from State 3 to State 4 due to the depletion of ADP in the microchamber. The additional mixing step after each measurement facilitated the sensor returning to ambient O<sub>2 </sub>concentration. State 3 respiration parameters driven by mitochondrial Complex I substrates (pyruvate/malate) were measured first, while Complex II-driven respiration (succinate) was measured by inhibiting Complex I with rotenone (2 &#x3bc;M). OCR was calculated by the Seahorse XF96 software package.

Primary neurons were isolated from the hippocampi of C57BL/6J mice at embryonic stage 16 (E16), plated onto PDL-coated cover-slips and cultured in complete medium (Neurobasal 1&#xd7;, 2% B27, 2 mM GlutaMAX&#x2122; and 2 &#x3bc;g/ml gentamicin) until DIV8 to allow the development of extensive synaptic networks. The cultures were treated with selected compounds or 0.1% DMSO for 24 hr before measuring spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed using an Axon Multiclamp 700b amplifier, 1440A Digidata digitizer and data acquisition using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, Calif.). The neurons were first recorded in a current clamp mode to monitor cell health. Only neurons with a resting membrane potential of less than &#x2212;40 mV were used for further analysis. sEPSC recordings were made at 50 kHz and subsequently filtered at 5 kHz. The membrane potential was held at &#x2212;70 mV during the recording. The extracellular bath solution for the recordings contained 135 mM NaCl, 10 mM glucose, 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM HEPES, adjusted pH to 7.4 with NaOH, and to 300-315 mOsm with sucrose. Patch-pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass with a micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co.) and filled with intracellular solution containing 100 mM K-gluconate, 1.7 mM KCl, 0.6 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, 4 mM ATP, and 0.1 mM GTP, adjusted pH to 7.2 with NaOH and to 300-315 mOsm with sucrose. Once a neuron was patched, its seal was monitored, and if the transient resistance was less than 100 mOhm, the recording was not used for analysis. All experiments were performed at room temperature. The frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs were analyzed using the template match search (pClamp) and measured as a percentage of baseline level, calculated from the average of a 5 min baseline recording. The values of the amplitude and frequency of EPSCs for each recording was reported as an average from a 5 min recording period.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0121">Live-Dead assay.

Most experiments utilized only Mt-GFP; some utilized both Mt-GFP and Cyto-tdTomato. The Z-projected images were preprocessed using a custom Fiji macro. For preprocessing of Mt-GFP images: background was subtracted (rolling ball, radius=3), images were median filtered (radius=1) and somatic mitochondria were removed. For removal of the somatic mitochondria, they were first segmented and then a somatic mitochondrial mask overlaid on the image. Steps for somatic mitochondria segmentation were: taking square root of the image (equalization of the too bright and too dim somatic mitochondria), minimum filtering (kernel=20) to erode small structures, using gaussian filter (sigma=20) to ensure mitochondria in neurites were downscaled, Otsu thresholding, object filtering (5000-100000 pixel), and binary dilation (15 cycle) of segmented somatic mitochondria. The size or shape of the mitochondria in neurites did not change during this preprocessing. For preprocessing of Cyto-tdTomato images: applying tubeness filter [39] followed by the removal of the soma, using the somatic mitochondrial mask from the green channel.

Count, length, area and circularity were measured for axonal and dendritic mitochondria, area was measured for neurites, and the measurements were aggregated using the median for mitochondrial area, circularity and length and a sum of the area for mitochondria (CA) and neurites.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0126">Aggregated field values were further processed by a custom Python script. Field values containing less than 500 mitochondria were removed, along with outliers, identified by a custom written machine learning algorithm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, left panel), and field values were averaged to well values. Robust Z-scores were calculated using neutral wells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, right panel) for the primary screen, and DMSO treated wells for the rescreen. Outliers were removed from the replicate plate well values and the replicate plates were averaged. Replicate plate wells containing outliers were identified by selecting those where the standard deviations of the replicates' robust Z-scores were larger than 3. In those cases, one value, which was furthest from the mean was removed. In the rescreen, where 10 replicate plates were used instead of 4, this algorithm was run 3 times, allowing the removal of maximum 3 values from the 10 replicates. Finally, hits were selected based on their robust Z-scores. For axonal mitochondrial content hits: axonal mitochondrial CA &#x3e;2.5 &#x26; dendritic mitochondrial CA between &#x2212;2 and 2. For dendritic mitochondrial content hits: CA &#x3e;2.5 &#x26; axonal mitochondrial CA &#x3c;2. For elongation hits: dendritic mitochondrial length median &#x3e;2.5.

This strain was generated in a C57Bl/6J background (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>; referred to as Mt mice). Dissociated cells from the forebrains of P0 pups of Mt mice were mixed with replication deficient AAV9 carrying a CaMKII promoter driven iCre recombinase gene (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>) and plated onto 384-well plates. Employing Cre-dependent, mitochondrial GFP expression offers experimenter control over the number of GFP-labeled mitochondria in each imaging field so they are not too dense nor too sparse. The floxed Mt expression cassette also included a nuclear-localized tagBFP2, which was used for the visualization of the neuronal nuclei. GFP labeled mitochondria (Mt-GFP; mitochondrial GFP) began to appear &#x2dc;DIV8 (8 days in vitro) and by DIV14 the signal was sufficiently strong to be imaged and analyzed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). Compound treatment was performed 24 hr prior to imaging, on DIV13. Correct sub-cellular targeting of the mitochondrial GFP reporter was validated by co-staining the Mt-GFP with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) and MitoTracker Orange (MTO), two well-characterized, cell-permeable fluorescent probes known to label mitochondria (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0130">Mitochondria in neurons are morphologically heterogeneous. In the soma, they form an irregularly shaped interconnected network while in neurites they exist as rod-like structures of various lengths. We focused our efforts on discovering compounds that increase mitochondrial content, promote elongation, or induce healthier, less round mitochondria in the axons and/or dendrites.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0131">We first classified Mt-GFP into three classes: somatic, axonal and dendritic mitochondria. The separation of axonal and dendritic mitochondria was achieved by their length differences. To measure the length differences between axonal and dendritic mitochondria, we used neurons from pups of Mt mice crossed with a ROSA26 knockin for expressing cytoplasmic tdTomato (Cyto-tdTomato, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), which provided a strong signal in the neurites. We then measured the length of &#x2dc;500 mitochondria in axons (axonal mitochondria) and &#x2dc;500 in dendrites (dendritic mitochondria) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). We considered mitochondria to be axonal if located in a process that was thin with a presynaptic bouton and dendritic if located in a thick process populated with dendritic spines. By plotting the frequency distribution of the mitochondrial length values, we found that mitochondria with lengths between 0.5-1.4 &#x3bc;m are predominantly axonal, while mitochondria with lengths longer than 2.4 &#x3bc;m are predominantly dendritic, therefore we excluded the range 1.4-2.4 &#x3bc;m from the analysis of axonal and dendritic mitochondria. This resulted in eliminating 4.5% of axonal mitochondria (0.4-1.4 &#x3bc;m) and 3% of dendritic mitochondria (&#x3e;2.4 &#x3bc;m). To identify somatic mitochondria, we took advantage of their tightly packed, bright and circular shape and analyzed them as one mass. Since extracting individual mitochondrial features from somatic mitochondria was not feasible, we excluded them from further analysis.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0132">We considered the possibility that compounds might increase mitochondrial content by promoting neurite sprouting. This hypothesis envisions that the compounds might increase neurite sprouting with mitochondrial biogenesis being spurred to fill the new neurites with mitochondria. Alternatively, increased biogenesis of mitochondria might drive neurite sprouting to accommodate the additional organelles. It was also possible that compounds might increase the biogenesis-turnover balance without altering neurite sprouting, which would increase the density of the mitochondrial mass in the processes. To distinguish between these possibilities, the Cyto-TdTomato signal was used in our rescreen to probe for altered neurite area.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0133">To collect high quality data with sufficient replication for the screen, we used automated confocal imaging and captured 4 z-stacks in each well across 4 replicate plates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). We then preprocessed and segmented the raw images to identify dendritic and axonal mitochondria and measured their area, length and circularity. The morphological data of the mitochondria of every field were aggregated to a population sum (of individual mitochondrial area) or median (of the population of individual mitochondrial circularity and length) values.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 2: Defining Image-Based Parameters for Mitochondrial Content, Elongation and Health</heading><p id="p-0108" num="0134">There are currently no small molecule probes reported to have a robust beneficial effect on mitostatic processes of primary neurons. As a first step, we selected and tested 23 compounds with reported effects on mitochondrial dynamics in other cell types, attempting to find positive controls for a screen for mitochondrial content, elongation or health in neurons (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>). Unexpectedly, none of the tested compounds had marked effects on the measured morphological features of mitochondria in primary forebrain neurons. In contrast, toxic compounds causing mitochondrial loss, fragmentation and swelling were readily available [16]. We chose to use the uncoupling agent FCCP to perturb mitochondrial function and morphology to help identify and validate the image-based parameters chosen as measures of mitostatic processes. FCCP treatment induced dramatic mitochondrial loss and fragmentation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0135">To quantify the mitochondrial content in the images, we defined the cumulative area of a field (CA) as the sum of the areas occupied by individual mitochondria. FCCP treatment caused a large decrease in the number of dendritic mitochondria and their average area (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, left panel), and a &#x2dc;90% reduction in the average dendritic mitochondrial CA per well (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, right panel). The area distribution pattern for average axonal mitochondria did not change, but the number of mitochondria classified as axonal increased (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, left panel). This resulted in an increase of axonal mitochondrial CA/well upon FCCP treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, right panel). The average sums of the dendritic and axonal mitochondrial CAs upon DMSO or FCCP treatment altogether indicates a neuron-wide mitochondrial loss due to FCCP treatment (CA<sub>Dend+Ax,DMSO</sub>=1292+404=1696 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, CA<sub>Dend+Ax,FCCP</sub>=123+629=754 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>). Although the observed increase in axonal mitochondrial CA (225 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>) due to FCCP treatment probably arises from excessive fragmentation of dendritic mitochondria yielding short objects that become classified as axonal mitochondria, this increase accounts for only &#x2dc;20% of the decrease of the dendritic CA. For this reason, we chose the parameter of dendritic mitochondrial CA &#x3e;2.5 robust Z-scores for identifying compounds that increase mitochondrial content.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0136">To identify compounds that elongate mitochondria we focused on the feature of dendritic length. FCCP treatment of neurons produced shorter dendritic mitochondria (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, left panel). Since individual dendritic mitochondrial length measures did not follow a normal distribution, we chose the median of the population within a field to obtain field values. Moreover, the median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean of the population, thus more reliable for a screen. FCCP treatment produced a significant decrease in the median of dendritic mitochondrial length (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, right panel). Thus, we chose median dendritic mitochondrial length as the measure of elongation and defined hits that increase mitochondrial length as those that increase this parameter by more than 2.5 robust Z-scores.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0137">We did not observe a significant decrease in average axonal mitochondrial area with FCCP treatment, but the axonal mitochondria became more rounded compared to their usual oblong shape. This increase in roundness of the axonal class can be measured by circularity (4&#x3c0;area/perimeter<sup>2</sup>), a measure that correlates well with mito- and neurotoxicity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). The ratio of highly circular mitochondria increased in the axonal mitochondrial population with FCCP treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>, left panel), and this was reflected in the average of axonal circularity median as well (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>, right panel). Highly circular mitochondria are well documented to occur in many pathological conditions [17, 18]. Therefore, we chose a decrease in the median of axonal mitochondrial circularity by &#x3e;2.5 robust Z-score for identifying a third group of compounds&#x2014;enhancers of mitochondrial health. In summary, FCCP treatment of neurons produced marked mitochondrial loss, dendritic mitochondrial fragmentation and more circular axonal mitochondria (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), as also described by others [16]. Given this relationship, we concluded that small molecules that increase mitochondrial content or elongation, and those that decrease circularity, offer a starting point in identifying probes that improve the mitochondrial system in neurons.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0138">We constructed an automated data analysis pipeline for our screen, where the input values were the medians (circularity, length) or sums (CA) of the individual mitochondrial measures of the fields.

Many compounds in the library proved to be neurotoxic, causing mitochondrial loss, fragmentation and increased circularity similar to FCCP treatment. The putative hits were rescreened using 42 DMSO treated wells scattered randomly across the plate for the calculation of robust Z-scores. As expected, the population of wells treated with putative hits yielded mitochondrial features that were shifted from the population of wells treated with DMSO (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D-F</figref>), indicating a significant hit enrichment. Close examination of selected hit compounds on mitochondrial features (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>G-K</figref>) revealed that they had an opposite effect of FCCP treatment as predicted. Elongation hits led to an increased median of dendritic mitochondrial length (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>G</figref> and K). Mitochondrial content enhancers increased the count and area occupied (CA) by dendritic mitochondria (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>H</figref> and K). Health enhancers decreased the number of rounded axonal mitochondria and increased the number of elongated ones, thereby decreasing the median of axonal mitochondrial circularity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>I</figref> and J).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0141">We confirmed 67 of the initial 149 compounds in the rescreen (45%; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>L</figref>) using 10 replicate plates.

Of the confirmed hits, 32 increased elongation, 45 increased mitochondrial content and 33 increased mitochondria health (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>L</figref>). Thirty-five of the compounds altered more than one mitochondrial parameter. Analysis of the compounds based on structural fingerprint similarities revealed that those modulating the three hit categories fell into multiple structural clusters (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), and none of the hit categories enrich structurally similar compounds. This suggests that multiple and diverse mechanisms of action can lead to similar effects on aspects of mitochondrial dynamics. The classification itself revealed 3 primary clusters. Two of the clusters contained compounds that are structurally distinct. Most members from the third cluster are from the flavonoid family (flavones, isoflavones, chalcones), implying common targets.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 4: Mitostasis Processes and Function Dissected with Small Molecule Probes</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0142">To distinguish compounds that increase mitochondrial content with or without neurite sprouting, we measured the total area covered by neurites across the fields imaged for each well in the rescreen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C and <b>4</b>A</figref> left panel). Eleven of the 53 compounds which increased mitochondrial content significantly (&#x3e;2 robust Z-scores) also increased neurite area by more than 2 robust Z-scores (Table 1), although there was no correlation between dendritic mitochondrial CA increase and neurite area across this population (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, right panel). The lack of correlation between these two parameters surprisingly suggests that they are not coupled: mechanisms that increase mitochondrial content are not triggered in response to increased sprouting, nor is increased neurite sprouting triggered by events that enhance mitochondrial content. A complete understanding of how neurons provide a sufficient supply of mitochondria to distal neurites has not been achieved, although biogenesis in the soma and anterograde transport along with de novo synthesis in the neurites offer partial explanations [1, 19].</p><p id="p-0117" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>The effect of MnMs on neurite sprouting.

rescreen data using compounds that modulate neuronal mitostasis along with neutral compounds offered a unique opportunity to explore the relationship between several mitochondrial properties in neurons. Plotting dendritic mitochondrial CA as a function of axonal mitochondrial CA showed that none of the 53 compounds that increased dendritic mitochondrial CA significantly (&#x3e;2 robust Z-scores) increased axonal mitochondrial CA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, Pearson's r=0.22). Given the large number of compounds with effects on dendritic mitochondrial CA, it seems unlikely that this results from the simple failure to find a compound that alters both. Rather, the result is more consistent with the possibility that increases in mitochondrial content can occur solely in dendrites, and/or that axonal mitochondrial content is more tightly regulated and is harder to perturb with small molecules. Nevertheless, compound-induced dendritic mitochondrial content seems to be uncoupled from axonal mitochondrial content. However, we did observe a correlation between dendritic mitochondrial CA and dendritic mitochondrial length as expected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, Pearson's r=0.76). Moreover, dendritic mitochondrial count and dendritic mitochondrial length also correlated positively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, Pearson's r=0.6), indicating that compounds that increase mitochondrial content often do so by increasing both count and length.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0144">In order to explore the possible connection between mitochondrial content and elongation, we collected time-lapse images of primary neurons for 12 hr after treatment with content and elongation hits along with untreated controls. As reported by others [20], we observed fast moving short mitochondria that continuously underwent fusion and fission events or nearly stationary longer mitochondria which did not. However, in neurons treated with compounds, the stationary long mitochondria sometimes fused together by apparent growth towards each other (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>). This observation explains the correlation between dendritic mitochondrial content and elongation. Compounds that increased axonal mitochondrial length did not significantly influence axonal mitochondrial CA or count (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 5: MnMs Alter Mitochondrial Function</heading><p id="p-0120" num="0145">We tested the 149 rescreened compounds for effects on mitochondrial function by measuring two parameters, the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) potential and ATP generation. We used the well characterized rhodamine derivative, TMRM, to measure the IMM potential and a commercial kit for measuring ATP generation. Strikingly, 61 of the 67 confirmed hits (91%) also increased ATP production, TMRM signal or both significantly (&#x3e;2 robust Z-scores), showing that the vast majority of MnMs also increase mitochondrial function (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>). This indicates a tight link between mitochondrial dynamics and function.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0146">Next, we probed the correlation between individual mitochondrial morphological features and function using the rescreened 149 compounds. Interestingly, this revealed only weak correlations between the individual mitochondrial features (area, length, count, CA and circularity) and function, with Pearson correlations (r) ranging from &#x2dc;0.4-0.5. This included the three hit parameters of mitochondrial content, elongation and health: dendritic mitochondrial CA (r<sub>ATP</sub>=0.5, r<sub>TMRM</sub>=0.47), dendritic mitochondrial length (r<sub>ATP</sub>=0.41, r<sub>TMRM</sub>=0.53), and axonal mitochondrial circularity (r<sub>ATP</sub>=&#x2212;0.44, r<sub>TMRM</sub>=&#x2212;0.41). However, plotting the rescreened compounds in three-dimensional space defined by the three hit parameters and separately marking whether they increase function or not revealed that compounds boosting mitochondrial function form a distinct cluster from those that do not (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>G</figref>). This indicates that increased mitochondrial function is generally accompanied by a combination of phenotypic changes that can be described by mitochondrial content, length, and health.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0147">The functional increase of mitochondria induced by 61 different MnMs can occur by 1) an increase in mitochondrial mass present in the neurons (mitochondrial content), 2) no change in mass but an increase in the efficiency of individual mitochondria, and 3) a combination of 1) and 2). To help distinguish between these possibilities, we constructed a four-way Venn diagram of the compounds that increased function, content, health or length (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>). Most of the compounds that increased mitochondrial function (n=61) also increased mitochondrial content (n=49), revealing an expected relationship between increased mitochondrial mass and measured function. However, the screen also identified compounds that only increased ATP production and/or membrane potential change without increasing content (n=12), suggesting an operative increase of output efficiency of the existing mitochondria. All these compounds improved health and/or induced elongation while increasing function. The Venn diagram further supports that all 3 parameters drive functional increases with a similar contribution (number of compounds increasing the hit parameter and function/number of compounds increasing hit parameter): biogenesis 92% (49/53), health 93% (39/42), elongation 90% (45/50).</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 6: Modulators of Mitochondrial Dynamics Protect Mitochondria Against Insults Associated with Neurodegenerative Disorders</heading><p id="p-0123" num="0148">Altered mitochondrial dynamics and function have been identified to be part of the neuropathology found in neuropsychiatric disorders along with increased oxidative stress and glutamate toxicity [5-10].

We observed severe fragmentation of both axonal and dendritic mitochondria with all three treatments, identified by a decrease of axonal mitochondrial area, a decrease in dendritic mitochondrial length, and an increase of axonal mitochondrial circularity. Treatment of neurons with 10 &#x3bc;M A&#x3b2;(1-42) oligomers, 75 &#x3bc;M peroxide or 25 &#x3bc;M glutamate for 48 h produced reproducible and sufficient effect sizes for our assays of mitotoxicity while keeping a significant fraction of neurons alive.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0149">We then treated neuronal cultures with the same three toxic substances, in the absence or in the presence of the 12 most reliable MnMs chosen by effect sizes for mitochondrial function and mitostasis parameters, to determine whether the modulators offered protection against the toxic agents assayed 48 hr later.

The compounds exhibited different protective power against the three insults, suggestive of different mechanism of action (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). Rhamnetin, 4&#x2032;-hydroxychalcone and 2&#x2032;,4&#x2032;-dihydroxychalcone conferred complete protection from A&#x3b2;(1-42) induced mitochondrial fragmentation. The nine other compounds provided only partial protection, failing to protect against the decreased area of individual axonal mitochondria caused by the toxic peptide. As a control, we treated the cultures with the less-toxic peptide, oligomeric A&#x3b2;(1-40). This oligomeric peptide failed to cause mitochondrial fragmentation under the conditions used.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0151">Mitochondrial fragmentation caused by treatment with peroxide (PO) was fully protected by 6 compounds: 4&#x2032;-hydroxychalcone, orphenadrine, alverine, naftopidil, rhamnetin and dyclonine; and partially protected by 4 others. Glutamate (GLUT) induced mitochondrial fragmentation was fully protected by one compound, alverine. We also measured the live:dead cell ratio in the presence of toxic concentrations of glutamate and the selected MnMs and found that alverine, along with 4&#x2032;-hydroxychalcone and 2&#x2032;,4&#x2032;-dihydroxychalcone, offered protection. In summary, 7 of the MnMs offered complete protection against A&#x3b2;(1-42) oligomer, peroxide or glutamate induced mitochondrial fragmentation in addition to their robust and reliable improvement of mitostatic processes using wild type neurons (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 7: Dyclonine Enhances Mitochondrial Function Directly, Potentiates Basal Synaptic Activity, and Increases the Respiration of Brain Mitochondria in Treated Mice</heading><p id="p-0128" num="0152">To determine whether select compounds alter mitochondrial function directly, isolated forebrain mitochondria of P0 mouse pups were treated with the compounds and ATP production was measured using a luciferase-based kinetic assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, B).

After 24 hr of treatment with the latter compounds, ATP production in neurons showed no significant change (with the 2 chalcones) or increase (rhamnetin, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>), suggesting that the direct inhibition of ATP production by mitochondria may have been normalized via longer-term compensatory mechanisms.

We measured the absolute oxygen consumption rate at baseline and in response to excess ADP/substrate (State3/3u) as normalized to protein content in primary neurons exposed to dyclonine for 24 hr. We observed a significant increase of State 3 and 3u respiration stimulated by either Complex I or Complex II substrates in mitochondria from the treated cultured neurons (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>, F). A similar respiratory rate increase was observed in mitochondria isolated from the whole brains of mice treated chronically for 7 months with dyclonine laced into their water supply (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>G</figref>, H).

Plates were covered with Breathe-Easy&#xae; sealing membrane (Sigma-Aldrich) to minimize uneven evaporation across each plate in the extended cultures and to permit gas exchange and limit cross-contamination.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0156">Mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x394;&#x3c8;<sub>m</sub>) and luminescence-based ATP assays. The assay to measure &#x394;&#x3c8;<sub>m </sub>was performed using the general procedures described in Perry et al. (2011). Changes of &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>in each well were monitored using the mitochondrial-specific, fluorescent dye TMRM (tetramethyl rhodamine, methyl ester; Molecular Probes) and measured using a CLARIOstar plate reader. Our assay development experiments established that 10 nM TMRM provided a non-quenching concentration and a linear assay. This concentration was used throughout our experiments. Compounds known to decrease &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>such as FCCP decreased TMRM fluorescence at 4 h or 24 h incubation, and were classed as toxic compounds from the screen, while those that increased &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>as shown with increased TMRM fluorescence were identified as potential hits. Neurons cultured to DIV13 in 384-well plates were loaded with 10 nM TMRM for 90 m before pin-tooling 100 nl compounds (final concentration, 12.5 &#x3bc;M). After 4 or 24 h of incubation, the wells were quickly washed twice with pre-warmed Neurobasal medium to remove free TMRM and the intracellular fluorescence measured by the plate reader (excitation 535&#xb1;15 nm, emission 590&#xb1;25 nm). Wells in columns 1 and 24 were not loaded with TMRM; these served to measure background signal which was subtracted from the wells to which TMRM was added. To measure the total ATP levels in neurons we utilized the CellTiter-Glo&#xae; luminescence-based ATP assay (Promega). DIV13 primary neurons were cultured for 24 h with either DMSO carrier or compound treatment, followed by removing 55 &#x3bc;l culture medium from each well. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 25 m, and 25 &#x3bc;l of CellTiter-Glo&#xae; Reagent with the substrate luciferin was then added to each well (Promega). Plates were covered with aluminum foil and shaken vigorously on an orbital shaker for 10 m at 200 rpm and maintained at room temperature for an additional 2 m in dark before being read with the plate reader set to the luminescence mode. Dose response experiments were performed by pre-diluting the compounds and pintooling such that DMSO concentration was always kept constant (0.125%).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0157">Compound library and hit picking rules. We screened 2400 compounds from the MicroSource Spectrum library. This library includes 1600 compounds from the US and International Drug Collections, compounds that have shown biological potential in peer-reviewed publications but have not been developed as drugs, and some nature products derived from commercial sources. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>E</figref> provide details of the assays used from which hit picking rules were made. In essence, the average fluorescence for each compound in the TMRM assay was determined and compared to the average fluorescence for compounds in the population on each assay plate to produce a Z-score. The Z-scores for each individual compound assayed across the four replicate plates was then averaged. Because of significant well location effects (outer rows) on each assay plate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>G</figref>), we selected primary hits as enhancing well fluorescence above the &#x3bc;<sub>plate </sub>by 3&#x3c3;<sub>plate </sub>for inner row wells (rows C-N, columns 3-22), and by 2.5&#x3c3;<sub>plate </sub>for outer row wells (rows A, B, O, P; columns 3-22) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C-D</figref>). Hits for the orthogonal ATP assay were selected in a similar way as elevating ATP levels by &#x3e;3 Z-scores compared to within-plate DMSO controls (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>F</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>P</figref>). All orthogonal assays employed inner wells of the 384-well plates.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0158">Structural clustering. Morgan fingerprints of the rescreened hits were calculated using RDKit. A distance matrix using the dice similarities of the fingerprints was created, and clustering was performed by WPGMA (Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean).</p><p id="p-0135" num="0159">Mitochondrial morphology and neurite area measurements. Mitochondrial morphology and neurite area were quantified using methods described by Varkuti et al, 2020. Briefly, Cre-dependent mitochondrial targeted GFP2 (mito-GFP) ROSA26 knock-in mice were crossed with Ai14 (007908, The Jackson Laboratory) expressing cytosolic-tdTomato, and the forebrain of P0 pups were isolated and primary neurons were cultured as described above. AAV9 virus containing the iCRE sequence driven by the neuron specific CaMKII promoter was added to the cell culture at plating and 75% of the media replaced 4 h after plating. Imaging was performed 24 (DIV14) and 48 h (DIV15) after compound addition (GE IN Cell Analyzer 6000, 60&#xd7; objective, 0.95 NA) in confocal mode for mito-GFP (green channel: 3 slices, &#x394;z=0.7 aperture=1.0 AU, &#x3bb;<sub>exc</sub>=488 nm, &#x3bb;<sub>em</sub>=515-535 nm) and widefield mode for cytosolic-tdTomato (red channel: &#x3bb;<sub>exc</sub>=561 nm, &#x3bb;<sub>em</sub>=569-641 nm). Z-projected images of the green channel were preprocessed (background subtraction: rolling ball, radius=3; median filtering: radius=1) and somatic mitochondria were removed (see details in Varkuti et al, Science Advances 6 (2020) eaaw8702). Red channel images were also preprocessed (tubeness filter, soma removal). Preprocessed images were segmented by GE Developer software (object-based, kernel size: 3). Segmented objects of the green channel were classified as axonal (length: 0.5&#x3c;Mt<sub>axon</sub>&#x3c;=1.4 inn, intensity: &#x3e;5000, area: &#x3e;0.25 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, circularity: &#x3e;0.6) or dendritic (length: &#x3e;=2.4 inn, intensity: &#x3e;5000) mitochondria, while those of the red channel were identified as neurites (intensity &#x3e;5000, circularity &#x3c;0.5). The length and circularity measurements for mitochondria were aggregated using the median and the area for neurites using the sum. After removing empty fields and outlier values from the fields, aggregated field values were averaged to well values (4 fields/well, 12 wells/compound). Robust Z-scores were calculated using DMSO-treated wells for each well ((median<sub>compound</sub>&#x2212;median<sub>DMSO</sub>)/median absolute deviation<sub>DMSO</sub>), well values were averaged for each compound.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0160">Isolation of brain mitochondria. C57BL/6J mice were randomly selected and grouped to receive either compound (5 mg/kg yohimbine)-supplemented or standard water for 7 months starting at 2 mo of age. The water supply was refreshed weekly. Mitochondria harvested from 2 brains per group were isolated in parallel by differential centrifugation as described by Sims and Anderson (2008), method &#x201c;A&#x201d; with some modifications. Briefly, the fresh brain tissue used for respiration experiments was minced and homogenized in a 40 ml Dounce homogenizer with cold isolation buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EGTA, 110 g/L glucose, pH 7.4). All subsequent procedures were performed on ice. The supernatant from two consecutive 5 m centrifugations at 1,300&#xd7;g were combined and spun for 10 m at 21,000&#xd7;g. The harvested pellet was resuspended in 15% Percoll and layered above a 23% over 40% Percoll gradient. The gradient was centrifuged at 30,700&#xd7;g for 15 m, and the mitochondrial fraction (a band at the 23%/40% Percoll interface) was aspirated. Mitochondria were washed and pelleted at 16,900&#xd7;g for 10 m, and the loose pellet was precipitated by adding BSA and centrifuging at 6,700&#xd7;g for 10 m. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in cold MAS-mitochondrial buffer without BSA (70 mM sucrose, 220 mM mannitol, 10 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM HEPES and 1 mM EGTA, pH=7.2 adjusted using KOH) and the yield of mitochondrial protein was determined by BCA assay.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0161">Measurement of mitochondrial O<sub>2 </sub>consumption. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) or extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) measurements from permeabilized neurons and isolated brain mitochondria were performed using the XF96 Extracellular Flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). For assays using cultured neurons, primary neurons were dissociated from the forebrains of P0 pups, seeded at 1.9&#xd7;10<sup>4</sup>/well (PDL-coated XF96 plate), cultured to DIV13 and incubated with selected compounds or DMSO (0.1%) for 24 h. Prior to the start of the OCR measurement, all but 30 &#x3bc;l of Neurobasal A/B27 culture medium was removed from each well. Cells were washed twice with pre-warmed MAS-BSA assay medium (70 mM sucrose, 220 mM mannitol, 10 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM HEPES and 1 mM EGTA, 4 mg/ml fatty-acid free BSA, pH=7.2 adjusted using KOH) and incubated in 180 ul MAS-BSA medium at 37&#xb0; C. in a CO<sub>2</sub>-free incubator for 5 m. Following the cartridge calibration, cells were loaded into the XF96 Extracellular Flux analyzer and further equilibrated for 10 m with two cycles of 3 m mixing and 2 m rest prior to the first measurement of basal respiration. OCR and ECAR were measured at 37&#xb0; C. under basal conditions followed by the sequential injection of pre-warmed 10&#xd7; mitochondrial substrates/ADP (20 &#x3bc;l), oligomycin (22 &#x3bc;l), FCCP (24 &#x3bc;l), and rotenone/antimycin A (26 &#x3bc;l). The final concentrations of injected compounds were as follows: 10 mM mitochondrial substrates (pyruvate/malate or succinate), 1 mM ADP, 1.5 &#x3bc;M oligomycin, 3 &#x3bc;M FCCP, 2 &#x3bc;M rotenone/antimycin A. Saponin (25 &#x3bc;g/ml) was co-injected with substrate/ADP to permeabilize the cells and stimulate ADP-dependent respiration. Two baseline measurements were obtained prior to any injection and 2 response measurements were collected after each injection except for after FCCP addition which consisted of 1 measurement (9 total measurements in each assay). Each measurement cycle consists of 2 m mixing, 2 m waiting, and 3 m data acquisition. This protocol allowed for sequential assessment of basal cell respiration, maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity (State 3 with substrate/ADP), proton leak (State 4<sub>o </sub>with oligomycin), uncoupled maximal respiration (State 3<sub>U </sub>with FCCP) and non-mitochondrial respiration with the Complex I/Complex III inhibitors, rotenone/antimycin A. Cells were washed twice with MAS buffer to remove residue BSA contained in the assay medium, lysed in 50 &#x3bc;l lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, 1&#xd7; protease and phosphatase inhibitor, pH 7.0 adjusted with NaOH) and total protein was determined by BCA assay with a BSA standard curve. Oxygen consumption was normalized to total protein content as pmol O<sub>2</sub>/min/ug total protein.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0162">To assay mitochondrial respiration in mice receiving chronic treatment of selected compounds, brain mitochondria were isolated in parallel from C57BL/6J mice receiving water supplemented with or without 25 mg/kg dyclonine or 5 mg/kg yohimbine. The isolated mitochondria were resuspended in MAS buffer without BSA to determine the yield of mitochondrial protein and subsequently further diluted in cold MAS-BSA buffer+substrate (P/M or Succ) to 3 &#x3bc;g/20 ul. This mitochondrial suspension was plated onto PDL-coated 96-well assay plates at 20 &#x3bc;l/well, except for the wells in the four corners which were used for background correction. Substrate was initially included and maintained from this step on to help maintain a healthy state of mitochondria. The plate was centrifuged at 2000&#xd7;g for 20 m at 4&#xb0; C. to attach the mitochondria to the XF96 microplates. After centrifugation, 160 &#x3bc;l of MAS-BSA buffer+substrate was added to each well. The mitochondria were checked briefly under the microscope to ensure that the mitochondrial monolayer in each well was homogenous, and then cultured at 37&#xb0; C. in a CO<sub>2</sub>-free incubator for 10 m. The plates were loaded into the XF96 Extracellular Flux analyzer and further equilibrated for 8 m by two cycles of 1 m mixing and 3 m rest prior to the measurement of basal respiration. Two baseline measurements were obtained prior to any injection, and one response measurement was obtained after each injection followed by additional 30 s mixing. The final concentration of compounds after injections were as follows: 10 mM pyruvate/malate or succinate, 1 mM ADP, 2 &#x3bc;M oligomycin, 4 &#x3bc;M FCCP, 2 &#x3bc;M rotenone/antimycin A. Each measurement cycle consisted of 30 s mixing, and 3 m data acquisition except for the measurement after ADP injection which lasted 6 m. The extension in time for this measurement beyond 3 m was included to observe the transition from State 3 to State 4 due to the depletion of ADP in the microchamber. The additional mixing step after each measurement, though optional, facilitated the sensor returning to ambient 02 concentration. State 3 respiration parameters driven by mitochondrial Complex I substrates (pyruvate/malate) were measured first, while Complex II-driven respiration (succinate) was measured by inhibiting Complex I with rotenone (2 &#x3bc;M).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0163">XF oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was calculated by Seahorse XF96 software package and the algorithm fully described in A.

significantly enhanced TMRM fluorescence and ATP production compared to non-hit compounds or DMSO-treated controls (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>F</figref>). Only 2 of the 16 (13%) compounds that elevated TMRM fluorescence at 4 h increased ATP levels. To probe the relationship between TMRM signal and ATP production, we compared the correlation coefficient between the TMRM fluorescence of all rescreened compounds and ATP production at 4 and 24 h. We found a very weak correlation between these two parameters for 4 h of incubation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.16, P&#x3c;0.0001, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>Q</figref>) and a modest correlation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.46, P&#x3c;0.0001, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>F</figref>) for 24 h, indicating a general trend between the measured whole-well TMRM signal and higher energetics of the neuronal population. We focused our subsequent studies on hits selected after a 24 hr incubation with neurons given the stronger relationship between TMRM fluorescence and ATP generation. Using this incubation time, the results indicate that increased A &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>is a good, inexpensive surrogate for detecting elevated levels of ATP within neurons.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Example 9: Structural and Functional Diversity and Potency of Modulators of Mitochondrial Function</heading><p id="p-0147" num="0170">Many of the confirmed 24 h TMRM/ATP hits were structurally related and so they were grouped using hierarchical clustering and Tanimoto similarities into several clusters (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>). We also discovered that some of the structural clusters contain compounds with a similar therapeutic use (Table 4). Surprisingly, 9 of the hit compounds are topical/local anesthetics (primarily in Cluster 3, orange shading in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>) that increase neuronal mitochondrial &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>and elevate ATP. Due to this novel finding, we included representatives from this group in subsequent experiments (lidocaine, benoxinate, dyclonine). Although only two isoflavone compounds were identified (Cluster 4, green), genistein was reported (Ding et al., <i>Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. </i>108 (2011) 333-340) to increase &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>in primary cortical neurons treated with A&#x3b2; peptide. Therefore, we employed genistein in latter experiments as a putative positive control compound. Cluster 4 also contains many steroid hormone receptor modulators and two COX inhibitors (grey). Estrogen derivatives were previously shown to contain neuro- and mitochondria-protective activity (Mortibouys et al, <i>Brain. </i>136 (2013) 3038-3050; Sherman et al., <i>Dis Model Mech. </i>11(2) dmm031906 (2018); Grimm et al., 2014, Irwin et al., 2008; Nilsen et at, 2007), but the mitochondrial effect of COX inhibitors was unexpected. Thus, we chose celecoxib for further characterization. Cluster 5 is comprised of three indole alkaloids which have alpha-blocker activity (brown). One of them, yohimbine was previously found to be neuroprotective by inducing the NRF2-mediated antioxidant response (WO2012149478A3). Therefore, we included yohimbine in follow-up experiments as a potential positive control and to explore this activity further. Cluster 6 contains a collection of structurally similar alpha/beta blockers for the treatment of high blood pressure and heart diseases (anti-adrenergics, brown), from which we chose carvedilol and naftopidil for further tests. We also highlight the interesting identification of several antipsychotics and classic tricyclic antidepressants (pink), anti-cholinergics (purple) and anti-dopaminergic/anti-serotoninergic compounds (yellow) in clusters 7 and 8, whose unanticipated functional modulation of mitochondria made them intriguing compounds for additional experiments (Table 4).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00006" num="00006"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="399pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 4</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Represents the maximal percent increase of TMRM fluorescence or ATP production relative to in-plate DMSO</entry></row><row><entry>controls from dose response experiments.

<b>15</b></figref>; Table 4) of selected compounds revealed that the EC<sub>50</sub>'s for TMRM fluorescence and/or ATP enhancement were generally between 0.1-5 &#x3bc;M. Effect sizes were measured between 15-30%. Nearly all compounds, apart from yohimbine, exhibited inverted-U shaped responses suggesting mitochondrial toxicity at high concentrations. Neurons are highly sensitive cells and most compounds have detrimental effects at high concentrations.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 10: Mitochondrial Functional Modulators Potentiate Respiration</heading><p id="p-0150" num="0172">The purpose of this example is to demonstrate that the compounds identified by the present disclosure increase mitochondrial respiration. We selected yohimbine (indole alkaloid) and doxepin (tricyclic antidepressant) for the necessary and more complex, absolute oxygen consumption rate (OCR) experiments. OCR at baseline and in response to excess ADP/substrate (State3/3u) were measured and normalized to protein content (Salabei et al., 2014; Sims and Anderson, 2008) using primary neurons presented with compounds for 24 h.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0173">Primary neurons exposed to yohimbine or doxepin showed a weak, non-significant, but consistent trend towards an increased basal rate of respiration, potentially due to a modest increase in mitochondrial function and/or content (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>B</figref>&#x2032;). More importantly, we observed a significant increase of State 3 and 3u respiration stimulated by either Complex I or Complex II substrates in mitochondria from cultured neurons treated with yohimbine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>B</figref>&#x2032;), and a significant increase with Complex I substrates for doxepin.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0174">We also took advantage of the water solubility of yohimbine to administer this compound to mice in drinking water across a period of 7 months. A similar respiratory increase was observed in mitochondria isolated from the whole brains of animals chronically treated with yohimbine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>C and <b>18</b>D</figref>). We calculated the Respiratory Control Ratios (RCR, State 3/4<sub>o</sub>) to provide a broad index of mitochondrial function (Brand and Nicholls, 2011; Rogers et al., 2011). State 3 respiration measures the maximal ability of mitochondria for substrate oxidation and ATP generation. State with OCR measured in response to oligomycin challenge, measures proton leak. The ratio between these states is influenced by most functions of OXPHOS, thus providing a net measure of the tightness between respiration and phosphorylation. Yohimbine treatment significantly increased RCR with both Complex I and II substrates with both mitochondria from cultured neurons and isolated brain mitochondria. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A</figref>&#x2032;, <b>18</b>B&#x2032;, <b>18</b>C&#x2032;, and <b>18</b>D&#x2032;). Doxepin weakly increased RCR using Complex I but not II substrates in cultured neurons (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A</figref>&#x2032;-<b>18</b>B&#x2032;). Collectively, the enhanced State 3 respiration and RCR with yohimbine and the weaker effects of doxepin indicate more efficient substrate oxidation, electron transport, coupling to OXPHOS and a lower proton leak, indicating a higher respiration capacity and efficiency in the treated mitochondria. Moreover, we previously reported that the anesthetic dyclonine produces beneficial effects in similar cell culture and in vivo experiments (Varkuti et al., 2020).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0175">Thus, representative compounds from three classes of functional mitochondrial modulators&#x2014;indole alkaloids, tricyclic antidepressants, and local/topical anesthetics&#x2014;all enhance neuronal mitochondrial function. These modulators may act directly on mitochondria or indirectly by stimulating cell signaling pathways that influence mitochondrial function (Sherman and Bang, 2018; Tsvetkov et al., 2010). However, the functional changes on mitochondria instilled by the tested compounds must be enduring, and become independent of cytoplasmic signaling pathways, since increased function persists in permeabilized neurons and in mitochondria purified from cells.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 11: Modulators of Neuronal Mitochondrial Function Alter Mitochondrial Morphology</heading><p id="p-0154" num="0176">The purpose of this example is to demonstrate that enhanced mitochondrial function is associated with mitochondrial morphological changes. A high-content assay was developed in parallel to monitor aspects of mitochondrial dynamics in primary cultured neurons that conditionally express (Cre recombinase dependent) mitochondrial-tagged GFP and cytosolic tdTomato reporters (Varkuti et al., 2020). We monitored two aspects of neuritic mitochondrial dynamics: (1) the health of mitochondria as measured by the average circularity of axonal mitochondria, since defective mitochondria targeted for mitophagy become circular in shape, and (2) the balance between fission/fusion measured by the average length of dendritic mitochondria. We also determined whether the compounds induced neurite sprouting by measuring the total area of neurites within the collected images. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> illustrates the results of surveying a collection of functional modulators selected from 5 different structural clusters (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>), quantified as robust z-scores relative to DMSO-treated control neurons.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0177">All tested compounds showed a trend towards promoting more oblong mitochondria after 24 h and they exhibited significant potency (Z-score &#x3c;&#x2212;2.0) compared to the control after 48 h of treatment. Notably, the identified mitochondrial OCR enhancers yohimbine, dyclonine and doxepin exhibited robust effects. These results provide evidence that the functional modulators promote healthier mitochondria using the morphological surrogate of circularity.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0178">The tested compounds also promoted the lengthening of dendritic mitochondria to Z-scores 2.0 after 48 h of treatment. This observation is consistent with a report that mitochondrial fusion and fragmentation are associated with higher and lower &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>values, respectively, in neuroblasts and stable cell lines (Sherman et al., 2018; Voccoli and Colombaioni, 2009). Yohimbine, dyclonine, pimozide and penfluridol were also observed to increase neuritic area after 48 h of treatment.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 12: Neuronal Mitochondrial Modulators Provide Protection Against Insults Associated with Neurodegenerative Disorders</heading><p id="p-0157" num="0179">Given the strong relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and brain disorders, we tested a group of functional mitochondrial modulators for their potential to protect against two neurodegeneration-associated insults: neurons subjected to increased oxidative stress and those expressing Alzheimer's-causing gene variants (neurons from 3&#xd7;TG mice). Adding tert-butyl hydroperoxide to the cultures to increase oxidative stress severely reduced TMRM fluorescence at concentrations above 50 &#x3bc;M and led to complete cell death at concentrations &#x3e;100 &#x3bc;M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>). Eight of the 10 tested compounds provided protection to the &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>from the toxic effects of increased oxidative stress (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-<b>20</b>A</figref>&#x2033;). Primary neurons isolated and cultured from 3&#xd7;TG mice to DIV23 exhibited a &#x2dc;20% reduction in TMRM fluorescence normalized to protein content per well when compared to C57Bl/6J neurons (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>B-<b>20</b>B</figref>&#x2033;). All compounds tested significantly increased &#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m </sub>in the presence of the insult to the level observed for control B6 neurons (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>&#x2033;). Remarkably, many of the tested compounds protect against both insults, including yohimbine, genistein, dyclonine, benoxinate, lidocaine, phenyl-4-amino salicylate, pimozide and doxepin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A</figref>&#x2033; and <b>20</b>B&#x2033;).</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Example 13: In Vivo Efficacy of Identified Drugs on Neuronal Mitochondria in Alzheimer's Disease Model</heading><p id="p-0158" num="0180">The purpose of this example is to demonstrate that drugs (MnMs) identified in the screens described herein (e.g., Examples 1-3) exhibited in vivo efficacy in protecting the mitochondrial population in neurons in models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0181">To assay representative compounds in this example, we employed a <i>Drosophila </i>model for AD (X. Wang et al., <i>Mol. Neurobiol</i>. (2020) https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-020-02107-w). The model employs the expression of the toxic peptide&#x2014;&#x3b2;42, which is a dominant toxic protein responsible for genetic forms of Alzheimer's disease&#x2014;in a subset of brain neurons that mediate learning and memory ability (mushroom body neurons). Flies expressing this toxic protein show: (1) small (3-dimensional volume, 3-dimensional surface area, length), rounded (sphericity), and more numerous neuronal mitochondria, (2) dysfunction of mitochondria (calcium import), (3) amyloid plaque formation, (4) increased cell death (apoptosis), and a learning impairment compared to control flies (Wang et al., 2020). Drugs that show efficacy therefore: enlarge neuronal mitochondria (increased volume, increased surface area, increased length), reduce sphericity, and reduce the number of mitochondria compared to untreated Alzheimer's flies.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0182">The AD model flies were collected immediately after eclosion from the pupal case and transferred to food that was laced with drug at 100 micromolar concentration. The flies were aged to 15 days-of-age: this is when the mitochondrial pathology is very robust.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0183">We compared the morphology of mitochondria collected from these flies treated with drug and compared them to the mitochondria of flies that remained untreated. In some cases, the mitochondria were compared in the cell bodies of the neurons; in other cases we compared the mitochondria in the axons of neurons (Tables 5 and 6).</p><p id="p-0162" num="0184">Representative drugs, as identified in the screens, were rhamnetin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>), orphenadrine, penfluridol, carvedilol, pimozide, genistein, phenyl-4 amino salicylate, 4-hydroxychalcone, yohimbine, alverine, and naftopidil. The mitochondrial morphological data show that the drugs exhibit some or all of the desired protective properties in cell bodies of neurons (Table 5) and in axons of neurons (Table 6). Each table shows the probability that the parameter compared between untreated and treated Alzheimer's flies differs solely on the basis of chance. A probability of p&#x3c;0.05 indicates that there exists a significant difference between the mitochondria of treated and untreated AD flies.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00007"
