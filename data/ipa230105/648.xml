Valvular insufficiency or regurgitation occurs when a valve in a heart of a subject does not close completely, allowing blood to flow backwards (e.g., from the left ventricle to the left atrium), which may adversely impact the functionality of the heart. In some cases, valvular stenosis can cause the valve to become narrowed and hardened, which may prevent the valve from opening fully, thereby reducing blood flow through the valve. This reduced blood flow may cause the heart to work harder to pump blood through the diseased valve.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Heart valve prostheses have been developed for repair and replacement of diseased and/or damaged heart valves. Some heart valve prostheses can be percutaneously delivered and deployed at the site of the diseased heart valve through a medical delivery system such as a catheter. An example of such a medical procedure is the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure. In some cases, a heart valve prostheses includes an expandable stent to which tissue defining valves are mounted. The heart valve prostheses can be delivered while the stent is in a low-profile or collapsed configuration so that the stent is in a low-profile state for advancement through the patient's vasculature. Once positioned at the target treatment site, the stent can be expanded to engage native tissue at a target treatment site and position the heart valve prostheses at the target treatment site.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some aspects, this disclosure describes example medical assemblies that include a medical stent including one or more electrodes carried by the stent and electrically coupled to an energy source via one or more electrical conductors. The stent is configured to be implanted in cardiovasculature of a patient and can be, for example, part of a heart valve prostheses or a stent configured to be implanted in a blood vessel of a patient to help improve patency of the vessel. The energy source may be configured to deliver an electrical signal between the electrode carried by the stent and a second electrode through a fluid in contact with the electrode of the stent to cause the fluid to undergo cavitation to generate a pressure pulse wave within the fluid.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The cavitation of the fluid may be used treat a condition in a heart of a patient or in the vasculature of a patient. For example, the cavitation may produce a high-energy pressure pulse wave that, when directed at a valvular stenosis, may be used to disrupt and fracture calcification partially or fully causing the valvular stenosis. The disruption and fracture of the calcification may allow a heart valve prosthesis (also referred to herein as an artificial heart valve or a prosthetic heart valve) to be more easily and/or fully expanded in place in the heart. In examples in which the cavitation is used to disrupt and fracture calcification in a blood vessel of a patient, the disruption and fracture of the calcification may allow a stent to easily and/or fully expanded in the vessel, e.g., to achieve better patency of the vessel and achieve better blood flow through the vessel. In some other aspects, the disclosure describes methods of delivering and using the medical stents described herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Clause 1: In one example, a medical assembly includes

The stents are configured to be implanted in cardiovasculature (e.g., in vasculature or a heart) of a patient and can be, for example, part of a heart valve prosthesis or a stent configured to be implanted in a blood vessel of a patient to help improve patency of the vessel. As a point of reference, in the context of at least heart valve prostheses, the term &#x201c;frame&#x201d; is interchangeable with the term &#x201c;stent&#x201d;; the frame of a heart valve prosthesis serves as the &#x201c;stent&#x201d; of the present disclosure. The stents may be configured to expand from a collapsed configuration to an expanded configuration. The stents may each include one or more electrodes carried by the stent and configured to deliver an electrical signal to a fluid contained within the heart or vasculature of the patient (e.g., blood) or delivered to the heart or vasculature of the patient by the stent (e.g., saline). The energy transmitted to the fluid may rapidly heat the fluid to produce a short-lived gaseous steam/plasma bubble within the fluid that quickly collapses (e.g., cavitates), releasing energy in the form of a pressure pulse wave. The pulse wave may be used to treat a defect in the heart or vasculature of the patient at a target treatment site.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some examples, the target treatment site may be a site within the heart or vasculature that has a defect that may be affecting blood flow. For example, the target treatment site may be a portion of a heart valve, such as an aortic valve or mitral valve, that includes a calcified lesion, e.g., calcified plaque buildup on or within the valve. The calcium buildup may occur with age as the heart valves accumulate deposits of calcium which is a mineral found the blood. As blood repeatedly flows over the affected valve, deposits of calcium can build up on or within the leaflets or cusps of the valve, resulting in a stiffening (e.g., reduced pliability) of the leaflets. This stiffening narrows the valve, creating a stenosis that can result in adverse physiological effects to the patient.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Calcified lesions in the cardiovasculature may be very hard (e.g., relative to a native valve or blood vessel) and difficult to treat using traditional methods, such as balloon angioplasty, stenting, thrombectomy, atherectomy, valvuloplasty, or other interventional procedures. Even with the introduction of a heart valve prosthesis, the calcification of the heart valve may create a hinderance to alleviating the stenosis and returning the heart valve to normal flow parameters. For example, the calcification may reduce the elasticity of the native heart valve, which may interfere with the ability of a prosthetic heart valve that is implanted proximate to or within an annulus of the native heart valve to expand a desirable amount and define a desired flow diameter.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some examples, a cavitation procedure cavitation procedure using the stents and medical assemblies described herein may be performed in the fluid adjacent to the calcified lesion to produce pressure pulse waves within the fluid. The pressure pulse waves resulting from the may impact a calcified lesion (or other defect) at a target treatment site to fracture or disrupt at least part of the lesion. Following the cavitation, the tissue at the target treatment site (e.g., heart valve or blood vessel) may be easily expanded with the described stents or other suitable device, allowing the treatment site to be expanded to a larger flow diameter. In examples in which the stent is used to treat calcification on the leaflets of a heart valve, post-cavitation, the calcified leaflets may become more elastic, allowing for easier manipulation when deploying the stent. In addition, the more elastic native leaflets may better enable the stent of the prosthetic heart valve to expand more fully in place proximate to or within an annulus of the native heart valve, which may help prevent valvular leakage in the future.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Delivering the cavitation treatment via a stent may provide one or more advantages. For example, in some examples in which the stent forms part of a heart valve prosthesis, the heart valve prosthesis can be deployed across a native heart valve of a patient immediately after delivery of the cavitation, e.g., without an additional medical procedure using a separate medical device. The deployment of the heart valve prosthesis immediately following the cavitation procedure may help improve treatment efficacy and potential patient outcomes. Additionally, or alternatively, using the catheters described herein to perform the cavitation procedure may reduce or eliminate the need for additional devices or electrical components to be inserted or implanted within the body of the patient to complete the described procedures.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views of an example human heart <b>10</b>. The human heart <b>10</b> is a four chambered, muscular organ that provides blood circulation through the body during a cardiac cycle. The four main chambers include the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) which supplies the pulmonary circulation, and the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV) which supplies oxygenated blood received from the lungs to the remaining body. To ensure that blood flows in one direction through the heart, atrioventricular valves (tricuspid valve (TV) and mitral valves (MV)) are present between the junctions of the atrium and the ventricles, and semi-lunar valves (pulmonary valve (PV) and aortic valve (AV)) govern the exits of the ventricles leading to the lungs and the rest of the body. These valves contain leaflets (LF) or cusps that open and shut in response to blood pressure changes caused by the contraction and relaxation of the heart chambers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a schematic sectional illustration of a left ventricle LV of heart <b>10</b> showing anatomical structures and a native mitral valve MV.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The left atrium LA receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins and pumps the oxygenated blood through the mitral valve MV and into the left ventricle LV during ventricular diastole. The left ventricle LV contracts during systole and blood flows outwardly through the aortic valve AV, into the aorta and to the remainder of the body. In a healthy heart, the leaflets LF of the native mitral valve MV meet evenly at the free edges or &#x201c;coapt&#x201d; to close and prevent back flow of blood into the left atrium LA during contraction of the left ventricle LV. The tissue of the leaflets LF attach to the surrounding heart structure via a dense fibrous ring of connective tissue called an annulus AN. The flexible tissue of the leaflets LF of the native mitral valve MV are connected to papillary muscles PM, which extend upwardly from the lower wall of the left ventricle LV and the interventricular septum IVS, via branching tendons called chordae tendinae CT. In a heart <b>10</b> having a calcified plaque buildup, the leaflets LF of the valves (e.g., aortic valve AV or mitral valve MV) may harden and may not sufficiently coapt or meet, such that regurgitation may occur where the valve does not close completely, allowing blood to flow backwards (e.g., from the left ventricle LV to the left atrium LA). The left side of heart <b>10</b> (e.g., mitral valve MV and aortic valve AV) can be more likely to become calcified because of the higher pressures generated. The introduction of a heart valve prosthesis may address some of the inefficiencies of the leaflets LF but may have little or not effect on reducing the calcified buildup or alleviating the stenosis caused by the buildup.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The medical assemblies described herein may be used to treat such calcified plaque buildup on or within a heart valve by cavitating the fluid in the vessel or portion of the heart to generate pulse waves within the fluid to mechanically fracture or dislodge the calcifications. Once fractured or dislodged, the targeted treatment site may be more easily expanded to a normal flow diameter or function.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some examples, the delivery catheters and methods are presented for the treatment of such heart valves as part of a procedure for minimally invasive implantation of a stent such as a stent that forms part of an artificial or prosthetic heart valve). For example, in accordance with the examples described below, the medical assemblies described herein can be used to percutaneously direct and deliver a mitral or aortic valve prosthesis via an intravascular retrograde approach.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> are schematic side views of an example medical assembly <b>20</b>, which includes a stent <b>22</b> comprising at least one primary electrode <b>24</b>, a secondary electrode <b>26</b>, and an energy source <b>28</b> configured to deliver an electrical signal between primary electrode <b>24</b> and secondary electrode <b>26</b> through a fluid in contact with primary electrode <b>24</b> to cause the fluid to undergo cavitation to generate a pressure pulse wave within the fluid. The designation of a &#x201c;primary&#x201d; or a &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; electrode is used to merely differentiate one set of electrodes from another and is not intended to indicate a preference among the electrodes, limit the direction in which an electrical signal is transmitted from one electrode to another, or designate where the cavitation initiates unless described otherwise in the examples. Further the term &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; may refer to the component(s) or portions of the component(s) that are used to induce cavitation within a fluid and is not intended to describe the entire cavitation system.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Stent <b>22</b> and primary electrode <b>24</b> may have any suitable configuration.

In some examples, stent <b>22</b> includes a metallic body and a dielectric coating applied over a portion of the metallic body. At least one surface of the metallic body may be exposed to the external environment of stent <b>22</b> (e.g., exposed to fluid within a blood vessel or a heart of a patient), and this exposed surface of the metallic body may define primary electrode <b>24</b>. In some examples, stent <b>22</b> may include a plurality of primary electrodes <b>24</b>, with each primary electrode <b>24</b> being defined by an exposed surface of the metallic body of stent <b>22</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, the metallic body of stent <b>22</b> may be electrically coupled to a electrically conductive coating exposed to the external environment of stent <b>22</b> that defines at least one primary electrode <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Stent <b>22</b> is configured to expand from a collapsed configuration to an expanded configuration at a target treatment site within cardiovasculature of a patient. In some examples, stent <b>22</b> may be configured to self-expand from the collapsed configuration to the expanded configuration. For example, the metallic body of stent <b>22</b> may be composed of a shape memory or super-elastic material such as nickel-titanium (e.g., Nitinol) configured to self-expand to the expanded configuration when stent <b>22</b> is unconstrained. In other examples, stent <b>22</b> may be forcibly expanded from the collapsed configuration to the expanded configuration using a suitable device such as an expansion balloon. In some examples, stent <b>22</b> may form part of a heart valve prosthesis such as a mitral or an aortic valve prosthesis. As understood by one of ordinary skill, in the context of at least a heart valve prosthesis, the term &#x201c;frame&#x201d; is interchangeable with the term &#x201c;stent&#x201d;; the &#x201c;frame&#x201d; of a heart valve prosthesis serves as the &#x201c;stent&#x201d; of the present disclosure.

Additionally, or alternatively, secondary electrode <b>26</b> may define an exterior surface of the distal tip of inner elongated member <b>40</b> adjacent distal end <b>32</b>B of elongated member <b>32</b>, or other type of surface that is exposed to fluid within the heart or vasculature of the patient during described cavitation process.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some examples, secondary electrode <b>26</b> may be carried by a radially expandable member (e.g., a balloon or other device) connected to inner elongated member <b>40</b> or may be configured to self-expand (e.g., constructed with a shape memory material). The radial movement of secondary electrode <b>26</b> may help reduce the separation gap between primary electrodes <b>24</b> and secondary electrode <b>26</b> during the cavitation procedure, which may be useful for producing certain types of electrical discharges.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Inner elongated member <b>40</b> may also define a guidewire lumen <b>48</b> configured to receive guidewire <b>45</b> used to help navigate distal portion <b>38</b>B to a target treatment site. For example, the guidewire may be introduced through vasculature of a patient to a target treatment site and distal portion <b>38</b>B of catheter <b>30</b> may be advanced over the guidewire to navigate elongated member <b>32</b> through the vasculature of the patient to the target treatment site.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Proximal end <b>32</b>A of elongated member <b>32</b> may be received within hub portion <b>36</b> and can be mechanically connected to hub portion <b>36</b> by any suitable technique. Hub portion <b>36</b> may include one or more supply tubes <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B (collectively &#x201c;supply tubes <b>44</b>&#x201d;). Supply tubes <b>44</b> may provide access to the various components of distal portion <b>38</b>B of elongated member <b>32</b> and may be used for accessing or transporting various items through elongated member <b>32</b> including, for example, a guidewire <b>45</b>, a fluid for use during the cavitation procedure, one or more electrical conductors <b>46</b>, a fluid for inflating or deflating a balloon (if present) carried by catheter <b>30</b>, or the like. For example, one or more of the supply tubes (e.g., supply tube <b>44</b>A) may be used to electrically couple primary and secondary electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> to energy source <b>28</b> via electrical conductors <b>46</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more of supply tubes <b>44</b> may be used to perfuse or aspirate portions of the vessel or heart at a target treatment site, used to introduce guidewire <b>45</b> into a guidewire lumen <b>48</b> of inner elongated member <b>40</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some examples, catheter <b>30</b> may include a strain relief body, which may be a part of hub portion <b>36</b> or may be separate from hub portion <b>36</b>. The strain relief body may extend distally from hub portion <b>36</b> and may help reduce mechanical strain between hub portion <b>36</b> and elongate member <b>32</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, proximal portion <b>38</b>A of catheter <b>30</b> can include another structure in addition or instead of hub portion <b>36</b>. For example, catheter hub portion <b>36</b> may include one or more luers or other mechanisms for establishing mechanical connections, fluidic connections, or other types of connections between catheter <b>30</b> and other devices.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Hub portion <b>36</b> may include a control member <b>50</b> configured to actuate the movement (e.g., retraction and advancement) of outer elongated member <b>42</b> relative to inner elongated member <b>40</b> to permit the release of stent <b>22</b>. Control member <b>50</b> may have any suitable design including, for example, a slider, a lever, or a thumbwheel mechanism that when actuated causes the proximal advancement or retraction of either inner elongated member <b>40</b> or outer elongated member <b>42</b> relative to the other. For example, control member <b>50</b> may be in the form a slider where moving the slider towards distal end <b>32</b>B, causes outer elongated member <b>42</b> to slide proximal relative to the distal end <b>32</b>B. Control member <b>50</b> may include one or more deployment markers that indicate when inner and outer elongated member <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are aligned to permit partial expansion of stent <b>22</b> (e.g., where distal end <b>42</b>B of outer elongated member <b>42</b> is proximal to a distal end <b>22</b>B of stent <b>22</b> and distal to a proximal end <b>22</b>A of stent <b>22</b>), full expansion of stent <b>22</b> (e.g., where distal end <b>42</b>B of outer elongated member <b>42</b> is proximal to proximal end <b>22</b>A of stent <b>22</b>), or full collapse of stent <b>22</b> (e.g., where distal end <b>42</b>B of outer elongated member <b>42</b> is at or distal to distal end <b>22</b>B of stent <b>22</b>).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some examples, elongated member <b>32</b> of catheter <b>30</b> may be used to access relatively distal treatment locations in a patient or other relatively distal tissue sites (e.g., relative to the access point for catheter <b>30</b>). Example treatment locations may include, for example, locations at or near the heart or a heart valve (e.g., aortic valve, mitral valve, or the like) or within the blood vessels of a patient. In some examples, elongated member <b>32</b> is structurally configured to be relatively flexible, pushable, and relatively kink- and buckle-resistant, so that it may resist buckling when a pushing force is applied to a relatively proximal portion of catheter <b>30</b> to advance elongated member <b>32</b> distally through vasculature, and/or so that it may resist kinking when traversing around a tight turn in the vasculature. Unwanted kinking and/or buckling of elongated member <b>32</b> may hinder a clinician's efforts to push the catheter body distally, e.g., past a turn in the vasculature.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Elongated member <b>32</b> has a suitable length for accessing a target treatment site within the patient from the vasculature access point. The length may be measured along the longitudinal axis of elongated member <b>32</b>. The working length of elongated member <b>32</b> may depend on the location of the lesion within the patient's body. For example, if catheter <b>30</b> is a catheter used to access a target treatment site at or adjacent a heart valve from a femoral access point, elongated member <b>32</b> may have a working length of about 50 centimeters (cm) to about 200 cm, such as about 110 cm, although other lengths may be used. In other examples, or for other applications, the working length of elongated member <b>32</b> may have different lengths.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The outer diameter of elongated member <b>32</b> may be of any suitable size or dimension including, for example, between about 1 millimeter (mm) and about 12 mm. In some examples, the outer diameter may be substantially constant (e.g., uniform outer diameter), tapered (e.g. tapered or step change to define a narrower distal portion), or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some examples, at least a portion of an outer surface of elongated member <b>32</b> (e.g., the outer surface of outer elongated member <b>42</b>) may include one or more coatings, such as, but not limited to, an anti-thrombogenic coating, which may help reduce the formation of thrombi in vitro, an anti-microbial coating, and/or a lubricating coating. In some examples, the entire working length of elongated member <b>32</b> is coated with the hydrophilic coating. In other examples, only a portion of the working length of elongated member <b>32</b>, e.g., including distal portion <b>38</b>B, may be coated with the hydrophilic coating. This may provide a length of elongated member <b>32</b> distal to hub portion <b>36</b> that does not include a hydrophilic coating and with which the clinician may grip elongated member <b>32</b>, e.g., to rotate elongated member <b>32</b> or push elongated member <b>32</b> through vasculature. In some examples, the entire working length of elongated member <b>32</b> or portions thereof may include a lubricious outer surface, e.g., a lubricious coating. The lubricating coating may be configured to reduce static friction and/or kinetic friction between elongated member <b>32</b> and tissue of the patient as elongated member <b>32</b> is advanced through the vasculature.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some examples, elongated member <b>32</b> may also include one or more radiopaque markers which may help a clinician determine the positioning of elongated member <b>32</b> relative to a target treatment site. For example, one or more radiopaque markers may be positioned proximal, within, or distal to the housing area for stent <b>22</b>, adjacent to secondary electrodes <b>26</b>, or combinations thereof. In some examples, portions of stent <b>22</b>, primary electrodes <b>24</b>, or secondary electrode <b>26</b> themselves may be radiopaque.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an enlarged conceptual cross-sectional view of distal portion <b>38</b>B of catheter <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, where the cross-section is taken along longitudinal axis <b>33</b> of elongated member <b>32</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows distal portion <b>38</b>B of catheter <b>30</b> positioned adjacent to a target treatment site <b>62</b> containing a calcified lesion <b>64</b> with stent <b>22</b> in a partially expanded configuration. In some examples, target treatment site <b>62</b> may be within vasculature of a patient, e.g., an artery or a vein. In other examples, target treatment site <b>62</b> may represent a native heart valve <b>60</b> (e.g., aortic valve or mitral valve) that includes calcified lesion <b>64</b>, which may be calcium buildup on, adjacent, or within native heart valve <b>60</b>, causing a heart valve stenosis (e.g., aortic stenosis). In some examples, calcified lesion <b>64</b> may affect the function of leaflets LF or cusps that open and shut heart valve <b>60</b> in response to blood pressure changes. For example, calcified lesion <b>64</b> may reduce the pliability of leaflets LF, thereby reducing blood flow through the native heart valve <b>60</b> and hindering heart valve <b>60</b> from functioning properly. The location of calcified lesion <b>64</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is one example, and lesion <b>64</b> may be have another location such as a superficial or a deep calcification on or within the tissue of the heart or vasculature of the patient.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, distal portion <b>38</b>B of elongated member <b>32</b> may be introduced through the vasculature of a patient and positioned adjacent to target treatment site <b>62</b>. Outer elongated member <b>42</b> may be partially retracted relative to inner elongated member <b>40</b> such that distal end <b>42</b>B of outer elongated member <b>42</b> is positioned proximal to distal end <b>22</b>B of stent <b>22</b> and distal to proximal end <b>22</b>A. Distal end <b>22</b>B of stent <b>22</b> may then expand to a partially expanded configuration (e.g., indicated by arrows <b>65</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). In some examples, distal end <b>22</b>B of stent <b>22</b> may be configured to self-expand radially outwards, while in other examples, as described further below, distal end <b>22</b>B may be expanded with the assistance of a balloon.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">While in the compressed and partially expanded configurations, primary electrode <b>24</b> is electrically coupled to energy source <b>28</b> via catheter <b>30</b>. For example, a portion of the metallic body of stent <b>22</b> (e.g., a portion near proximal end <b>22</b>A) may be electrically coupled to electrical conductor <b>46</b>A. Electrical conductor <b>46</b>A may be in direct contact with the metallic body of stent <b>22</b> or may be electrically coupled to the metallic body of stent <b>22</b> through electrical contact with an intermediate electrically conductive component such as electrical contact <b>66</b>. Electrical contact <b>66</b> may define a surface of either inner elongated member <b>40</b> or outer elongated member <b>42</b> configured to be in direct contact with the metallic body of stent <b>22</b> while stent <b>22</b> is in the partially expanded configuration. Electrical contact <b>66</b> may be connected to electrical conductor <b>46</b>A via soldering or other suitable means to provide an electrical pathway between energy source <b>28</b> and primary electrode <b>24</b> using electrical conductor <b>46</b>A and the metallic body of stent <b>22</b>. In some examples, electrical contact <b>66</b> may include an electrically conductive ring positioned over inner elongated member <b>40</b> such that electrical contact <b>66</b> defines an external conductive surface of inner elongated member <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some examples, inner elongated member <b>40</b> may also include a retaining member configured to receive at least a portion of stent <b>22</b>. The retaining member is configured to help retain stent <b>22</b> in place relative to inner elongated member <b>40</b> while stent <b>22</b> is in the partially expanded configuration, such as by limiting or even eliminating rotational and longitudinal movement of stent <b>22</b> relative to inner elongated member <b>40</b>. For example, the retaining member may define one or more shaped recesses configured to receive parts of proximal end <b>22</b>A of stent <b>22</b> (e.g., connecting members or tabs) and prevent rotational or longitudinal movement of stent <b>22</b> while outer elongated member <b>42</b> is positioned over proximal end <b>22</b>A of stent <b>22</b>. In some examples, the retaining member may be formed in a wall of inner elongated member <b>40</b>, in a wall of electrical contact <b>66</b>, or by some other suitable device connected to inner elongated member <b>40</b>. In addition, in some examples, electrical contact <b>66</b> may be positioned within the retaining member, such that when stent <b>22</b> is mechanically engaged with the retaining member, primary electrode <b>24</b> is electrically connected to conductor <b>46</b>A via the electrical contact <b>66</b>.

At that time, the retaining member may release stent <b>22</b> allowing the stent to be deployed in the expanded configuration at the target treatment site. As a consequence of being deployed, stent <b>22</b> will become disconnected from electrical contact <b>66</b> and electrical conductor <b>46</b>A, thereby allowing stent <b>22</b> to remain in the body of the patient and catheter <b>30</b>, along with all the other electrical components of catheter <b>30</b> to be removed from the body of the patient. In some examples, the separation may occur naturally once proximal end <b>22</b>A of stent <b>22</b> is allowed to expand within valve <b>60</b>, while in other examples proximal end <b>22</b>A may be partially mechanically coupled (e.g., via a friction clip) to electrical contact <b>66</b> and the connection may be severed with a small amount of force (e.g., the force produced by stent <b>22</b> returning to the expanded state or by the retraction of elongated member <b>32</b>).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">From the partially expanded configuration, energy source <b>28</b> may deliver, using catheter <b>30</b>, an electrical signal between primary electrode <b>24</b> and secondary electrode <b>26</b>. The electrical signal may be delivered through a fluid <b>68</b> via primary and secondary electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> to heat a portion of fluid <b>68</b> to generate a steam/plasma bubbles within fluid <b>68</b>. The steam/plasma bubbles may represent relatively low-pressure pockets of vapor generated from the surrounding fluid <b>68</b>. The low-pressure steam/plasma bubbles eventually collapse in on themselves due to the relatively high pressure of the surrounding fluid <b>68</b> and heat loss of the steam/plasma bubbles to the surrounding fluid <b>68</b>. As the steam/plasma bubbles collapse, the bubbles release a large amount of energy in the form of a high-energy pressure pulse waves <b>70</b> within fluid <b>68</b>. In some examples, the formation and subsequent collapse of the steam/plasma bubbles may be short lived or nearly instantaneous, causing the pressure pulse waves <b>70</b> to originate near the source of energy delivered to fluid <b>68</b> by primary or secondary electrode <b>24</b> or <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The electrical signal transmitted may be delivered as a corona, an electrical arc, a spark, or the like between primary and secondary electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> using fluid <b>68</b> as the conductive media. In some examples, secondary electrode <b>26</b> may represent the return electrode such that the current density along the exposed surface area (e.g., exposed to fluid <b>68</b>) of secondary electrode <b>26</b> is maximized. Additionally, or alternatively, the exposed surface areas of primary electrode <b>24</b> (e.g., the portion of the metallic body of stent <b>22</b> defining primary electrode <b>24</b>) may be relatively small to maximize the current density on the exposed surface. In some examples, the size or material of respective primary and secondary electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> selected to accommodate the desired current. In some examples, the respective exposed surface of each primary electrode <b>24</b> may be less than about 0.1 square millimeters (mm<sup>2</sup>) to provide the surface for the formation of the plasma/steam bubbles to occur.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some examples, the separation distance between primary electrode <b>24</b> and secondary electrode <b>26</b> may be set depending on the type of electrical signal intended to be transmitted between the electrodes. For example, for arc-type cavitation, primary electrode <b>24</b> and secondary electrode <b>26</b> may be separated by a distance of about 0.005 inches to about 0.020 inches (e.g., about 0.13 mm to about 0.5 mm). For corona-type cavitation, primary electrode <b>24</b> and secondary electrode <b>26</b> may be separated by a distance of about 0.005 inches to about 0.050 inches (e.g., about 0.13 mm to about 1.3 mm), or may be separated by even larger distances.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Once formed within fluid <b>68</b>, the pressure pulse waves <b>70</b> may propagate through fluid <b>68</b> where they impact the afflicted tissue transmitting the mechanical energy of the pressure pulse wave into the tissue and calcified lesion <b>64</b>. The energy transmitted to calcified lesion <b>64</b> may cause the calcium buildup to fracture or break apart allowing target treatment site <b>62</b> to be subsequently expanded (e.g., via stent <b>22</b> and/or a balloon) to a larger flow diameter.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">By conducting the cavitation procedure within fluid <b>68</b> in direct and intimate contact with the calcified lesion <b>64</b>, the transfer of energy from the pressure pulse waves <b>70</b> to calcified lesion <b>64</b> may be more efficient as compared to a cavitation procedure that introduces one or more intermediate devices, such as a sidewall of a balloon that may otherwise dampen the pulse energy, between the source of cavitation (e.g., primary and secondary electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>) and calcified lesion <b>64</b>. In some examples, the improved efficiency of the process may require less energy to be transmitted to fluid <b>68</b> to incur the same amount of cavitation forces. Further, as the temperature of fluid <b>68</b> will increase as a consequence of the cavitation procedure, reducing the overall energy delivered to fluid <b>68</b> may also help reduce the temperature increase to fluid <b>68</b> caused by the delivery of energy to fluid <b>68</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The more efficient transfer of energy from the pressure pulse waves <b>70</b> to calcified lesion <b>64</b> may also reduce the duration that the cavitation procedure must be performed in order to sufficiently fracture or break apart calcified lesion <b>64</b> resulting in an overall shorter procedure. In some examples, by cavitating fluid <b>68</b> directly in contact with target treatment site <b>62</b>, the space provided at the treatment site may allow for the resultant plasma bubbles to grow before collapsing which may help increase the resultant pressure created by the pressure pulse waves <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Additionally, by conducting cavitation using partially expanded stent <b>22</b> rather than a fully expanded stent <b>22</b> (in which case stent <b>22</b> would be mechanically disconnected from elongated member <b>32</b>), stent <b>22</b> may be easily repositioned within fluid <b>68</b> relative to target treatment site <b>62</b> to provide additional cavitation treatment. For example, after a round of initial cavitation while stent <b>22</b> is in the partially expanded configuration, outer elongated member <b>42</b> may be advanced distally relative to inner elongated member <b>40</b> to force stent <b>22</b> into the collapsed configuration against inner elongated member <b>40</b>. While in the collapsed configuration, distal portion <b>38</b>B of catheter <b>30</b> may be repositioned relative to fluid <b>68</b> and target treatment site <b>62</b>. Stent <b>22</b> may then be re-deployed into the partially expanded configuration by retracting outer elongated member <b>42</b> relative to inner elongated member <b>40</b> and the cavitation procedure may be repeated. The entire process may be repeated as many times as necessary. In some example, the ability to reposition stent <b>22</b> and primary electrode <b>24</b> relative to target treatment site <b>62</b> may permit the treatment of multiple calcified lesions within the cardiovasculature of the patient or may permit treating a relatively large lesion from multiple positions and/or directions.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Conducting cavitation using stent <b>22</b> also permits stent <b>22</b> rather than a separate cavitation device may also enable stent <b>22</b> to be implanted at target treatment site <b>62</b> following the cavitation procedure without needing to use a separate device (e.g., stent delivery catheter) to complete the delivery of stent <b>22</b>, making the overall procedure more efficient.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some cases, the calcification of calcified lesion <b>64</b> may not release into a blood stream of a patient. In other cases, however, at least some calcification may break away from lesion <b>64</b> and create emboli that releases into a blood stream of a patient. In some examples, the cavitation procedure may be performed in conjunction with an embolic protection element, e.g., a filter device, positioned downstream of target treatment site <b>62</b> to collect emboli and any portions of calcified lesion <b>64</b> that may be dislodged by pressure pulse waves <b>70</b>. The embolic protection element can be any suitable device, including, but not limited to, a blood permeable membrane or wire mesh mechanically connected to an elongated member.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">As described further below, in some examples, stent <b>22</b> may include a plurality of primary electrodes <b>24</b>, which may be distributed about stent <b>22</b>. The plurality of primary electrodes <b>24</b> may be electrically connected together (e.g., in series or parallel) or may be electrically isolated from each other and electrically connected to respective electrical conductors <b>46</b>. The plurality of primary electrodes <b>24</b> may have any suitable configuration, and can be an integral part of stent <b>22</b> or may be separate from stent <b>22</b> and mechanically connected to stent <b>22</b>. For example, each respective primary electrode <b>24</b> may be defined by a surface of the metallic body of stent <b>22</b> being exposed to fluid <b>68</b>. In some examples, plurality of primary electrodes <b>24</b> may be positioned at distal end <b>22</b>B of stent <b>22</b> such that when stent <b>22</b> is in the partially expanded configuration, plurality of primary electrodes <b>24</b> are distributed in a ring pattern.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some examples, by controlling the size of the exposed surfaces defining primary electrodes <b>24</b> relative to the larger exposed surface of secondary electrode <b>26</b>, cavitation may occur near primary electrodes <b>24</b>. The distributed ring pattern of plurality of primary electrodes <b>24</b> may provide more uniform and distributed energy at target treatment site <b>62</b> and better disruption of calcified lesion <b>64</b> by pressure pulse waves <b>70</b>. Such ringed-pattern arrangements may be useful for targeting calcified lesion <b>64</b> adjacent or within native heart valve <b>60</b> of a patient. Additionally, or alternatively, primary electrode <b>24</b> may be defined by the apex of a distal strut of stent <b>22</b> or by one or more metal tabs extending from the distal strut to provide a relatively large exposed surface area for the electrode compared to the size of the respective struts. The larger exposed surface area of such electrodes <b>24</b> along with the curved apexes may help preserve the integrity of primary electrodes <b>24</b> during cavitation procedure by being less apt to separate or melt during the cavitation procedure due to the relatively high current loads.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Fluid <b>68</b> may include any fluid capable of undergoing cavitation via energy delivered to fluid <b>68</b> by primary electrode <b>24</b>. In some examples, fluid <b>68</b> may be or include blood flowing within the patient. In addition to or instead of blood, in some examples, fluid <b>68</b> may be or include a fluid introduced into the patient, such as, but not limited to, biocompatible fluids such as saline, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or similar solution with a salt content between about 0.9 weight percent (wt. %) and about 5 wt. %; contrast media (e.g., about 25 volume percent (vol. %) to about 75 vol. % contrast media), or the like. Saline or other ionic solutions may more readily undergo cavitation compared to blood, thereby requiring less energy to induce cavitation within fluid <b>68</b>. For example, the higher the salt content of the saline fluid, the higher the conductance will be for the fluid, thereby requiring less energy to increase the temperature of the fluid and induce cavitation. Additionally, the higher the concentration of contrast media, the more viscous fluid <b>68</b> will be leading to a higher dissipation of the cavitation bubbles.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some examples, fluid <b>68</b> may be heated (e.g., body temperature or about 37&#xb0; C.) prior to introduction into the patient. Heating fluid <b>68</b> may increase the relative vapor pressure of the fluid and thus require less energy to induce cavitation. In these examples, fluid <b>68</b> may include fluid not found in the patient's body, but, rather, introduced by a clinician. In examples in which fluid <b>68</b> is introduced into the patient's body, fluid <b>68</b> may be introduced to target treatment site <b>62</b> using any suitable technique. In some examples, elongated member <b>32</b> may define one or more perfusion lumens configured to provide access to target treatment site <b>62</b> and permit the delivery of fluid <b>68</b>, such as saline, into the vessel or heart via one of supply tubes <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). For example, inner elongated member <b>40</b> may define a perfusion lumen with a port exiting near stent <b>22</b>. Fluid <b>68</b> may be forced through the perfusion lumen (not shown) via one of supply tubes <b>44</b> where fluid <b>68</b> mixes with blood at target treatment site <b>62</b> and undergoes cavitation by electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In some examples, stent <b>22</b> may be configured to self-expand. For example, stent <b>22</b> may include a metallic body made of a shape memory or super-elastic material such as nickel titanium (e.g., Nitinol).
