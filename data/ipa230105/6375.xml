Thus, the second shield member <b>80</b> has a shield portion for the signal contact <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the signal contact <b>70</b><i>b, </i>which are in contact with each other, outside in the front-back direction. Thus, the noise shielding effect is improved also for the signal contact <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the signal contact <b>70</b><i>b. </i>To be more specific, inflow of noise to the signal contact <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the signal contact <b>70</b><i>b </i>from the outside and outflow of noise from the signal contact <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the signal contact <b>70</b><i>b </i>to the outside are effectively suppressed. As a result, for example, also in high-speed transmission, it is possible to obtain good transmission characteristics for high-frequency signals.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The pair of first contacts <b>30</b><i>a </i>are disposed along the transversal direction of the connector <b>1</b> at both ends of the first insulator <b>20</b> in the left-right direction. The pair of second contacts <b>70</b><i>a </i>are disposed along the transversal direction of the connector <b>1</b> at both ends of the second insulator <b>60</b> in the left-right direction. Thus, the width of the connector <b>1</b> in the longitudinal direction is reduced. Accordingly, the connector <b>1</b> is reduced in size in the longitudinal direction. For example, because the number of positions and directions for disposing antennas are increasing in communication terminals in recent years, which are adapted to high-speed transmission, reduction in size of connectors incorporated in the communication terminals is required for space-saving. It is possible for the connector <b>1</b> according to one embodiment to fulfill such a requirement.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Because the connector <b>1</b> includes the plurality of signal contacts <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the signal contacts <b>70</b><i>b </i>that differ from the first contacts <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second contacts <b>70</b><i>a, </i>it is possible for the connector <b>1</b> to transmit various signals between the circuit board CB<b>1</b> and the circuit board CB<b>2</b>. Because the plurality of signal contacts <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the signal contacts <b>70</b><i>b </i>are disposed along the longitudinal direction of the connector <b>1</b>, the signal contacts <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the signal contacts <b>70</b><i>b </i>are separated far from the first contacts <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second contacts <b>70</b><i>a, </i>which are disposed along the transversal direction of the connector <b>1</b>. It is possible to separate the signal contacts <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the signal contacts <b>70</b><i>b </i>far from the first contacts <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second contacts <b>70</b><i>a </i>in the connector <b>1</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to shield the signal contacts <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the signal contacts <b>70</b><i>b </i>by using shield members that are independent from each other. At this time, it is possible to perform shielding from multiple directions, because a sufficient space for providing the shield members can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">It is clear for a person having ordinary skill in the art that the present disclosure can be realized in other predetermined embodiments other than the embodiments described above without departing from the spirit and essential features thereof.
