This condition is more commonly known as an ingrown toenail. Ingrown toenails can develop when the distal portion of the toenail is cut too short, thereby allowing the cuticle and toe flesh at the corner of the emerging toenail (rear corner terminus of the free portion of the toenail) to overlap the toenail, thus causing inflammation, swelling and pain.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sulfides, such as sodium sulfide nonahydrate, (hereinafter referred to as sodium sulfide), are effective keratolytic agents for softening nails. According to the Federal Register, over-the-counter ingrown toenail relief drug products in a form suitable for topical administration can, under certain circumstances, be generally recognized as safe and effective (for example sodium sulfide 1 percent in a gel vehicle). (See generally, Federal Register Vol. 68, No. 88, May 7, 2003; pages 24347-24349)</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various medicated devices and methods using, for example, sodium sulfide or conventional antibiotics such as mercurochrome have been provided to correct or relieve pain associated with an ingrown toenail (See, generally, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,770,583; 3,464,408 and 3,799,160). However, most such devices either are complicated to use, expensive or of little practical value. For example, the device may not be able to adequately and deliberately direct and hold the medication on the affected area and may not provide a sufficient quantity of medication.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a simple, inexpensive, but highly effective device for such purposes and a simple method of use of the same. Preferably, such a device should be easily applied to an affected area and easily disposable.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is to be understood that if any prior art information is referred to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission that the information forms part of the common general knowledge in the art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, to advance at least the aforementioned deficiencies in the art, described herein is a simple, easily used, wrapable bandage for use in relieving pain associated with ingrown toenails.

In one embodiment the strip and the composition retaining well can be integral.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In various embodiments, the composition retaining well can be compressible from about 20 to 80 percent of its height at rest. The well depth can be between 100 percent to 50 percent of the height of the composition retaining well. The composition retaining well can be made from an inert material and made of any suitable moisture-blocking material. The composition retaining well can be selected from the group consisting of polyethylene foam, closed foam, vinyl film, low density polyethylene foam, and the like, and combinations thereof. The strip can be selected from the group consisting of rubber, a breathable polymeric material, a woven tricot cloth, vinyl film, cellulose and plastic web. The composition retaining well can be configured to receive a medicated gel having 1 percent sodium sulfide.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one approach, a method of relieving pain associated with ingrown toenails may have the steps of providing a bandage having a flexible and wrapable bandage strip coated on one side with pressure sensitive adhesive, and on the same side as the pressure sensitive adhesive a compressible and expandable composition retaining well having an aperture configured to receive a medicated gel composition is affixed at its base about midway along a length of the strip; wherein the composition retaining well at rest is about 3 millimeters to 10 millimeters in height from its base to the aperture and having sides sloping towards the aperture of about 30 degrees to about 80 degrees; providing a tube of a medicated gel having 1 percent sodium sulfide; squeezing gel into the well until it is about 50 to 100 percent filled; aligning the aperture over an affected area of the toenail; compressing the composition retaining well adjacent to the affected area; and wrapping the strip around the toe and releasably affixing the strip to the toe by the pressure sensitive adhesive.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another approach, an ingrown toenail relief kit is provided having a bandage having a flexible and wrapable bandage strip coated on one side with pressure sensitive adhesive, and on the same side as the pressure sensitive adhesive a compressible and expandable composition retaining well having an aperture configured to receive a medicated gel composition is affixed at its base about midway along a length of the strip; wherein the composition retaining well at rest is about 3 millimeters to 10 millimeters in height from its base to the aperture and having sides sloping towards the aperture of about 30 degrees to about 80 degrees; and a tube of a medicated gel having 1 percent sodium sulfide.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other aspects of the invention are also disclosed and will become more apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art to which the devices pertain and from the following description and claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Notwithstanding any other forms which may fall within the scope of the present invention, preferred embodiments of the disclosure will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a device in accordance with one of the present embodiments in use;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a device in accordance with the present embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> applied to a user;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a top view of a device in accordance with the present embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a sectional view of the device in accordance with the present embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> taken along section lines IV-IV of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a sectional view of the device in accordance with an alternate embodiment taken along section lines IV-IV of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a front elevation view of a device in accordance with the present embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a bottom view of a device in accordance with the present embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a side elevation view of a device in accordance with the present embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0023" num="0022">While the features described herein may be susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to be limiting to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the subject matter as defined by at least the appended claims.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present embodiments provide a flexible strip having on one side a pressure sensitive adhesive and a compressible/expandable well to receive compositions therein. In use, the pressure sensitive adhesive may be applied to a surface to hold and compress the well against the surface thereby exposing the surface adjacent the opening/aperture of the well to the composition contained therein. Although the present embodiments are demonstrated as a bandage wrap having a compressible/expandable well configured to receive over-the-counter (OTC) ingrown toenail relief products, it is understand that present embodiments may be used wherever any composition is desired to be maintained adjacent a surface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, accordingly to one exemplary approach, presented herein are simple easy to use devices configured to assist in relieving pain associated with ingrown toenails by deliberately and effectively applying medication disposed within a compressible/expandable well against an affected area.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present figures provide an exemplary use of the device of the present embodiments. A device <b>20</b> (shown herein as a bandage wrap) is comprised of a flexible/wrapable bandage strip <b>22</b> coated on one side with pressure sensitive adhesive <b>21</b>. Pressure sensitive adhesive <b>21</b>, can be a permanently tacky material like an acrylic adhesive, rubber base adhesive, or the like. Pressure sensitive adhesive <b>21</b> functions as an attaching means for releasably holding device <b>20</b> in place around a toe <b>48</b> so that an aperture of a well having a medicated gel can be directly, firmly and consistently applied to an affected area.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Strip <b>22</b> can be made of rubber, a breathable polymeric material, a woven tricot cloth, vinyl film, cellulose, plastic web and the like so long as it is flexible and wrapable, and optionally stretchable. Strip <b>22</b> has on the same side as the pressure sensitive adhesive a composition retaining well <b>16</b> having a well/opening/bore <b>14</b>, the underside/base of which is attached to strip <b>22</b> either by the pressure sensitive adhesive <b>21</b> or by a separate more permanent adhesive (not shown). Composition retaining well <b>14</b> should be an essentially inert material and can be made of any suitable moisture-blocking material, such as polyethylene foam, closed foam, vinyl film, low density polyethylene foam, and the like.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, foot <b>18</b> is depicted as having a nail <b>38</b> on toe <b>48</b> having an ingrown portion <b>36</b>, which pierces the nail groove <b>37</b>. A sulfide-containing gel <b>34</b> from tube <b>32</b> is squeezed into composition well <b>16</b>. For exemplary purposes, gel <b>34</b> may be a sulfide, a polysulfide or mixtures thereof, of an alkali or an alkaline earth metal and a carrier which is an aqueous or water-containing formulation of a modified cellulosic material within which the sulfide is dissolved or dispersed and in which the utilized water is deionized and/or distilled.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, device <b>20</b> with gel <b>34</b> disposed in composition well <b>16</b> is wrapped around the user's toe <b>38</b> and held in place by the pressure sensitive adhesive aligned with the afflicted nail groove <b>37</b> of ingrown toenail <b>36</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, composition retaining well <b>14</b> has been compressed about 20-80 percent of its height <b>24</b> at rest (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Device <b>20</b> thus retains gel <b>34</b> in the area of nail groove <b>37</b> on nail <b>38</b> with a firm consistent force. As the composition retaining well <b>14</b> is compressed the top is compressed to form a seal around the affected area. At this stage the sealing compression does not require much effort by the user since the composition retaining well <b>14</b> is relatively narrow at its top. As more pressure is applied, the base of composition retaining well <b>14</b> expands to apply greater pressure to drive the medicated gel deeper into the affected area.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in the figures, composition retaining well <b>14</b> may be a pyramid or a cone shape or any variation between a pyramid and cone shape. The cone base may be round or oblong and the pyramid base may be square or rectangular. The angles of slopes <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) and <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) of composition retaining well <b>14</b> may be 30 degrees to about 80 degrees. The base dimension <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of composition retaining well <b>14</b> can vary from about 8 millimeters to 20 millimeters. Composition retaining well <b>14</b> can vary from 3 millimeters to 10 millimeters in thickness while at rest and compressible as mentioned above combined thickness of strip <b>22</b> can be a thickness <b>24</b> that can vary from 3 millimeters to 12 millimeters.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Composition retaining well <b>14</b> not only protects the skin and retains the sulfide-containing gel in place on the afflicted ingrown toenail area, but also through the compression of composition retaining well <b>14</b> adds a greater, more effective seal and greater and more effective pressure of gel <b>34</b> onto the affected area of nail <b>38</b>. Thus, the present embodiments provide a superior ability to seal and drive medicated gels into affected areas. The exposed portion of composition retaining well <b>14</b> may optionally also have has a pressure sensitive adhesive for attaching to the toe.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Well <b>16</b> depth <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) may vary by as much as 100 percent to 50 percent of height <b>24</b> of composition retaining well <b>14</b>. Well <b>16</b> can be a generally rectangular/oblong slot or aperture defining the opening of well <b>16</b>. Dimensions of the aperture <b>17</b> of well <b>16</b> are configured to cover an affected area with the composition. Accordingly, aperture <b>17</b> should be sized to cover most ingrown toenails (e.g., 2-3 millimeters in width 42 and 5-12 millimeters in length <b>40</b>, See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). It is noted that the largest dimension of well <b>16</b> should be perpendicular to the axis <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) of strip <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an alternate embodiment of device <b>20</b>.
