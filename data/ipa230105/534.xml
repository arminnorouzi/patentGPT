Unless otherwise stated, all of the claims and discussion apply equally to all of these materials.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The primary anchor of the anchoring apparatus defining a primary bore, a head section, and a tail section. The primary bore extends along an imaginary longitudinal axis of the primary anchor interior to the primary anchor and the primary bore is normally and preferably cylindrical in shape.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the primary anchor, the head section can be considered to be at one end of the imaginary longitudinal axis of the primary bore, with the tail section at the other end of the imaginary longitudinal axis of the primary bore. The tail section of the primary bore defines a tail section opening of the primary bore. In some embodiments, the tail section of the primary bore forms a threaded section on an interior surface portion of the sidewall of the primary bore.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the primary anchor forms a threaded exterior portion. More preferably, the primary anchor forms a threaded exterior portion and a threaded section on an interior surface portion of the sidewall of the primary bore.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The anchoring apparatus may further comprise an extension member sized and configured to mate with the primary anchor at the tail section opening of the primary anchor. In preferred embodiments, the mating of the primary anchor and the extension member is via threading of the extension member and at least a portion of the tail section of the primary anchor. More preferably, the threading of the tail section to connect to an extension member is on an interior surface portion of the sidewall of the primary bore. In preferred embodiments, the extension member is a threaded cylindrical extension member. Still more preferably, the extension member is a threaded cylindrical extension member and the tail section has threading to connect to an extension member on an interior surface portion of the sidewall of the primary bore.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The length of the anchoring apparatus can be varied as needed, by having primary anchors of different length, and/or by having primary anchors to which extension members of different lengths can be connected.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The head section of the primary anchor defines a head section opening of the primary bore, and the head section also defines a pair of substantially parallel bores extending through the head section of the primary anchor.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Each substantially parallel bore in the head section of the primary anchor (a) extends along an imaginary bore axis which bore axis is disposed at an angle relative to the imaginary longitudinal axis of the primary anchor, (b) is in communication with at least a portion of the primary bore, and (c) is sized and configured to receive a portion of a cable therein and therethrough. The bores need not be parallel, but parallel orientation is preferred. In preferred embodiments, the imaginary bore axes are substantially perpendicular to the imaginary longitudinal axis of the primary anchor.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the head section forms a threaded section on an interior surface portion of a sidewall of the primary bore; more preferably, the threaded section is closer to the head section opening than are the substantially parallel bores. In an alternate embodiment, the threaded portion of the secondary anchor is an extension from the mating end of the secondary anchor; the threaded section mates with at least a portion of a threaded interior portion of the primary bore.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In preferred embodiments, the head section of the primary bore forms a threaded section on an interior surface portion of a sidewall of the primary bore, and the tail section of the primary bore forms a threaded section on an interior surface portion of the sidewall of the primary bore and/or on an exterior surface of the primary anchor; and in some of these embodiments, the anchoring apparatus has an extension member sized and configured to mate with the primary bore at the tail section opening of the primary anchor.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another embodiment, the primary anchor is comprised of a head member and a tail member configured for detachable coupling therewith, the head member defining the head section and the tail member defining the tail section of the primary anchor. In an alternate embodiment, the primary anchor is comprised of a head member, a tail member, and a coupling member, where the head section and tail section are configured to mate with each other, and the coupling member detachably attaches to the head section and to the tail section. This permits head sections and tail sections to be interchanged. In preferred embodiments of this alternate arrangement, the head section and tail section form external threading, and the coupling member has internal threading configured to position the coupling member over the external threading portions of the head section and of the tail section (as a sleeve).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The secondary anchor is sized and configured to mate with the head section of the primary anchor at the head section opening of the primary bore. The secondary anchor comprises a mating end section sized and configured to extend into a portion of both of the substantially parallel bores of the primary anchor when the mating end section of the secondary anchor is received by the primary anchor in the head section of the primary bore. In preferred embodiments, the top of the secondary anchor is sized and configured to receive a tool such as a hexagonal wrench or a screwdriver to aid in mating the secondary anchor to the primary anchor.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, the secondary anchor is threadably connectable to the primary anchor. In preferred embodiments in which the head section of the primary anchor forms a threaded section on an interior surface portion of a sidewall of the primary bore, the secondary anchor is preferably threaded and sized and configured to mate with at least a portion of the threaded section of the head section of the primary anchor. In some preferred embodiments, the secondary anchor is a set screw.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another embodiment, the anchoring apparatus comprises one or more anchor sets. Each anchor set comprises a primary anchor, a secondary anchor, and a cable. The primary anchor and the secondary anchor and the preferences therefor are as described above; an extension member as described above may also be included in one or more anchor sets.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The cable comprises two end sections. Each end section is sized and configured to extend through a respective one of the pair of substantially parallel bores, so that a portion of the cable is held in its respective one of the pair of substantially parallel bores by the secondary anchor when the mating end section of the secondary anchors is mated with the head section of the primary anchor at the head section opening.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The number of anchoring apparatus can be varied as needed. When more than one anchoring apparatus is used, the anchoring apparatus can be at any desired spacing, and the head sections of the primary anchors do not need to be coplanar.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the anchoring apparatus further comprises at least one support plate defining one or more apertures, each aperture being sized and configured to receive at least a portion of a primary anchor and/or at least a portion of an extension member of the anchoring apparatus. A support plate may have a plurality of apertures, one or more apertures being sized and configured to receive at least a portion of a primary anchor, and one or more apertures being sized and configured to receive at least a portion of an extension member. Typically, only one support plate is present. The anchoring apparatus can be used with various types of support plates.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the practice of this invention, the primary anchor and/or an extension member attached thereto are sized and configured to be received directly into body tissue, preferably bone tissue. In some embodiments, the primary anchor is sized and configured to be received into both a support plate and body tissue, preferably bone tissue. Often, a support plate is used to stabilize body tissue, especially bone tissue. One of the preferred applications for the anchoring apparatus with or without a support plate is for bone fracture fixation. The anchoring apparatus can also stabilize joints and/or ligaments, for example to treat a ligament tear.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the practice of this invention, the primary anchor is held by body tissue, especially bone tissue, and the secondary anchor maintains the tension on the cable(s) and secures the cable(s) in place in the primary anchor.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the anchoring apparatus can hold in place a body tissue graft, especially a graft of ligament tissue onto bone tissue; the sutures holding ligament tissues can be reinforced by the anchoring apparatus of this invention.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a particularly preferred embodiment, the anchoring apparatus comprises<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0034">a primary threaded screw which defines i) a primary threaded bore extending along an imaginary longitudinal axis of the primary threaded screw, ii) a threaded tail section defining a tail section opening, and iii) a head section defining a head section opening of the primary threaded bore and defining a pair of substantially parallel bores extending through the head section of the primary threaded screw, each parallel bore        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0035">(a) extending along an imaginary bore axis which is disposed at a substantially perpendicular angle relative to the imaginary longitudinal axis of the primary threaded screw,</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0036">(b) being in communication with least a portion of the primary threaded bore, and</li>            <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0037">(c) being sized and configured to receive a portion of a cable therein and therethrough, and</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0038">a secondary threaded screw sized and configured to mate with the head section of the primary threaded screw at the head section opening of the primary threaded bore and with at least a portion of the threaded section of the primary bore, the secondary threaded screw comprising a mating end section sized and configured to extend into a portion of both of the substantially parallel bores when the mating end section is received by the primary threaded screw at the head section opening of the primary threaded bore.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">A method of the invention is a method for anchoring body tissue, which method comprises:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0040">optionally placing a support plate adjacent to body tissue;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0041">placing a cable around or through body tissue, and, when present, around the support plate, the cable comprising opposing end sections;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0042">drawing at least one end section of the cable into or through, and disposing a portion of said cable within, one of a pair of substantially parallel bores of a primary anchor;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0004" num="0043">tensioning the cable, and</li>        <li id="ul0005-0005" num="0044">mating a secondary anchor with the primary anchor, a mating end section of the secondary anchor extending into a portion of both of the substantially parallel bores, thereby contacting the mating end section and the portion of the cable(s) in the substantially parallel bore(s).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0036" num="0045">Preferably, for the methods of the invention, the features of the primary anchor, secondary anchor, and preferences therefor are as described above for the anchoring apparatus.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">The body tissue generally comprises bone tissue, ligament tissue, or bone tissue and ligament tissue in the embodiments of this invention.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0047">The tensioning of the cable can be accomplished by any convenient tensioning device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0048">In the practice of this invention, a portion of a cable can be in one or both of the substantially parallel bores of the primary anchor. Normally and preferably, the portion of cable in the substantially parallel bore is enough to fill the parallel bore, which permits the secondary anchor to secure the cable. When a cable end section is positioned in a parallel bore, enough cable to fill the parallel bore is used, such that the end of the cable is substantially flush with, or, preferably, extends from, the end of the parallel bore.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0049">One end section of a cable can be drawn through a first parallel bore, placed around or through body tissue, and around a support plate, if present, and drawn through a second parallel bore. In some embodiments, the parallel bores through which the end sections of a cable are drawn are in different primary anchors. A secondary anchor needs to be mated with each primary anchor through which the cable is drawn. In preferred embodiments, the cable is drawn through parallel bores on the same primary anchor. In another embodiment, the cable can go through one or more holes defined by a support plate; an anchor apparatus can hold the cable in place in the support plate hole.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0050">The cable end sections can go into and through the parallel bores in either direction. The portions of cable in the parallel bores do not need to be fully enclosed when the secondary anchor has been mated with the primary anchor.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051">When the cable is wrapped around body tissue(s) and the cable is tensioned, the cable tightens and compresses the body tissue(s). An advantage provided by this invention is that when the secondary anchor is secured in the anchoring apparatus (for example, by tightening a screw), providing tension to the cable, the secondary anchor (e.g., screw) compresses and holds in place but does not cut the cable. Another advantage is that the cable does not need to be tied, eliminating the presence of knots in the patient's body.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052">Turning now to the Figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top view of an anchoring apparatus <b>2</b> of the invention with the secondary anchor <b>6</b> mated to the primary anchor <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the primary anchor <b>4</b> as the outermost concentric ring; the secondary anchor <b>6</b> is represented by the inner circles.
