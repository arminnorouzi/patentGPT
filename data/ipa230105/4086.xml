Semiconductor devices, which make up a major component of devices such as mobile phones, computer tablets, and the like, have been pressured to become smaller and smaller, with a corresponding pressure on the individual devices (e.g., transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc.) within the semiconductor devices to also be reduced in size.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One enabling technology that is used in the manufacturing processes of semiconductor devices is the use of photolithographic materials. Such materials are applied to a surface of a layer to be patterned and then exposed to an energy that has itself been patterned. Such an exposure modifies the chemical and physical properties of the exposed regions of the photosensitive material. This modification, along with the lack of modification in regions of the photosensitive material that were not exposed, can be exploited to remove one region without removing the other, or vice-verse.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, as the size of individual devices has decreased, process windows for photolithographic processing has become tighter and tighter. As such, advances in the field of photolithographic processing are necessary to maintain the ability to scale down the devices, and further improvements are needed in order to meet the desired design criteria such that the march towards smaller and smaller components may be maintained.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the semiconductor industry has progressed into nanometer technology process nodes in pursuit of higher device density, higher performance, and lower costs, there have been challenges in reducing semiconductor feature size.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is best understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying figures.

In some embodiments, a layer to be patterned (or a target layer) <b>20</b> is formed over a substrate <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In some embodiments, one or more layers are formed between the substrate <b>10</b> and the target layer <b>20</b>. A first resist layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>is formed over the surface of a layer to be patterned (or target layer) <b>20</b> or, when the target layer <b>20</b> not formed, over the surface of the substrate <b>10</b>, in the first resist coating operation S<b>105</b>. The first resist layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>undergoes a first baking (or pre-exposure baking) operation to evaporate solvents in the resist composition in the first pre-exposure baking operation S<b>110</b> in some embodiments. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a second resist layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>is formed over the first resist layer <b>15</b><i>a</i>, to form a bi-layer resist <b>15</b> in the second resist coating operation S<b>115</b>. In some embodiments, the first resist layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>includes a chemically-amplified resist (CAR) composition. In some embodiments, the first resist layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>includes a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or a polyhydroxystyrene (PHS). In some embodiments, the first resist layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>is formed by a spin-coating method. In some embodiments, the second resist layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>includes a metal-containing photoresist formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or atomic layer deposition (ALD). In some embodiments, the metal-containing photoresist layer is formed by a spin-coating method.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The photoresist layers <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>are photosensitive layers that are patterned by exposure to actinic radiation. Typically, the chemical properties of the photoresist regions struck by incident radiation change in a manner that depends on the type of photoresist used. The photoresists are positive tone resists or negative tone resists. A positive tone resist refers to a photoresist material that when exposed to radiation (e.g.&#x2014;UV light) becomes soluble in a developer, while the region of the photoresist that is non-exposed (or exposed less) is insoluble in the developer. A negative tone resist, on the other hand, refers to a photoresist material that when exposed to radiation becomes insoluble in the developer, while the region of the photoresist that is non-exposed (or exposed less) is soluble in the developer. The region of a negative tone resist that becomes insoluble upon exposure to radiation may become insoluble due to a cross-linking reaction caused by the exposure to radiation. In some embodiments, the resist is a negative tone developed (NTD) resist. In an NTD resist, instead of the portion of the resist exposed to actinic radiation crosslinking, a developer solvent is selected that preferentially dissolves the unexposed portion of the resist to form the patterned resist.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Then, the resist layers <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>undergo a second baking (or pre-exposure baking) operation S<b>120</b> to evaporate solvents in the resist composition in some embodiments.

In some embodiments, the resist layers are heated at a temperature of about 40&#xb0; C. and 120&#xb0; C. for about 10 seconds to about 10 minutes. In some embodiments, the each resist layer undergoes pre-exposure baking after each resist layer is formed. In other embodiments, the first resist layer <b>15</b><i>a </i>and the second resist layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>are formed and then both layers are subjected to the pre-exposure baking operation S<b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The second resist layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>is selectively exposed to actinic radiation <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>) in the radiation exposure operation S<b>125</b>. In some embodiments, the second resist layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>is selectively exposed to ultraviolet radiation. In some embodiments, the ultraviolet radiation is deep ultraviolet (DUV) radiation. In some embodiments, the ultraviolet radiation is extreme ultraviolet (EUV or XUV) radiation. EUV and XUV are used interchangeably in this disclosure. In some embodiments, the radiation is an electron beam.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the exposure radiation <b>45</b> passes through a photomask <b>30</b> before irradiating the resist layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>in some embodiments.
