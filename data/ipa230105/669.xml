No. 62/938,916, filed Nov. 21, 2019, which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present specification relates generally to instruments and methods to treat intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and more particularly, to a detachable cooling apparatus and associated system to be deployed during brain surgery for treating symptoms associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), craniectomy-requiring surgeries, or intraparenchymal operations.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Bleeding inside the brain is known as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). ICH can occur as a result of traumatic brain injury or can occur spontaneously. Common etiologies for atraumatic ICH include hypertensive arteriopathy, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke, an underlying vascular lesion, hemorrhagic tumor, or other less common causes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Over five million hemorrhagic strokes occur every year worldwide. There are approximately 70,000 cases of ICH in the United States per year. ICH is the deadliest form of stroke with approximately 40% mortality within 30 days of the primary insult. Six months after the bleed only 20% of patients regain functional independence in their daily activities.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Mechanical stress and destruction of cerebral tissue due to hematoma formation rapidly follows the hemorrhagic event and is associated with swelling of brain tissue surrounding the site of injury. Neurotoxic components of the hematoma induce a secondary, subacute injury manifested as perihematomal edema (PHE). Formation of PHE begins within the first four hours and accelerates rapidly, reaching 60% of peak absolute volume 24 hours after the hemorrhage. Although the most rapid expansion occurs in the first 48 hours, the edema continues to increase until an average of 12 days after the hemorrhage. The growth of the edema correlates with a decline in neurological function. No treatment has yet been discovered to mitigate PHE or improve outcome after ICH. Current medical management focuses on limiting the primary injury by controlling bleeding, decreasing the chance of rebleeding, and providing supportive care for the patients. The Surgical Treatment in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (STICH) and the Surgical Treatment in Lobar Intracerebral Hemorrhage (STICH II) trials both failed to demonstrate an improvement in the primary outcome of improved neurologic function in the surgical group after ICH. Attempts at aggressive blood pressure control through the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage (INTERACT II) and Antihypertensive of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage (ATACH II) trails also missed their primary outcomes of improved functional status. In addition, the Recombinant Factor VIIa in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage (FAST) administering FACTOR VII acutely did not show a benefit while the Platelet transfusion versus standard care after acute stroke due to spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage associated with antiplatelet therapy (PATCH) trial addressing hemostasis did not show a functional improvement while the PATCH trial actually demonstrated that giving platelets to patients on antiplatelet agents was deleterious.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Studies have identified a therapeutic role of hypothermia as a tool to treat ICH. Hypothermia is one of the earliest and most thoroughly studied neuroprotectants that exerts its effects through multiple mechanisms. Acutely, hypothermia reduces metabolic rate and the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and improves glucose metabolism. Subacutely, it reduces cell-mediated inflammation with the reduction in inflammatory markers and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic BAX and up-regulation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 gene expression.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Systemic hypothermia is the practice of inducing hypothermia by reducing the core temperature of the body achieving hypothermia of all organs including the target organ: the brain. The application of systemic hypothermia has been studied in multiple conditions that result in neurological injury; most notably post-cardiac arrest, neonatal hypoxia, and stroke. However, systemic hypothermia carries specific risks related to the non-selective cooling of the organ systems, which include bradyarrhythmias, coagulopathies, metabolic derangements, immune suppression, and shivering which may cause as much damage as the ICH itself.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments generally relate to a detachable cooling apparatus that comprises a distal running catheter forming a distal lumen that provides liquid as an input and a proximal running catheter forming a proximal lumen that receives the liquid as an output, wherein the proximal running catheter is connected to the distal running catheter. In some embodiments, the detachable cooling apparatus further includes a heat-exchanger region comprising a high conductivity material that cools surrounding tissue with the liquid. In some embodiments, the detachable cooling apparatus further includes a connector that allows for attachment, detachment, and alignment of the distal running catheter and the proximal running catheter to line up to one or more catheters associated with a fluidics pump and thermal-regulating mechanism. In some embodiments, the detachable cooling apparatus further includes a sensor array that is operable to determine at least one of a temperature of an internal liquid or surrounding tissue, a pressure of the internal liquid or surrounding tissue, a flow rate of the internal liquid or surrounding tissue, and biological properties of the internal liquid or surrounding tissue and an external controller operable to modify the at least one of the temperature, the pressure, and the flow rate. In some embodiments, the sensor array is located at a far distal end of the distal running catheter or at any section of the distal running catheter. In some embodiments, the detachable cooling apparatus further includes a heat-exchanger region comprising a high conductivity loop that cools surrounding tissue with the liquid. In some embodiments, the high conductivity loop is at a substantially 180-degree angle. In some embodiments, the detachable cooling apparatus further includes a heat-exchanger region comprising a high conductivity coiled proximal running catheter that wraps around a distal running catheter that connects the distal running catheter to the proximal running catheter and that cools surrounding tissue with the liquid. In some embodiments, the detachable cooling apparatus further includes a heat-exchanger region comprising a high conductivity inflatable member, such as a bag or balloon, that receives the liquid from the distal running catheter as the input to a distal most region of the inflatable member and a proximal lumen that receives the liquid from the inflatable member as the output at a proximal most point of the inflatable member that connects the distal running catheter to the proximal running catheter and that cools surrounding tissue with the liquid. In some embodiments, the detachable cooling apparatus further includes a fluidics midsection that thermally insulates the liquid that is input into the distal running catheter until it reaches the heat-exchanger region. In some embodiments, the fluidics midsection includes a polyurethane or silicone section that thermally insulates the liquid. More specifically, this midsection is designed to have the required flexibility while also remaining thermally insulating. For example, it is desirable for this flexible midsection (also described herein as being a flexible intermediate region) to be able to navigate through two 90 degree turns without kinking. As described herein, the expression &#x201c;kinking&#x201d; describes a situation in which at least one of the lumens (e.g., distal running lumen or proximal running lumen) is substantially occluded (i.e., greater than 40% occlusion of the at least one lumen due to bending/collapsing of the lumen wall). A silicone based midsection can deliver these properties/features. In some embodiments, the detachable cooling apparatus further includes an additional set of lumens and ports that provide at least one of a drug, a lavage, ventricular drain, or sensor wires. In some embodiments, the detachable cooling apparatus further includes a connection that attaches the proximal end of the detachable cooling apparatus to a fluidics cooling and pump system and at least one additional lumen that introduces the drug, lavage, drain or sensor through a distal port located anywhere between the connection and a distal-most end of the detachable cooling apparatus. In some embodiments, the connection is a screw lock. In some embodiments, connection is a luer lock. As described herein, the connection system that is associated with the detachable cooling apparatus must allow for tunneling under the skin as described herein. The present disclosure describes different embodiments in which connectors are configured to be attached to the catheter structure (the detachable cooling apparatus which itself can tunnel under the skin) after the catheter structure has passed through the surgical equipment and tunneled under the skin or alternatively, the connectors themselves are small enough to be tunneled under the skin. In addition, the catheter structure or connector needs to be able to attach to common metal stylets that are commonly used in surgery. Commonly, this can be accomplished with silicone fitting over a barbed-tube connector on the stylet.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments a method comprises performing a surgical evacuation of an intracranial hematoma in a patient, installing an apparatus within a remaining hematoma cavity of the patient, using imaging to confirm placement of the apparatus in a brain of the patient, activating the apparatus to induce neuroprotection from within the remaining hematoma cavity, operating the apparatus until after an end of surgery, and removing the apparatus without an additional surgical operation.

id="p-0053" num="0052">The present specification generally discloses a fluid-based, closed-circuit cooling system that is used to treat symptoms associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), craniectomy-requiring surgeries, or intraparenchymal operations by placing a detachable cooling apparatus in the evacuation cavity after intracerebral hemorrhage evacuation, attaching it to a fluidics cooling system and inducing targeted temperature management. The detachable cooling apparatus is placed and connected to the fluidics cooling system during surgery, can remain operative for weeks, and can be removed without the need for additional operations. The detachable nature of the cooling apparatus allows for easy placement of the apparatus during surgery and increases the ability to tunnel the device beneath the skin. The detachable cooling apparatus may be removed by pulling the proximal end of the detachable cooling apparatus outward from the skull of the patient. This approach is different from current and traditional therapeutic hypothermia strategies that focus on systemic cooling by limiting the area of temperature modulation to the area of injury and the immediate vicinity, while also operating within the standard procedures currently employed to surgically treat ICH. The detachable cooling apparatus can help maximize the neuroprotective properties of hypothermia via temperature reduction in the perihematomal region and can help reduce or limit the complications associated with systemic hypothermia include shivering, coagulopathy, and infection. Definitions of terms will be as such: &#x201c;Cooling&#x201d; or any variation thereof will be defined as any reduction in temperature relative to the primary area of insult within the patient's brain. &#x201c;Loop&#x201d; will be defined as any shape wherein the starting point and ending point of a fluidics system are immediately adjacent. &#x201c;Bag&#x201d; will be defined as any thin-membraned, volume filling compartment that conforms to the surrounding area. &#x201c;High conductivity material&#x201d; is defined as any material with low thermal resistance, specifically, plastics with thermal conductivities of around or greater than 0.5 Watts/meter-&#xb0; Kelvin as one exemplary property.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Exemplary System</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary neural hypothermia-inducing fluidics system <b>100</b> to treat symptoms associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), craniectomy-requiring surgeries, or intraparenchymal operations by placing a detachable cooling apparatus (device) <b>101</b> in the evacuation cavity after intracerebral hemorrhage evacuation and inducing targeted temperature management as described herein.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The hypothermia-inducing fluidics system <b>100</b> preferably includes a closed-circuit flow system with the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> and a thermal management and flow system <b>103</b> for monitoring and/or controlling the operation of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b>. The detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> is placed in an evacuation cavity of a patient <b>110</b>. The system <b>100</b> is configured such that a cooled liquid is delivered to the target area for inducing the targeted temperature management and more particularly, the use of the cooled liquid and design of the system maximizes neuroprotective properties of hypothermia via temperature reduction in the perihematomal region. In one embodiment, the cooled liquid comprises a saline solution; however, other suitable solutions can be used.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> includes a distal running catheter and a proximal running catheter (See, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>G</figref>), both comprising a thermally insulated midsection that is designed to insulate cooled liquid received from an external system until it reaches a heat-exchanger region <b>105</b> of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b>. Both the distal and proximal running catheters define the heat-exchanger region <b>105</b>. As is known, a heat exchanger is a system that is used to transfer heat between two or more fluids (e.g., the cooled liquid and the tissue at the target site). In the present system <b>100</b>, the heat exchanger region <b>105</b> is designed such that the cold temperature of the cooled liquid is transferred to the target site (e.g., tissue) within the patient's brain. It will be appreciated that the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> is thus defined by a catheter body that can be made up of the distal running catheter and the proximal running catheter. The distal running catheter and the proximal running catheter can be two separate structures or can be a single integral structure that includes two discrete lumens (i.e., distal running and proximal running) that are separated from one another. In general, the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> can be referred to as being a catheter structure.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a cross-section <b>104</b> of the patient's brain, which illustrates the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> as entering the brain and including a temperature-controlled radius <b>111</b> around the heat exchanger region <b>105</b> of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> contained within the brain. In some embodiments, the proximal end of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> is securely attached to the patient's <b>110</b> skull. In some embodiments, the proximal section of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> may remain external to the cranium and is able to be tunneled beneath the skin of the patient.

All of these embodiments are closed-circuit systems in which cooled liquid is delivered to a heat transfer location (heat-exchanger location) at which heat transfer occurs and then the liquid, in a warmer condition, is returned to be recooled and then the process continues.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an enlarged section <b>106</b> of a connection between the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> and the fluidics system which is designed to deliver the cooled liquid. In some embodiments, the connection may be a male-female luer-lock; however, any number of other types of connections can be used to provide a secure, fluid sealed connection between these two parts. Both the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> and the fluidics midsection include two catheters <b>107</b>: a distal running catheter that provides the cooled liquid to the evacuation cavity of the patient <b>110</b> and a proximal running catheter that returns liquid to the thermal management and flow system <b>103</b>. The connected, these two catheters of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> and the fluidics midsection are in sealed, fluid communication to allow flow of the cooled liquid to the heat exchanger region <b>105</b> and also the return flow of the liquid after it has undergone heat transfer in the heat exchanger region <b>105</b> as described below.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The temperature of the cooled liquid is altered to a precise (inputted) value (within acceptable tolerances) within the thermal management and flow system <b>103</b> and is pumped down a distal running catheter (distal running lumen) through the detachable connection <b>107</b> and into the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b>. The distal running catheter of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> provides the cooled liquid to the heat-exchanger region <b>105</b>. The cooled liquid absorbs heat from the surrounding tissue through the heat-exchanger region <b>105</b>.

It will be understood that the port <b>151</b> can include a luer connector or the like for mating to a syringe or other delivery device for delivering an agent, such as medication. In another embodiment, the drug introduction system and the external ventricular drain <b>153</b> could be added to the thermal management and flow system <b>103</b> to allow for controlled, continuous introduction of drugs into the cavity, or automatic safety regulatory processes to account for intracranial pressure changes. The external ventricular drain <b>153</b> can include a valve or other mechanisms for control thereof.

The proximal running catheter <b>204</b> includes liquid that is heated when the cooled liquid is exposed to surrounding tissue in the heat-exchanger region <b>206</b>. In other words, a heat exchange operation has occurred in the heat-exchanger region <b>206</b> and the cold temperatures of the cooled liquid is transferred to the tissue resulting in a cooling of the tissue and warming of the cooled liquid). In one embodiment, the heat-exchanger region (distal end portion) is cooled to a temperature of around 0&#xb0; C. (by means of the cooled liquid) in order to cool the target region (target brain tissue) to a temperature of between 30&#xb0; C. and 36&#xb0; C. The distal running catheter <b>202</b> and the proximal running catheter <b>204</b> are covered by a portion <b>208</b> of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> that insulates the distal running catheter <b>202</b> to prevent premature temperature changes. In other words, the portion <b>208</b> comprises an insulated region defined by an outer insulation material, such as a jacket or the like, that covers at least the distal running catheter <b>202</b> to ensure the cooled liquid maintains temperature as it is delivered to the heat-exchanger region <b>206</b>. Any number of different insulating materials can be used so long as they are sufficiently flexible to permit bending of this insulated region (portion <b>208</b>).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The heat-exchanger region <b>206</b> may include a high conductivity material, such as a thin-walled high conductivity polyether loop that operates as a heat-exchanger region to allow the cold temperature from the cooled liquid to cool the surrounding tissue. In this example, the heat-exchanger region exposes the cooled liquid from the distal running catheter <b>202</b>, which absorbs heat from the surrounding tissue. As a result, the cooled liquid becomes heated liquid and the heated liquid is transmitted outside of the patient via the proximal running catheter <b>204</b>. It will be appreciated that other high conductivity materials can be used such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK), high density polyethylene (HDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), conductive polyamide (PA), low friction polyamide-imide (PAI), polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), or conductive polyphenylene sulfide (PPS). Many of these materials can be embedded or reinforced with other conductive materials such as carbon-fiber or glass-fiber to further increase conductivity without negatively affecting imaging capabilities or device function.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional top view of the detachable cooling apparatus and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> shows a second side view of the portion <b>201</b> detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> with additional solid lines to illustrate how the insulated region <b>208</b> covers the distal running catheter <b>202</b> and the proximal running catheter <b>204</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is a cross-sectional top view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> shows a third side view of the portion <b>201</b> of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> that is rotated to see only the proximal running catheter <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates possible embodiments such as a sensor <b>222</b> and an additional lumen port <b>224</b>.

The sensor <b>222</b> may determine a variety of data including the temperature of the liquid, the pressure of the liquid, the intracranial pressure, the flow rate of the liquid, or other biological properties of the liquid or surrounding tissue. In some embodiments, the sensor <b>222</b> is coupled to an external controller located on the thermal management and flow system (not shown) that is operable to modify at least one of the temperature, the pressure, the flow rate, and the other biological properties.

The sensor <b>222</b> can be located at any number of different locations, such as at an interface between the insulated region <b>208</b> and heat-exchanger region <b>206</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) or at the far distal end of the cooling apparatus or other location that is in proximity to the target site.

For example, as described herein, the external temperature sensor can be located along the flexible midsection of the apparatus. The internal and external sensors are in communication with the controller and allow for temperature measurements to be recorded and displayed. In addition, the controller can be configured to take action in response to the temperature measurements. For example, the external temperature sensor is intended to measure the radial cooling effect of the apparatus and therefore, if brain tissue temperature detected by the external temperature sensor is less than desired, the temperature of the cooling liquid can be adjusted (e.g., lowered).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>G</figref> illustrates that at least in one embodiment, the heat-exchanger region <b>206</b> is translucent and the insulated region <b>208</b> is opaque (shown with gray shading) for purposes of showing the location of the insulation, but other versions of the materials are possible.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>G</figref> illustrate a bag embodiment of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to some embodiments wherein a heat-exchanger region <b>305</b> may be primarily composed of a thin, high-conductivity bag <b>306</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates a distal end portion <b>301</b> of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> that illustrates a distal running catheter <b>304</b>, a heat-exchanger region <b>305</b>, a bag <b>306</b>, and an example placement of a drug infusion port <b>307</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B-<b>4</b>C</figref> are a cross-sectional top view and cross-sectional side view of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> that includes a proximal running catheter <b>302</b>, the distal running catheter <b>304</b>, and the bag <b>306</b>.

In this embodiment, a distal end section of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>160</b> includes a heat transfer balloon <b>170</b> which acts as a heat-exchanger region in the manner described previously herein. The heat transfer balloon <b>170</b> can extend to or close to the distal end <b>164</b>. As in the previous embodiments, the detachable cooling apparatus <b>160</b> includes the distal running catheter and the proximal running catheter. The distal running catheter can have a distal opening or can define a distal lumen that provides for and allows the cooled liquid to flow directly from the distal running catheter into the interior of the heat transfer balloon <b>170</b>. This distal opening or distal lumen is preferably located at or near the distal end of the heat transfer balloon <b>170</b>. The proximal running catheter can have a proximal opening or can define a proximal lumen that provides for and allows the liquid to flow directly out of the inside of the heat transfer balloon <b>170</b> into the proximal running catheter for return to the thermal management and flow system. The distal opening is located downstream of the proximal opening (i.e., closer to the distal end).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The distal end of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>160</b> is preferably formed of a material that is not rigid so as to minimize potential damage from the detachable cooling apparatus <b>160</b> moving while in place (at the target site).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The detachable cooling apparatus <b>160</b> includes an intermediate insulated region <b>165</b> as shown in which an insulating material covers at least the distal running catheter. This intermediate insulated region <b>165</b> is preferably flexible and as described herein is formed to allow the heat-exchanger region (e.g., balloon <b>170</b>) and the intermediate insulated region <b>165</b> to undergo two separate 90&#xb0; turns. At a proximal end region <b>167</b>, there is no insulating material and this section serves as a rigid connection region to allow for the receipt of the cooled liquid from the thermal management and flow system and the return of the warmed liquid back to the thermal management and flow system. The proximal end region <b>167</b> can be form of a suitable rigid plastic material that is not flexible and does not collapse when a connector is securely coupled thereto.

The first rotary seal member includes a first rotatable knob (cinch element) <b>181</b> or the like that can be screwed down in order to effectively couple (attach) the first rotary seal member to the detachable cooling apparatus <b>160</b>. The main body of the first rotary seal member is flexible in nature (e.g., a silicone tubular structure) and is dimensioned to be disposed about the rigid (reinforced) proximal end region of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>160</b> so as to form a seal thereto. The tightening of the first rotatable knob <b>181</b> causes a cinching against and compresses and seals the flexible main body of the first rotary seal member against the rigid proximal end region. Since the first seal <b>180</b> is attached to this rigid (reinforced) proximal end region, there internal lumens maintain their shape and do not compress. Conversely, when the first rotatable knob <b>18</b> (cinching element) is unscrewed, the first rotary seal member can be removed from the detachable cooling apparatus <b>160</b>. The first rotary seal member provides an inlet port <b>185</b> at one end thereof that is placed in fluid communication with the inflow port of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>160</b> to allow cooled liquid to flow through these two ports into the inner lumen of the distal running catheter. As described herein, the ability to quickly and easily remove the first seal <b>180</b> provides a number of advantages to that allow the detachable cooling apparatus <b>160</b> to be used intracranially as discussed herein.

Unscrewing the second and third rotatable knobs <b>191</b>, <b>192</b> allows for the easily uncoupling (removal) of the second rotary seal member. The second rotary seal member also has a side outflow port <b>194</b> that is located along the side of the second rotary seal member. The side outflow port <b>194</b> can be in the form of a leg that extends radially outward from the side of the second rotary seal member. The second rotary seal member can be disposed about and is sealingly coupled to the proximal end region <b>167</b> and/or the intermediate insulated region <b>165</b>. The second rotary seal member also covers the outflow port associated with the proximal running catheter and is designed so that warm fluid flowing through the outflow port flows into the interior of the secondary rotary seal member and exits through the side outflow port <b>194</b>. The rotatable knobs <b>191</b>, <b>192</b> thus isolate the side outflow port <b>194</b>. As shown, the second rotary seal member is thus disposed between the first rotary seal member and the distal end <b>164</b>.

The user interface <b>800</b> also includes buttons (inputs) for changing the desired temperature of the liquid, a button for stopping the thermal management and flow system <b>103</b> from cooling the liquid, and a button for modifying the settings, such as monitoring the operation of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b>, activate manual or automatic rewarming, and power off the thermal management and flow system <b>103</b>. It will be appreciated that the user interface <b>800</b> can be part of a computing device, such as a laptop, desktop, etc., or can be part of a mobile device, such as an app on a cellular phone, tablet, etc. Alerts, both visual and auditory, can be incorporated into the software that is executed to alert the user as to an event that needs attention (e.g., the measured temperature is outside of an acceptable range).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown and described herein, the detachable cooling apparatuses disclosed herein include three main regions, namely, a distal end region which serves as the heat-exchanger region, an intermediate flexible region that is an insulated region, and a rigid proximal end region which is a stiffer, reinforced region that defines the section to which one or more connectors are attached. The different regions that can be formed of different materials can be coupled to one another using conventional techniques, such as use of bonding agents, welds, etc.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>H</figref> show the brain (i.e., the target area) during deployment, operation, and removal of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> according to some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>H</figref> thus illustrate successive steps that are performed. It is well understood that during neurosurgery, the required instruments and tools are delivered to the target site using a delivery device, such as a SurgiScope. A SurgiScope is a microscope and robot designed to hold tools and assist in positioning those tools during neurosurgery. The unit can be mounted on the ceiling and can hold instruments such as endoscopy tools, biopsy needles, and electrodes. The associated software allows for target and trajectory determination. In a first step, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, a hemorrhage evacuation is performed and the hemorrhage is removed from the brain <b>10</b> using a traditional tool, such as an aspiration device <b>20</b>. In a second step, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, the cavity is seen, with the aspiration device <b>20</b> removed but the approach (i.e., an opening passing through the skull) still accessible by future devices. In a third step, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>, the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> is deployed within the cavity via the same burr hole utilized for evacuation (step <b>1</b>). The detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> is tunneled away from the burr hole, allowing for the primary entry point in the brain <b>10</b> of the patient to be closed. It will be understood that the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> is fed through a device, such as the SurgiScope, in order to reach the target location in the brain. In a fourth step, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref>, cooling is initiated using the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> while the patient is still in the operating room under the guidance of a surgeon. In a fifth step, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>E</figref>, cooling is maintained between several hours to the entire length of the hospital stay. It will be appreciated that during this time, the cooling liquid continuously flows through the system and is recooled, etc., to continuously cool the target tissue. In a sixth step, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>F</figref>, controlled rewarming is initiated prior to removal of the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b>. In a seventh step, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>G</figref>, upon completion of rewarming, flow is stopped, and the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> is removed at the bedside using a mild pulling force (without requiring additional equipment). As described herein, in some embodiments, the proximal end connector is removed prior to removal. The controlled rewarming can occur by heating the liquid flowing through the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b>. In an eighth step, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>H</figref>, the tunneled exit point is closed.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The detachability of the cooling apparatuses described herein is important since the connector equipment associated with the detachable cooling apparatus is too large to pass through the lumen of the SurgiScope and similarly, during the process described above, when it is desired to remove the SurgiScope from the detachable cooling apparatus, the SurgiScope cannot pass over the connector equipment. Thus, in the case of using the seals <b>180</b>, <b>190</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>), these seals <b>180</b>, <b>190</b> can be removed from the detachable cooling apparatus to allow for removal of the SurgiScope over the detachable cooling apparatus. Thus, the modularity and detachability (quick connect/quick disconnect) of the present system permits its use in an intracranial setting (neurosurgery). It will be appreciated that the other types of connectors, such as luer connectors, described herein also permit the quick attachment/detachment.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a flow diagram <b>1000</b> of a method for deploying an apparatus within an ICH evacuation cavity. In some embodiments, the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is used, but other devices may be used that induce neuroprotection from within the cavity. At block <b>1002</b> (first step), a surgical evacuation of an intracranial hematoma in a patient is performed. For example, the surgical evacuation may be a minimally-invasive process of removing the IHC from the patient via a burr hole in the skull. At block <b>1004</b> (second step), an apparatus is installed within a remaining hematoma cavity of the patient. The apparatus may be the detachable cooling apparatus <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or another device. At block <b>1006</b> (third step), imaging is used to confirm placement of the apparatus in a brain of the patient. At block <b>1008</b> (fourth step), the apparatus is activated to induce neuroprotection from within the remaining hematoma cavity. For example, the apparatus may be attached to a thermal management and flow system <b>103</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> that includes a pump for providing cooled liquid through the apparatus that cools the tissue inside the brain. As mentioned previously, the pump is part of a flow management control system that is configured to maintain the temperature of the cooled liquid within a target range. As a result, flow rate of the cooled liquid is controlled so that a residence time of the cooled liquid in the heat-exchanger region results in the temperature of the cooled liquid within the heat-exchanger region being maintained in this desired temperature range (e.g., around freezing (32&#xb0; F.)). At block <b>1009</b> (fifth step), the apparatus is operated until after an end of surgery. At block <b>1010</b> (sixth step), the apparatus is removed without an additional surgical operation. The apparatus may be removed following neuroprotective treatment. For example, the apparatus may be removed after the temperature in the remaining hematoma cavity is substantially similar to the temperature of the other tissue in the brain of the patient.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>F</figref> illustrates the system of catheter tunneling in ICH procedures. The detachable cooling device <b>1303</b> is introduced through a SurgiScope or similar device <b>1301</b> into the brain via a burr hole <b>1302</b> (a small hole made in the skull). The SurgiScope <b>1301</b> is then removed around the catheter (device <b>1303</b>) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>).

A stylet connector <b>1402</b> could be a permanent or removable catheter section and is comprised of a stretchable material, such as silicone. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> demonstrates the slide-over mechanism of attachment that connects these two parts together.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> depicts the various sections of one exemplary detachable cooling apparatus. The distal end comprises a heat exchanger region <b>1501</b> built with highly-conductive plastics. The midsection <b>1502</b> is a flexible, insulating region that traverses the brain, skull and skin. The proximal portion of the catheter is reinforced to allow for the use of rotator seals or other mechanisms to attach the luer connector(s) <b>1503</b>. An additional embodiment designed to attach the detachable cooling apparatus to a standard metal stylet (See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>), generally shown at <b>1504</b>, for tunneling is also depicted.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>D</figref> illustrate possible catheter embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref> shows a cross-section of the catheter, with the inflow lumen <b>1606</b> running internal to the outflow lumen <b>1605</b> that is encased in the thermally insulating midsection <b>1604</b>. The structure defining the inflow lumen <b>1606</b> can be considered to be a distally extending catheter, while the structure defining the outflow lumen <b>1606</b> can be considered to be a proximally extending catheter. The inflow lumen extends through the heat-exchanger region <b>1601</b> but ends proximal to the end of the heat exchanger region <b>1601</b>. The cooled liquid thus exits the open distal end of the outflow lumen <b>1605</b> and flows into the heat-exchanger region <b>1601</b> before flowing in an opposite direction in the inflow lumen <b>1606</b>. As mentioned herein, the heat-exchanger region <b>1601</b> is formed of a different material than the flexible midsection (intermediate section) <b>1604</b>.

The deflated bag (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>) is flush against the inflow port <b>1801</b>. As flow is initiated, the bag <b>1805</b> inflates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>) to fill the cavity space within the brain. The inflow port <b>1801</b> does not extend the entire length of the bag <b>1805</b>, ensuring that, when inflated, the semi-rigid inflow port is not in direct contact with the brain. The distal end of the bag is thus unsupported since the distal end of the inflow port <b>1801</b> is spaced from the distal end of the bag <b>1805</b>. This allows the distal end to have some compression due to any brain tissue movement. The inflow port <b>1801</b> and outflow <b>1802</b> are sized to allow for a specific internal pressure within the bag. The flexible midsection is shown at <b>1808</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The system described herein is thus configured to provide localized cooling of a target area and unlike conventional intravascular cooling systems, the present system is of an extravascular nature. As mentioned herein, the cooling apparatuses described herein are designed to fit through current instrument delivery systems, such as a SurgiScope device and therefore, at least according to one embodiment, the diameter of the detachable cooling apparatus (catheter structure) is less than 4.7 mm and can be less than 4.0 mm, and can in one exemplary embodiment be between 2.0 mm and 4.0 mm to allow for tunneling under the skin. In one embodiment, the axial length of the heat-exchanger region can be between 1 cm and 3 cm. In the event of using an external temperature sensor and an internal temperature sensor, as described herein, the distance between the internal and external temperature sensors can be up to 3 cm (e.g., between 1-3 cm). In addition, in at least one embodiment, the outflow (proximally running) lumen can be slightly smaller than the inflow (distally running) lumen to ensure inflation of the inflatable member. This results in the outflow lumen being the rate-limiting step for flow rate. In one embodiment, the outer diameter (OD) is 4 mm, meaning the inner diameter (ID) of the outflow lumen is substantially smaller (&#x3c;1 mm). In one embodiment, it is desirable to achieve a &#x2dc;1 mm (5F) outflow ID. In one embodiment, the catheter length (i.e., length of the detachable cooling apparatus) can be between 5 to 20 cm, such as &#x2dc;15 cm. As also discussed herein, the detachable cooling apparatus (catheter) is configured to be flexible enough to undergo two separate 90&#xb0; turns due to the construction of the flexible midsection. This is similar to common EVD catheters, which are commonly made with silicone tubing (e.g., the thermally insulating outer catheter of the detachable cooling apparatus can thus be made with a flexible material such as silicone).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the above description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the specification.
