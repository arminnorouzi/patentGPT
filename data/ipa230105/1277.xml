The solutions of vertical take-off aircrafts are also known which change completely the position from vertical into horizontal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">From the published international application WO2003GB02770 the solution of an air vehicle drive device is known containing the fan placed in a tubular air channel and guides for distributing the air jet into two or more additional jets directed to the appropriate jet nozzles is known from. The device provides the vertical start and lifting force as well as the force for horizontal flight.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">From the published application US 20080150083 a drive unit is known, fitted with a turbine with a distributor, placed in the air channel, longitudinally with the outlet chute of the ramjet engine. The distributor divides uniformly the flow of exhaust gas from the ramjet engine to two pairs of outlet nozzles, the outlet part of which is bent at an angle of 120&#xb0; from the vertical, longitudinal axis of the nozzle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">From the Polish patent description PL221132 a drive of vertical take-off and landing air vehicle is known, fitted with an engine, which contains at least two pairs of air channels, located symmetrically on the right and left sides in relation to the aircraft axis. A turbine and a throttling valve, which serves for regulating the force of draft produced by the turbine and is located between the air inlet to the air channel and the turbine, are placed in each air channel. Each air channel includes a movable outlet nozzle at the outlet.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">From the German utility model DE 29916203 U1 an aircraft with vertical take-off and landing is known. This solution describes a construction of an aircraft with vertical take-off and landing which does not have the disadvantages of a popular, conventional helicopter showing flight inefficiency and technical complexity of the drive components.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">The solution disclosed in the utility model DE 29916203 U1 is characterized by agility and precision of hovering. The helicopter described therein may take-off and land vertically. Forces activated in it enable its vertical take-off thanks to the horizontal propellers built in the wings. The tilt of the vehicle is achieved by changing the draft of these propellers and the vehicle rotation is regulated by additional lamellae deflecting the air stream.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">Forces generated on the tail by two opposing propellers in the vertical take-off and landing phase only allow the correction of the tail position by generating a corrective force only perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle while, in the flight phase, only parallel to this axis.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Contrary to the known solution, in the present solution, constituting a subject of the present patent application, the generated resultant force creating a lift may freely change direction and force while moving along a vertical plane passing through the longitudinal axis of the drive unit from 90 degrees to 90 degrees in relation to the vertical axis of this drive unit (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>4</b></figref><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b>).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">The helicopter disclosed in the prior art document DE 29916203 U1 has wings in which propellers generating vertical draft are fixed. However, the opposing propeller placed on the tail does not create lift but only a corrective force, it replaces the rear propeller in a helicopter (so that the helicopter does not revolve around its axis).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0012">The purpose of the present solution is to design such construction of drive which allows building the vertical take-off and landing air vehicles without equipping them with additional rotary drive elements or without equipping them in two drive systems, separately for vertical and horizontal flight.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">According to the present solution the essence of the air vehicle drive unit, which has at least one air channel, the air channel being fitted with outlet-inlet nozzles openings and the drive, is that a fan (<b>2</b>) or fan (<b>2</b>&#x2032;) is fixed respectively on each ends of the air channel and that each fans of the drive is connected respectively with an independent engine for individual regulation of the draft force by each of them. One of the outlet-inlet nozzles openings is placed in a wall of the central part of the air channel, between fixed drive fans, and constitutes a vertical draft force outlet-inlet nozzle opening.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">It is favorable when the vertical draft force outlet-inlet nozzle opening has a contour of rectangle with rounded corners, elongated in the direction of longitudinal axis of the air channel.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">Most often, at least three drive units inseparably connected with each other form a stable drive system of the flying vehicle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">The drive unit is usually equipped with its own independent power supply system composed of battery pack and controller.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">Typically, the drive unit housing has built-in catches for connecting several drive units in series.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">The solution according to the present disclosure is characterized in a simple construction, which allows controlling the vehicle freely by an independent regulation of rate and direction of the air jet produced by individual fans. The vehicle can ascend, descend, rotate, fly forward and backward.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">The drive unit allows application in its various combinations and arrangements, in flying vehicles.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0020">The subject of the solution is displayed in the embodiment in drawings, where:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows schematically the flying vehicle drive unit in longitudinal section from the side;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the unit in the longitudinal section from below;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> show the resultant draft force F of the drive unit, with equal draft forces F1 and F2, generated in one direction;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows resultant draft force F&#x2032; of the drive unit, with different draft forces F1 and F2, generated in one direction;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>shows resultant draft force F&#x2032; of the drive unit deflected in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> due to a change of direction of engine <b>2</b>&#x2032; draft and the difference of draft forces F1, F2 generated in different directions, where F2&#x3c;F1;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows vertical resultant draft force F&#x2033; of the drive unit with equal forces F1, and F2, generated in different directions;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows schematically the example of a flying vehicle with the drive unit according to the solution in an axonometric view;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows schematically the example of a flying vehicle with three drive units according to the solution in a bottom view;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows schematically the example of a flying vehicle with ten drive units connected in series into four assemblies according to the solution in a bottom view;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows schematically the example of a flying vehicle with three drive units according to the solution in a bottom view with marked front drive unit <b>6</b> and two rear drive units <b>7</b>;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows schematically the example of a flying vehicle in a side view with a marked resultant draft force F of each of the drive units directed in one direction forward;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows the change of direction of resultant draft force F&#x2033; to vertically upwards for the front drive unit <b>6</b>;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows presents the change of direction of resultant draft force F&#x2033; to vertically upwards for the front drive unit <b>6</b> and rear drive unit <b>7</b>;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows the flying vehicle composed of a central loading box, optional wings and four drive assemblies according to the solution in a side view;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows the flying vehicle composed of a central loading box, optional wings and four drive assemblies according to the solution in a bottom view;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows the flying vehicle composed of a central loading box, optional wings and four drive assemblies according to the solution in a front view and similarly in a rear view;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows the drive unit equipped with two fans with a housing in a cross-sectional view; and</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows the drive unit equipped with two fans with a housing in a plan view.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0039">The description of illustrative embodiments according to principles of the present invention is intended to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings, which are to be considered part of the entire written description.
