The invention further relates to a plug connector having such a holding frame and to an electronic device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Holding frames of this type serve for the modular use of contact inserts, for example on plug connectors. One or more contact inserts can be arranged on such a holding frame in order to be inserted together with the holding frame into a housing of a plug connector part or of a plug connector and to be connected to the housing via the holding frame. In this way, contact inserts can be combined with each other in a modular manner and arranged in or on a plug connector part via the holding frame.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such contact inserts can have, for example, one or more electrical contacts. In this case, the contact inserts on the one hand are connected to electrical lines which are routed to a plug connector and on the other hand form plug contacts via which the plug connector can be brought into engagement with a mating plug connector part in a plug-in manner for electrical contact.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such modular contact inserts offer the advantage of flexible combinability and thus a variable usability of plug connectors.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When contact inserts are inserted into a holding frame, it is necessary for the contact inserts to be held on the holding frame in order to enable the holding frame together with the contact inserts to be attached, for example, to a plug connector. In a holding frame known from DE 10 2012 110 907 A1, it is provided for this purpose that a second holding frame part can be attached to a first holding frame part, which has recesses for receiving projection elements of contact inserts, in order in this way to latch projection elements inserted into the recesses and thus lock them on the holding frame.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a holding frame known from DE 20 2012 103 360 U1, two different recesses are provided on frame walls. Projection elements of contact inserts can be inserted into first recesses on an upper edge of the frame walls so as to engage, whereas pin-like formations of the contact inserts can be brought into latching engagement with second recesses in the form of openings.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the present invention provides a holding frame for a plug connector, for receiving contact inserts, comprising: a main frame, which has a first side wall, a second side wall opposite the first side wall, a first end wall, and a second end wall opposite the first end wall, the first side wall, the second side wall, the first end wall, and the second end wall enclosing an interior of the main frame into which the contact inserts are insertable in an insertion direction; and multiple wall segments, each of which has a fastening region via which the contact inserts that are inserted into the interior of the main frame are holdable on the main frame, wherein each wall segment of the multiple wall segments are arranged on a receiving section formed on the first side wall or on the second side wall, and wherein each receiving section has a slot-like cutout into each of which a foot region of one of the multiple wall segments is inserted in a mounted position.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Subject matter of the present disclosure will be described in even greater detail below based on the exemplary figures.

The holding frame is further characterized by multiple wall segments, each having a fastening region via which the contact inserts inserted into the interior of the main frame can be held on the main frame, wherein the multiple wall segments are each arranged on a receiving section formed on the first side wall or on the second side wall, wherein each receiving section has a slot-like cut-out into which a foot region of one of the multiple wall segments is inserted in a mounted position.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The wall segments can be arranged on the main frame. Each contact insert inserted or introduced into the main frame can be held or fastened on the main frame via two oppositely disposed wall segments. The mounted position is the position in which the wall segments are arranged on the main frame and contact inserts that have been introduced into the interior of the main frame can be held by the wall segments. Multiple receiving sections are preferably formed on each of the two side walls of the main frame. The receiving sections of a side wall are preferably arranged next to each other and thus in a row. The receiving sections are preferably formed in each case in the respective side wall of the main frame. A receiving section is assigned to each wall segment to be arranged on the main frame, so that a wall segment can be arranged in each receiving section. In order to fasten the wall segments to the main frame, it is provided according to the invention that each receiving section has a slot-like cut-out into which a foot region of one of the multiple wall segments can be inserted in the mounted position. The wall segments can thereby be arranged and fastened individually on the main frame and thus individually on the respective associated receiving section. By inserting the wall segments at least with their foot region into a slot-like cut-out of the receiving section assigned to them, the mounting of the wall segments on the main frame can be accomplished especially easily and quickly. The structural design of the holding frame can also be considerably simplified as a result. The slot-like cut-outs can each form a pocket in the main frame into which the wall segments, in the mounted position, can engage at least in some regions, in this case with their foot region. The foot region&#x2014;with which the wall segments can be inserted into the slot-like cut-out&#x2014;of the wall segments is preferably formed on an end section of the wall segments.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The slot-like cut-outs of the receiving sections are preferably each formed on a lower edge of the main frame. The wall segments can thus preferably each be fastened to the main frame from below and inserted into the slot-like cut-outs. The mounting direction of the wall segments on the main frame is thus preferably counter to the insertion direction of the contact inserts into the interior of the main frame, so that an insertion of the wall segments into the respective slot-like cut-out can take place in an opposite direction to the insertion of the contact inserts into the main frame. The contact inserts are preferably inserted from above into the interior of the main frame.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The slot-like cut-outs of the receiving sections formed on the first side wall can be connected to one another and/or the slot-like cut-outs of the receiving sections formed on the second side wall can be connected to one another. The slot-like cut-outs formed on a side wall are preferably arranged one after the other in a row. If the slot-like cut-outs formed on a side wall are connected to one another, the slot-like cut-outs can take the form of a cut-out which can span all receiving sections of a side wall. Such a slot-like cut-out can extend over more than 2/3 of the length of the side wall.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The receiving sections are preferably formed in each case on an outer side of the main frame that faces away from the interior. In the mounted position, the wall segments are thus preferably on the outer side of the main frame. Preferably, no part or region of a wall segment in the mounted position is arranged on an inner side of the main frame, which inner side faces in the direction of the interior of the main frame. The wall segments therefore no longer have to have a design which is elaborately bent, because, in the case of the wall segments according to the invention, it is no longer necessary for the lower edge of the main frame to be gripped in an encompassing manner.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The receiving sections can each have an opening which, in the mounted position, can in each case be overlapped, at least in some regions, by the fastening region of the wall segment assigned to the receiving section. The openings are preferably designed in the form of openings on the main frame or on the side walls of the main frame. The openings preferably extend into the main frame starting from the upper edge of the main frame. Via the openings, the wall segments can be brought into operative connection with the contact inserts, especially with the projection elements of the contact inserts, in order to be able to hold the contact inserts in the interior of the main frame. For this purpose, the projection elements of the contact inserts can project into the respective opening. In the mounted position, the openings are covered, at least in some regions, by the fastening region of the respective wall segment, so that the wall segments can each cover or overlap a projection element of an inserted contact insert at the end face. Due to the covering of the projection elements of the contact inserts at the end face by means of the wall segments, each wall segment can by means of its fastening region apply a force, especially a compressive force, at the end face of the projection element assigned thereto, which projection element is oriented transversely to the insertion direction of the respective contact insert into the main frame. As a result, the positioning, and especially the orientation of the positioning of the contact insert in the main frame, can be improved. A centering of the contact insert within the main frame can in particular be achieved thereby, so that any play occurring between the contact insert and the main frame can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In order to be able to form a coding for the insertion of the contact inserts in the correct position, the openings of the receiving sections formed on the first side wall can have a greater width than the openings of the receiving sections, which openings are formed on the second side wall. The two projection elements formed on a contact insert likewise preferably have a different width, so that an insertion of the contact insert can only be done in such a way that the wider projection element can be inserted into the wider opening of a receiving section and the narrower projection element of a contact insert can be inserted into the narrower opening of a receiving section. It is thereby possible to prevent incorrect plugging of the contact inserts into the main frame and thus into the holding frame.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to hold the contact inserts in the desired position within the interior of the main frame, the fastening region of the wall segments preferably has at least one fastening tab which, in the mounted position, projects through the opening of a receiving section. The fastening tab can be designed in such a way that, in the mounted position, the fastening tab can rest on an upper side of a projection element of the respective contact insert, so that, in the insertion direction of the contact insert into the main frame, the fastening tab can prevent a movement of the inserted contact insert that is counter to the insertion direction of the contact insert.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In order to be able to achieve a greater stability when the contact inserts are held in their inserted position in the main frame, the fastening region of the wall segments can have two fastening tabs which project through the opening of a receiving section in the mounted position. The two fastening tabs of a fastening region of a wall segment can be formed symmetrically to one another.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The two fastening tabs of a fastening region of a wall segment can be arranged on opposite outer edges of the wall segment. The two outer edges preferably delimit the respective wall segment. Due to the arrangement on the outer edges, the fastening tabs can be arranged in the form of two wings on the wall segment.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The fastening tabs preferably have a bent design in the region of the connection to the respective outer edge. Preferably, the fastening tabs are bent outwards from the main extension plane of the wall segments. Preferably, the fastening tabs can each be formed bent at an angle &#x3b1;&#x2265;90&#xb0; to the outer edge of the wall segment. Especially preferably, the fastening tabs can each be formed bent at an angle &#x3b1;&#x2265;180&#xb0; to the outer edge of the wall segment.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The fastening region of the wall segments can in each case be formed on a head region of the wall segments, which can be positioned on an end section of the wall segment opposite the foot region. The fastening region and the head region of a wall segment thus preferably have a maximum possible distance from one another.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The wall segments are preferably designed to be resilient. For this purpose, the wall segments can be formed for example from a spring plate. When a contact insert is inserted, the wall segments mounted on the main frame can thereby spring away at their head region outwards from the interior of the main frame, in order to enable insertion of the contact insert into the interior. If the contact insert is positioned in the desired position in the interior of the main frame, the fastening region of the wall segments can again spring or pivot back in the direction of the interior of the main frame, so that the fastening region of the wall segments can hold the contact inserts in this position.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to be able to achieve an especially good spring action, each wall segment can have between the foot region and the head region a central section, wherein the width of the central section can taper from the foot region towards the head region. As a result of this tapering, a uniform deformation of the wall segment, especially of the central section of the wall segment, can be achieved over the bending length of the wall segment during insertion and removal of the contact inserts into/from the interior of the main frame. Due to the tapering from the foot region towards the fastening region, the bending stress of the wall segment can decrease from the foot region towards the fastening region. The foot region can form a clamping location of the wall segment on the main frame, especially on a receiving section of the main frame. By reducing the width of the wall segment starting from this clamping location&#x2014;the foot region of the wall segment&#x2014;a uniform stress profile over the length of the wall segment can be achieved when the wall segment flexes during the insertion and removal of the respective contact insert. The elasticity of the wall segment can be increased by the tapering in the direction of the head region, whereby a kind of flexible joint can be formed on the wall segment. As seen along the length of the wall segment, the central section preferably has a substantially larger surface area than the foot region and the fastening region of the wall segment.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the region of the central section, the outer edges of the wall segment are preferably not formed in a straight line. Instead, the outer edges of the wall segment extending along the central section can have a curved shape. Due to the curved shape of the outer edges, the distribution of the bending stress within the wall segment can be further improved, so that the load acting on the wall segments during insertion and removal of the contact inserts can be reduced and at the same time an optimized spring effect of the wall segments can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order to be able to achieve a separation of function between the foot region and the central section, an offset can be formed in a connection region of the foot region on the central section such that the foot region can extend in a first plane and the central section can extend in a second plane arranged offset to the first plane. In the mounted position within the main frame, the foot region can thereby be arranged in the slot-like cut-out, wherein on the connection region of the wall segment having the offset, the wall segment can be guided out of the cut-out in the mounted position, so that the central section and also the fastening region or the head region of the wall segment can be guided along the outer side of the main frame and thus said outer side barely no longer engages in the slot-like cut-out of the receiving section.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The receiving sections can each have a bearing face against which an inner surface of the wall segments facing in the direction of the interior of the main frame can lie flat in the mounted position. Due to the planar abutment of the wall segments over their central section on the respective receiving section, a good and positionally secure support of the wall segments on the receiving sections and thus on the main frame can be achieved. The bearing face preferably faces away from the interior of the main frame.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">An especially positionally secure attachment of the wall segments on the main frame can further be achieved by the fact that the bearing face of a receiving section can be delimited by two opposite inner edges, wherein in the region of the central section of the wall segments the outer edges of the wall segments can, in the mounted position, adjoin the inner edges of the receiving section assigned thereto in a positive-locking manner. A lateral displacement of the wall segments, especially during the insertion and removal of the contact inserts, can thereby be reliably prevented, because the wall segments are supported on both sides by the outer edges and are limited in their movement.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In order to be able to further improve the fastening of the wall segments to the main frame, the wall segments can each have a fastening element at their foot region, which fastening element, in the mounted position, can be in engagement with an opening formed on the main frame. Each receiving section can have such an opening. The fastening elements can be designed, for example, in the form of a tab or a nose which, in the mounted position, in each case enters into an opening on the main frame or on the respective receiving section and there can latch or hook.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is further possible for an identification element to be fastened to each of the wall segments. The identification element can already be labeled or can be labeled individually by the user. The identification elements can provide the possibility of marking the contact inserts or the plug-in locations for the contact inserts in the interior of the main frame. Especially preferably, the identification element can be attached or be attachable to the foot region of the wall segment. The identification element can, for example, be inserted together with the foot region into the slot-like cut-out in order to secure the identification element.
