However, the present disclosure is not limited by the embodiments described below. In the drawings, identical elements or corresponding elements are referred to by the same reference numerals. Moreover, each drawing is schematic in nature, and it needs to be kept in mind that the relationships among the dimensions of the elements or the ratio of the elements may be different than the actual situation. Among the drawings, there may be portions having different relationships among the dimensions or having different ratios. Furthermore, in the present written description, the cutoff wavelength implies the cable cutoff wavelength defined in ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union) G.650.1. Moreover, regarding the terms not particularly defined, the definitions and the measurement methods given in G.650.1 and G.650.2 are followed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a multicore optical amplifying fiber according to a first embodiment, and illustrates a cross-sectional surface of the multicore optical amplifying fiber in a perpendicular direction to an axial direction. A multicore optical amplifying fiber <b>1</b> is a double-clad seven-core-type optical fiber that includes the following constituent elements: seven core portions <b>1</b><i>a </i>representing a plurality of core portions; an inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>that encloses the core portions <b>1</b><i>a; </i>and an outer cladding portion <b>1</b><i>c </i>that encloses the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Herein, the direction vertical to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> represents an axial direction Dz of the multicore optical amplifying fiber <b>1</b>. Moreover, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a radial direction Dr and an axial-rotation direction Dt of the multicore optical amplifying fiber <b>1</b> are defined. In the other drawings too, in an identical manner to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the axial direction Dz, the radial direction Dr, and the axial-rotation direction Dt may be defined in the same manner.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The core portions <b>1</b><i>a </i>are placed in a triangular lattice in such a way that a close-packed state is achieved. That is, a single core portion <b>1</b><i>a </i>is placed at or close to the center of the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b. </i>Centering around that core portion <b>1</b><i>a, </i>six core portions <b>1</b><i>a </i>are placed to represent the corners of a regular hexagon. Thus, it may also be said that, when a hexagonal close-packed lattice is defined in the cross-sectional surface perpendicular to an axial direction of the multicore optical amplifying fiber <b>1</b>, the core portions <b>1</b><i>a </i>are positioned at the lattice points. The core portions <b>1</b><i>a </i>include, for example germanium (Ge) or aluminum (Al) as the refractive index adjustment dopant meant for enhancing the refractive index. Moreover, the core portions <b>1</b><i>a </i>include erbium (Er) that is a rare-earth element serving as an amplification medium. Herein, Er is added at such a concentration that, for example, the absorption coefficient near the wavelength of 1530 nm is in the range of 2.5 dB/m to 11 dB/m. The addition concentration is, for example, in the range of 250 ppm to 2000 ppm. However, there is no particular restriction on the absorption coefficient or the addition concentration. Meanwhile, Al also has the function of suppressing the concentration quenching of Er.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>has a lower refractive index than the maximum refractive index of the core portions <b>1</b><i>a. </i>The inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>is made of, for example, pure silica glass without having any refractive index adjustment dopant added thereto. As a result, a step-index-type refractive index profile is achieved between the core portions <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b. </i>Meanwhile, in the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b, </i>a trench portion may be formed on the outer periphery of each core portion <b>1</b><i>a. </i>In that case, the trench portions are made of silica glass in which a refractive index adjustment dopant such as fluorine (F) is added for lowering the refractive index. Thus, the trench portions have a lower refractive index than the refractive index of the remaining portion of the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>that is made of pure silica glass. In that case, a trench-type refractive index profile is achieved between the core portion <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">If core &#x394; represents the relative refractive-index difference of each core portion <b>1</b><i>a </i>with respect to the glass of the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b; </i>then, in the first embodiment, core &#x394; of each core portion <b>1</b><i>a </i>is substantially identical and, for example, is in the range between 0.35% and 2% at the wavelength of 1550 nm. In relationship to core &#x394;, it is desirable that the core diameter of the core portions <b>1</b><i>a </i>is set to achieve a cutoff wavelength that is shorter than the optical amplification waveband at which a rare-earth element is capable of optical amplification. In the case of Er, the optical amplification waveband is, for example, in the range between 1530 nm to 1565 nm called the C band or in the range between 1565 nm to 1625 nm called the L band. The core diameter is, for example, in the approximate range between 5 &#x3bc;m and 10 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The outer cladding portion <b>1</b><i>c </i>has a lower refractive index than the refractive index of the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b, </i>and is made of resin, for example. If the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>includes trench portions, then the outer cladding portion <b>1</b><i>c </i>may have a higher refractive index than the refractive index of the trench portions.

Then, optical fiber drawing of the base material is performed, and the outer cladding portion <b>1</b><i>c </i>is formed.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">The base material rod used in the method explained above may be manufactured according to the VAD (Vapor-phase Axial Deposition), or the OVD (Outside Vapor Deposition) method, or the MCVD (Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) method, or the plasma CVD method. Regarding the base material rod, soot layers made of glass particles, namely, a soot layer representing the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>ea</i>, a soot layer representing the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>ec</i>, and a soot layer representing the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>ee </i>are deposited; and draining and vitrification is performed by heat treatment. As a result, the base material rod is formed. At that time, if soot layers made of mutually different composition materials are deposited as the neighboring soot layers; then, during the subsequent heat treatment, air bubbles develop at the interface between those soot layers, thereby resulting in the formation of the portions representing the air bubble regions <b>1</b><i>eb </i>and <b>1</b><i>ed</i>. For example, different composition materials imply silica glass added with dopants that include alkali metals, such as fluorine (F), germanium (G), phosphorous (P), natrium (N), and potassium (K); and chlorine (Cl). A dopant represents an example of a dopant meant for varying the viscosity of silica glass. As a result of adding dopants, it is believed that, during the heat treatment, stress is exerted on the interface between the different composition materials, which results in the formation of air bubbles. Moreover, dopants may also be used for varying the refractive index of silica glass. Thus, it is desirable that the refractive indexes of the soot layers are kept identical by adding one or more of the selected dopants or by not adding any dopant.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">Meanwhile, the base material rod used in the method explained above may be manufactured also according to the jacketing method.

In the case of implementing the jacketing method, the glass rod and the jacketed tubes may be made of mutually different composition materials, and the outer periphery of the core rods or the inner and outer surfaces of the jacketed tubes may be kept relatively rough.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional surface of a multicore optical amplifying fiber according to an eighth embodiment.

For example, helium (He) gas is circulated for the purpose of reducing the OH radical during vitrification. The He gas enters the gap formed among the glass particles. However, when the soot layers get consolidated thereby resulting in vitrification, the He gas gets confined inside the glass and turns into air bubbles. Herein, in the case of circulating the He gas, relatively large air bubbles are formed with ease.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">Regarding this phenomenon, when the inventors of the present disclosure carried out keen examination, it was understood that, since the He gas has a small atomic weight or a small molecular weight, even if the soot gets consolidated, the He gas may still easily diffuse to some extent inside the soot and may coagulate, thereby resulting in easy formation of relatively large air bubbles. In that regard, the present inventors presumed that updating the atomic weight or the molecular weight of the gas circulated at the time of vitrification would enable controlling the diameter of the air bubbles. For example, as an inert gas, if a rare gas, such as the argon (Ar) gas or the xenon (Xe) gas, that is a large-molecular-weight gas having a greater atomic weight or a greater molecular weight than the He gas is circulated; then relatively smaller air bubbles may be formed because the ease of diffusion or the extent of coagulation is lower than the He gas. Alternatively, it is also possible to circulate a mixed gas of the He gas and a large-molecular-weight gas. In that case, if the partial pressure or the flow ratio of the large-molecular-weight gas in the mixed gas is increased, then the diameter of the air bubbles may be relatively reduced. Thus, the diameter may be controlled by controlling the partial pressure or the flow ratio.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a configuration of a multicore optical fiber amplifier according to an 11-th embodiment.

When the measurement was taken for the other core portions, an identical absorption spectrum was obtained.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">The length of the multicore optical amplifying fiber was 35 m, and the pumping light having the power of 16 W was supplied from a semiconductor laser. Then, from each single-mode optical fiber of the optical fiber fan in, WDM signal lights of eight channels, which were arranged at equal wavelength intervals in the range of 1530 nm to 1565 nm, were input after adjusting them to achieve the total power of &#x2212;5 dBm. As a result, from each single-mode optical fiber of the optical fiber fan out, amplified signal lights were obtained that had a relatively higher level of power close to 20 dBm, such as the total power of 19.0 dBm per core portion. The inter-channel power deviation of the amplified WDM signal lights was equal to or smaller than 4 dB. Moreover, the difference of gains among the core portions of the multicore optical amplifying fiber was equal to or smaller than 3 dB in each channel.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">As a comparison example, optical amplifiers were manufactured in which various multicore optical amplifying fibers having no air bubbles were used, and an experiment was carried out under identical conditions regarding the pumping light and identical conditions regarding the WDM signal lights. In each case, the total power per core portion was about 15 dBm.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a configuration of an optical communication system according to a 12-th embodiment.
