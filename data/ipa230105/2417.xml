boronic acid and is represented by the structural Formula I.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="37.00mm" wi="65.19mm"

be represented as an N-protected dipeptide and may be written as Pyz-Phe-boro-Leu, which stands for pyrazinoic acid, phenylalanine and leucine having a boronic acid group in place of carboxylic acid. It is a proteosome inhibitor in organisms and is believed to function as a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0004">Bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro and causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma. Bortezomib presently is approved in USA for the treatment of multiple myeloma, relapsed multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma. A variety of combination therapies have been investigated for treating multiple myeloma, in which Bortezomib is administered with one or more other biologically active substances, such as lenalidomide, dexamethasone, melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, carmustine, pomalidomide, vorinostat, tanespimycin, and perifosine. Other potential uses of bortezomib also have been reported, including treatment of amyloidosis.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0005">It is available in the market under the brand name &#x201c;VELCADE&#x2122;&#x201d; in the form of injection. Each vial contains 3.5 mg of Bortezomib as a sterile lyophilized powder. Chemistry review section of summary basis of approval for Bortezomib (NDA 21-602) mentions that the drug substance, drug product and the reconstituted drug product have three different molecular forms. PS-341 (Bortezomib) drug substance exists as the trimeric boroxine in the solid state. When exposed to water, the boroxine hydrolyses to monomeric boronic acid PS-341. The structure of the lyophilized PS-341 drug product has been determined to be symmetrical mannitol ester. While reconstituted by 0.9% NaCl solution, the reconstituted PS-341 drug product consists of equilibrium between the mannitol ester and the PS-341 boronic acid.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0006">Adams et al in U.S. Pat.
