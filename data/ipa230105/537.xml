Other reasons for obtaining tattoos include permanent cosmetic applications and to cover scars or blemishes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Permanent tattoos are created by piercing the skin with needles or similar instruments to mechanically deliver an ink, which includes small particles of pigments/dyes suspended in a carrier, into the dermis of an individual. The creation of a permanent tattoo requires the insertion/implantation of pigments, dyes, and/or chromophores which are not dissolvable and/or biodegradable. Following mechanical insertion of the ink particles and during the healing process, the majority of the ink particles, 70-80%, are engulfed by phagocytic skin cells (such as fibroblasts and macrophages) or retained in the extracellular matrix of the dermis and the remaining ink particles are found such that 10-15% of the ink particles lie flattened on collagen fibers and 5-10% of the ink particles lie attached on the serosal side of capillaries. Over time, the tattoo inks may migrate and descend deeper into the dermis, so the tattoos become blurred and duller.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite the wide acceptance and popularity of permanent tattoos, there is a significant demand for the removal of tattoos. Removal of tattoos, however, represents a complex process that most typically involves the use of high power lasers. The current state-of-the-art for tattoo removal is performed using a variety of lasers which induce degradation of the inks to achieve tattoo removal. The laser conditions require matching the laser frequencies to the particles according to their size, composition, color, and depth in the dermis. The laser is applied to the tattoo such that the pigments, dyes, and/or chromophores of the ink particles absorb the laser light and the laser pulses dissociate and degrade the pigments, dyes, and/or chromophores components of the ink particles into small(er) fragments. The fragmented ink components may become essentially colorless and small enough to be absorbed by the body and removed from the dermis. Nonetheless, laser-based removal of tattoos has several shortcomings. For example, lasers induce heating of the skin and can cause burns as well as other undesirable tissue damage which can cause some scarring or color variations that are likely to remain after healing. Current laser-based procedures for tattoo removal may therefore be somewhat ineffective at complete removal of tattoo inks, require multiple treatments at a high cost, cause pain, and can result in scarring, disfigurement, and depigmentation of the treated skin.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide a system and methods for tattoo removal using non-laser-based approaches. It would also be advantageous to provide methods that enable removal/extraction of the degraded ink components, such as dyes, pigments and other chromophores, from the body to reduce absorption by the body of potentially harmful/toxic chemicals.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present teachings to provide a system and method for removing a tattoo from a subject by exposing ink particles trapped within the dermis to cold plasma.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an additional object of the present teachings to provide such a system and method which allows for the extraction of the residue of plasma-treated tattoo ink particles, which may have toxic properties, and of other degradation components from the subject's skin tissues.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is yet another object of the present teachings to provide methods for removing tattoos which can be performed in one or more treatments and which are effectively less painful to the subject being treated than current conventional methods of tattoo removal.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is still a further object of the present teachings to provide methods of tattoo removal which can address the limitations of current state-of-the-art removal methods (i.e., laser-based removal systems) to reduce issues with skin scarring, skin color bleaching, and residual tattoo shadowing remaining after removal treatment(s).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A method and system using cold plasma to remove tattoos from a subject has been developed. In one embodiment, the method for tattoo removal is based on application of a cold plasma which can dislodge and degrade tattoo ink particles trapped within a subject's dermis to facilitate the removal of the mobilized ink particles and/or degradation products thereof from the subject's dermis and surrounding tissues and render the tattoo invisible, non-discernible, and/or undetectable.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In preferred embodiments, the cold plasma is delivered to the subject's dermis via one or more needle or probe-like structures that penetrate the subject's tattooed skin. The cold plasma interacts with constituents present within the dermis such as, but not limited to, the tattoo ink particles themselves, macrophages, fibroblasts, cell membranes, collagen fibers, and capillaries and other cellular and non-cellular constituents of the dermis which have trapped the tattoo ink particles in such a manner as to effectively disrupt the tissue components and dislodge the trapped tattoo ink particles. The cold plasma may also induce degradation of certain types of the ink particles, which are composed of organic and/or inorganic pigments, dyes, and/or chromophores and give color to the ink particles. In preferred embodiments, the cold plasma both dislodges and degrades the trapped ink particles without causing any damage or any significant amount of thermal or other type of irreparable damage to the plasma exposed dermis or other surrounding tissue.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In preferred embodiments, the cold plasma effectively dislodges and degrades all or a portion of the tattoo ink particles during a single or multiple tattoo removal treatment. In some embodiments, multiple treatments may be applied wherein the number of treatments depends on factors such as the size and complexity of the tattoo and on the health of the individual and/or individual's skin. In some embodiments, the dislodged ink particles and degradation by-products thereof can be mobilized to remove them from the subject's dermis and surrounding tissues prior to their recapture by the natural protection mechanisms of the skin, which can otherwise result in a shadowing effect or prior to their transport through the lymphatic channels and deposition in lymph nodes.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the mobilization step involves the delivery of a pharmaceutically acceptable mobilization fluid which facilitates the removal of the dislodged and degraded ink particles and by-products thereof. The mobilization fluid delivered to the plasma treated dermis is extracted in a subsequent extraction step such as by the application of suction. The extraction of the mobilization fluid containing the dislodged and degraded ink particles from the dermis and surrounding tissues removes the tattoo from the skin.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In preferred embodiments, all or a portion of the dislodged and degraded tattoo ink particles and by-products thereof are extracted from the subject's tattooed dermis during the extraction step. By degrading, dislodging and removing the tattoo ink particles, the tattoo on skin treated according to the method described herein becomes undetectable, invisible, and/or non-discernible to the naked eye. In certain other embodiments, the cold plasma can degrade all or a portion of the tattoo ink particles and the degradation by-products are converted into colorless components and the tattoo becomes undetectable, invisible, and/or non-discernible to the naked eye. In such embodiments, treatment of the tattoo ink particles with cold plasma may render the ink particles down to their colorless atomic, molecular, and/or gaseous components, such as carbon dioxide or water. In some embodiments, the colorless components may not need to be removed or otherwise extracted from the skin if the tattoo has otherwise been rendered undetectable, invisible, and/or non-discernible to the naked eye. In other embodiments, the dislodged and degraded ink particles and degradation by-products thereof which are rendered into colorless components may be absorbed by natural processes from the interstitial fluid of the dermis or elsewhere in the body.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The extraction of the degraded and dislodged ink particles and by-products thereof from the subject's skin is advantageous as the ink particles, components and degradation by-products thereof may have toxic properties which could potentially have harmful effects if absorbed by the subject's body.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, a system for removal of tattoos using cold plasma is formed of (1) cold plasma generation component; (2) optional fluid delivery component; and (3) fluid extraction component. The cold plasma generation component is coupled and connected to a treatment component for delivery of the cold plasma to the tattooed dermis of a subject. The fluid delivery component of the system delivers mobilization fluid to the treatment component which in turn is used to deliver the fluid to the tattooed dermis and surrounding tissue. The mobilization fluid is formed of a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation and facilitates the removal of dislodged and degraded tattoo ink particles and degradation by-products thereof and tissue degradation by-products formed or created during or after exposure to the cold plasma.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The fluid extraction component of the system is coupled and connected to the treatment component to provide suction for extraction of the mobilization fluid and/or removal/extraction of dislodged and degraded tattoo ink particles which may be present in the natural fluids present in the dermis or surrounding tissue directly.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments of the system, the cold plasma generation component, fluid delivery component, and a fluid extraction component may be incorporated into a combined free-standing treatment component. In some embodiments, the fluid delivery component may be excluded from the combined treatment component.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In preferred embodiments, the application of a cold plasma, mobilization fluid, and/or extraction (i.e., suction) steps via the treatment component to the tattooed dermis and surrounding tissue is controlled by a skilled/trained operator or technician and the treatment is applied with a high level of precision. In preferred embodiments, all or a portion of the tattoo ink particles are dislodged, degraded, and extracted from the subject's tattooed dermis, to render the tattoo undetectable, invisible, and/or non-discernible to the naked eye.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">These and other features of the applicant's teachings are set forth herein.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The skilled person in the art will understand that the drawings, described below, are for illustration purposes only.

Definitions</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">&#x201c;Cold plasma,&#x201d; as used herein refers to a non-thermal or atmospheric plasma, generated by subjecting a gas(es) to a strong electrical field with a rapidly changing polarity to create a plasma which may contain electrons, highly energetic positively or negatively charged ions, and chemically active species such as ozone, hydroxyl radicals, nitrous oxides and other excited atoms or molecules. In particular, cold or non-thermal plasmas are created at or near standard atmospheric pressure and have temperatures which are close to or near room temperature which are non-damaging when applied to tissue. Contacting tissue with a cold plasma does not increase the tissue temperature at all or significantly, typically only by a few degrees or less.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x201c;Connected,&#x201d; and &#x201c;coupled,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to directly coupling (i.e., connecting) one element (i.e., output) of a system or component to another element (i.e. input) by any suitable means available, such as, for example, through tubing. Optionally, other intervening elements may also be present.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">&#x201c;Color,&#x201d; as used herein, is broadly defined as a detectable property determined by a substance's electromagnetic absorption and/or emission in the visible spectrum.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">&#x201c;Colorless,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to when essentially no color can be detected apart from the normal coloration of the surroundings (such as skin or other tissue) by the naked eye under normal lighting conditions, for example, diffuse sunlight or standard artificial lighting.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">&#x201c;Dislodged,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the release of tattoo ink particles from local skin cells and tissue structures such as cells, membranes, and/or tissues, typically found in the dermis.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">&#x201c;Degraded,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the breakdown of the organic and/or inorganic components of tattoo ink particles due to interaction with an energetic cold plasma via processes that include, but are not limited to, oxidation, reduction, fragmentation, electron decomposition, ion decomposition, or other degradation pathways. Degradation generally refers to a breakdown of a colored organic pigment, dye, or chromophore and/or to the breakdown of the particle size of colored inorganic ink particles which causes them to become colorless. Degradation can come about through the disruption of crystals or amorphic masses of elements such carbon, or by the breaking of chemical bonds in organic or inorganic compounds.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">&#x201c;Pigment, dye, or chromophore,&#x201d; as used herein, are terms that refer to organic and/or inorganic substance(s) which are colored and impart color to a tattoo ink.

The plasma <b>10</b> may be delivered by any suitable means known. In preferred embodiments the cold plasma <b>10</b> is delivered to the dermis <b>12</b> via one or more needle or probe-like structures <b>20</b> that can penetrate the subject's tattooed skin. Those skilled in the art will be able to determine the penetration depth of the one of more needle or probe-like structures to deliver the plasma to the tattooed dermis.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0045">It is believed that the cold plasma delivered to a subject's tattooed dermis results in the cold plasma interacting with constituents present within the dermis such as, but not limited to, macrophages, fibroblasts, other cells, collagen fibers, and capillaries which have trapped the tattoo ink particle, in a sufficient amount to effectively disrupt the local dermal skin cells and tissue structures holding the particles and dislodge the trapped tattoo ink particles from the dermis and surrounding tissues. The cold plasma also may induce degradation of the ink particles, which are composed of organic and/or inorganic pigments, dyes, and/or chromophores and give color to the ink particles. Such degradation can result from the interaction of the energetic plasma constituents with the organic and/or inorganic components of the ink particles to degrade them via such processes as oxidation, reduction, fragmentation, electron decomposition, ion decomposition, or other degradation pathways.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0046">In preferred embodiments, the cold plasma both dislodges and degrades the trapped ink particles without causing a significant amount of thermal or other type of irreparable damage to the subject's dermis or surrounding tissue.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0047">In some embodiments of the method, the exposure time of the dermis to the cold plasma needed to dislodge and degrade the tattoo ink particles can be as short as one microsecond, but is more preferably a longer period of time, in the range from about one microsecond up to about one hour. In some embodiments, the cold plasma effectively dislodges and degrades the ink particles at the point of plasma exposure within a period of time of 60 minutes or less, more preferably 10 minutes or less. In certain embodiments, the cold plasma may effectively dislodge and degrade all or a portion of the tattoo ink particles within a single tattoo removal treatment. In other embodiments, multiple treatments using cold plasma according to the methods described may be applied. The number of treatments depends on factors such as the area/size and complexity of the tattoo (for example, multi-colored and/or multi-layered tattoo and the age and settling of tattoo inks into lower portion of dermis over time) and on the health of the individual and/or individual's skin. In some non-limiting embodiments, tattooed skin having an area of up to 5 square inches may be treated in as little as one treatment. For tattoos having a larger surface area/size and/or complexity, repeated treatments may be applied with an intervening period time passing between treatments, such as up to one week, up to two weeks, up to three weeks, up to one month, up to two months, or up to three months; longer periods of time may pass between treatments as needed. In preferred embodiments of the method, the temperature of the dermis or other surrounding tissues is not increased by exposure to the cold plasma. In certain other embodiments, the temperature of the dermis or other surrounding tissues when exposed to a plasma treatment is not increased at all or significantly, only increasing by about 1&#xb0; to about 5&#xb0; C. above normal body temperature, which is below the temperatures needed to induce any significant amount of thermal damage or pain. The application of cold plasma to the dermis for tattoo removal is not expected to produce blanching and/or bleaching of the subject's natural skin color or pigmentation.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the dislodged ink particles <b>14</b> and degradation by-products thereof are mobilized in a mobilization step to remove them from the subject's dermis and surrounding tissues <b>12</b> prior to their recapture by the natural protection mechanisms of the skin, which can result in a re-tattooing effect. In some embodiments, the mobilization step involves the delivery of a pharmaceutically acceptable mobilization fluid <b>24</b>, preferably through the same one or more needle or probe-like structures used to deliver the cold plasma <b>22</b>. The mobilization fluid <b>24</b> facilitates the removal of the dislodged and degraded ink particles <b>14</b> and by-products thereof from the dermis <b>12</b>. The mobilization fluid delivered to the cold plasma treated dermis is extracted in a subsequent extraction step which can be accomplished by any suitable means, such as by the application of suction. Suction, as used herein, refers to at least a partial vacuum created at the ends of the one or more needle or probe-like structures described above, such that the mobilization fluid containing the dislodged and degraded ink particles <b>26</b> is drawn away and extracted from the dermis and surrounding tissues. In some embodiments, suction is applied as a continuous suction or, alternatively, suction can be applied as a non-continuous pulsing suction. In some embodiments, no mobilization fluid is administered during or after the plasma treatment and the dislodged ink particles and degradation by-products thereof are removed by extraction (i.e., suction) of natural bodily fluid(s) containing the particles and by-products from the dermis and/or surrounding tissue during the extraction step.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0049">In preferred embodiments, all or a portion of the dislodged and degraded tattoo ink particles are extracted from a tattoo during the extraction step. By removing dislodged and degraded tattoo ink particles, the tattoo on skin treated according to the method described becomes undetectable, invisible, and/or non-discernible. By definition, an effective amount of cold plasma is applied to cause the colors in the original tattoo in the treated area to become undetectable, invisible and/or non-discernible. In some embodiments, treatment of the tattoo ink particles with cold plasma may render the ink particles down to their colorless atomic, molecular, and/or gaseous components, such as carbon dioxide or water, and the colorless components may not require removal or extraction from the skin if the tattoo has otherwise been rendered undetectable, invisible, and/or non-discernible to the naked eye. In such embodiments, the portion of dislodged and degraded ink particles and degradation by-products thereof which are rendered into colorless components and which remain in the dermis may be absorbed through the interstitial fluid of the body. In such embodiments the method involves dislodging and degrading tattoo ink particles by applying a cold plasma to a subject's tattooed dermis; wherein the cold plasma is applied in an effective amount to a subject's dermis to render the tattoo undetectable, invisible, and/or non-discernible. The application of the steps of mobilizing the dislodged and degraded ink particles and by-products thereof and extracting the dislodged and degraded ink particles and by-products thereof from the subject's dermis as described above are optional and determined at the discretion of the skilled technician or operator applying the tattoo removal method to the subject's tattooed skin.

The complete cycle may be repeated any number of times as necessary to effectively remove the tattoo by dislodging and degrading tattoo ink particles from the subject's dermis and tissue. The preferred number of cycles which may be applied are typically in the range of one to 100 cycles, or more. In certain other embodiments, all of the steps are applied concurrently. In a non-limiting example, the dislodgement (application of cold plasma to tattooed dermis), mobilization, which may include the introduction of a mobilization fluid to the dermis, and the extraction step, which involves removal of the mobilization fluid containing the dislodged and degraded ink particles and degradation by-products thereof, or in some instances where no mobilization fluid is used, removes the dislodged and degraded ink particles and degradation by-products thereof directly. In some other embodiments, the steps of dislodgement and mobilization occur concurrently and are followed by the extraction step and form a cycle which is performed at least one or more times, as necessary to remove the tattoo ink from the subject's dermis and rendering the tattoo undetectable, invisible, and/or non-discernible.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0052">In a preferred embodiment of the method described above can further include a pretreatment of the surface of the tattooed skin with an antibiotic solution in order to prevent the introduction of infectious organisms present on the surface to the skin into the dermis during treatment.
