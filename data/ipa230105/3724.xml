The developed diagnostics microneedle-based device can be easily worn on the individual's skin and can measure concentrations of various biomarkers including, for example, protein biomarkers in a real-time mode directly inside the ISF.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The analysis is performed on the aptamer-modified electrodes which are in the form of microneedles (e.g., polymeric hollow microneedles) and acting as electrochemical sensors. Aptamers functionalized by a redox reporter molecule (e.g. methylene blue or anthraquinone) specifically and reversibly bind to the analyte of interest, upon which a folding in the conformation of the electrode-bound aptamer occurs. This binding-induced folding leads to a change in the electron transfer characteristics of the redox molecule that is corresponding to the target biomarker's concentration and is detected using electrochemical techniques, e.g. square wave voltammetry (SWV).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">While the present document describes application of the disclosed technology to real-time aptamer-assisted measurement of cortisol and insulin biomarkers as model analytes, the technology disclosed in this patent document is readily expandable to the continuous monitoring of any biomarkers such as, for example, hormone, and proteins of interest through binding to their relevant aptamer-based biorecognition elements.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The in-vivo stable electrochemical detection of the target analytes present in the ISF can be achieved, according to the technology disclosed herein, with no surface fouling through using an effective anti-biofouling self-assembled monolayer on a surface of a microneedle electrode or a hydrogel coating. Furthermore, the aptamers can be rationally engineered in-vitro to implement the analyte detection in a desired concentration window.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Unlike microneedle-based enzymatic sensing, the disclosed technology expands the capabilities of microneedle sensors to widen the scope of biomarkers that can be detected. Sensing of such biomarkers commonly rely on immunoassays which are not always feasible to perform at the microneedle tip.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another highly important aspect of the disclosed technology is the integration of aptamer-based electrochemical sensing with enzymatic sensing on a single microneedle array device toward continuous real-time reversible monitoring of multiple biomarkers simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Currently there is no available device for the minimally-invasive or non-invasive continuous monitoring of various biomarkers and the only methods available for measuring biomarkers are based on the traditional ways of sampling blood using hypodermic needles followed by quantification using external meters/techniques in centralized laboratories (mostly using ELISA method which is highly time-consuming and expensive). Such methods have significant disadvantages, including patient discomfort, the need for relatively high sample volume, and the generation of sharp waste. More importantly, they cannot track trends and fluctuations in the levels of biomarkers and thus, cannot provide real-time information regarding the biomarker concentrations.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">There is currently no viable technology to provide real-time on-body information regarding concentrations of different biomarkers and developing a wearable multiplexed sensor capable of continuously monitoring the dynamically changing levels of different disease markers at the same time would be of critical significance for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">There have been many examples of sensors that detect physiologically relevant biomarkers in-vitro, but yet there is no example of biosensors for in-vivo detection of ISF biomarkers. Wearable on-body biosensing has a potential to revolutionize healthcare by enabling personalized medicine. Through providing clinically relevant health information on a continuous basis using wearable non-invasive sensors, an individual's health conditions can be well understood, providing a platform to disease diagnosis, prognosis and management. The present document shows examples of wearable on-body sensor devices for continuous real-time monitoring of various biomarkers which obviate the cost and complexity of traditional immunoassay-based approaches. An example microneedle device based on the technology disclosed in this patent document can be used for multiplexed monitoring of different biomarkers such as, for example, cortisol, insulin, ketone bodies, and glucose for diabetic patients. Such a device can be in a form of a fully-integrated wearable microneedle patch which can be used for self-monitoring and/or used by healthcare providers. The aptamer-based microneedle sensing protocol described herein can be readily expanded to the detection of other biomarkers of interest. This takes a leap forward in the field of disease diagnostics and personalized healthcare.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The microneedle aptamer-based electrochemical sensing devices described herein are the first demonstration of combining electrochemical aptamer-based sensing with microneedle devices for diagnostic applications. This novel electrochemical platform is also the first example of a wearable on-body patch capable of non-invasively monitoring different biomarkers in the ISF.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Various embodiments of the microneedle based sensor devices according to the technology disclosed in this patent document integrate sensing of biomarkers using aptamers with other sensing modalities and/or strategies, including, but not limited to, enzymatic detection of important metabolite biomarkers on a single microneedle array platform, as it has been shown herein on the example of simultaneous detection of four important diabetes-related analytes, i.e. cortisol, insulin, ketone bodies, and glucose.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The application of microneedles for diagnostic and monitoring purposes has received much attention over the last decade in view of the rich molecular information contained in the interstitial fluid. However, direct sensing of the ISF markers at a microneedle tip is usually carried out using enzyme-modified microneedle electrode transducers. These rely on reversible biocatalytic reactions of the corresponding substrates.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In contrast, implementation of common bioaffinity assays, such as immunoassays, at the microneedle tips faces a barrier owing to the strong interaction between the target antigen and the capture antibody which makes the regeneration of the antibody receptor extremely difficult, along with the need for several washing and incubation steps. Often such assays also require additional incubation steps with related tagged reagents to perform competitive or sandwich assays, which are not always feasible to perform at the tips of microneedles.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The only reports on the microneedle-assisted antibody-based biomarkers analysis are either based on the sampling the ISF including the biomarkers or the selective capture of specific biomarkers through their binding to the antibodies functionalized on the surface of microneedles, followed by off-body analysis procedures. None of these reports have the capability to adapt to the continuous monitoring of the biomarkers directly at the microneedle tip. As a result, the use of microneedle ISF sensors have not been reported for in-vivo bioaffinity monitoring of ISF biomarkers and the realization of in-situ real-time bioaffinity assays on the microneedle tip toward ISF monitoring of various markers remains as a major challenge.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present document describes the realization of real-time bioaffinity assays on a microneedle tip electrode through the use of reversible binding, conformation-dependent aptamers.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Aptamers have recently shown great promise for the real-time and continuous monitoring of therapeutic drugs in live animals using electrochemical approaches. However, these aptamers have been reported toward continuous monitoring of drugs and other small analytes only, and they have not been used for in-vivo monitoring of higher-molecular-weight analytes (e.g., proteins etc.). Also, they have been applied through invasive methods using, for example, 18-gauge catheters.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">By combining the microneedles and aptamer-based electrochemical sensing in the disclosed technology, we demonstrate the first example of in-situ bioaffinity-based monitoring of biomarkers (including protein biomarkers) in a non-invasive fashion.

The gold wire of the electrode probe structure <b>127</b> can be insulated with parylene (a poly(para-xylylene) polymer) conformal coating, for example. The parylene coating can create a highly uniform, pinhole-free and chemically-resistant coating of, e.g., about 30 microns thick for the Au wire. The parylene coating can serve multiple purposes including electrical insulation, chemical isolation, and mechanical protection of the wire, for example. The parylene coating of the gold wire of the electrode probe structure <b>127</b> can be configured to expose a reproducible surface area of the wire for conduction of electrochemical measurements.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">High-affinity aptamer sequences, developed using, for example, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) approach to be specific for a target analyte (e.g., to be able to bind to the target analyte (e.g., a biomarker such as insulin) in, for example, a reversible fashion), can be tethered to the Au wire of the electrode probe structure <b>127</b> via 5&#x2032;-thiol links, for example. The aptamer sequences can be functionalized with a redox reporter molecule, e.g. methylene blue or anthraquinone, at the 3&#x2032; end or 5&#x2032; end of the aptamer sequence, such that selective binding of the target biomarker to the aptamer sequence would bring the redox reporter closer to the surface of the Au wire of the electrode probe structure <b>127</b> to facilitate electron transfer between the reporter molecule and the electrode probe structure <b>127</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Aptamers functionalized by a redox reporter molecule (e.g., methylene blue or anthraquinone) can specifically and reversibly bind to a compound of interest, upon which a folding in the conformation of the electrode-bound aptamer occurs. This binding-induced folding can lead to a change in the electron transfer characteristics of the redox molecule that is corresponding to the concentration of the target compound of interest and is detected using electrochemical detection techniques such as square wave voltammetry (SWV) implemented for aptamer-functionalized electrodes of the sensor device <b>100</b>. The multiplexed detection of different biomarkers can be achieved through labeling aptamers with different redox reporters having different redox characteristics or by spatially localized measurement of current signals of a single redox tag.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Electrochemical detection modalities or measurement techniques other than square wave voltammetry can be employed for detection of a target analyte at any of the working microneedle electrodes <b>120</b> or <b>130</b> of the sensor device <b>100</b>. Among the possible electrochemical measurement techniques that can be employed by the sensor device <b>100</b> the following ones can be mentioned.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A potentiometric measurement technique is the one where an open circuit potential of the electrochemical cell is measured directly. This potential can be measured between a reference electrode (e.g., the reference electrode <b>110</b> of the sensor device <b>100</b>) and a working electrode (e.g., the working electrode <b>120</b> or the working electrode <b>130</b> of the sensor device <b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The potentiometric measurement technique is contrasted with the amperometric family of measurements that measure current while controlling the cell potential. For example, chronoamperometry is a powerful tool for measuring diffusion-controlled reactions. In chronoamperometry, the potential is stepped at the beginning of a measurement and then remains constant throughout the duration of the measurement. The current that results from this stimulus is plotted as a function of time.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Voltammetry techniques vary the potential as a function of time. The resulting current is plotted as a function of potential. For example, cyclic voltammetry (CV) sweeps the potential of the cell linearly across a voltage range, while a fast scan CV (FSCV) technique does this at a faster rate. Square-wave voltammetry (SWV) uses a square wave superimposed over a staircase function to provide a sweeping measurement that provides two sampling instances per potential. As a result of this sampling technique, the contribution to the total current that results from non-faradic currents is minimized. Like CV, the current is plotted as a function of potential.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the electrode probe structure <b>137</b> of the microneedle electrode <b>130</b> can be structured in the same or in a similar way to the electrode probe structure <b>127</b> of the microneedle electrode <b>120</b>. The aptamer sequences tethered to the Au wire of the electrode probe structure <b>137</b> can be tailored to bind to an analyte different from the target analyte which is specific to the aptamer sequences that are tethered to the Au wire of the electrode probe structure <b>127</b>. For example, the aptamer sequences tethered to the Au wire of the electrode probe structure <b>137</b> can be configured to bind to cortisol. Note that, similar to insulin, cortisol is an important diabetes-related biomarker. As such, the microneedle electrode <b>120</b> of the device <b>100</b> can be configured to detect a first analyte (e.g., insulin), while the microneedle electrode <b>130</b> of the device <b>100</b> can be configured to detect a second analyte (e.g., cortisol) that is different from the first analyte.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In certain embodiments of the device <b>100</b>, the aptamer sequences of the electrode probe structure <b>127</b> can be functionalized with a first type of redox reporter molecule (e.g. methylene blue) while the aptamer sequences of the electrode probe structure <b>137</b> can be functionalized with a second type of redox reporter molecule (e.g., anthraquinone) that is different from the first type of redox reporter molecule. In other embodiments, both the aptamer sequences of the electrode probe structure <b>127</b> and the aptamer sequences of the electrode probe structure <b>137</b> can be functionalized with the same type of redox reporter molecule (e.g., one of methylene blue or anthraquinone).
