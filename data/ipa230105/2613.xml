Cells transplanted in suspension at or near their intended target may adhere and integrate into the target tissue. However, many factors can affect their rate of incorporation into the target tissue, and the cells may not effectively adhere to the intended target. Biopolymer scaffolds can provide a means for retaining cells at their intended target, increasing the rate of incorporation of the transplanted cells into the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In vitro cell culture on polymer scaffolds provides a strategy for tissue creation and cell transplantation. A specific cell line is seeded onto the polymer scaffold. The polymer scaffold should provide good biocompatibility, controllable biodegradability, appropriate tensile strength, and flexibility. While collagen has often been used as a biopolymer scaffold, extensive cross-linking of the collagen is often required to provide the biopolymer with the requisite tensile strength which in turn reduces its flexibility, making it difficult to manipulate during both cell culture and transplantation. Furthermore, such biopolymer scaffolds are generally hazy and unsuitable for implantation in the eye.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to one example (&#x201c;Example 1&#x201d;), provided herein is a reinforced biopolymer comprising i) a synthetic support membrane and ii) a biopolymer, the reinforced biopolymer having a) a measured optical transparency of at least 85%;

By permitting mass transport across the synthetic support membrane, nutrients can diffuse across the membrane to reach cells on the surface of the biopolymer, and cellular waste byproducts can diffuse away from the cells and across the membrane. The mass transfer coefficient of the synthetic support membrane can be adapted to a desired use, increasing or decreasing mass transport potential across the synthetic support membrane.

In certain embodiments, the synthetic support membrane has a thickness of about 0.5 &#x3bc;m, about 1 &#x3bc;m, about 1.5 &#x3bc;m, about 2 &#x3bc;m, about 2.5 &#x3bc;m, about 3 &#x3bc;m, about 3.5 &#x3bc;m, about 4 &#x3bc;m, about 4.5 &#x3bc;m, about 5 &#x3bc;m, about 5.5 &#x3bc;m, about 6 &#x3bc;m, about 6.5 &#x3bc;m, about 7 &#x3bc;m, about 7.5 &#x3bc;m, about 8 &#x3bc;m, about 8.5 &#x3bc;m, about 9 &#x3bc;m, about 9.5 &#x3bc;m, or about 10 &#x3bc;m. As described in detail below, in certain instances, the wetting out process can cause the synthetic support membrane to &#x201c;collapse,&#x201d; with a decrease in membrane thickness. The thicknesses provided above refer to the &#x201c;collapsed&#x201d; synthetic support membrane following wetting out and as it appears in the composite reinforced biopolymer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In certain embodiments, the biopolymer includes collagen, gelatin, laminin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, elastin, thrombospondin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, polysaccharides, alginate, chitosan, glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronic acid, or a combination of any two or more of these. In particular embodiments, the biopolymer includes a collagen. Many of these components may exist in different forms or as different types. For example, there are many different types of collagen (e.g., Types I, II, III, etc.) and gelatin (e.g., Type A, Type B). Further, these components may be derived from a variety of sources. It is contemplated that any type or form, derived from any source, may be included in a biopolymer described herein.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the biopolymer also includes one or more additives, such as, for example, a coating or imbibing aid, a viscosity modifier, a density modifier, or a biopolymer cross-linker.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A single biopolymer layer occurring on one side of the synthetic support membrane can have a thickness of about 0 &#x3bc;m to about 95 &#x3bc;m. In some embodiments, the biopolymer is fully imbibed into the synthetic support membrane on one side of the synthetic support, the biopolymer layer thus having a thickness of about 0 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In certain instances, the biopolymer of the reinforced biopolymer is cross-linked. Cross-linking the biopolymer can increase its tensile strength and thermostability. Methods for cross-linking biopolymer elements contemplated herein such as collagen, gelatin, laminin, fibronectin and the like are known in the art. Cross-linking, while increasing tensile strength, can have the negative effect of reducing the &#x2018;stickiness&#x2019; of the biopolymer and it ability to retain cells and/or adhere to tissue in vivo. An advantage of the reinforced biopolymers disclosed herein is that because of the synthetic support membrane, the biopolymer does not need to be crosslinked to increase its tensile strength; the strength and toughness of the reinforced biopolymer is provided by the synthetic support membrane. Although the biopolymer may still be cross-linked, it does not need to be cross-linked as extensively as it would need to be if the synthetic support membrane were not present. This permits the biopolymer to retain its stickiness and ability to retain cells and/or adhere to tissues in vivo. Cross-linking the biopolymer may be done to, for example, increase the thermostability of the biopolymer so that it may be implanted in vivo without liquefying. The extent or level of cross-linking necessary to achieve the desired thermostability is generally lower than that required to achieve significant gains in tensile strength.

The surface may be functionalized by, for example, including cell adhesion molecules, antigens, epitopes, and/or stem cell differentiation factors at the surface of the biopolymer layer. It will be recognized that such functionalization factors are cell-specific, and can be selected according to the specific cell type.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In certain instances, the biopolymer layer(s) is configured to minimize or avoid an inflammatory response when implanted in vivo.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The thickness of the reinforced biopolymer can be from about 0.5 &#x3bc;m to about 150 &#x3bc;m.

As the toughness of the synthetic support membrane is a few orders of magnitude greater than that of the biopolymer layer(s)&#x2014;even if crosslinked, the toughness of the synthetic support membrane approximates the toughness of the reinforced biopolymer. The contribution of the biopolymer to the toughness of the reinforced biopolymer can be neglected.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The synthetic support membrane-biopolymer composite construction of the reinforced biopolymers described herein results in the biopolymer having sufficient tensile strength and toughness to withstand handling and manipulation during both cell culture procedures and in vivo implantation. Unlike a substrate made up only of biopolymer, which requires extensive cross-linking to achieve sufficient tensile strength to withstand manipulation and implantation, the described reinforced biopolymers are flexible and tough, while minimizing the need to further manipulate (e.g., cross-link) the biopolymer layer(s).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In certain embodiments, a reinforced biopolymer described herein has a measured optical transparency of at least about 85%. In some embodiments, a reinforced biopolymer described herein has a measured optical transparency of at least about 90%. Optical transparency is measured in air with the biopolymer in a fully hydrated state. When measured in air, Fresnel reflection at the outside interfaces between the sample and its environment reduces transmission values compared to optical transparency of the reinforced biopolymer when in use in accordance to the present disclosure. It will be understood that the optical transparency of the reinforced biopolymer in use will be higher than the measured value in air.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Optically transparent reinforced biopolymers can be used, for example, as substrates or vehicles for delivering cells to the eye without adversely affecting the eye's optics. For example, a monolayer of corneal endothelial cells grown on a surface of a biopolymer layer of a reinforced biopolymer can be implanted at the posterior surface of the cornea, providing a layer of healthy endothelial cells to the cornea (i.e., an endothelial keratoplasty). In another example, retinal pigment epithelial cells can be introduced directly to the retina as a monolayer formed on a surface of a reinforced biopolymer. In both of these examples, the reinforced biopolymers allow normal optical function of the eye, with good transparency and minimal scattering.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The transparency of ePTFE is largely governed by how much residual scattering is present in the bulk of the material. To obtain high specular (clear image-forming) transmission, diffuse (scattered) components in both transmission and reflection must be minimized. This is typically done by either thinning of the structure or incorporation of a substance with a near-matching refractive index (around 1.37 for ePTFE) into ePTFE's microstructure. In some embodiments, the ePTFE synthetic support membrane is prepared according to the methodology describe in U.S. Pat. No. 7,306,729 to Gore, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Some members of this family of membranes possess high clarity while having high degrees of porosity, which normally reduces the amount of visible light passing through the membrane. Certain membranes can have a light transmission, or optical transparency, of at least 50% and a porosity of at least 50%, while light transmission values of 85% and higher are obtainable in membranes that are greater than 75% porous.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The amount of air trapped within the synthetic support membrane and the hydration index of imbibed substances are important determinants in the optical transparency of the support membrane, contributing to the optical transparency of the reinforced biopolymer. In some embodiments, all or substantially all air is expelled from the synthetic support membrane during a wetting out process that occurs prior to the synthetic support membrane being imbibed with a biopolymer. In some instances, the wetting out process results in the membrane &#x201c;collapsing&#x201d; on itself. For example, an ePTFE membrane having a thickness of about 5 &#x3bc;m prior to wetting out may collapse to a thickness of about 1 &#x3bc;m. The wetted out synthetic support membrane is then prepared and imbibed with the desired biopolymer to produce a reinforced biopolymer that is free or substantially free of air. In some instances, where the reinforced biopolymer is imbibed with biopolymer and is free or substantially free of air, it is considered to be &#x201c;fully imbibed.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In certain embodiments, the biopolymer has a refractive index that is the same as or substantially similar to the refractive index of the synthetic supporting membrane.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In another aspect, provided herein are implantable cell therapy devices. The implantable cell therapy device includes a reinforced biopolymer and a monolayer of cells on a surface of the biopolymer that is distal to the synthetic support membrane. The monolayer of cells can include, but is not limited to, corneal endothelial cells, corneal epithelial cells, retinal pigment epithelial cells, photoreceptor cells, M&#xfc;ller glial cells, ganglion cells, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, pericytes, stem cells, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the stem cells are pluripotent stem cells. In other embodiments, the stem cells are multipotent stem cells.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In another aspect, methods of treating a disease or condition are provided. In some instances, the disease or condition affects a cellular layer in a subject. The disease or condition can be, for example, corneal endothelial dystrophy, a disease or condition affecting the retinal pigment epithelium, or a disease or condition affecting the photoreceptors. The methods generally include surgically implanting an implantable cell therapy device described herein on or near the diseased site or otherwise affected area, where the implantable cell therapy device includes a monolayer of cells selected to treat or otherwise improve the disease or condition. For example, corneal endothelial dystrophy can be treated by surgically implanting a cell therapy device including a monolayer of corneal endothelial cells at a posterior surface of the cornea. In some embodiments, the implantation procedure includes first removing some or all of the diseased or non-functional corneal endothelium. A disease or condition of or affecting retinal pigment epithelium can be treated by surgically implanting a cell therapy device including a monolayer of retinal pigment epithelial cells at the retina.

A 3 mil (76.2 &#x3bc;m thick) ePTFE membrane was placed and fixated onto a table. The membrane was then hydrophilically treated and dried. The dry, hydrophilically treated membrane was then mounted onto a hoop. An excess of the gelatin solution was pipetted onto the membrane, and a drawdown procedure using RDS15 Mayer bar was carried out to form a layer of gelatin on the membrane. This procedure involved putting a line of gelatin solution (in excess) across a top edge of the membrane and drawing it down with the Mayer bar. Care was taken not to move the membrane. The membrane immediately wetted out with the gelatin. The formed reinforced biopolymer composite was then allowed to dry. The composite was optionally rewetted to allow for easier peel off. Gelatin layer thickness can be controlled by using different drawdown bars. The membrane with gelatin layer was dried and hydrophilically treated. The dry, treated membrane was then</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Gelatin of the gelatin layer was crosslinked using a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide-N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC-NHS) crosslinking procedure (see, e.g., Kuijpers et al.

Concentrations of EDC/NHS were altered to generate cross linking from 5% to &#x2018;100%&#x2019; (functional groups crosslinked to their maximum in view of steric hinderance). The gelatin weight of the reinforced biopolymer was determined, and the amount of gelatin was used to calculated how much EDC would be required to activate carboxylic acid residues. A 2.5% w/v EDC solution with NHS (molar ratio NHS/EDC=0.2) was prepared. MES buffer (0.05M, pH 5.3) was used to immerse the ePTFE-gelatin composite so the concentration of gelatin was 1 g/50 ml. The required quantity of EDC/NHS solution was subtracted from this volume, and the required quantity of EDC/NHS solution was added.
