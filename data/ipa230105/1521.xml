The positions of the detected regions of a supporting bar are defined in a coordinate system of a numerical controller of the machine tool provided with the supporting bar in question or with the workpiece support in question. The determined actual geometry of the supporting projections is compared with the defined intended geometry in a numerical comparison device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">By determining the actual geometry of supporting projections over the projection height, and by comparing the determined actual geometry with the intended geometry, it is possible to establish the state of a supporting bar and/or of a workpiece support provided with the supporting bar, for example whether, and optionally to what extent, supporting projections of the supporting bars have melted or deformed with a reduction in the projection height. Consequences for subsequent machining processes are drawn from these findings in the event of the machining method executed according to the present disclosure and on the machine tool implemented according to the present disclosure. Specifically, in advance of a cutting machining operation for the workpiece to be machined and taking into account the actual geometry, determined over the projection height, of the supporting projections, a parts occupancy is defined, on the basis of which it is ensured that the subsequent machining process proceeds substantially without disruption and/or that, during the subsequent machining process, a machining result is obtained that meets the relevant quality demands. It is preferably the case that, on the basis of the previously determined actual geometry of the supporting projections and optionally with reference to the deviation of the actual geometry of the supporting projections from the intended geometry, a parts occupancy is defined on the workpiece to be machined, on the basis of which parts occupancy the parts cut free during the subsequent machining process are supported, without tilting, by the supporting projections of the supporting bars. Moreover, conceivable according to aspects of the present disclosure is a parts occupancy on the workpiece to be machined that is dependent on the actual geometry of the supporting projections, so that puncture sites of the cutting beam or a cutting line followed by the cutting beam on the workpiece do not lie above intact supporting projections, and as a result in particular the welding of scraps to supporting projections is avoided.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">The actual geometry of the supporting projections over the projection height is determined according to aspects of the present disclosure by a light section method known in the art, within the course of which a line of light extending in the longitudinal direction of the supporting bar is projected from a light source onto the longitudinal side of a supporting bar, and the line of light is used to scan the longitudinal side of the supporting bar over at least part of the height region, assigned to the supporting projections, of the supporting bar in the direction of the height of the supporting bar. The scanned extent of the longitudinal side of the supporting bar that was scanned using the line of light is detected by means of an optical detector, in particular by means of a camera, to generate an image of the longitudinal side of the supporting bar, and the actual geometry of the supporting projections is determined on the basis of the generated image of the longitudinal side of the supporting bar by means of a numerical evaluation device in accordance with conventional methods.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">It is preferably the case that, according to an aspect of the present disclosure, one or more cameras having coordinated filters are used to image the line of light, which moves on a supporting bar relative thereto in the direction of the height of the supporting bar, and a three-dimensional point cloud is generated from the images by means of the evaluation device according to an aspect of the present disclosure. The evaluation device can derive the state, in particular the height, of the supporting projections on the supporting bar from this point cloud.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">As an alternative or in addition to the imaging triangulation according to the an aspect of the present disclosure, there is the option of detecting the actual geometry of supporting projections on supporting bars of a workpiece support over the projection height capacitively, inductively, on the basis of ultrasound, tactilely or using different imaging methods.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">In this respect, it is possible either to use an individual sensor, which passes over the supporting bar in question in its longitudinal direction, or the supporting projections are detected by means of a sensor array, which extends over the entire length of the supporting bar in question. In the case of a sensor array, depending on the method it is necessary to ensure a sufficiently high, but not excessively high, density of individual sensors in order to allow as high as possible a resolution without disruptive superimposition.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">For the tactile detection of supporting projections, sensors connected in an array, such as gearwheels or a tongue with needles, come into consideration. Measuring balls are also conceivable as tactile sensors.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">In the context of alternative imaging methods, it is possible, for example, for an image in which the entire workpiece support can be seen to be processed by a convolutional artificial neural network and thus for the state of supporting projections of a supporting bar provided as part of a workpiece support to be identified. In this respect, first of all simple shapes (lines in a certain orientation) and, later on, complex shapes composed of simple shapes (supporting projections as a combination of two lines) are identified in the image in multiple steps (layers of the network). By using as many supporting bars and degrees of damage as possible to teach the neural network, it is possible to achieve a very high identification rate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">It is also possible for supporting projections and thus the actual state of supporting bars to be detected by a camera on a cutting head that directs the cutting beam onto the workpiece to be machined. For this purpose, first of all the supporting bar is separated from the background in a recording. Then, the camera, with a fixed focal width and in a state focused on a supporting projection by means of autofocus, is moved in a direction of the height of the supporting bar. The height of the supporting projection can be calculated from the magnitude of the camera movement in a direction of the height of the supporting bar. A corresponding imaging system is offered by TRUMPF (Johann-Maus-Stra&#x3b2;e 2, D-71254 Ditzingen) under the name &#x201c;DetectLine&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">Moreover, by virtue of a camera on a laser beam path, a switched-on laser can be passed over supporting bars of a workpiece support in the longitudinal direction. The strength of the return reflection of the laser light is a measurement for the height of the supporting projections on the supporting bars over which the camera passes in a longitudinal direction. The imaging system likewise offered by TRUMPF under the name &#x201c;PierceLine&#x201d; is suitable for carrying out an imaging method of this type, for example.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">Lastly, as a departure from the light section method according to an aspect of the present disclosure, stripe illumination of the supporting bars in question and a transillumination method come into consideration for detecting the actual geometry of supporting projections of a supporting bar over the projection height.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">In the case of stripe illumination of a supporting bar, different stripe patterns are projected onto the supporting bar in question by a projector. One or more cameras, the relative position of which with respect to the projector and to the supporting bar are known, record the stripe patterns. A three-dimensional point cloud representing the supporting bar can be generated from the resulting images. In the process, it is possible to achieve sub-pixel accuracy, since the stripe patterns are known. The height of the supporting projections on the supporting bar can be easily garnered from the three-dimensional point cloud. In the event of a complex exposure environment, as is encountered frequently in the manufacture of sheet metal, for example, a projection in the non-visible infrared spectrum with coordinated filters in front of the camera(s) can be recommended.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">A transillumination method is carried out on a supporting bar when a workpiece is mounted on the supporting bar. A light source is used to expose the workpiece from underneath at a longitudinal side of the supporting bar over the longitudinal extent of the supporting strip. At the oppositely situated longitudinal side of the supporting bar, the supporting bar is imaged on the bottom side of the workpiece by a camera. The supporting projections of the supporting bars appear as darkened portions here, and the projection interspaces appear bright. The actual state of the supporting projections can be calculated from the silhouette thereof.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">In a preferred configuration of an aspect of the present disclosure, as line of light, a line of laser light is projected onto the longitudinal side of the supporting bar to be detected. Accordingly, a line laser is preferably provided as projector.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033">In a further configuration according to an aspect of the present disclosure, the longitudinal side of the supporting bar in the direction of its height is scanned with the supporting bar stationary and with the line of light being moved in the direction of the height of the supporting bar, and/or with the line of light stationary and with the supporting bar being moved toward the light source or away from the light source.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">In a refinement of an aspect of the present disclosure, the method and the device for determining the actual geometry of supporting projections on a single supporting bar are also used to determine the actual geometry of supporting projections on multiple, preferably all, supporting bars of a workpiece support. In this case, positioning movements are generated in the transverse direction of the supporting bars, by means of which the supporting bars to be detected are advanced toward the light source of the scanning device and the associated optical detector successively into positions in which a scanning operation is carried out.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">To reposition a workpiece support having multiple supporting bars to be detected with respect to a light source provided for all supporting bars and to an associated optical detector, in one refinement of an aspect of the present disclosure, an advancing device is provided, by means of which the workpiece support can be advanced in the transverse direction of the longitudinal sides of the supporting bars into positions in which the longitudinal sides of the supporting bars can be accessed one after the other by the light source and the optical detector of the device for carrying out a light section method.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">The movement axes of which use is made when the longitudinal side of the supporting bars to be detected is being scanned and which are intended to generate the relative movement of the supporting bars and the line of light in the direction of the height of the supporting bar and optionally also the movement axes for repositioning supporting bars between individual scanning operations must have high positioning accuracy.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">In a preferred configuration of the machine tool according to an aspect of the present disclosure, the movement, to be performed for the purpose of scanning the longitudinal side of one or more supporting bars, of the supporting bar(s) and/or the advancing movement of the supporting bar(s) is generated by means of a workpiece transferring device, which in all other respects serves to move the workpiece support provided with the supporting bar(s) into a work area of the machine tool for machining purposes.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">To ensure defined exposure conditions, in a further, preferred configuration of an aspect of the present disclosure, the detection of the actual geometry of the supporting projections is carried out on the supporting bar(s) in question in the interior of an enclosure of the machine tool. In particular, the spatial delimitation of a work area of the machine tool according to an aspect of the present disclosure comes into consideration as enclosure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a machine tool in the form of a laser flatbed machine <b>1</b> for laser cutting metal sheets comprises a machining unit <b>2</b>, a handling device <b>3</b> and a pallet changer <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">A work space <b>5</b> of the machining unit <b>2</b> is provided with an enclosure <b>6</b>.
