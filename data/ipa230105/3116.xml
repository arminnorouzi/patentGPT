Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some described examples generally relate to open hole environments, and in particular, to apparatus and methods for contacting an open hole surface.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Background Information</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Either when a well is drilled/completed, or at some point later in the life cycle of a well, sections of the well infrastructure may be uncased or without liner. That is to say that that the well infrastructure may comprise regions that are &#x201c;open hole&#x201d;. Such open hole regions may exist in a pilot hole, sidetrack, or otherwise at the bottom of a well structure without a liner (e.g. an open hole or barefoot completion).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Open hole sections may exist in onshore and offshore wells. It will be appreciated that the surface or ground region associated with an onshore well may relate to the surface from which the well structure extends into ground and then down to the formation. For an offshore well, the surface or ground region may relate to the mudline, or the like, from which well structure extends down to the formation below.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, a particular type of well is an appraisal (or exploration) well which may be drilled as part of an appraisal process to determine the extent and reserves at a particular field. Appraisal wells may be present at onshore and offshore locations. Appraisal wells may comprise a section having a metallic well structure, such as a conductor or casing, and an open hole section having no metallic well structure. Once the appraisal process is complete, appraisal wells are typically abandoned. The abandonment process may include pumping a first plug, which may comprise cement, into the open hole section and positioning a second plug, which may also comprise cement in the metallic well structure section.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, at the end of the lifecycle of a well, or at the end of an appraisal process, or the like, steps may be taken to permanently abandon a well that may introduce open hole regions. Abandonment procedures may include: isolating any freshwater zones associated with the well; isolating from the well any future production zones; preventing leaks to/from the well; and, in addition to removing wellheads, etc., also cutting and removing all well structure such as casing strings, etc., to a particular level below the surface.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Communication methods in the oil in gas industry may utilize e-lines, slicklines, fibre optic cabling, electromagnetic technology, acoustic technology and pressure wave technology. However, one or more of these technologies may be problematic to implement in the described open hole regions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This background serves only to set a scene to allow a person skilled in the art to better appreciate the following description. Therefore, none of the above discussion should necessarily be taken as an acknowledgement that that discussion is part of the state of the art or is common general knowledge. One or more aspects/embodiments of the invention may or may not address one or more of the background issues.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some examples, an apparatus for contacting an open hole surface is provided. The apparatus provides for robust and effective contact to an open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some examples, the apparatus comprises an expandable portion surrounded by a contact portion configured to contact an open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An open hole surface, in contrast with a cased or tubed surface, of a formation is not generally smooth. An open hole surface may have bumps, cracks, fractures, gaps, holes and other such generally uneven and/or not smooth surfaces. These uneven surfaces have a reduced surfaced area that may be contact by a flat or even contact portion.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the expandable portion is configured to expand to force the contact portion to contact the open hole surface. Expansion of the expandable portion forces the contact portion to at least partially fill the bumps, cracks, fractures, gaps, holes and other generally uneven and/or not smooth surfaces of the open hole surface. Expansion of the expandable portion generally increases the surface area of the open hole portion that the contact portion is contacting. As will be described, this reduces resistance to ground and improves signal transmission and reception.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">While the contact portion may contact the open hole surface prior to expansion of the expandable portion, expansion of the expandable portion increases the surface area of the open hole surface that is contacted by the contact portion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some examples, the contact portion is configured to maximize contact with the open hole surface. Once the expandable portion has expanded the contact portion maximizes contact with the open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As previously stated, the contact portion may contact the open hole surface prior to expansion of the expandable portion; however, expansion of the expandable portion maximizes the surface area of the open hole surface that is contacted by the contact portion.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some examples, the contact portion is configured to electrically contact the open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The apparatus may be used in transmitting or receiving signals through the formation. In order to transmit and receive signals through the formation, electrical contact with the open hole surface of the formation may be required. For example, transmitting and receiving signals via electromagnetic or acoustic signals through the formation may require electrical contact with the open hole surface. Accordingly, the contact portion is configured to electrically contact the open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some examples, the contact portion is configured to minimize resistance to ground through the open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Increasing or maximizing contact with the open hole surface minimizes resistance to ground through the open hole surface. This reduces resistance seen by the apparatus in transmitting a signal through the formation or receiving a signal transmitted through the formation. Therefore, signals can be transmitted/received over greater distances and/or with greater certainty of accurate and correct reception.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some examples, the expandable portion comprises at least one inflatable bladder.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some examples, the expandable portion comprises an inflatable bladder on each end of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each bladder is configured to be pressurized or inflated. Each bladder is surrounded by the contact portion. When a bladder is pressurized or inflated (i.e. expanded state), the bladder increases the diameter of the contact portion. The bladders and contact portion are sized and positioned such that this increased diameter forces the contact portion into contact with the open hole surface and increases the surface area of the open hole surface that the contact portion contacts. When a bladder is de-pressurized or deflated (i.e. resting state), the bladder decreases the increased diameter of the contact portion back to its original resting diameter.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some or more examples, the expandable portion comprises a swellable member configured to swell on contact with a particular fluid. Despite the contact portion surrounding the expandable portion, the fluid may still contact the swellable member. For example, the contact portion may have gaps or apertures. In some or more examples, the contact portion comprises a sleeve.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The swellable member is configured to swell upon contact with a particular fluid to increase the diameter of the contact portion and increase the surface area of the open hole portion that is contacted by the contact portion. The particular fluid may be production fluid or a particular trigger injected into production or other fluid.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some or more examples, the swellable member comprises an elastomer. Exemplary elastomers include a superabsorbent polymer (SAP). The SAP is configured to swell upon contact with water.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some or more examples, the expandable portion comprises a member configured to buckle outwards upon compression.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The member is longitudinally compressed (i.e. compressed along its long axis) such that the member is forced to buckle outwards (i.e. radially) by the compression. The contact portion surrounds the member such that the outwards buckling of the member causes the contact portion to contact the open hole surface. Thus, during compression of the member an increased surface area of the open hole surface contacts the contact portion. Once the member is no longer compressed, the member will return to its original uncompressed state and unbuckled state.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The member may be compressed on both ends or on only a single end. The member may be compressed by a piston. The piston may be motor driven.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some or more examples, the member is tubing. In some examples, the tubing is a polymer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some or more examples, the expandable portion is configured to receive fluid.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some or more examples, the fluid is production fluid.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some of more examples, the expandable portion comprises at least one expandable pocket configured to receive fluid. The expandable pocket receives fluid, such as production fluid. The fluid expands the pocket towards the open hole surface. The expanded pocket forces the contact portion to contact more of the open hole surface than when the pocket is not expanded.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some or more examples, the apparatus further comprises a valve configured to permit fluid to flow into and/or out of the pocket. The valve may be opened to release any fluid in the pocket. The valve may be a non-return valve. A non-return valve ensures that fluid flows out of the pocket and not back into the pocket through the non-return valve.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some or more examples, the expandable portion comprises at least one valve configured to receive fluid. The valve may form part of a series of valves configured to receive fluid. The valves receive fluid, such as production fluid. The received fluid put pressure on the contact portion pushing the contact portion to contact more of the open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some or more examples, the contact portion a sleeve. The sleeves surround the expandable portion.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Upon expansion of the expandable portion, the sleeve contacts the open hole surface. An increased surface area of the open hole surface contacts the sleeve when the expandable portion is expanded compared to when the expandable portion is not expanded.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sleeve may be made of an electrically conductive material. The increased surface area allows for lower resistivity to be seen by the sleeve when receiving or transmitting signals through the open hole surface from or into, respectively, the formation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some or more examples, the contact portion comprises a mesh.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Upon expansion of the expandable portion, the mesh contacts the open hole surface. An increased surface area of the open hole surface contacts the mesh when the expandable portion is expanded compared to when the expandable portion is not expanded.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The mesh may be made of an electrically conductive material. In particular, the mesh may be formed of interwoven conductive fibres. The increased surface area allows for lower resistivity to be seen by the mesh when receiving or transmitting signals through the open hole surface from or into, respectively, the formation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some or more examples, the contact portion comprises a tube of rope.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Upon expansion of the expandable portion, the tube of rope contacts the open hole surface. An increased surface area of the open hole surface contacts the tube of rope when the expandable portion is expanded compared to when the expandable portion is not expanded.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The tube of rope may be made of an electrically conductive material. The increased surface area allows for lower resistivity to be seen by the tube of rope when receiving or transmitting signals through the open hole surface from or into, respectively, the formation.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some or more examples, the rope comprises braided steel rope.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some or more examples, the apparatus is configured to at least one of transmit and receive a signal. The signal may be transmitted or received through the formation via the open hole surface. Upon expansion of the expandable portion, the contact portion contacts an increased surface area of the open hole surface. Increasing the surface area of the open hole surface contacted decreases or minimizes the resistance seen by the contact portion. The decreased or minimized resistance ensures current may be successfully retrieved (or pulled) from the formation via the open hole surface for receiving signals, and ensures current may be successfully transmitted (or pushed) into the formation via the open hole surface. This increases the transmission distance to the apparatus or from the apparatus. Furthermore, this increases the reliability of transmission and reception.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some examples, the apparatus is configured for use in a sidetrack of a well.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A sidetrack is a secondary wellbore drilled away from the original well. It is possible to have multiple sidetracks, each of which may have been drilled for different reasons. The sidetrack may be unused. Specifically, the sidetrack may be unused for collecting production fluid. Use of the apparatus in a sidetrack that is not used for collecting production fluid ensures that the apparatus does not restrict the flow and/or collection of production fluid.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one example, a method for contacting an open hole surface is provided. The method provides for robust and effective contact to an open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some examples, the method comprises expanding an expandable portion surrounded by a contact portion to create contact between the contact portion and an open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As previously stated, an open hole surface, in contrast with a cased or tubed surface, of a formation is not smooth. An open hole surface may have bumps, cracks, fractures, gaps, holes and other such generally uneven and/or not smooth surfaces. Uneven and not smooth surfaces have a reduced surfaced area that may be contact by a flat or even contact portion.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Expansion of the expandable portion surrounded by the contact portion forces the contact portion to contact the open hole surface. The contact portion may partially fill the bumps, cracks, fractures, gaps, holes and other such generally uneven and/or not smooth surfaces of the open hole surface. Further, the contact portion contacts a greater surface area of the open hole portion than when the expandable portion is not expanded. This reduces resistance to ground and improves signal transmission and reception.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">While the contact portion may contact the open hole surface prior to expansion of the expandable portion, expansion of the expandable portion increases the surface area of the open hole surface that is contacted by the contact portion.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some or more examples, the contact between the contact portion and the open hole surface is electrical contact.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Electrical signals may be injected, transferred or pushed, or detected, extracted or pulled into/from the formation via the electrical contact between the open hole surface and the contact portion. As a greater surface area of the open hole surface is contacted when the expandable portion is expanded than when the expandable portion is not expanded or resting, the electrical contact has a lower resistance. The lower resistance seen by the contact portion allows for signals to be transmitted/received over greater distances and/or with greater certainty of accurate and correct reception.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some or more examples, expanding the expandable portion surrounded by the contact portion minimizes resistance to ground through the open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Minimizing the resistance to ground through the open hole surface ensures signals can be received from the formation and transmitted to the formation via the open hole surface at lower power rates. This may increase the life cycle of the apparatus. An increased life cycle results in a longer lasting apparatus that does not require as large batteries or requires fewer battery changes. This is particularly relevant in abandonment of wells where signal retrieval and transmission may be required for a significant time period.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some or more examples, expanding the expandable portion comprises inflating at least one bladder.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Each bladder is configured to be pressurized or inflated. Each bladder is surrounded by the contact portion. When a bladder is pressurized or inflated (i.e. expanded state), the bladder increases the diameter of the contact portion. The bladders and contact portion are sized and positioned such that this increased diameter forces the contact portion into contact with the open hole surface and increases the surface area of the open hole surface that the contact portion contacts. When a bladder is de-pressurized or deflated (i.e. resting state), the bladder decreases the increased diameter of the contact portion back to its original resting diameter.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some or more examples, expanding the expandable portion comprises using fluid to expand the expandable portion. The fluid comprises a liquid or a gas. In some examples, the fluid is pumped into the expandable portion to pressurize the expandable portion and cause the expandable portion to expand.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some or more examples, expanding the expandable portion comprises receiving fluid and using the received fluid to expand the expandable portion. The fluid comprises a liquid or a gas. In some examples, the fluid is received by the expandable portion via a valve. The fluid is pumped into the expandable portion to pressurize the expandable portion and cause the expandable portion to expand.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some or more examples, the fluid is production fluid.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The fluid may be received by an expandable pocket of the expandable portion. The expandable pocket receives fluid. The fluid expands the pocket towards the open hole surface. The expanded pocket contacts more of the open hole surface than then the unexpanded pocket.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The fluid may be received by at least one valve configured to receive fluid. The valve may form part of a series of valves configured to receive fluid. The valves receive fluid. The received fluid put pressure on the contact portion pushing the contact portion to contact more of the open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some or more examples, expanding the expandable portion comprises swelling a swellable member. In some or more examples, the swellable member comprises an elastomer.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The swellable member is configured to swell upon contact with a particular fluid to increase the diameter of the contact portion and increase the surface area of the open hole portion that is contacted by the contact portion. The particular fluid may be production fluid or a particular trigger injected into production or other fluid.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some or more examples, the elastomer is a superabsorbent polymer (SAP). The SAP is configured to swell upon contact with water.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some or more examples, the method further comprises, prior to expanding the expandable portion, passing the expandable portion surrounded by the contact portion through a well to the open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The expandable portion is in a deflated or non-expanded state and therefore the expandable portion surrounded by the contact portion can pass through the restricted diameter of the well. However, when the expandable portion surrounded by the contact portion reaches the open hole surface, the expandable portion expands and the contact portion contacts the open hole surface. The overall diameter of the expandable portion surrounded by the contact portion is now greater than in the deflated state. The expandable portion surrounded by the contact portion can therefore pass through restricted diameter entry points, such as a well, while still expanding to contact an open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Aspects of the inventions described may include one or more examples, embodiments or features in isolation or in various combinations whether or not specifically stated (including claimed) in that combination or in isolation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A description is now given, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified representation of a section of a well;</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged elevation view of the open hole section of the well of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a simplified representation of the well of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with an apparatus for contacting an open hole surface in accordance with an aspect of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged elevation view of the open hole section of the well of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with the apparatus for contacting an open hole surface an unexpanded or resting state;</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an enlarged elevation view of the open hole section of the well of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with the apparatus for contacting an open hole surface in an expanded state;</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is an elevation view of another embodiment of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in a resting or unexpanded state;</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is an elevation view of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> in an expanded state;</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is an elevation view of another embodiment of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in a resting or unexpanded state;</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is an elevation view of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> in an expanded state;</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an elevation view of another embodiment of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is an elevation view of another embodiment of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in a resting or unexpanded state; and</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> is an elevation view of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> in an expanded state</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The foregoing summary, as well as the following detailed description of certain embodiments will be better understood when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Similarly, while in the following example an offshore well structure is described, nevertheless the same systems and methods may be used onshore, as will be appreciated.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a simplified representation of a section of a well <b>100</b> is shown. In this embodiment, the well <b>100</b> is an offshore appraisal well. A well structure <b>102</b> extends from the surface to a subterranean formation. In this embodiment, the surface is the seabed or mudline <b>104</b>. The well structure <b>102</b> may comprise a conductor, casing and other tubing used to recover product from the subterranean formation. The well <b>100</b> further comprises a wellhead <b>106</b>, wet tree or the like, at a production platform <b>108</b>. In other embodiments, the wellhead <b>106</b> is located at the mudline <b>104</b>. The well <b>100</b> further comprises an open hole section <b>110</b>, in that there is no well structure positioned within the well <b>100</b> in the open hole section <b>110</b>. While the open hole section <b>110</b> is lower than the well structure <b>102</b>, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that other configurations are possible. The open hole section <b>110</b> may instead be located above the well structure <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As a person skilled in the art will appreciate, one or more devices may be present in the open hole section <b>110</b>. Exemplary devices include down hole tools, gauges and sensors. Communication with or from these devices may be desired. Communication may be in the form of wireless communication. As used herein, the term &#x201c;wireless&#x201d; when applied to communications encompasses all transmission that is not through a guided transmission medium, such as a wire, other metallic structure or a material having high electromagnetic (EM) conductivity relative to a surrounding medium. Wireless communications may, for example, be through air, water, ground (or formation) or another medium that has substantially isotropic EM conductivity.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As previously stated, wireless communications may be through ground such as the subterranean formation itself. Detection of wireless communications through the subterranean formation may require contact with the subterranean formation. However, reliable contact may be problematic as the subterranean formation may have cracks, fractures, bumps, gaps and other such generally uneven or not smooth surfaces. Such unreliable contact may be present, in particular, at the open hole section <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Furthermore, evening these surfaces increases costs, time and may be impractical if the surfaces are downhole.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a side elevation view of the enlarged open hole section <b>110</b> is shown. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the surface of the open hole section <b>110</b> has cracks, fractures, bumps, gaps and other such generally uneven or not smooth surfaces. Reliable contact with such an uneven surface may be problematic.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, even if the open hole surface is reliably contacted, a lesser surface area of the open hole surface may be contacted compared to an even surface such as that from a tube or casings. This is due to the nature of the uneven surface of the open hole section <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Uneven surfaces may result in not at all of the current being transmitting (transferred or pushed) or received (detected or pulled) at the surfaces of the subterranean formation. If the current is not transmitted into the formation, then the resulting signal may be incorrectly and/or inaccurately wirelessly transmitted through the formation. Similarly, if the current is not received from the formation, then signals may be incorrectly and/or inaccurately wirelessly received through the formation.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In addition, uneven surfaces increase the resistivity to ground making transmission (transfer or pushing) and reception (detection or pulling) of current less effective and/or more power intensive. Therefore, transmission of current into an even surface allows the resulting signal to be sent over a greater distance than transmission of current into an uneven surface. Similarly, reception of current from an even surface allows signals to be sent over a greater distance than reception of current from an uneven surface.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the well <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is shown with an apparatus generally identified by reference numeral <b>200</b>.

In this embodiment, the apparatus <b>200</b> is positioned within the open hole section <b>110</b>. The apparatus <b>200</b> is configured for contacting an open hole surface, specifically a surface of the open hole section <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The apparatus <b>200</b> is sized such that it may be placed within the open hole section <b>110</b>. Further, the apparatus <b>200</b> may be held in position within the open hole section <b>110</b> by a variety of methods including by some form of one or more of a packer, anchor, hook or platform.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">While the apparatus <b>200</b> open hole section <b>110</b> has been shown in an offshore appraisal well, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that the apparatus <b>200</b> may be used in a variety of other wells in other environments including, but not limited to, offshore, onshore, appraisal wells, production wells, abandonment environments and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the apparatus <b>200</b> comprises an expandable portion <b>202</b> generally surrounded by a contact portion <b>204</b>. The contact portion <b>204</b> may surround the entirety of the expandable portion <b>202</b> or only a portion thereof. The contact portion <b>202</b> is configured to contact an open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The expandable portion <b>202</b> is configured to expand. Expansion of the expandable portion <b>202</b> forces the contact portion <b>202</b> to contact an open hole surface of the open hole section <b>110</b> as will be described.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The contact portion <b>204</b> is configured to contact an open hole surface of the open hole section <b>110</b>. The contact portion <b>204</b> is configured to facilitate electrical contact between the apparatus <b>200</b> and the open hole section <b>110</b>. For example, the apparatus <b>200</b> or the contact portion <b>110</b> may be connected to a device such as for example a transmitter, receiver, transceiver and/or processor that facilitates the transmission and/or reception of signals. The contact portion <b>204</b> provides electrical connection between the device and the open hole surface of the open hole section <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the apparatus <b>200</b> may be in contact with the open hole section <b>110</b> when the expandable portion <b>202</b> is not expanded or in a resting state. Specifically, the contact portion <b>204</b> may be in contact with an open hole surface of the open hole section <b>110</b>. However, since the open hole surface is generally uneven or not smooth and may have bumps, cracks, fractures, gaps and/or holes, the contact portion <b>204</b> may contact only a very small unexpanded proportion <b>210</b> of the open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">As the contact portion <b>204</b> may provide electrical contact to the open hole section <b>110</b> through the unexpanded proportion <b>210</b> of the open hole surface, the resistance, i.e. the resistance to ground, seen by the contact portion <b>204</b> (and any device contacted to the contact portion <b>204</b> or apparatus <b>200</b>) may be extremely high if the unexpanded proportion <b>210</b> is very small. This will make sending, transmitting, transferring or pushing current in order to transmit a signal into the formation via the open hole section <b>110</b>, for example, more difficult and require significant power as only the unexpanded proportion <b>210</b> is accessible to the contact portion <b>204</b>. Similarly, detecting, pulling, receiving or extracting current from the formation via the open section <b>110</b> for receiving a signal, for example, will be power intensive as only the unexpanded proportion <b>210</b> is accessible to the contact portion <b>204</b>. The apparatus <b>200</b> is configured to address, at least partially, these issues.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In operation, the expandable portion <b>202</b> expands to create contact between the contact portion <b>204</b> and an open hole surface of the open section. The expandable portion <b>202</b> forces the contact portion <b>204</b> into contact with an open hole surface of the open hole section <b>110</b>. If the contact portion <b>204</b> is already in contact with the open hole surface of the open hole section <b>110</b>, then expansion of the expandable portion <b>202</b> increases the amount of surface area of the open hole surface that the contact portion <b>204</b> contacts. As the expandable portion <b>202</b> expands the contact portion <b>204</b> contacts more and more of the open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the apparatus <b>200</b> is shown with the expandable portion <b>202</b> expanded (i.e. in the expanded state). Expansion of the expandable portion <b>202</b> forces the contact portion <b>204</b> to contact a greater surface area of the open hole surface than when the expandable portion <b>202</b> is not expanded or in its resting state. This greater surface is highlighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and identified as expanded proportion <b>212</b>. As will be appreciated, the expanded proportion <b>212</b> represents a greater surface area of the open hole surface than the unexpanded portion <b>210</b>. Thus, upon expansion of the expandable portion <b>202</b>, the contact portion <b>204</b> contacts a greater surface area of the open hole surface.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Contacting a greater surface area of the open hole surface minimizes resistance, specifically, resistance to ground, and allows more current to be pushed, transferred or transmitted into the open hole surface, or detected, pulsed or received from the open hole surface. This is advantageous when transmitting (transferring current) signals or receiving (detecting current) signals.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a number of uneven or not smooth surfaces still exists on the open hole section <b>110</b> that the contact portion <b>204</b> is not contacting when the expandable portion <b>202</b> is expanded (i.e. in the expanded state). In one embodiment, an open hole surface of the open hole section <b>110</b> is scanned to determine the layout of open hole surface. The layout may include the specific geological features of the open hole surface such as the size and configuration including angles, lengths and widths of the uneven surface of the open hole surface. This may include the size and configuration of bumps, cracks, fractures, fissures and other geological features.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The apparatus <b>200</b> is configured, prior to placement within the open hole section <b>110</b>, to maximize the surface area of the open hole surface contacted by the contact portion <b>204</b> when the expandable portion <b>202</b> is expanded based on the layout (from the scan, for example) of the open hole surface. The surface area of the open hole surface contacted by the contact portion <b>204</b> is accordingly maximized. Conversely the resistance (resistance to ground) seen by the contact portion <b>204</b> at the open hole surface is minimized since the surface area contacted is maximized.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">While a particular apparatus <b>200</b> has been described, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that various configurations are possible.

The sleeve <b>604</b> surrounds the inflatable bladder <b>602</b>, although not the entirety of the inflatable bladder <b>602</b>. The sleeve <b>604</b> may be in contact with the open hole surface prior to expansion of the inflatable bladder <b>602</b>; however, expansion of the inflatable bladder <b>602</b> causes the sleeve <b>604</b> to contact a greater surface area of the open hole surface. As previously described, increasing the surface area of the open hole surface contacted by the sleeve <b>604</b> decreases the resistance (the resistance to ground) and allows for more current to be introduced into the formation via the open hope surface.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The sleeve <b>604</b> is electrically conductive such that the sleeve <b>604</b> can be used to push or pull current into or out of, respectively, the open hole surface.

Thus, during compression of the member <b>702</b> an increased surface area of the open hole surface contacts the sleeve <b>704</b>. Once the member <b>702</b> is no longer compressed, the member <b>702</b> returns to its original uncompressed and unbuckled state. The compression therefore decreases the height of the member <b>702</b>, while the resultant buckling increases the width of the member <b>702</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In this embodiment, the member <b>702</b> is compressed on both ends.
