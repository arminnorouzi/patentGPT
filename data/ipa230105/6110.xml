A white LED for a nighttime use with a light intensity of 300 mcd is a most common example. However, from the viewpoint of safety at night, especially for a white LED for automotive use placed close to a driver, the market is looking for LEDs with a light intensity of 120 mcd or less, in particular, white LEDs with light intensity of 100 to 10 mcd are demanded. If such a light-emitting device with light intensity of 120 mcd or less is to be achieved by lowering the injection current in a traditional way, the emission wavelength (peak wavelength) of a blue LED varies, and the chromaticity of a white LED changes as described above.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">One solution is to use a conventional blue LED with low luminous efficiency. However, as the technological trend is toward higher efficiency blue LEDs, there are no manufacturers that may supply blue LEDs with low luminous efficiency at a stable quality and at a low price. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a technology to manufacture dark LEDs based on high-efficiency, high-quality, and low-cost blue LEDs that are widely available in the market.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As a result of the inventors' diligent study, the present inventors have developed a white LED with a light intensity of 30 mcd or lower by using a light-emitting element, a dimming agent that absorbs a portion of the light from the light-emitting element, contains at least one of terbium, praseodymium, manganese, and titanium, and has 80% or less of the diffuse reflection intensity of a wavelength of 400 nm to 750 nm, and a phosphor that absorbs a part of the light from the light-emitting element and converts the light into light with an emission peak wavelength different from the peak wavelength of the emission wavelength of the light-emitting element.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described below in detail, the light-diminishing effect of terbium and praseodymium is weak when trivalent rare earth elements are included as constituent elements of the dimming agent. Therefore, matrix crystals containing divalent alkaline earth metals are preferable.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a light-emitting device <b>100</b> according to present embodiments. The light-emitting device <b>100</b> according to one or more aspects includes a light-emitting element <b>10</b> provided on a substrate <b>40</b> and a dimming agent <b>2</b> that absorbs a portion of the light from the light-emitting element <b>10</b>. The dimming agent <b>2</b> is dispersed in a resin layer <b>20</b> that serves as a resin sealant covering the light-emitting element <b>10</b> and stored in a package <b>30</b>. In the resin layer <b>20</b>, an additive such as Aerosil may be added as needed to enhance the dispersibility of the dimming agent <b>2</b>, etc.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For the light-emitting element <b>10</b>, an emission peak wavelength is in a 380 to 490 nm range. Such light-emitting element emits blue light and is relatively readily available with high quality and low cost. The dimming agent <b>2</b> contains at least one of terbium, praseodymium, manganese, and titanium and has a diffuse reflection intensity of 80% or less at a wavelength from 400 nm to 750 nm. The use of the dimming agent <b>2</b> results in a blue light-emitting device with reduced brightness without lowering the current value of the current injected into the LED.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The resin layer <b>20</b> may include a phosphor <b>1</b> (<b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>). By changing the emission wavelength of the phosphor <b>1</b>, the inventors discovered that a dark light-emitting device may be created that exhibits not only white but also various emission colors such as green, yellow, and red.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an experiment, an embodiment or embodiments, and a comparative example (CE) described below, a blue LED with an output of 60 mcd and a dominant wavelength of 458 nm when 5 mA of current is applied is used as the light-emitting element <b>10</b>.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Dimming Agent</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The following explanation relates to a dimming agent. A diffuse reflection spectrum of a currently used dimming agent is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For a comparison, a commercial product with an emission peak wavelength of 530 nm (Ba, Sr)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>:Eu phosphor (hereinafter referred to as BOS phosphor) is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The BOS phosphor selectively absorbs light with 500 nm or lower, whereas an AlN dimming agent absorbs light uniformly from 400 nm to 750 nm.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, the light absorption of the AlN dimming agent is not very strong. Making 30 mcd or less with a white LED increases the used amount of AlN dimming agent. However, as a powder concentration in a resin increases, a resin viscosity increases, making uniform application difficult.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Therefore, a development of a new dimming agent is sought. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the diffuse reflectance spectra of body-colored dark powders. Terbium oxide (Tb<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), praseodymium oxide (Pr<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>), and manganese oxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) are commonly used materials when making a phosphor, and terbium oxide (Tb<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), praseodymium oxide (Pr<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>), and manganese oxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) indicate strong optical absorption in a wide range of wavelengths from 400 nm to 750 nm. Titanium is also used in various compounds as a raw material for a phosphor, a photocatalyst and a pigment. A typical titanium black is titanium oxynitride, which also indicates strong optical absorption in a wide range of wavelengths from 400 nm to 750 nm. As a comparison, a carbon black powder used in an automobile tire also indicates strong optical absorption in a wide range of wavelengths from 400 nm to 750 nm.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the dimming agent with a dark body-colored is added to a white LED, a small amount of the diming agent greatly diminishes the white LED. From the workability at the time of weighing, a dimming agent that may be added in a certain amount is required.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A specific gravity and a particle size of each particle may preferably be adjusted in order to uniformly disperse the phosphor and dimming agent in the resin.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Specific Gravity of Diminishing Agent</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The specific gravity of a material is determined by its constituent element and crystal structure. Therefore, it is difficult to change the specific gravity of a phosphor while maintaining the luminescence characteristic. As illustrated in Table 1, phosphors use relatively heavy elements (e.g., alkaline earth metals and rare earth elements) and therefore have relatively high specific gravities. AlN and similar body-colored Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>powders are made of relatively light elements and therefore have relatively low specific gravities.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The specific gravity of each material, referenced from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), is listed in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Specific Gravity</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Material</entry><entry>(g/cm<sup>3</sup>)</entry><entry>Reference</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="91pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>AlN</entry><entry>3.38</entry><entry>ICSD #82789</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub></entry><entry>3.43</entry><entry>ICSD #97567</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub></entry><entry>2.96</entry><entry>ICSD #200707</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Sr<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub></entry><entry>4.51</entry><entry>ICSD #35667</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Ba<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub></entry><entry>5.49</entry><entry>ICSD #38155</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub></entry><entry>4.57</entry><entry>ICSD #93635</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">The specific gravity of the dimming agent may be adjusted by selecting a crystal matrix of the dimming agent.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Attenuation Rate</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0046">An attenuation rate (an absorption rate) may be increased by increasing the amount of a doping element.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">The main point is that the selection of the matrix material and impurity doping may be configured in the same way as a phosphor with a luminescent center (an impurity) added.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Particle Size of a Dimming Agent</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0048">A particle growth of a phosphor may be controlled by the particle size of the raw material used and the temperature and time of firing. By using the crystal matrix used in a phosphor as a dimming agent, a manufacture in the same way as a phosphor may be done. Therefore, the particle size of the dimming agent may be easily adjusted.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">From the above, by adding elements (terbium, praseodymium, manganese, and titanium) that cause light absorption to the same crystal matrix as the phosphor, a white LED with 30 mcd or lower may be provided.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">A valence of an element causing an optical absorption is considered.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Terbium oxide (Tb<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) is a mixture of Tb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and TbO<sub>2 </sub>and contains trivalent and tetravalent Tb. The body color is brownish brown. For trivalent Tb, LaPO<sub>4</sub>:Ce<sup>3+</sup>, Tb<sup>3+</sup> (LAP) are well known as green phosphors for fluorescent lamps. The green phosphor has a white body color and shows weak light absorption in a visible light region. The visible light absorption of terbium oxide (Tb<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) is therefore attributed to tetravalent Tb.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">On the other hand, praseodymium oxide (Pr<sub>4</sub>O<sub>11</sub>) is also a mixture of Pr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and PrO<sub>2 </sub>and contains trivalent and tetravalent Pr. The body color is dark gray. Pr in praseodymium fluoride (PrF<sub>3</sub>) is trivalent, and its powder has a green body color. Therefore, the black body color may be attributed to the tetravalent Pr.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">Mn in manganese oxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) is tetravalent based on its chemical formula.
