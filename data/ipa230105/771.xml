id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">An opioid independent surgical anesthetic composition includes an injectable dosage form of a hydrogel having a plurality of solid lipid matrix particles entrapped therein. The solid lipid matrix particles include a lipophilic local anesthetic drug and a lipid glyceride (e.g., saturated triglyceride or lipid blend of various lipid glycerides). Methods for creating a long-acting local anesthetic product can include creating a bulk solid of a lipid matrix product by heating a lipid solvent above its melting point, dissolving a lipophilic local anesthetic drug therein, reducing a temperature of the resultant drug-lipid solution to below the melting point of the lipid solvent, and heat annealing the lipid matrix to remove or reduce presence of any unstable polymorphs in the lipid matrix. The methods can further include crushing the bulk solid of the lipid matrix product to form solid lipid matrix particles and entrapping the solid lipid matrix particles within a hydrogel.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="86.28mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230000772A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="211.75mm" wi="144.27mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000772A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="211.84mm" wi="143.93mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000772A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="212.68mm" wi="102.53mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000772A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="172.97mm" wi="127.34mm" file="US20230000772A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="142.16mm" wi="150.88mm" file="US20230000772A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="197.95mm" wi="114.47mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000772A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="218.86mm" wi="95.17mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000772A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="206.50mm" wi="123.02mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000772A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="127.85mm" wi="151.21mm" file="US20230000772A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="186.01mm" wi="125.73mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000772A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/156,799, filed Mar. 4, 2021, and entitled OPIOID INDEPENDENT SURGICAL ANESTHETIC.

More particularly, the present application relates to long-acting, opioid independent anesthetics that may be used to manage postoperative pain.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Relevant Technology</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Medical practitioners often employ surgical techniques to treat injuries and disorders. Surgical techniques often involve manipulating or structurally altering a patient's body by&#x2014;or through&#x2014;an incision. Even after closing a surgical incision (e.g., with a suture), patients may be subject to postoperative pain at the surgical site, such as acute pain immediately following the surgical operation and/or lingering pain as the surgical site heals.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many postoperative pain treatment regimens involve the use of opioids as a centrally-acting analgesic to mitigate the pain. For example, members of a surgery or recovery team may administer an initial dose or doses of opioids to a patient after a surgical procedure, and the patient may be prescribed additional doses of opioids for self-administration to maintain analgesia as the effects of the initial dose(s) wear off. The freedom to self-medicate opioids leads some patients to over-medicate or otherwise abuse the use of their prescribed drugs, often leading to opioid addiction or even an overdose. The risks and dangers of opioid addiction and overdosing have gained significant attention in recent years, particularly due to the pervasiveness of opioid addiction within the U.S. and many other countries around the globe.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some instances, rather than administering an initial opioid dose, medical practitioners administer a local anesthetic to a surgical site in an effort to treat postoperative pain. However, conventional local anesthetics often only provide analgesia at the surgical site for a few hours following administration. It is time consuming and impractical to administer iterative doses of local anesthetic, and because many local anesthetics are delivered via injection, there is an inherent additional risk of infection. These obstacles and the ease by which centrally acting opioid medications can be administered orally (e.g., as a pill or capsule) contribute to the continued prescription of opioids to treat postoperative pain&#x2014;despite the personal and social harms clearly linked with their widespread use.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Alternative pain management strategies are needed to reduce the dependence on opioids for treating postoperative pain. For example, new or alternative local anesthetics are needed that can temporally extend the analgesic effect at a surgical site following administration. However, there is a dearth in the market for such products, and existing products that purport to provide long-acting local analgesia suffer from a number of shortcomings, such as a failure to perform as reported, high cost, complicated drug delivery procedures, and unfavorable drug release profiles.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there are a number of problems and disadvantages with existing postoperative pain management regimens and opioid independent surgical anesthetics that can be addressed.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various embodiments disclosed herein are related to systems, methods, components, apparatuses, and kits associated with opioid independent surgical anesthetics. Such embodiments may beneficially improve postoperative pain management and may mitigate the need for centrally-acting opioid medication after a surgical procedure by, for example, facilitating long-acting, local analgesia at a surgical site.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A first aspect provides an opioid independent surgical anesthetic composition. The opioid independent surgical anesthetic composition includes an injectable dosage form of a hydrogel that has a plurality of solid lipid matrix particles entrapped therein. The plurality of solid lipid matrix particles includes a lipophilic local anesthetic drug and a lipid glyceride, such as a saturated glyceride (e.g., a saturated triglyceride or a lipid blend of mono, di, or triglycerides). In some instances, the opioid independent anesthetic composition is provided as part of a kit within a ready-to-use syringe.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the hydrogel is a hyaluronic acid hydrogel. In an embodiment, the hyaluronic acid hydrogel may be crosslinked, or not crosslinked. Furthermore, in some instances, the lipophilic local anesthetic drug is (or includes) bupivacaine and the saturated triglyceride is (or includes) tristearin. Other amide based anesthetics could also be used (e.g., ropivacaine, lidocaine, etc.), as could other lipid glycerides. In one aspect, the plurality of solid lipid matrix particles substantially include glycerides (e.g., triglycerides or a lipid blend) forming a &#x3b2;-phase crystalline state. The solid lipid matrix may additionally, or alternatively, have a melting point greater than about 45&#xb0; C., preferably greater than about 70&#xb0; C., and/or each of the plurality of solid lipid matrix particles has a longest dimension of about 200 &#x3bc;m or less.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, an opioid independent surgical anesthetic composition includes a ready-to-use injectable dosage form of a hyaluronic acid hydrogel (e.g., crosslinked or not crosslinked) having lipid emulsion droplets containing bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or another amide based anesthetic (e.g., any -&#x2032;caine anesthetic) entrained therein. The opioid independent surgical anesthetic composition is configured to release the anesthetic in a biphasic manner when administered at a surgical site. The biphasic release may include a burst phase and a sustained release phase, improving postoperative pain management in an opioid independent fashion. In some embodiments, for example, between 30%-70% of the ropivacaine, bupivacaine or other anesthetic is cumulatively released from the hydrogel during the burst phase (e.g., the burst phase may be between 8-24 hours post administration), and between 70%-99% of the ropivacaine, bupivacaine or other anesthetic is cumulatively released from the hydrogel by 72 hours post administration. In other words, after the burst phase, the remaining 30-70% may be released in a window 8-72 hours, or 24-72 hours after administration.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, a method for creating an opioid independent surgical anesthetic composition includes (i) creating a bulk solid of a lipid matrix product by heating a lipid solvent above a melting point of the lipid solvent, dissolving a lipophilic local anesthetic drug into the lipid solvent to form a drug-lipid solution, and quenching or otherwise reducing a temperature of the drug-lipid solution to below the melting point of the lipid solvent; (ii) forming solid lipid matrix particles by crushing the bulk solid of the lipid matrix product; and (iii) entrapping a plurality of size-selected solid lipid matrix particles within a hydrogel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, creating the bulk solid of the lipid matrix product also includes performing a heat annealing process, e.g., after quenching or otherwise reducing the temperature of the drug-lipid solution to below the melting point of the lipid solvent. The heat annealing process can include, for example, maintaining a temperature of the drug-lipid solution at approximately 8&#xb0; C.-12&#xb0; C. below the melting point of the lipid solvent for a period of time. Thus, the drug-lipid solution may be quickly quenched to ambient temperature or below, and afterwards heated again during the heat annealing process.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, in some embodiments, the lipophilic local anesthetic drug includes ropivacaine or bupivacaine, the lipid solvent includes a lipid blend, a saturated triglyceride, or other lipid glyceride, and the hydrogel includes a hyaluronic acid hydrogel (crosslinked or not). Additionally, or alternatively, each of the plurality of size-selected solid lipid matrix particles has a longest dimension less than about 200 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, an opioid independent surgical anesthetic composition may comprise an injectable dosage form of a hydrogel having a plurality of solid lipid matrix particles entrapped therein, the plurality of solid lipid matrix particles comprising a lipophilic local anesthetic drug and a saturated glyceride.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, the saturated glyceride comprises a lipid blend including one or more of a monoglyceride, a diglyceride, or a triglyceride. For example, a lipid blend may include one or more monoglycerides in combination with one or more diglycerides, and/or one or more triglycerides. In an embodiment, the lipid blend may include monoglyceride(s) and diglyceride(s), monoglyceride(s) and triglyceride(s), diglyceride(s) and triglyceride(s), or monoglyceride(s), diglyceride(s), and triglyceride(s). In an embodiment, the blend includes at least some monoglyceride(s) or diglyceride(s), e.g., in addition to any triglyceride(s). As used herein, lipid blend refers to a blend of two or more different lipid components (e.g., monoglycerides, diglycerides, and/or triglycerides). In an embodiment, such a lipid blend includes at least one monoglyceride and/or at least one diglyceride (i.e., it is not just solely triglycerides). Such monoglycerides, diglycerides, and any included triglycerides may be saturated.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment the saturated glyceride comprises a saturated triglyceride.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment the hydrogel comprises a hyaluronic acid hydrogel.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment the hyaluronic acid is included in an amount from 0.5% to 3% by weight.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment the hyaluronic acid has a molecular weight in a range from 500,000 to 3,000,000 Da.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment the lipophilic local anesthetic drug comprises at least one amide based anesthetic.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment the plurality of solid lipid matrix particles substantially comprises triglycerides or other glycerides forming a &#x3b2;-phase crystalline state.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment the solid lipid matrix particles have a melting point greater than about 45&#xb0;

However, existing products that purport to provide long-acting local anesthetic effects are deficient in many respects. For example, one purported extended-release local anesthetic preparation&#x2014;Exparel&#xae; (Pacira, Parsippany, N.J.)&#x2014;is a liposomal bupivacaine suspension. Although Exparel&#xae; has shown some promise in reducing the quantity of opioids required for maintaining analgesia after surgery, there have been concerns about its true efficacy and duration of effect in reducing post-operative pain (e.g., as demonstrated by independent clinical trials). Exparel&#xae; is also cumbersome to use, requiring the administering physician to repeatedly jab the patient with a needle to deliver subcutaneous injections of the liposomal bupivacaine suspension around the periphery of the wound (or surgical site). This process is also time consuming, taking the physician approximately 10 minutes in the operating room to administer all of the requisite injections.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">Additionally, Exparel&#xae; typically fails to provide a burst effect of drug release following injection, making Exparel&#xae; unsuitable for managing acute pain at a surgical site immediately following a surgical procedure. To address this issue, Pacira, the manufacturer of Exparel&#xae; recommends mixing the liposomal bupivacaine with standard bupivacaine (e.g., bupivacaine HCl) prior to infiltration, or separately injecting standard bupivacaine at the surgical site (e.g., with a separate syringe) in conjunction with Exparel&#xae;. Using Exparel&#xae; in conjunction with standard bupivacaine further adds to the complexity, time, and/or cost associated with implementing Exparel&#xae; for postoperative pain management and underscores its inability to provide sufficient analgesia at the injection site without additional anesthetics.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">These concerns, coupled with the high cost of Exparel&#xae;, have led to significant concerns about the cost utility and efficacy of Exparel&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">As noted above, Exparel&#xae; comprises liposomal bupivacaine. Liposomes may experience accelerated release of their contents in vivo due to disruptive serum protein adsorption to the lipid bilayer and by retardation of electrostatic potential by salts/ions in the physiologic milieu. Such reactions to in vivo conditions may be a cause of the failure of liposomal bupivacaine to satisfy the needs of medical practitioners for a long-acting local anesthetic. Other attempts to create lipid micro/nano-particle bupivacaine sustained release systems have failed due to instability, poor drug loading, and/or rapid drug expulsion during storage. For example, unstable &#x3b1;-phase lipid polymorphs may spontaneously transition to the thermodynamically favored &#x3b2;-phase and expel loaded drugs during the phase transition.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">Accordingly, there exists a long-felt need for an improved opioid independent, long-acting local anesthetic formulation that provides, for example, prolonged analgesia following administration (e.g., 48 hours or longer, such as 72 hours or longer), that can be administered in a simple, non-time-consuming manner (e.g., as a ready-to-use composition deliverable through a conventional syringe), and that demonstrates an initial burst release of anesthetic followed by localized, sustained release of anesthetic to address both the acute and lingering postoperative pain&#x2014;all preferably at an affordable price.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">Various embodiments disclosed herein are related to systems, methods, components, apparatuses, and kits associated with opioid independent surgical anesthetics. In one example embodiment, an opioid independent surgical anesthetic composition includes an injectable dosage form of a hydrogel that has a plurality of solid lipid matrix particles entrapped therein. The plurality of solid lipid matrix particles includes a lipophilic local anesthetic drug and a glyceride, such as a saturated triglyceride or lipid blend of lipid glycerides (e.g., including mono, di, and/or triglycerides). In another example embodiment, an opioid independent surgical anesthetic composition includes a ready-to-use injectable dosage form of a hyaluronic acid hydrogel having lipid emulsion droplets containing bupivacaine entrained therein. In an embodiment, the hyaluronic acid may not be cross linked with a crosslinker (e.g., PEGDA). In other embodiments, it may be crosslinked.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">Those skilled in the art will recognize, in view of the present disclosure, that at least some of the disclosed embodiments may address various shortcomings and/or problems associated with conventional techniques and products for managing postoperative pain.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">For example, at least some anesthetic compositions of the present disclosure utilize a hydrogel, such as a hyaluronic acid hydrogel, as a carrier to facilitate drug delivery (at least some anesthetic compositions of the present disclosure may be generalized as hyaluronic acid local anesthetics (HALAs), such as a lipid emulsion HALA or a lipid matrix particle HALA). Although hyaluronic acid hydrogels exhibit a gel-like consistency, hyaluronic acid hydrogels also exhibit shear-thinning mechanical properties, enabling a HALA to be injected through a small-gauged needle (e.g., 18 G-25 G) similar to standard local anesthetics prepared as an aqueous solution (or other liquid form). Unlike plain bupivacaine, which has the consistency of water, a HALA reforms into a stable gel following injection through a syringe. This allows a HALA to be applied topically, avoiding complicated and/or repetitive subcutaneous injection procedures. For example, at the end of a surgical procedure, medical practitioners may easily apply a HALA within the wound and suture the wound closed over the HALA, disposing local anesthetic directly at the source of the pain. The drug then elutes from the carrier hyaluronic acid hydrogel to provide a local analgesic effect safely and reliably. It should be appreciated that the gel-like consistency of the hydrogel advantageously allows it to conform to the wound bed as the surgical site is closed. This acts to provide anesthetic across the surface area of the wound and more efficiently direct its analgesic effects to the disrupted tissue where the pain and inflammation is more intense or originating from.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0064">In addition, at least some HALAs of the present disclosure are configured to provide a high-rate burst drug release upon administration to a surgical site followed by a low-rate prolonged drug release. In this regard, a HALA of the present disclosure may address both acute pain that immediately follows a surgical procedure as well as lingering pain experienced as a surgical site heals. Accordingly, at least some HALAs of the present disclosure provide medical practitioners with a single product that manages both acute postoperative pain and lingering postoperative pain (e.g., in contrast with existing products that require complicated admixing procedures prior to drug administration or contemporaneous administration of multiple drug products).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0065">In some instances, a HALA implements bupivacaine as an anesthetic agent, which is known to be cardiotoxic. Notwithstanding the cardiotoxic properties of bupivacaine, the controlled release characteristics of the HALAs of the present disclosure may enable HALAs to include a high concentration of bupivacaine relative to conventional products (e.g., 1.5% or greater w/v bupivacaine compared to 0.5% w/v for bupivacaine HCL and 1.33% w/v Exparel&#xae;) while still safely providing superior analgesic effects without risk of cardiotoxicity. In another embodiment, the anesthetic agent may be ropivacaine. Another embodiment may include lidocaine. Ropivacaine and/or lidocaine may be less cardiotoxic, e.g., given its shorter carbon chain on the amine portion of the molecule. For example bupivacaine includes a 4-carbon chain length on the amine portion of the molecule, while ropovacaine includes a 3-carbon chain length, and lidocaine includes two 2-carbon chains attached to the nitrogen atom.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0066">The manufacturing protocol and materials for creating at least some of the HALAs of the present disclosure are simple and/or inexpensive, particularly when compared with the manufacturing protocol and materials for creating existing products that attempt to provide long-acting local anesthetic effects. In addition, HALA products of the present disclosure may be provided to medical practitioners in a shelf-stable and ready-to-use syringe (e.g., 5 cc or 10 cc) that is operable to manage both immediate postoperative pain (via an initial burst drug release) and lingering postoperative pain (via a subsequent sustained drug release) with a single application. It should be appreciated that the disclosed HALA products are beneficially shelf-stable, allowing for extended storage periods without loss of desired therapeutic effect. Accordingly, a HALA of the present disclosure may allow medical practitioners to avoid complicated admixing procedures, multiple injection procedures, contemporaneous administration of multiple anesthetic drugs (e.g., Exparel&#xae; and bupivacaine HCL), and/or other drawbacks associated with existing local anesthetics that attempt to provide long-acting effects.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0067">In some embodiments, lipid matrix particle HALAs implement solid lipid matrix particles formed under controlled heating/cooling conditions that allow for heat annealing of the lipid melt used to form the solid lipid matrix particles. Heat annealing may advantageously remove unstable polymorphs from the lipid melt in preparation for pulverization to form the solid lipid matrix particles for entrapment within a hyaluronic acid hydrogel. In some instances, the removal of unstable polymorphs contributes to the stable and predictable diffusion-controlled drug release from lipid matrix particle HALAs.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0068">Because the HALAs of the present disclosure may facilitate extended local control of pain at a surgical site, the HALAs of the present disclosure may provide a postoperative pain management alternative that mitigates or avoids the use of centrally-acting opioids for pain management (particularly self-administered opioids). In this regard, the HALAs of the present disclosure may help patients to avoid any potential opioid dependency, overdose, and/or addiction by allowing medical practitioners to treat a surgical site with an opioid-independent, effective, safe, and long-acting local anesthetic.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0069">Although the present disclosure focuses in some respects on topical applications of HALAs within human patients, those skilled in the art will recognize, in view of the present disclosure, that these implementations are provided as examples only and are in no way limiting of the present disclosure. For example, a user may inject a HALA subcutaneously as a nerve blocking agent and/or on an animal subject in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0070">Furthermore, although the present disclosure focuses, in some respects, on HALAs that implement ropivacaine or bupivacaine as an anesthetic agent, a HALA may implement additional or alternative anesthetic agents, such as lidocaine or other amide based local anesthetics such as articaine, cinchocaine/dibucaine, etidocaine, levobupivacaine, lignocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, trimecaine, and/or others.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0071">Having just described some of the various high-level features and benefits of the disclosed embodiments, attention will now be directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>9</b></figref>.

As indicated hereinabove, in at least some embodiments, the hydrogel <b>110</b> comprises a hyaluronic acid hydrogel formed from hyaluronic acid <b>115</b>. Hyaluronic acid <b>115</b> is a naturally occurring component of extracellular matrix and has demonstrated safety (e.g., a very low risk of side-effects). The hyaluronic acid may be crosslinked (with linkage <b>120</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) or not crosslinked (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0073">In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the hydrogel <b>110</b> is formed from thiol-modified chains of hyaluronic acid <b>115</b> that are crosslinked by thiol-reactive poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) <b>120</b> crosslinkers. The crosslinking restricts movement of the chains of hyaluronic acid <b>115</b> and forming a network structure that gives the hydrogel <b>110</b> its gel-like mechanical properties. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an embodiment where the hyaluronic acid <b>115</b> is not crosslinked. For example, where sufficiently high molecular weights or other properties are present, to provide the desired physical properties (e.g., sufficient viscosity, with shear thinning behavior), the crosslinking may not be needed. For example, it was found that the desired physical and mechanical properties can be achieved without need for the additional steps and ingredients required for crosslinking. Such steps are time consuming and often require less ideal chemicals. The purpose of the hyaluronic acid is simply to disperse and entrap the lipid microparticles into solution and increase viscosity for local application. Hyaluronic acid is well suited for such, because of its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and shear-thinning behavior. The resulting product is viscous but also injectable through a relatively small gauge needle or other delivery head, due to its shear-thinning behavior.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0074">As noted above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> also illustrate that the hydrogel <b>110</b> entraps solid lipid matrix particles <b>105</b> that are infused with a local anesthetic agent (e.g., bupivacaine, ropivacaine or other anesthetic <b>125</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> infused throughout solid lipid matrix particles <b>105</b> of the lipid matrix particle HALA <b>100</b>). As will be described hereinafter, preliminary results indicate that the hydrogel <b>110</b> may shield at least some of the anesthetic-loaded solid lipid matrix particles <b>105</b> from harsh in vivo conditions, thereby facilitating a controlled, prolonged release of bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or other anesthetic <b>125</b> from the lipid matrix particle HALA <b>100</b> into a surgical or injection site.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate a schematic representation of a procedure for manufacturing the solid lipid matrix particles <b>105</b> for creating a lipid matrix particle HALA <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> show that the solid lipid matrix particles <b>105</b> may, in some implementations, be formed from a combination of a lipid glyceride <b>130</b> (e.g., a lipid blend of lipid glycerides or a saturated triglyceride) and a lipophilic local anesthetic drug (e.g., bupivacaine or ropivacaine <b>125</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> above the saturated lipid or lipid blend <b>130</b>). For example, the saturated lipid or lipid blend of lipid glycerides <b>130</b> may be heated (e.g., via hotplate <b>135</b> or other heating device) to a temperature above its melting point, forming a saturated glyceride lipid melt. Freebase bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or other anesthetic <b>125</b> may be dissolved into the lipid melt (indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> by arrow <b>140</b>), forming a ropivacaine-lipid solution, bupivacaine-lipid solution, or other anesthetic-lipid solution.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0076">The anesthetic-lipid solution may then be cooled to form an anesthetic-loaded lipid matrix bulk solid <b>145</b> (indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> by arrow <b>150</b>). In some instances, after cooling the anesthetic-lipid solution, a heat annealing process <b>147</b> is performed. For example, a heat annealing process may include heating the material after quenching (e.g., to ambient temperature or below), and maintaining a temperature that is between about 5&#xb0; C.-20&#xb0; C. below the melting point of the saturated triglyceride or lipid blend of lipid glycerides <b>130</b>, preferably approximately 10&#xb0; C. below the melting point of the saturated triglyceride or lipid blend of lipid glycerides <b>130</b>, for an extended period of time (e.g., longer than 30 minutes, preferably longer than about an hour, more preferably approximately 2 hours) as the anesthetic-lipid solution solidifies to form the anesthetic-loaded lipid matrix bulk solid <b>145</b>. In an embodiment, the anesthetic is specifically ropivacaine.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0077">Triglycerides are known to crystalize into three phases upon solidification from melt. Triglycerides may solidify into an unstable &#x3b1;-phase crystalline state, an intermediary &#x3b2;&#x2032;-phase crystalline state, and/or a stable &#x3b2;-phase crystalline state. Other lipid glycerides (e.g., monoglycerides or diglycerides) may exhibit similar characteristics. Omitting or avoiding unstable &#x3b1;-phase and &#x3b2;&#x2032;-phase crystalline structures from the anesthetic-loaded lipid matrix bulk solid <b>145</b> may increase thermodynamic stability of solid lipid matrix particles <b>105</b> formed from the anesthetic-loaded lipid matrix bulk solid <b>145</b> (e.g., which may possibly increase shelf life stability) and may contribute to the desired diffusion-controlled drug release from the lipid matrix particle HALA <b>100</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0078">Preliminary results indicate that performing the heat annealing process described herein may remove substantially all unstable &#x3b1;-phase and &#x3b2;&#x2032;-phase crystalline structures from an anesthetic-loaded lipid matrix bulk solid <b>145</b>, providing an anesthetic-loaded lipid matrix bulk solid <b>145</b> that substantially comprises the &#x3b2;-phase crystalline state. The heat annealing step <b>147</b> can be helpful in removing such undesirable polymorph structures. By way of example, attention is briefly directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, which illustrates a graph of differential scanning calorimetry data of non-annealed bupivacaine-loaded lipid matrix particles (curve <b>910</b>) and heat annealed bupivacaine-loaded lipid matrix particles (curve <b>920</b>). As is evident from curve <b>910</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the heat flow necessary to increase the temperature of the non-annealed bupivacaine-loaded lipid matrix particles includes significant fluctuations between about 50&#xb0; C.-70&#xb0; C., which indicates the presence of unstable &#x3b1;-phase triglyceride crystalline structures in non-annealed bupivacaine-loaded lipid matrix particles. In contrast, as is evident from curve <b>920</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, such fluctuations do not appear between about 50&#xb0; C.-70&#xb0; C. for heat annealed bupivacaine-loaded lipid matrix particles, indicating that unstable &#x3b1;-phase triglyceride crystalline structures are not present in heat annealed bupivacaine-loaded lipid matrix particles. Ropivacaine-loaded lipid matrix particles are expected to exhibit similar characteristics.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0079">The anesthetic-loaded lipid matrix bulk solid <b>145</b> may be pulverized or crushed (e.g., with a mortar and pestle or functional equivalent) to form solid lipid matrix particles <b>105</b> in powder form (indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> by arrow <b>155</b>). The solid lipid matrix particles <b>105</b> may be admixed with components for forming the hydrogel <b>110</b> (e.g., hyaluronic acid <b>115</b>, optionally a crosslinker such as PEGDA <b>120</b>; admixing indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> by arrows <b>160</b>, <b>165</b>, and <b>170</b>). In some instances, the admixed solid lipid matrix particles <b>105</b>, hyaluronic acid <b>115</b>, and PEGDA <b>120</b> are disposed within a syringe <b>175</b> where crosslinking may complete to form a lipid matrix particle HALA <b>100</b> that is ready for immediate use by a medical practitioner in a manner that avoids bedside admixing or other complicated procedures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an alternative example that does not include any PEGDA or other crosslinker, further simplifying the preparation method.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0080">Furthermore, in some instances, the solid lipid matrix particles <b>105</b> that are size selected prior to admixing with the components for forming the hydrogel <b>110</b> (e.g., including only solid lipid matrix particles that have a longest dimension of between about 25 &#x3bc;m-500 &#x3bc;m, preferably between about 50 &#x3bc;m-300 &#x3bc;m, more preferably about 200 &#x3bc;m or less). For example, the solid lipid matrix particles <b>105</b> formed by pulverizing the anesthetic-loaded lipid matrix bulk solid <b>145</b> (indicated by arrow <b>155</b>) may be sieved to isolate solid lipid matrix particles of different size ranges, such as 25 &#x3bc;m or smaller, between 25 &#x3bc;m and 50 &#x3bc;m, between 100 &#x3bc;m and 125 &#x3bc;m, etc. (e.g., using ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standardized sieves with pore sizes of 25, 50, 100, and 125 &#x3bc;m). In some instances, drug release characteristics of a lipid matrix particle HALA <b>100</b> may be tuned/customized based on size selection of the solid lipid matrix particles <b>105</b> used to form the lipid matrix particle HALA <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081">Drug release characteristics of a lipid matrix particle HALA <b>100</b> may be customized by modifying various components, such as lipid matrix particle size (as indicated above), fatty acid chain length of the components of the lipid or lipid blend, crystallization morphology (e.g., tunable by modifying heat annealing or refraining from performing heat annealing), drug loading concentration, type and/or degree and/or mass ratio of crosslinking, and/or others. In one example, a lipid matrix particle HALA <b>100</b> includes hyaluronic acid at 1.25% w/v, where the ropivacaine, bupivacaine, or other anesthetic concentration is 2% w/v.

Examples of such saturated triglycerides that may be used or included in a lipid blend include trilaurin, trimyristin, tripalmitin, tristearin, and/or others. By way of example, the carbon chain length included in the glyceride may be at least 10, at least 12, at least 14, at least 16, at least 18 carbon atoms, such as from 14 to 30, from 16 to 24, or from 18 to 22 carbon atoms. By way of example, lauryl groups have 12 carbon atoms, myrstyl groups have 14 carbon atoms, palmitic groups have 16 carbon atoms, and stearyl groups have 18 carbon atoms.

For example, a hydrogel can be crosslinked without the presence of PEGDA where the thiol-modified hyaluronan crosslinks with itself via oxidative disulfide bond formation to form hydrogels. By way of further example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, no cross-linker need be present.

Creating a bulk solid of a lipid matrix product can itself include various sub-acts. For example, act <b>305</b>A includes heating a lipid solvent above a melting point of the lipid solvent. In some instances, the lipid solvent includes a saturated triglyceride (<b>130</b>), such as tristearin with a melting point of approximately 72.5&#xb0; C. Lipid blends of glycerides may also be used (e.g., a blend of saturated mono, di, and/or triglycerides). Act <b>305</b>B includes dissolving a lipophilic local anesthetic drug into the lipid solvent to form a drug-lipid solution.

After such quenching, a heat annealing process noted at 305 C may be performed. The heat annealing process may include maintaining a temperature of the drug-lipid solution at approximately 8&#xb0; C.-12&#xb0; C. below the melting point of the lipid solvent for a period of time (e.g., one hour or longer, such as 2 hours). For example, where the lipid solvent comprises tristearin, a heat annealing process may include maintaining a temperature of the drug-lipid solution at 62&#xb0; C. for a time period of 2 hours.
