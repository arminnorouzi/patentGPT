SFF processes are generally additive, in that material is selectively deposited to construct the product rather than removed from a block or billet. Most SFF processes are also layered, meaning that a geometrical description of the product to be produced is cut by a set of parallel surfaces (planar or curved), and the intersections of the product and each surface&#x2014;referred to as slices or layers&#x2014;are fabricated sequentially. Together, these two properties mean that SFF processes are subject to very different constraints than traditional material removal-based manufacturing. Nearly arbitrary product geometries are achievable, no tooling is required, mating parts and fully assembled mechanisms can be fabricated in a single step, and multiple materials can be combined, allowing functionally graded material properties. New features, parts, and even assembled components can be &#x201c;grown&#x201d; directly on already completed objects, suggesting the possibility of using SFF for the repair and physical adaptation of existing products. On the other hand, a deposition process must be developed and tuned for each material, geometry is limited by the ability of the deposited material to support itself and by the (often poor) resolution and accuracy of the process, and multiple material and process interactions must be understood.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">SFF has traditionally focused on printing passive mechanical parts or products in a single material, and the emphasis of research has been on developing new deposition processes (U.S. Pat. No. 5,121,329 to Crump; U.S. Pat. No. 5,134,569 to Masters; U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,055 to Sachs et. al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,126,529 to Weiss et. al.), on improving the quality, resolution, and surface finish of fabricated products, and on broadening the range of single materials which can be employed by a given SFF process, including biocompatible polymers and other biomaterials (Pfister et al., &#x201c;Biofunctional Rapid Prototyping for Tissue-engineering Applications: 3D Bioplotting Versus 3D Printing,&#x201d; <i>Journal of Polymer Science Part A: Polymer Chemistry </i>42:624-638 (2004); Landers et al., &#x201c;Desktop Manufacturing of Complex Objects, Prototypes and Biomedical Scaffolds by Means of Computer-assisted Design Combined with Computer-guided 3D Plotting of Polymers and Reactive Oligomers,&#x201d; <i>Macromolecular Materials and Engineering </i>282:17-21 (2000)), and living cells (Roth et al., &#x201c;Inkjet Printing for High-throughput Cell Patterning,&#x201d; <i>Biomaterials </i>25:3707-3715 (2004)). These improvements have allowed freeform fabrication to become a viable means of manufacturing finished functional parts, rather than only prototypes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">More recently, the greater utility of freeform fabricated products having multiple materials has been recognized, prompting reexamination and novel research into processes which can fabricate using multiple materials (U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,009 to Penn), and which can thereby produce complex articles with a variety of functionality, including functionally graded materials (Ouyang et al., &#x201c;Rapid Prototyping and Characterization of a WC&#x2014;(NiSiB Alloy) Ceramet/Tool Steel Functionally Graded Material (FGM) Synthesized by Laser Cladding,&#x201d; Columbus, Ohio, USA: TMS&#x2014;Miner. Metals &#x26; Mater. Soc. (2002); Smurov et al., &#x201c;Laser-assisted Direct Manufacturing of Functionally Graded 3D Objects by Coaxial Powder Injection,&#x201d; <i>Proceedings of the SPIE&#x2014;The International Society for Optical Engineering </i>5399:27 (2004)), electronics, MEMS (Fuller et al., &#x201c;Ink-jet Printed Nanoparticle Microelectromechanical Systems,&#x201d; <i>Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems </i>11:54-60 (2002)), living tissue constructs (Mironov et al., &#x201c;Organ Printing: Computer-aided Jet-based 3D Tissue Engineering,&#x201d; <i>Trends in Biotechnology </i>21:157-161 (2003)), and compositions of living and nonliving materials (Sun et al., &#x201c;Multinozzle Biopolymer Deposition for Tissue Engineering Application,&#x201d; 6<sup>th </sup><i>International Conference on Tissue Engineering</i>, Orlando, Fla. (Oct. 10-13, 2003); International Patent Application No. PCT/US2004/015316 to Sun et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,905,738 to Ringeisen et al.). All of these systems still depend upon a small fixed set of deposition process technologies, and are therefore limited to the materials which can be adapted to those processes, by the effects of those particular processes on the materials, and by the fabrication rates and resolutions of those processes. In particular, the system of U.S. Pat. No. 6,905,738 to Ringeisen et al., requires that for every material to be deposited, a two material system be developed comprising the material to be transferred, and a compatible matrix material which is vaporized by the laser in order to propel the transfer material to the substrate. In addition, this system has only demonstrated fabrication of thin films of materials&#x2014;its ability to deposit many layers of materials is not well established. The system and method of Sun et al., &#x201c;Multinozzle Biopolymer Deposition for Tissue Engineering Application,&#x201d; 6<sup>th </sup><i>International Conference on Tissue Engineering</i>, Orlando, Fla. (Oct. 10-13, 2003) and International Patent Application No. PCT/US2004/015316 to Sun et al., is limited to a fixed set of four deposition processes and requires that the alginate materials be deposited into a bath of liquid crosslinking agent&#x2014;a limitation it shares with the work of Pfister et al., &#x201c;Biofunctional Rapid Prototyping for Tissue-engineering Applications: 3D Bioplotting Versus 3D Printing,&#x201d; <i>Journal of Polymer Science Part A: Polymer Chemistry </i>42:624-638 (2004) and Landers et al., &#x201c;Desktop Manufacturing of Complex Objects, Prototypes and Biomedical Scaffolds by Means of Computer-assisted Design Combined with Computer-guided 3D Plotting of Polymers and Reactive Oligomers,&#x201d; <i>Macromolecular Materials and Engineering </i>282:17-21 (2000). In addition, none of these systems explicitly measures the properties of, and monitors and controls the conditions experienced by the fabrication materials, the fabrication substrate, and the article under construction before, during, and/or after fabrication as an intrinsic part of the fabrication process and manufacturing plan. The fabrication process is thus limited to the spatial control of material placement on relatively simple, passive substrates. Temporal control of the evolution of material properties is therefore not possible, and complex substrates whose state must be controlled and monitored continuously are not readily accommodated. Fabricating into or onto substrates, such as living organisms or devices which must remain in operation continuously, is problematic.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A major challenge in orthopaedic tissue engineering is the generation of seeded implants with structures that mimic native tissue, both in terms of anatomic geometries and intratissue cell distributions. Previous studies have demonstrated that techniques such as injection molding (Chang et al., &#x201c;Injection Molding of Chondrocyte/Alginate Constructs in the Shape of Facial Implants,&#x201d; <i>J. Biomed. Mat. Res. </i>55:503-511 (2001)) and casting (Hung et al., &#x201c;Anatomically Shaped Osteochondral Constructs for Articular Cartilage Repair,&#x201d; <i>J. Biomech. </i>36:1853-1864 (2003)) of hydrogels can generate cartilage tissue in complex geometries. Other studies have investigated methods to reproduce regional variations in articular cartilage constructs by depositing multiple layers of chondrocytes (Klein et al., &#x201c;Tissue Engineering of Stratified Articular Cartilage from Chondrocyte Subpopulations,&#x201d; <i>Osteoarthritis Cartilage </i>11:595-602 (2003)) or chondrocyte-seeded gels (Kim et al., &#x201c;Experimental Model for Cartilage Tissue Engineering to Regenerate the Zonal Organization of Articular Cartilage,&#x201d; <i>Osteoarthritis Cartilage </i>11:653-664 (2003)). However, there remains no viable strategy for rapidly producing implants with correct anatomic geometries and cell distributions. Recently, advances in SFF techniques have enabled the deposition of multilayered structures composed of multiple chemically active materials (Malone et al., &#x201c;Freeform Fabrication of 3D Zinc-Air Batteries and Functional Electro-Mechanical Assemblies,&#x201d; <i>Rapid Prototyping Journal </i>10:58-69 (2004)). Applicants believe that this technology has the potential to be adapted to the fabrication of living tissue under conditions that preserve cell viability.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed at overcoming disadvantages of prior art approaches and satisfying the need to establish a robust and reliable SFF system and method.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect of the present invention relates to an article fabrication system. The system has a plurality of material deposition tools containing one or more materials useful in fabricating the article. The system has a material deposition device having a tool interface for receiving the material deposition tools, the tool interface of the material deposition device being movable relative to a substrate to dispense material from the material deposition tool to the substrate. A system controller is operably connected to the material deposition device to control operation of the material deposition device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of fabricating an article. This method involves providing the above-described article fabrication system. Material is dispensed from the material deposition tools, when mounted on the tool interface of the material deposition device, in amounts and at positions on the substrate in response to instructions from the system controller, whereby an article is fabricated on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further aspect of the present invention relates to a method of fabricating a living three-dimensional structure. This method involves providing a data set representing a living three-dimensional structure to be fabricated. One or more compositions including a composition having a hydrogel with seeded cells is provided. The one or more compositions are dispensed in a pattern in accordance with the data set suitable to fabricate the living three-dimensional structure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to an article fabrication system. The system has a material deposition tool containing one or more materials useful in fabricating the article. The system has a material deposition device having a tool interface for receiving the material deposition tool, the tool interface of the material deposition device being movable relative to a substrate to dispense material from the material deposition tool to the substrate. The system has an enclosure defining a receptacle for enclosing the substrate in a confined environment segregated from other components of the system and capable of receiving material dispensed from the material deposition tool. A system controller is operably connected to the material deposition device to control operation of the material deposition device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet a further aspect of the present invention relates to an article fabrication system. The system has a material deposition tool containing one or more materials useful in fabricating the article. The system has a material deposition device having a tool interface for receiving said material deposition tool, the tool interface of the material deposition device being movable relative to a substrate to dispense material from the material deposition tool to the substrate. The system has one or more sensors positioned to detect non-geometric properties of material dispensed to the substrate. A system controller is operably connected to the sensors to control detection of material properties and to the material deposition device to control the material deposition device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention relates to an article fabrication system having multiple interchangeable material deposition tools and one or more modules capable of receiving material dispensed from material deposition tools. The deposition tools may contain interchangeable cartridges containing materials useful in fabricating the article. The tools and/or the cartridges may also contain apparatus for monitoring and conditioning the material for deposition. The substrate modules are useful in fabricating the article, and may also contain apparatus for monitoring and conditioning the deposited materials.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The system may also have a device to automatically switch tools and their cartridges and substrate modules, or these may be fixed in the system. A system controller is operably connected to the material tools, cartridges, substrate modules, transfer devices, and positioning systems. The system has provision for monitoring and controlling the environmental conditions under which fabrication takes place, for monitoring and correcting fabrication errors during the course of fabrication, and for monitoring and controlling the properties of the article being fabricated during the course of fabrication. The combined capabilities of the system, the deposition tools, and the substrate modules allow monitoring and control of the conditions experienced by all of the materials and by the article being fabricated, before, during, and/or after the fabrication process. This extends the freeform fabrication process to include controlled evolution of material properties as well as controlled deposition of multiple materials, allowing not just geometric, but spatio-temporal control over the properties of the composite article being fabricated. These extended capabilities are especially important when fabricating integrated systems comprising multiple active materials, such as electrochemical devices and living tissue constructs. This is also the case when depositing constructs into sensitive substrates, such as living organisms or sensing devices, the health and function of which must be maintained throughout the fabrication process.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention's modular system architecture and multi-level control scheme give it distinct advantages over other systems. The modular system architecture enables the system of the present invention to adapt to high throughput applications, in which material changes and substrate changes must be efficient and, in some cases, in which automation would be beneficial. The modular design also enables the system to adapt to a broad range of applications. For example, the same general system design could be used for in vitro as well as in vivo fabrication.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The multi-level sensing, actuation, control, and intelligence enables the system to log and/or control the spatio-temporal state of numerous properties of both materials and articles being fabricated prior, during, and after fabrication (for example, from the start of the fabrication process through incubation). These material and article properties include but are not limited to temperature, humidity, light, vibration, pressure, mechanical loading, and shape. Spatio-temporal control of numerous properties is important when fabricating integrated systems with active materials such as electromechanical devices, self-assembling structures, and living tissue constructs.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a fabrication system in accordance with the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a material deposition device and the tool rack of the system in accordance with the present invention in which the tool rack is connected to the material deposition device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front view of a material deposition device of a system in accordance with the present invention without a material deposition tool attached at the tool interface.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a front view of a material deposition tool in accordance with the present invention, which is a cartridge holding tool capable of receiving a modular material cartridge.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a front view of a material deposition device in accordance with the present invention fitted at a tool interface with a cartridge holding tool capable of receiving a modular material cartridge.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a front view of a cartridge holding tool in which a modular material cartridge carrying a syringe is positioned in the cartridge chamber.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a front view of a material deposition device of a system in accordance with the present invention fitted at the tool interface with a cartridge holding tool in which a modular material cartridge carrying a syringe is positioned in the cartridge chamber.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-D</figref> are perspective views of a cartridge holding tool and material modular syringe cartridge that fits into the cartridge holding tool. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-B</figref> illustrate perspective, exploded views of the parts of a syringe which fit into the syringe cartridge. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> illustrates a perspective, exploded view of how the syringe fits into the syringe cartridge. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the cartridge holding tool fitted with the syringe cartridge.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view of a transfer device in accordance with the present invention.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a perspective view of a fabrication system in accordance with the present invention in which the transfer device is in contact with a material deposition tool located on a tool rack.

In the particular embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, tool rack <b>4</b> is connected to material deposition device <b>2</b>. Located near material deposition device <b>2</b> and tool rack <b>4</b> is transfer device <b>100</b>, which is capable of making contact with material deposition tool <b>18</b> and moving material deposition tools <b>18</b> between material deposition device <b>2</b> and tool rack <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Material deposition device <b>2</b> and tool rack <b>4</b> are again illustrated in perspective in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As shown, machine base <b>6</b> is the general supporting structure of material deposition device <b>2</b>. Machine base <b>6</b> preferably has horizontal surface <b>90</b> which may rest on the ground or on a flat surface, such as the top of a bench or a table, and two vertical surfaces <b>92</b>A-B connected to horizontal surface <b>90</b>. In a preferred embodiment, machine base <b>6</b> is a large, precision granite structure, although other materials may be used in the construction of machine base <b>6</b> so long as the material is capable of dissipating vibration from the high acceleration motions that material deposition device <b>2</b> is capable of.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Positioning system <b>8</b> is preferably a machine driven X-Y coordinate gantry supported by machine base <b>6</b>. Positioning system <b>8</b> has two X-axis stages, including first X-axis stage <b>10</b>A and second X-axis stage <b>10</b>B, preferably constructed of commercially available ballscrew stages. X-axis stages <b>10</b>A-B rest on, and are attached to, vertical walls <b>92</b>A-B of machine base <b>6</b>. Positioning system <b>8</b> is preferably constructed of a commercially available ballscrew stage identical to X-axis stages <b>10</b>A-B. Y-axis stage <b>12</b> is fixed, at opposite ends and perpendicular to, first X-axis stage <b>10</b>A and second X-axis stage <b>10</b>B and spans horizontal surface <b>90</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Movement at positioning system <b>8</b> occurs as Y-axis stage <b>12</b> moves back and forth along X-axis stages <b>10</b>A-B. This movement is driven by motors <b>40</b>A-B which, in a preferred embodiment, are high-performance brushless DC motors with optical encoders for displacement feedback. However, any motor which is capable of producing relatively high acceleration, good velocity regulation, and positioning accuracy may be used to operate the movement of positioning system <b>8</b>. In operation, motor <b>40</b>A drives one end of Y-axis stage <b>12</b> along X-axis stage <b>10</b>A while motor <b>40</b>B simultaneously drives the other end of y-axis stage <b>12</b> along X-axis stage <b>10</b>B.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Another moving component of positioning system <b>8</b> is tool interface <b>20</b>, which resides on Y-axis stage <b>12</b> and moves back and forth along Y-axis stage <b>12</b>. Tool interface <b>20</b> is capable of receiving a material deposition tool, such as material deposition tool <b>18</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As discussed in greater detail below, material deposition tool <b>18</b> may receive material cartridges, such as material cartridge <b>26</b>. Movement of tool interface <b>20</b> along Y-axis stage <b>12</b> is driven by motor <b>42</b>, which is preferably a motor similar to, or identical to, motors <b>40</b>A-B. With tool interface <b>20</b> being capable of moving back and forth along Y-axis stage <b>12</b> and Y-axis stage <b>12</b> being capable of moving back and forth along X-axis stages <b>10</b>A-B, positioning system <b>8</b> is capable of moving tool interface <b>20</b> in virtually any direction on a horizontal plane above horizontal surface <b>90</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Above horizontal surface <b>90</b> of machine base <b>6</b> and below positioning system <b>8</b> is substrate <b>16</b>. Substrate <b>16</b> is a build surface upon which material from material deposition tool <b>18</b> is deposited. In a preferred embodiment, substrate <b>16</b> is equipped with calibration device <b>44</b>, which may be fixed anywhere on substrate <b>16</b>, but is preferably fixed to an outer edge or corner of substrate <b>16</b>. Calibration device <b>44</b> is described in greater detail below. Substrate <b>16</b> is preferably constructed of a precision-ground aluminum plate, but may be constructed of any material capable of ensuring planarity. Substrate <b>16</b> rests on support structure <b>34</b>, which holds substrate <b>16</b> in a horizontal position or, alternatively, may be adjusted to change the orientation (i.e., angle) of the surface plane of substrate <b>16</b> relative to positioning system <b>8</b>. Support structure <b>34</b> is preferably of rigid construction.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the particular embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, support structure <b>34</b> is connected to Z-axis stage <b>14</b>. Z-axis stage <b>14</b> is preferably a commercially available ballscrew stage, identical to X-axis stages <b>10</b>A-B and Y-axis stage <b>12</b>. Support structure <b>34</b> moves along Z-axis stage <b>14</b> in a vertical direction either towards or away from positioning system <b>8</b>, thereby adjusting the vertical distance of substrate <b>16</b> relative to the material deposition tool (e.g., material deposition tool <b>18</b>) connected to tool interface <b>20</b> of positioning system <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In operation, material deposition device <b>2</b> fabricates a product as positioning system <b>8</b> moves material deposition tool <b>18</b> in a pathway along substrate <b>16</b> and material deposition tool <b>18</b> deposits material onto substrate <b>16</b> along the pathway. Typically, fabrication of a product is carried out by layer-wise deposition of the material. This standard planar layered deposition approach to material deposition device <b>2</b> enables the system to deposit materials from material deposition tool <b>18</b> in a manner which optimizes the properties of the deposited material relative to the specified performance metrics for the product being fabricated&#x2014;including alignment of deposited material fibers along primary stress axes to improve mechanical performance, depositing polymer materials in a manner which increases the degree of molecular alignment, and improving e.g., electrical or mechanical properties.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Alternative embodiments of material deposition device <b>2</b> may be designed to permit a less massive machine base to be used. For example, a cable and pulley arrangement could be used to create a Cartesian gantry robot in which the motors remain stationary (mounted on the machine base), thereby reducing the moving mass of the system and the reaction forces. This in turn would allow the use of a smaller, lighter machine base without compromising stability and precision. Alternative embodiments may make use of other means of moving the positioning system components, including linear electromagnetic motors, pneumatics, or hydraulics.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Alternative embodiments of material deposition device <b>2</b> can also make use of other positioning systems including, but not limited to, articulated robotic arms for the positioning and traversing of the material deposition tools and/or the positioning of the substrate. This would permit the material deposition device to make use of non-planar deposition paths (3-D curves) and more complex manipulation of objects being fabricated. This would also provide more freedom for the manufacturing planning components of the system to arrive at plans which more closely match the specifications of the desired product, which may include the ability to achieve 3-D curvilinear optimization of fiber or molecular alignment in deposited materials.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is tool rack <b>4</b> which, in the particular embodiment shown, is connected to material deposition device <b>2</b>. In an alternative embodiment, tool rack <b>4</b> may be located in proximity to material deposition device <b>2</b> rather than being connected. Tool rack <b>4</b> is equipped with tool mounts, such as tool mount <b>28</b>, which are capable of receiving a variety of material deposition tools, represented by mounted tool <b>30</b> and described in further detail below. A preferred tool mount of tool rack <b>4</b> is illustrated as tool mount <b>28</b>, which has fluid/gas and electrical connectors <b>36</b> and mechanical connectors <b>38</b>. Fluid/gas and electrical connectors <b>36</b> and mechanical connectors <b>38</b> allow tool rack <b>4</b> to be in electrical, fluid/gas, and/or mechanical communication with tools stored on tool rack <b>4</b>. Tool rack <b>4</b> may also be equipped with cartridge holding devices <b>32</b> that are capable of receiving individual material cartridges <b>26</b>. Tool rack <b>4</b> may also be equipped with substrate module holding devices that are capable of receiving individual or groupings of substrate modules. Substrate module holding devices may include electronic, mechanical, and/or auxiliary material interfaces which permit communication between any embedded intelligence and control in the substrate modules and the tool rack and hence the system controller. These interfaces may also provide utilities and auxiliary materials which may be used for the monitoring and control of the state of the substrate module and its contents.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a preferred embodiment, tool rack <b>4</b> is designed to provide utility services to material deposition tools and material cartridges which are stored on it, and to provide communication between the material deposition tools and the system controller. Particular services include, without limitation, power, data communication, commands, fluids, and compressed gas. Data communication can take place between the material deposition tools and material cartridges stored on tool rack <b>4</b> and the system controller to enable the real-time status of materials and material deposition tools to be controlled and/or monitored while they are not in use. Data communication further allows the status to be used during manufacturing planning and allows the inventory to be managed. For example, requests for additional material can be made to a user if the system finds that tool rack <b>4</b> does not contain sufficient quantity of a material required in the current manufacturing task. The data communication also allows the system controller and/or user to reprogram, query, monitor, and/or control any embedded intelligence, sensors, and/or actuators in the material deposition tools or material cartridges. This can include updating the identity and/or status of materials contained in a tool or cartridge, and updating the internal control parameters of a material cartridge and/or a material deposition tool. These features of tool rack <b>4</b> make it possible to use materials prepared further in advance than would otherwise be possible, since they can be kept in favorable conditions for preservation by the cartridge until use. They also enable a greater level of automation, and more efficient use of materials than is otherwise possible because the materials can be automatically readied for use at the appropriate time, and possibly returned to storage conditions automatically by the system. Chemical reactions, cellular reproduction and metabolism, and other material properties can be monitored and controlled in materials awaiting use, enabling the controller evolution of material properties to be an integral part of the manufacturing plan.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Turning to the illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, tool interface <b>20</b> is equipped with tool interface mount <b>92</b>, which is capable of receiving a material deposition tool. Tool interface mount <b>92</b> is a standardized tool interface to accommodate a plurality of material deposition tools. In a preferred embodiment, tool interface mount <b>92</b> is a commercially available robotic tool changer that provides for a rigid, precise, and repeatable automatic mounting and unmounting of material deposition tools. Preferably, tool interface mount <b>92</b> has electrical connectors, fluid/gas connectors, and mechanical connectors (e.g., a pneumatic connection) capable of establishing electrical, fluid/gas, and mechanical communication with a connected material deposition tool. Thus, when a material deposition tool is connected to tool interface mount <b>92</b>, electrical, fluid/gas, and mechanical communication may be established between tool interface <b>20</b> (and the system controller and any fluid, gas, electrical, and mechanical utilities available in the system) and the connected material deposition tool.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A unique feature of the system of the present invention is that rather than being dedicated to a single manufacturing process technology and to one or two materials, this system makes use of multiple deposition (and other manufacturing, testing, and measurement process) technologies, and an essentially unlimited number of materials. This is achieved by encapsulating a given manufacturing technology in a modular &#x201c;tool&#x201d; (referred to as a material deposition tool) which is manipulated by the material deposition device (i.e., positioning system <b>8</b>) during the course of manufacturing, measuring, or testing an object. Tools may have significant onboard sensing, actuation and computational resources in order to monitor and control their own performance, and/or the state of the material that they are employing, as well as for communicating state information and control parameters with the system controller.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Material deposition tools useful in the system of the present invention (i.e., for positioning on tool interface mount <b>92</b>) include, without limitation, various commercially available material deposition tools and material deposition tools described herein.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one embodiment, one of the material deposition tools is a fusible-material extrusion tool for depositing thermally liquefied plastics, low melting-point metals, and other fusible materials. Fusible-material extrusion tools are commercially available. Typically, this type of tool employs motor-driven pinch-rollers to force feedstock material (in the form of a wire) into a heated portion of the tool and out of a constricted orifice (nozzle). The heated portion of the tool softens or melts the feedstock, permitting it to be pushed out of the nozzle as a fine stream of liquid or semi-liquid material. Nozzles are replaceable, and nozzle orifice diameters may be smaller than 0.010 of an inch.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Various modifications may be made to commercially available fusible-material extrusion tools for use with the system of the present invention. These design modifications may include a temperature sensor positioned directly in the nozzle, immediately proximate to the point where the material is deposited to control the extrusion temperature of the deposited material. In addition, the pinch-rollers may be modified to have a tooth shape which is optimized for minimal damage to the feedstock and maximum buckling strength of the feedstock as it is driven into the tool, allowing the feedstock to be driven with more force into the heater block and out of the nozzle. This modification permits faster extrusion rates and/or finer resolution (via narrower nozzles). In another modification, the body of the tool may be made of organic polymers to reduce the mass of the tool and thereby improve the performance of the positioning system while the tool is in use by the system. Also, the tool may be equipped with a muffler surrounding the feed stock material through which fluid or compressed gas may be circulated in order to actively cool the feedstock material after passing through the pinch roller and before reaching the heater block. This would also increase the buckling strength of the feedstock material and would allow for faster extrusion and/or higher resolution.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In another embodiment, one of the material deposition tools used in the system of the present invention is an ink-jet tool. Ink-jet tools, in particular, and, more generally, any tool can be used to deposit multiple reactants into the same spatial location in order to effect a chemical reaction on a very local scale. The very small volumes achievable with ink-jet droplets (e.g. picoliters) are especially well suited to this. Ink-jet droplets of multiple reactants jetted into the same location will react very quickly, permitting the local control chemical reactions within deposited material, allowing very small scale structuring of chemical activity and resultant material properties. Reactant concentrations can be varied by relative numbers of drops of each type of reactant deposited at a give point. This can allow reactions fast enough that reactants do not have time to move (e.g., drip or flow) or evaporate or degrade before the reaction takes place. An ink-jet tool is capable of depositing multiple (e.g., four) materials simultaneously without material changes. An important benefit of ink-jetting for material deposition is high resolution (100 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;100 nm disk-shaped deposit per droplet), especially when working with materials whose functionality depends on their being produced in thin films (e.g., semiconducting polymers, dielectrics, separator materials for batteries, electroding materials for actuators). The very small volume of droplets (picoliter) achievable with ink-jetting allows deposition of material onto non-planar surfaces. The very small droplets not only dry extremely quickly, but the small gravitational force they experience allows them to adhere to sloped and curved surfaces without the flowing that larger drops would experience. This is exceedingly valuable when fabricating articles with complex, non-planar geometries containing non-horizontal and/or non-planar laminae or other structures. The high resolution and point-by-point deposition of material permits structures (such as linear features whose material varies with length, or multi-material lattices) to be practically realized, making the products of an ink-jet tool complementary to those that can be achieved by a stream-type deposition tool such as a syringe tool (described below).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In a further embodiment, one of the material deposition tools is an electrospinning tool. An electrospinning tool uses an electrical potential difference between the material, generally a fluid, contained in the tool, and the substrate to draw the material out of the tool in extremely fine streams. This potential difference can be achieved by placing one electrode in contact with the fluid within the tool, and another electrode on the substrate (if it is conductive) or on a perforated electrically conductive plate placed between the tool and the substrate. A central hole in the latter plate is arranged concentrically with the outlet or nozzle of the tool so that the fluid stream may pass directly through and continue to be deposited on the substrate. Volatile liquid components of the material may evaporate from the stream of material because of electrostatic charging and self-repulsion and because of the very large surface area to volume ratio of the stream. The material which arrives at the substrate may thus be a dry thread of material with a diameter of nanometers. Adjusting the material composition, the spacing between the substrate and the tool, and the electrical potential can allow control of the liquid content and diameter of the deposited material. This type of tool permits the production of nanoscale structures, including highly aligned polymer molecules. Such a tool provides the system with the ability to embed materials structured at the nanometer scale into macroscopic objects being fabricated.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In another embodiment, one of the material deposition tools may be a &#x201c;pick and place&#x201d; robot tool. A &#x201c;pick and place&#x201d; robot tool is device which can hold, reorient, and accurately place an object onto a substrate. The materials dispensed by a &#x201c;pick and place&#x201d; robot tool may include integrated circuits, passive electrical components, electrical motors, batteries, and any other discrete solid objects with characteristic dimensions ranging from 100 micrometers to 10 centimeters. For example, a &#x201c;pick and place&#x201d; robot tool might place integrated circuit components onto conductive pads and conductive traces deposited by other material deposition tools in the course of fabricating an article. Still, other material deposition tools might then encapsulate the circuit components and conductive pads and traces in an insulating material to produce an article with embedded exogenously manufactured components.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In other embodiments, the material deposition tools may include, but not be limited to: thermal spray deposition tools, vapor deposition tools, and laser forward transfer deposition tools.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A thermal spray deposition tool is a device in which a solid material powder is entrained in a gas stream which is directed at the substrate. The stream is passed through a heat source prior to arriving at the substrate such that the powder particles are melted and deposited as tiny molten drops.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A vapor deposition tool employs a stream of gas to entrain vapor evaporated from a solid or liquid material contained in a heated reservoir. Within the tool, the gas stream flows past or through the reservoir, entrains the vapor, and is directed out of an orifice toward the substrate. When the substrate is below the condensation temperature of the vapor, the vapor will condense onto the substrate. The rate and morphology of deposited material can be regulated by varying the reservoir temperature, the gas stream velocity, and temperature, the substrate temperature, the orifice diameter, and the distance from orifice to substrate.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A laser forward transfer deposition tool employs a pulsed laser to transfer material from a source substrate to a receiving substrate. The source substrate is located between the laser and the receiving substrate. The source substrate generally consists of a laser transparent medium, such as a strip, tape, or disk of glass, fused silica, or polymer. The lower surface of the source substrate&#x2014;that which faces the receiving substrate&#x2014;is coated with a thin layer (e.g. 0.1-1000 micrometers) of the material to be deposited. A pulse from the laser is directed at the source substrate, passes through the transparent medium, and liberates a small quantity of the material attached to the source substrate medium. The momentum imparted to the material in the course of liberation carries it toward the receiving substrate, where it is deposited. After each laser pulse, the relative position of the source substrate and the laser are changed so that a region of the source substrate which has not received a pulse, and hence retains its full coating of material to be deposited, is placed in the path between the laser and the desired point of deposition on the receiving substrate.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The system may also include material modification tools which are intended to modify the properties and/or geometry of material after it has been deposited by a material deposition tool. Material modification tools include, but are not limited to, lasers, infrared lamps, ultraviolet lamps, cutting tools, milling tools, drills, temperature controlled jets of gases and/or fluids and/or gas or fluid entrained powders. In addition, any material deposition tool may also be integrated with and/or mounted simultaneously with other material deposition tools, and/or material modification tools, and/or material sensing apparatus. These combination tools and combinations of tools allow the deposition and/or modification and/or measurement of one or more deposited materials in very rapid succession. This enhances the spatiotemporal control of the system over the materials being deposited.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In yet another embodiment, one of the material deposition tools is a cartridge holding tool capable of receiving a modular material cartridge. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a preferred embodiment of material deposition tool <b>18</b>, which is a cartridge holding tool equipped with cartridge socket <b>48</b> for receiving a modular material cartridge. As shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, cartridge socket <b>48</b> has mechanical interfaces <b>52</b> that hold a material cartridge in cartridge socket <b>48</b> and/or embedded intelligence in the material deposition tool and/or the system controller. Electronic and fluid/gas interfaces <b>54</b> establish electronic communication between the material cartridge placed in cartridge socket <b>48</b> and the system controller and provide fluid/gas flows to the material cartridge which may be used by the system controller and/or embedded intelligence in the tool and/or in the cartridge to monitor and control the state of the cartridge, and/or the material or materials contained in the cartridge. This enhances the ability of the overall system to achieve spatiotemporal control of the evolution of material properties before, during, and after fabrication of an article. Fluid/gas flows may also be used in a supporting role for fabrication by being routed through the cartridge and directed downward toward the substrate. This allows the creation of a highly localized controlled environment at the point of material deposition e.g. with an inert gas flow to prevent chemical reactions.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In a preferred embodiment, material deposition tools of the present invention are operably connected to the system controller, whether they are attached to the tool interface or not.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the particular embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, material deposition tool <b>18</b> is equipped with a volumetrically controlled dispensing system having linear motor <b>56</b> which provides up and down force to linear shaft <b>50</b>, thus driving the dispensing of material from material deposition tool <b>18</b>.

It also permits the use of a wider variety of materials than would otherwise be amenable to deposition. Cartridges may contain magnetic stirring or a vibrational stirring apparatus which can be used to maintain homogeneity in materials (e.g. multi-phase slurries, emulsions, dispersions) that otherwise would separate or settle, causing clogging of the tool or undesirable dispensing properties. Heating and cooling devices within syringe cartridge <b>26</b> may be used to manage viscosity of materials and to promote or prevent chemical or biological activity. In this way, materials can be maintained within syringe cartridge <b>26</b> in one state which is desirable for one set of reasons, then allowed to evolve into a different state after deposition. Given that the entire system of the present invention may reside in an enclosure (described below) which allows environmental control&#x2014;humidity, temperature, gas mix, lighting, sterility&#x2014;sophisticated control over the trajectories of many material parameters through time can be achieved, even as the material is deposited in precisely controlled geometry.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">It is possible to use the control that the active cartridge and the enclosure environment provides over the material state before, during, and after the deposition process to perform feedback control of parameters of the deposited material other than geometry&#x2014;enabling a steering of the manufacturing process toward a final product which more closely matches that desired. This can include such parameters as color, reflectivity, sterility, (biological) viability, mechanical properties, reactivity, odor, etc., provided that some means of detecting these parameters can be provided to the system. This means may consist of a human expert and/or an appropriate automatic sensor mounted on the material deposition tool or embodied as a separate modular sensing tool, for sequential use. Appropriate sensors include, without limitation, CCD cameras with machine vision software, &#x201c;electronic nose,&#x201d; mechanical probes with force instrumentation, and fluorescence CCD microscopes with machine vision software.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">An alternative to sensing of these properties via a tool or sensor mounted on tool interface <b>20</b> (or material deposition tool <b>18</b>) is to deposit the materials directly onto a sensing apparatus, or to embed the sensing apparatus within the material as it is being deposited. These substrate or embeddable sensors include, without limitation, biochip sensors for detection of biological products and monitoring and control of living cells and tissues, temperature sensors, semiconductor chemical sensors, strain gauges, pressure sensors, and many others.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Because most of the material deposition tools which are used with the system of the present invention deposit materials through an orifice of some kind, there is the frequent occurrence of residual material accumulating around the orifice, nozzle, tip, etc. Maintaining precise control of the deposition process, desired segregation of materials, and avoiding clogging and damage to tools and objects being fabricated, all require that the tools be cleaned periodically to remove this residual material. Several approaches may be used in the system to achieve this cleaning automatically. For tools with robust tips or nozzles and stubborn material accumulations, a wire brush, rubber scraper blade, solvent-saturated sponge, or a combination of these may be employed, namely by having positioning system <b>8</b> drive material deposition tool <b>18</b> to a point on substrate <b>16</b> where these devices are mounted, then rubbing the tip of material deposition tool <b>18</b> (or syringe cartridge <b>26</b>) against them automatically. For more delicate tool tips, such as fine gauge needles, a solvent bath and/or a gas jet may be used in an analogous fashion to wash or blow material away. Because the various material deposition tools used in the system may span all of these needs, in general, several tip cleaning devices will be positioned at the edge of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in one embodiment, transfer of material deposition tools and/or substrate modules and/or material cartridges to and from the tool rack and/or other storage locations and the material deposition device is carried out by transfer device <b>100</b>.

The pattern is established by the system controller, which operates according to an electronic data file so that changes to the product only require changes to the design data of the system controller. In its basic operation, transfer device <b>100</b>, according to a manufacturing plan programmed into the system controller, takes a specified tool from tool rack <b>4</b> and connects it to tool interface <b>20</b>. Tool interface <b>20</b> then communicates with material deposition tool <b>18</b> and configures it for use. Material deposition device <b>2</b> then performs some steps in the manufacturing plan, e.g. depositing some material in a designated pattern along substrate <b>16</b>. Transfer device <b>100</b> then retrieves material deposition tool <b>18</b> from tool interface <b>20</b> and returns it to tool rack <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">System controller <b>104</b> is operated by fabrication system software that automatically converts design data into a manufacturing plan. The fabrication system software automates the majority of operations of the system of the present invention, permitting the designer's intent to be converted into a realized product with a minimum of labor and prerequisite specialized knowledge about the materials being used (i.e. deposited). System controller <b>104</b> is designed to store data about system performance and to improve the system automatically by updating data and models which it uses for manufacturing planning, manufacturing simulation, manufacturing plan execution, and operation control.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The main components of the system software of system controller <b>104</b> are the manufacturing planning, operation control, materials/tools/substrates database, and design database. The manufacturing planning software is responsible for converting the designer's intent, via the product description data, into an executable plan for producing the design. In the simplest implementation, the system expects the product description data to be the geometry of the product, with contiguous subregions of geometry (called &#x201c;chunks&#x201d;) labeled with the material which the designer desires for that subregion, and the tool used to deposit that material. For each chunk of geometry, the materials/tools/substrates database is queried by the planning software for specifications of the material deposits that the requested material/tool combination can provide. These specifications include the geometry of the &#x201c;atomic&#x201d; deposits of material that this combination can produce. When the material deposition tool is an ink-jet tool, the atomic deposit is a deposit caused by a single drop of material from the tool. For other material deposition tools, such as a syringe tool and a fusible material extrusion tool, the atomic deposit may be curvilinear with some minimum length and some nominal cross-section dimensions. Still other atomic deposit types are possible with other material deposition tools, and many tools are capable of producing individual deposits of various sizes and shapes. The simplest manufacturing planning implementation does not take advantage of this. The essential aspect of the atomic deposit is that it can be combined into larger deposits by contiguous placement without producing undesirable loss of properties in the large deposit relative to those of the atomic deposit. The chunk geometry is decomposed into a union of geometric solids whose form is dictated by the atomic deposit. Positions (and possibly paths) in 3-dimensional space are stored for these to be later used to specify the paths and/or coordinates (referred to as the &#x201c;set of paths,&#x201d; or &#x201c;toolpaths&#x201d;) for material deposition to be performed by the system. When decomposition has been performed for all chunks in the design, the full set of data describing these decompositions is automatically sorted to satisfy a multiple objective optimization of the manufacturing process. This sorted set of paths (with associated tool and material labels and coordinates) constitutes a manufacturing plan which is executable by the system control software and system hardware.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the simplest approach, the sorting of paths will arrange the toolpaths by vertical (Z-axis) coordinate and paths with the same vertical coordinate will be grouped by material/tool combination. More sophisticated optimizations take into account more detailed information about the materials, tools, performance of the system itself, and known design rules (e.g. from the design database) for certain aspects of the design. More sophisticated optimizations can also involve optimizing the shape and directionality of material deposition paths to achieve desired properties in the finished products. This can include optimizing mechanical properties such as tensile strength along primary stress axes, or possibly even along 3-dimensional curves through an object being fabricated. This type of final material property optimization through path optimization can also be used to provide preferential axes for tissue growth when working with living biological materials. Information to drive these optimizations can be extracted from the materials/tools/substrates and design databases, from real-time and historical performance data that the system maintains about itself, and from a simulation of the manufacturing process. This latter method becomes more crucial as designs, material behavior, and material interactions become more complex, and specifications for the finished product become more stringent. The simulation may make use of models of material evolution over time and in response to environmental conditions which are stored in the materials/tools/substrates database, models of system operation and performance, and may perform physical simulations of a candidate manufacturing process for a given design (including finite element models, or other physics-based modeling). In this way, the system can make predictions about the quality and/or performance of a final product that might result from a given manufacturing plan, which can then be used for automated searching for manufacturing plans which satisfy the objective functions supplied by a user in the design specifications for the object to be produced. The simulation, in an interactive mode, can permit a designer to explore the effect of alternative designs on the complexity of the manufacturing process. The simulation of the manufacturing process also plays an essential role for error recovery/correction during a manufacturing process. Error recovery/correction is important because producing complex objects with novel or experimental materials is costly and time consuming. Further, if the system does not detect and recover from errors during the manufacturing process, the errors will&#x2014;by the very nature of the SFF process&#x2014;be buried within the object being produced and be difficult or impossible to diagnose and repair. The manufacturing simulation allows the system, at any step in the manufacturing process, to compare the state (geometry and other automatically detectable properties) of the simulation to the state of the real object being produced as measured by 3-D scanning (or other) sensors. Discrepancies can be remedied by generating modifications to the manufacturing plan which replace or circumvent the error&#x2014;these too can be explored in simulation, and the effect of the errors and the modifications to the manufacturing plans can be used to update predictions of the quality and performance of the final product.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The manufacturing planning software can include special purpose data conversion capabilities to assist the designer in conveying design data to the system. This can include automatic conversion of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data into manufacturing plan geometry data, or automatic conversion of point cloud data resulting from non-contact scanning directly into manufacturing plan geometry data.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Another element of the system controller of the present invention is operation control, which includes all of the feedback control, self-testing, data-collection software required to operate the system hardware and execute a manufacturing plan produced by the manufacturing planning software, including: (i) low-level control software for tools and material cartridges which may be executed by computational hardware within the tools and cartridges themselves; (ii) the feedback control laws which operate the environmental controls within the system enclosure; (iii) the motion control software that commands the positioning systems and coordinates positioning system control with tool deposition control; (iv) control and path planning for the transfer device used for tool and material changes; and (v) scanning sensor control, data collection, and data conversion.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The materials/tools/substrates database component of the system controller is used to store information about the properties of materials used in fabrication, the types and shapes of deposits of material that can be made by a given deposition tool, specialized parameters for controlling deposition tools to achieve each type of deposit, selection and parameters for controlling material modification tools to achieve a desired modification of material properties, parameters for controlling substrate modules in order to achieve a desired trajectory of materials properties evolution, material interactions with other materials, and other information. The material properties information may be in the form of a complex material model, which can include time evolution of the material properties in response to conditions. This type of information may be used in many ways in manufacturing planning and manufacturing simulation, including: (i) generating plans for the control of material substrate modules and enclosure environmental conditions to guide the evolution of material properties before, during, and after deposition (e.g. cellular reproduction rates, chemical reaction rates, etc.); (ii) identifying complications in a manufacturing plan, e.g. where adjacent materials might be reactive, where a liquid might need to be deposited only after a solid boundary has been constructed to contain it; and (iii) identifying how long manufacturing plan steps must be spaced by in order to allow deposited materials to solidify, react, etc.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The information in the database is compiled from a variety of sources. First, the embedded intelligence, sensing, and communications in material deposition tools and cartridges obtains real-time information on quantity and status of materials loaded into the system for use in the current manufacturing plan, and health and operational status of the tools. Second, chemical or materials data references and research obtain general chemical and materials properties data and dynamic properties models. Third, manual calibration by operators or machine learning algorithms within the system (Malone et al., &#x201c;Application of Machine Learning Methods to the Open-Loop Control of a Freeform Fabrication System,&#x201d; <i>Proceedings of the </i>15<i>th Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium</i>, Austin Tex., August 2004, pp. 377-388, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) retrieve tool control parameters required to generate a given material deposit geometry.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The design database is a repository of subunits of manufacturing plans and design rules of thumb that have been demonstrated to be successful, as well as complete designs and manufacturing plans for useful functional modules that are likely to be desirable inclusions into other designs. Maintaining this database is important, because no practical manufacturing simulation will be able to predict all issues of concern during manufacturing. The successful designs, rules, tricks, and modules capture much of the hidden information that would be difficult or impossible to simulate.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Modules can be complete functional devices, such as batteries, actuators, joints, transistors, etc., which can be freeform fabricated directly into other designs to produce a composition of higher functionality. Design rules can be empirical relations between, for instance, the volume of active material deposited in a certain type of device, and the performance of the resulting device.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In order for the manufacturing planning and control system to be able to automatically monitor the progress of a fabrication operation, to identify and locate objects placed in the build environment, and to measure the geometry of the finished product, the system may include a non-contact ranging sensor device which can be scanned by the positioning system across the build surface (i.e. substrate). This device has a distance resolution of 10 micrometers, while the positioning system has an XY-plane resolution of 5 micrometers. The benefit of this type of sensor is that it is compact enough to embed within material deposition tools near the point of material deposition (e.g. nozzle), and of low enough cost to use in each cartridge, even in multiples. The presence of the ranging sensor within a material deposition tool permits the acquisition of the geometry of deposited material with minimal interruption of the fabrication process (e.g. without pausing manufacturing in order to mount a separate sensing tool to perform the scanning) and very near the point of deposition. This improves the value of the resulting data for use in feedback control of the deposition tool&#x2014;geometric flaws in deposited material can be detected quickly, minimally allowing the manufacturing planning software to design compensating material deposits which can be executed in a timely fashion, without compromising the properties of materials which are sensitive to the time since deposition. If such sensing can be provided in a 360 degree circle around and very proximate to the point of deposition, such sensing could be used for online feedback control of the deposition tool&#x2014;allowing the control law for the tool to adjust tool actuator commands in order to achieve the desired deposit geometry. Because many materials are not mechanically durable, and many are liquids, measurement by contact methods is not acceptable for this role. Even if not useful for online feedback control, more frequent &#x201c;semi-online&#x201d; feedback provided by the currently employed sensor greatly improves the achievable final quality of the object being fabricated, because it allows the manufacturing planning software to compensate for variability in the properties of the materials being employed, or other deposition errors by automatically generating modified manufacturing plans which compensate for the errors, for instance by depositing material into undesired gaps, or by modifying subsequent deposition paths so that they do not collide with excess material that was accidentally deposited.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Alternative embodiments for this type of non-contact geometric sensing may include confocal chromatic displacement sensor, ultrasonic range sensor, a laser triangulation sensor as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, which can provide superior distance resolution, and reduced sensitivity to the reflectivity of the material. Laser triangulation sensor <b>150</b> is preferably positioned on the back side of tool interface <b>20</b> and emits lasers <b>152</b> onto substrate <b>16</b>. Other machine vision sensing technologies are also available, including microscopic video capture at the point of deposition.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">One of the challenges of employing multiple tools in a freeform fabrication system is that of &#x201c;registration,&#x201d; namely ensuring that the point of material deposition is accurately known by the system controller for each tool that is used. The tools have finite rigidity, and even using precision robotic tool changers to mount tools to the positioning system, there is a limit to the repeatability of the position of the point of action of the tool. Without accurate registration, material deposited by one tool will not be positioned correctly relative to material deposited by previous and subsequent tools used, and significant geometric and functional errors will result from the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Two approaches have been explored for calibrating the location of the point of deposition. The first, and inferior method, requires that for each time a tool is mounted for use on the positioning system, a human operator must manually control all 3 axes of the positioning system, placing the tip of the tool in contact with a &#x201c;registration mark&#x201d; on the build surface. The position of this mark is stable over time and at a known location within the volume accessible to the positioning system. Thus, when the point of deposition of the current tool is located at this mark, the positioning system can read the displacement between this location and the known location of the registration mark, and thereby infer the position of the point of deposition of the current tool. Because this method requires an operator to perform the calibration manually through visual alignment, and for each tool change, the labor and time required are impractical (1-5 minutes for each calibration, possibly hundreds of tool changes during a relatively simple build operation). For this reason, a second method has been developed which automates this calibration process. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, calibration device <b>44</b> is mounted on substrate <b>16</b>. Calibration device <b>44</b> eliminates the need for the registration mark and reliance on the human operator's eye. Calibration device <b>44</b> has two infrared emitters <b>200</b>A-B and two infrared detectors <b>202</b>A-B oriented orthogonally to each other, and Teflon-covered analog force sensor <b>204</b> located at the intersection of the two optical axes.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The optical emitter/detector pairs (<b>200</b>A-B and <b>202</b>A-B, respectively) function by detectors <b>202</b>A-B returning a signal level which is higher when less infrared light is received from emitters <b>200</b>A-B. Thus, when an object obstructs the optical axis of an emitter/detector pair, the signal will be larger than when no object is present, and the signal varies symmetrically as an object moves perpendicularly across the optical axis. This sensing arrangement easily detects small deposition tips, such as a syringe needle <b>68</b> with an outside diameter of 0.007&#x2033;. The system control software monitors the analog output signals from the optical sensors, while commanding the positioning system to perform a search pattern. When tool tip <b>68</b> has been positioned at the center of both optical axes, providing the X and Y coordinates of the tool tip, the Z-axis is elevated gradually, raising the sensor assembly toward tool tip <b>68</b> until a signal is detected by force sensor <b>204</b>. Force sensor <b>204</b> is designed to detect very small changes in applied force with very little displacement, so detecting contact with the sensor requires very little force be applied to tool tip <b>68</b>. When a threshold force is detected, the Z coordinate of tool tip <b>68</b> is identified.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In an alternative embodiment of calibration device <b>44</b>, a hole is left in the center of sensor <b>204</b>, extending directly through substrate <b>16</b>. An initial rough positioning of tool tip <b>68</b> will be used to maneuver tool tip <b>68</b> through the hole so that it extends below the plane of substrate <b>16</b>. A compressed gas jet located beneath the substrate <b>16</b> at this location will be activated briefly to blow away any residual material attached to tool tip <b>68</b>, if the tool is delicate. If tool tip <b>68</b> is less delicate and requires more vigorous cleaning, a wire brush, rubber scraper blade, or similar device will be located proximate to calibration device <b>44</b> to be used for tip cleaning (by relative motion). Tool tip <b>68</b> will then be raised upward through the hole, and the search pattern used to identify the X, Y, and Z coordinates of tool tip <b>68</b>&#x2014;the X and Y coordinates first as before with the current version of the sensor, and the Z coordinate by observing simultaneous rising signal edges in detectors <b>200</b>A-B which is associated with tool tip <b>68</b> leaving both optical axes simultaneously in the Z-direction.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Before commencing to fabricate an article and/or after having made each deposit of material, the system can collect 3-dimensional geometry data of the current state of the substrate and any objects therein, the material deposited, and the article being fabricated. Precisely capturing the geometry of the substrate immediately prior to manufacturing, planning, and commencing deposition is important when an article is to be fabricated onto or into an object whose geometry and location are not precisely known, are not easily represented, and/or are not static, such as a living organism. This permits the manufacturing plan to be generated in a manner which accommodates the actual geometry of the substrate, preventing collision between the deposition tool and the substrate, and improving deposition quality by maintaining proper separation between tool and substrate. The more dynamic the substrate, the more frequently such data must be captured. If necessary, geometric sensing apparatus can be located very near to the orifice of a tool and data collected continuously, enabling the system controller to track the motion of the substrate and command compensatory motion of the deposition tool relative to the substrate while depositing material in order to achieve the desired deposit geometry. After having made a deposit of material, the system can collect 3-dimensional geometry data of the current state of the product being fabricated. Any substantial unexpected deviation of the deposit geometry from that predicted by the manufacturing simulation for the current manufacturing step will be captured as an error volume (polytope). This error volume will be sent back to the manufacturing planning software which may modify the manufacturing plan in order to attempt to remove the error by making additional material deposits, or may cancel the entire manufacturing operation. Any unremediated error will be incorporated into the manufacturing simulation, to improve prediction of the characteristics of the finished product. This error data may also be used to modify the materials/tools/substrates and design databases to reflect any knowledge gained from identifying the cause of the error. Other sensing devices may be used in an analogous manner to provide spatial and/or temporal monitoring of other aspects of the substrate, of the state of the material being deposited, and of the article being fabricated. Deviations of the measurements from the desired values, as simulated in the simulation module of the system software, or as expected from the data in the materials/tools/substrates database, can be used to generate compensatory actions which may be executed prior to making the next deposit of material. For instance, given a deposit of a chemically reactive material which changes color as it reacts, a machine vision sensor can detect that the color of a region of deposited material is not what is expected for this material given the data present in the materials/tools/substrates database, the time elapsed since the material was deposited, and the conditions experienced by the material as measured by sensors within the substrate module. The system can generate a compensatory action which is to apply local heating via a material modification tool to those areas which are under reacted, and to reduce the temperature in the receptacle of the substrate module in order to slow the reaction of those areas which are overreacted.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">To further enable fabrication of complex articles, such as living tissues, the fabrication system of the present invention may have one or more substrate modules attachable to the substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-C</figref> illustrate a module of the present invention, which is attachable to the substrate.

Gels that cross-linked more quickly would be further cross-linked at the time of deposition and would be less receptive to subsequent layers because the bonds were already formed before the following layers could be deposited. Experiments were run in which the experimental parameters were varied and the cross-linking rate was given a relative, qualitative measure depending on how quickly the gel stiffened. The relationships between the experimental parameters and the ability of the gel to bond between layers are summarized in Table 3.

It was initially thought that the viscosity would be an accurate indication of how well the gel would hold its shape against gravity. In order to further vary the viscosity, dextrose was used as a bulking agent. However, after comparing the results of the viscosity experiments to simulated prints in which the gel was layered by hand, it was clear that viscosity was not an accurate indicator of a gel's resistance to weight-induced deformation. The notion was rejected and this part of the formulation process was iterated. At this point, it was noticed that the resistance was strongly related to cross-linking rate. While a high viscosity did not help the gel hold its shape, partial cross-linking did. Therefore, the faster a gel cross-linked the better it would be able to hold its own weight. At this point, it was realized that two SFF-related needs were directly determined by cross-linking rate, that is, the bonding between layers and the resistance to gravity. However, these two needs were opposed to each other. A higher cross-linking rate would help the gel hold its shape against gravity, while at the same time it would make the layers less likely to bond with each other. Some acceptable compromise needed to be reached.

In other words, the test determined whether the gel sustained life throughout the printing process, i.e., while being subjected to the shear forces induced by the deposition process. During viability testing, the printing process was simulated and then the percentage of living cells versus dead cells was measured before and after the simulated printing process. In order to count the percentage of living cells, two fluorescent chemical markers were used. Calcein acetoxymethyl (calcein AM) attaches to living cells and ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) attaches to dead cells. Through the use of a fluorescent light source, a microscope, and the appropriate optical filters, the living and dead cells were identified (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-B</figref>). The viability test did not have to be done under sterile conditions; the test was measuring short-term viability and infection would only have a long-term effect.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0195">Process Sterility Test</p><p id="p-0202" num="0196">The approach of using an autoclavable plastic bag as a printing envelope had to be tested to verify that no bacteria or fungi were allowed to infect the printed alginate gel. A sterile sample of alginate gel was prepared and placed in a sterile syringe. This syringe was then transported, with a sterilized syringe end-cap, to the printer and the full printing procedure was executed. After the printing, the sample was brought back to a sterile work hood where the envelope was opened and the sample removed. The gel sample was incubated for a period of eight days. After this incubation period, the sample was analyzed for presence of bacteria and fungi growth with the use of a chemical marker and fluorescence microscopy. It was determined that there was less than 1 bacterium per 0.9 &#x3bc;L after 8 days of incubation.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0197">Direct CT Scan Printing Test</p><p id="p-0204" num="0198">This research additionally demonstrated the ability to efficiently print a hydrogel implant directly from a CT scan. A CT scan of a meniscus cartilage was provided by the Cornell affiliated Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) and then converted into an STL file.

The results of this direct CT Scan print are shown (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A-B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>A-B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0205" num="0199">These results show the ability to successfully 3-D print viable, infection-free, living hydrogel implants of multiple materials with complex biological geometries. By printing with alginate hydrogels pre-seeded with gels, this technology serves as a versatile tissue engineering platform on which spatially heterogeneous implants of varied seeding densities, chemical concentrations, cell-types, etc., can be fabricated in arbitrary geometries. Additionally, the fabrication of implants generated directly from CT Scans brings this technology one step closer to its clinical form. This will allow patients to have, within hours, a complex, living, pre-seeded, multi-cell-type implant, such as an intervertebral disk, produced from prior CT Scans of their own healthy body parts.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 3&#x2014;Direct Freeform Fabrication of Zinc-Air Batteries with Tailored Geometry and Performance</heading><p id="p-0206" num="0200">In the following discussion, a cell is defined as a device that converts the chemical potential energy between its anode and cathode materials into electrical energy by means of redox reactions: reduction (electron gain) at the cathode, oxidation (electron loss) at the anode. A battery comprises of one or more connected cells. The essential functional components of a zinc-air (&#x201c;Zn-air&#x201d;) cell are the anode terminal, cathode terminal, anode, separator, catalyst, electrolyte, and casing. The anode and cathode terminals are passive conductors that collect charge carriers and allow connection to external loads. The anode (zinc in this case) is one of the two key reactants in the cell. The other key reactant, oxygen, is derived directly from the atmosphere. The separator provides electrical insulation between the anode and cathode to prevent internal shorting, but must be permeable to electrolyte to allow ionic current flow. The catalyst accelerates the rate of chemical reaction at the electrolyte/atmosphere interface in a cell, improving power output. The electrolyte (aqueous potassium hydroxide (&#x201c;aq. KOH&#x201d;) in this case), provides a medium for ionic transport within the cell and a source of ions. The casing provides an enclosure for the battery materials, permitting the battery to be handled without exposing the handler to the chemical reactants therein, and restricting the exposure of the reactants to the atmosphere, so that the evaporative loss of water from the electrolyte is reduced while still permitting the diffusion of atmospheric oxygen into the battery. The basic chemical reactions are:</p><p id="p-0207" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00006" num="00006"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>At Air Cathode:</entry><entry>&#xbd; O<sub>2 </sub>+ H<sub>2</sub>O + 2e &#x2192;2OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup></entry></row><row><entry/><entry>At Zn Anode:</entry><entry>Zn &#x2192; Zn<sup>2+</sup> + 2e</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Zn<sup>2+</sup> + 2OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub></entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Zn(OH)<sub>2 </sub>&#x2192; ZnO + H<sub>2</sub>O</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Overall:</entry><entry>Zn + &#xbd;O<sub>2 </sub>&#x2192; ZnO:E<sub>0 </sub>= 1.65 V</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><br/>Thus, the ideal output voltage of a zinc-air electrochemical cell is 1.65V. In practice, modes of energy dissipation within the cell limit open-circuit voltage to about 1.4V, and 1.2V under reasonable loading conditions.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0201">In order to produce a Zn-air battery in accordance with the freeform fabrication system of the present invention, for each of the materials required to produce a battery, a formulation must be prepared which can be readily, automatically dispensed by at least one of the material deposition tools. This formulation process presents a significant challenge given the variety of materials involved. The availability within the system of multiple material deposition tools which make use of differing deposition processes provides greater freedom in the choice of materials and reduces the number of restrictions associated with selecting and formulating materials. The fact that the form of the finished battery is determined by the geometry data provided to the fabrication system permits a variety of single and multiple cell batteries, and a variety of battery shapes to be constructed without reformulation of materials or modification of method of fabrication.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0202">A set of experiments concluded with the successful fabrication of a complete, functional Zn-air battery with the freeform fabrication system. The experiments (Malone et al., &#x201c;Freeform Fabrication of 3D Zinc-air Batteries and Functional Electro-mechanical Assemblies,&#x201d; <i>Rapid Prototyping Journal </i>10:58-69 (2004), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) employed two separate material deposition tools&#x2014;a fusible-material deposition tool and a prototype version of a cartridge holding tool&#x2014;with the freeform fabrication system to produce a complete, functional zinc-air battery.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0203">The fusible-material deposition tool was used to deposit acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (&#x201c;ABS&#x201d;) thermoplastic as the casing of the batteries. As this material has been used with this tool in a wide variety of other experiments, no special formulation was required.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0204">The cartridge holding tool was used to deposit four different materials from four 10 mL disposable syringes, each syringe loaded with one of four materials. The first material was a methylcellulose gel filled with silver powder in order to render it electrically conductive. This material was used to form the anode terminal and cathode terminal. The second material was a slurry of zinc powder and aqueous potassium hydroxide at 8 Molar concentration, with a nonionic surfactant added to disperse the zinc powder and reduce friction in the material. This material was used to form the zinc anode. The third material was a slurry of ceramic particles in water with an adhesive binder. This material was used to form the electrically insulating separator. The fourth material was a slurry of manganese dioxide, carbon black, and aqueous potassium hydroxide. This material was used as the cathode catalyst.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0205">Each of these materials required careful adjustment of the relative concentration of ingredients and, sometimes, the inclusion of additional ingredients in order to arrive at a formulation that can be dispensed from a syringe without clogging the syringe. All of the formulations had to be carefully tested and adjusted so that when deposited in the correct juxtapositions to each other, the aggregate behaved as a working electrochemical cell with reasonable power output. This is necessary since some of the formulation modifications which enhance the ability of the material to be dispensed may interfere with the desired electrochemical reactions.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0206">Once acceptable formulations were arrived at for each of the four materials, a syringe needle was selected for that material which has a circular cross-section and an interior diameter as small as possible without being prone to becoming clogged by the material. The selection was made by mounting a syringe needle on a given syringe filled with one of the materials. The material was pushed through the needle manually using a standard disposable syringe plunger. If the entire contents of the syringe (approximately 10 mL) could be pushed through the needle without a clog forming, the needle was considered acceptable, and the test was repeated with a needle of smaller internal diameter. If a clog formed, a needle of larger internal diameter was tried. This process was iterated until the smallest needle was found that does not experience clogging.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0207">Each material thus had an associated syringe needle which partially determined the geometry of the deposits of material that can be extruded from the syringe, and hence by the cartridge holding tool.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0208">Other factors that affect the geometry of the deposits include the viscosity of the material, which determines whether it retains its shape or flows after having been deposited. It is generally desirable in freeform fabrication that materials have high viscosity so that they retain their shape upon being deposited, and can be stacked vertically without being contained or supported. Another factor is the height of the tip of the syringe needle above the surface onto which material will be deposited. This height should be roughly equivalent to the internal diameter of the syringe needle in order to achieve a roughly circular cross-section of deposited material. Yet another factor that affects the geometry of the deposits is the acceleration and speed with which the material is extruded from the syringe by the cartridge holding tool relative to the acceleration and speed with which the material deposition device moves the cartridge holding tool along a given path over the substrate. When these speeds are matched, the material will be deposited with roughly the cross-sectional dimensions of the syringe needle.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0209">A calibration procedure was used to identify the accelerations, speeds, and distances which generate uniform, repeatable, and well-controlled deposits of material, as well as the relative position of the material deposition orifice of the tool to the position of the material deposition tool interface of the material deposition device. The calibration procedure was commenced for each material by entering the material name, the name of the material deposition tool used for depositing the material, and the initial estimated accelerations, speeds, and distances for the material into the materials/tools/substrates database of the system, mounting the cartridge holding tool onto the deposition device, loading a syringe of the particular material into a material cartridge and the cartridge into the cartridge holding tool, and commanding the system to produce a test pattern of the particular material by depositing it onto a substrate. The quality and geometry of the deposited test pattern was evaluated visually and with a caliper by the operator to determine whether the material deposits began, ended, maintained continuity, and maintained uniform cross-section as specified by the test pattern data. The parameters in the materials/tools/substrates database were adjusted and new test pattern deposits generated until the results were deemed satisfactory. The cross-sectional dimensions of the satisfactory material deposits were measured using the caliper. The height and width of the cross section of the deposits were entered into the materials/tools/substrates database with the other parameters. The parameters which generated the satisfactory results were used by the system for all subsequent deposition, including during the fabrication of a complete working battery.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0210">Once the cross-section dimensions of material deposits and associated parameters were found for all of the materials, the battery to be fabricated was designed using SolidWorks three-dimensional mechanical computer-aided design (&#x201c;MCAD&#x201d;) software. The battery designed was of a cylindrical shape. The design included an assembly of parts. A hollow cylindrical casing part contained stacked disk-shaped parts representing, from bottom to top, anode terminal, zinc anode, separator, cathode catalyst, and cathode terminal. The top-most part was a disk-shaped lid with holes intended to allow atmospheric oxygen to diffuse into the battery. Care was taken to ensure that the dimensions of each part of the battery assembly was larger than the cross-section dimensions of the material from which that part was to be fabricated. The data describing the geometry of the assembly (and all of the parts therein) was exported from the MCAD software as a set of STL format geometry data file.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0211">The graphical user interface (&#x201c;GUI&#x201d;) of the system software of the freeform fabrication system was used to import the STL files representing the geometry of the battery parts into the fabrication system. As the geometry of each part was imported, a shaded surface representation of the part was displayed to the user. The user used a feature of the GUI to assign a material from the materials/tools/substrates database to the part. The casing and casing lid were assigned the fusible-material deposition tool and the ABS thermoplastic material. All other parts were assigned the cartridge holding tool. The anode terminal and cathode terminal were assigned the methylcellulose material containing silver powder. The zinc anode part was assigned the zinc anode paste material. The separator part was assigned the separator ceramic slurry material. The cathode catalyst part was assigned the cathode catalyst slurry material.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0212">Once all of the parts of the battery were imported into the system, the user commanded the software to generate a manufacturing plan. Using the names of the materials assigned to each of the parts, the manufacturing planning module of the software queried the materials/tools/substrates database for the cross-sectional dimensions of the materials. For each part, the planning module then uses the height of the cross-section of the material associated with that part to generate a family of parallel planes normal to the vertical (Z direction) axis of the system, spaced by the cross-section height of that material. The intersection of the part geometry with the family of planes is a family of closed curves (called &#x201c;boundaries&#x201d;) which are uniformly spaced in height. At the height of each plane which intersected the part, the planning software generated a set of planar lines and curves (called &#x201c;toolpaths&#x201d;) in the area enclosed by the boundaries, which resided in the horizontal (XY) plane at that height, and which are horizontally spaced from each other by the width of the cross-section of the material. The manufacturing planning software labeled the toolpaths with the name of the material deposition tool and the material associated with the part being processed.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0213">This process was repeated for each part in the assembly which represented the battery to be fabricated, after which the manufacturing planning module sorted the toolpaths into a list according to several criteria, including the height of the toolpaths exported the set of labeled toolpaths (called the &#x201c;manufacturing plan&#x201d;) to the operation control module of the system software.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0214">The GUI informed the user that the manufacturing plan was completed. The user then commanded the system software to begin executing the manufacturing plan.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0215">The operation control module performed a self-test routine for the material deposition device hardware. The operation control module then examined the first labeled toolpath in the manufacturing plan to identify the material deposition tool and material required. In this case, the first tool required was the fusible-material deposition tool, and the material was ABS thermoplastic. The operation control module determined that this tool was not yet mounted on the tool interface of the material deposition device. The GUI requested that the user attach this tool to the tool interface. The operation control module then queried the materials/tools/substrates database for the parameters associated with this tool and this material, which also included the location of the material deposition orifice of the tool relative to the location of the tool interface in the material deposition device coordinate system. The GUI then requested that the user command motion of the positioning system of the material deposition device until the orifice of the material deposition tool was adjacent to the desired point on the substrate at which the fabrication of the battery was desired to commence. The user employed the GUI to perform this action, and to inform the operation control module that this action was completed. The operation control module then recorded this position of the positioning system as the &#x201c;build origin,&#x201d; and commenced to command the positioning system to trace out the first path in the manufacturing plan while simultaneously commanding the material deposition tool to deposit material onto the substrate, coordinating the commencement and termination of material deposition with the commencement and termination of positioning system motion along the path. Once this path was completed, subsequent paths in the manufacturing plan were examined by the operation control module. Several paths which described the bottom of the battery casing were executed in succession, resulting in a disk of ABS thermoplastic.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0216">The next several paths in the manufacturing plan were labeled with the cartridge holding tool and the silver-filled methylcellulose material. The fabrication process was interrupted by the operation control module, which commanded the positioning system to move to a corner of its range of motion while employing the GUI to request that the user remove the fusible material deposition tool from the tool interface, and replace it with the cartridge holding tool and ensure that a cartridge containing a syringe filled with the silver-filled methylcellulose material was mounted in the cartridge socket of the tool. The user performed these actions and signaled their completion using the GUI. The operation control module then resumed the fabrication process by querying the materials/tools/substrates database for the orifice coordinates for this tool and material, and adjusting the positioning system coordinate system to reflect the difference in the orifice coordinates between the two tools. The operation control module commanded the positioning system to position the orifice of the tool at the coordinates of the starting point of the next toolpath, and commanded the tool and deposition device to deposit material along the path as before, only using the parameters from the materials/tools/substrates database for this tool and this material.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0217">This same set of operations was continued by the system for each path in the manufacturing plan, requesting that the user change the tool and/or material cartridge according to the labels of the paths.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0218">After the deposition of the anode terminal, fabrication of the hollow cylindrical wall of the casing with the fusible material deposition tool and ABS material was alternated with fabrication of the other parts of the battery using the cartridge holding tool and the appropriate material cartridges, progressively building upward in height. The zinc anode was deposited atop the anode terminal. Then the separator, cathode catalyst and cathode conductor were deposited. Finally the fusible material deposition tool and ABS material were used to deposit the casing lid, which completed the fabrication of the functional zinc-air battery.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0219">The finished battery measured approximately 50 mm in diameter by 10 mm high, produced more than 1.4 V open-circuit, and was able to produce enough power (approximately 30 mW) to rotate a small electric motor for a few seconds.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0220">This example demonstrates the ability of the freeform fabrication system to fabricate complete functional articles which comprise multiple active materials while employing a plurality of material deposition tools which operate by different material deposition mechanisms.
