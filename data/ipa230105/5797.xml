For example, as disclosed in Patent Document 1, a step of etching the oxide film is performed by a chemical oxide removal (COR) process and a post heat treatment (PHT) process.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The COR process is a process of causing an oxide film formed on a wafer to react with a processing gas to modify the oxide film, thus generating a reaction product. The PHT process is a heating process of heating and vaporizing a reaction product produced in the COR process. By continuously performing the COR process and the PHT process, etching of the oxide film formed on the wafer is performed.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the PHT process, a temperature of the wafer is measured to appropriately heat the wafer. At this time, a temperature of the stage heated by the heater is measured, and the temperature of the stage is estimated to be the temperature of the wafer.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Here, the wafer heating temperature in the PHT process is, for example, about 300 degrees C. In the PHT process apparatus described in Patent Document 1 in the related art, a wafer is heated by the heater embedded in the stage, and heating rate is, for example, about 0.45 degrees C./sec. Therefore, the wafer heating process takes time.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore, the present inventor came up with an idea of using an LED light source having a high heating rate as a heat source to shorten the heating time. Specifically, a wafer is heated by being irradiated with the LED light emitted from the LED light source, and the heating rate is, for example, 12 degrees C./sec. Therefore, it is possible to shorten the time required for heat treatment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">However, since the PHT process is performed in a pressure-reduced atmosphere inside the chamber that accommodates the wafer, it is necessary to provide the LED light source outside the chamber. In such a case, even in a case where the temperature of the LED light source which is a heat source is measured as in the related art, it is not impossible to estimate the temperature of the LED light source as the temperature of the wafer. In the related art, the temperature measurement of a wafer in the case where the LED light source is provided outside the chamber in this way is not assumed in the first place. Therefore, there is room for improvement in the temperature measurement of a wafer in the related art.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The technique according to the present disclosure appropriately measures a temperature of a substrate, which is accommodated in a chamber, from the outside of the chamber in a non-contact manner. Hereinafter, the wafer processing apparatus and the wafer processing method according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings. In the specification and drawings, elements having substantially the same functional configurations will be denoted by the same reference numerals and redundant descriptions will be omitted.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">&#x3c;Wafer Processing Apparatus&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">First, a configuration of a wafer processing apparatus according to the present embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating the configuration of a wafer processing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment.
