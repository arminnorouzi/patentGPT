Typically, the term &#x201c;longitudinal data&#x201d; may be referred to as panel data, allowing to track the same sample (e.g., a population sample) at different points in time, by allowing the measurement of the duration of events, and record the timing of various events. For example, in case of clinical data, an exemplary sample may include individuals, events, repeated cross-sectional data, long-term data, and other similar type of data. For example, longitudinal data can be the weight of a person which may fluctuate over a lifetime. Using this longitudinal data, a histogram of a person's weight over time displays periods of being underweight, normal weight, and overweight. Yet another example, suppose the unemployment rate remained high for a long period of time, one may use longitudinal data to determine if the same group of individuals stays healthy over the entire period or if different groups of individuals move in and out of the healthy state over the time period.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Yet another example, an exemplary inventive longitudinal data engine with an associated exemplary inventive longitudinal database may be configured, for example without limitation, to provide responses to inquiries such as: &#x201c;For a person in the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoalbuminemia situation in the 48 hours prior to hospitalization what type of drug would reduce the probability for hypoglycemia event(s) in the next 72 hours?&#x201d; Typically, an answer to such single question would require numerous database inquiries and programming one or more specialized stored procedures using a standard relational database approach. For example, typically, the standard relational database approach needs to define primary keys and foreign keys. In turn, typically, when records are created in a relational database for several sequential events in a patient life, such events would be recorded in records among numerous tables and rows. Further, typically, such tables would have data for numerous patients. Typically, complex querying code would need to be programmed (e.g., utilizing numerous SQL commands) to isolate sequential events of a single patient which is typically inefficient (time consuming) and, in many cases, not practical (e.g., requiring specialized programming resources).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides for an exemplary inventive longitudinal data engine that is associated with an exemplary inventive two-stage data structure arrangement.
