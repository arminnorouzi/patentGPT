In addition, in the organic EL display device, there is a strong demand for developing technology of efficiently extracting light. This is because when light extraction efficiency is low, the actual emission amount in an organic EL element is not effectively utilized, which causes a large loss in terms of power consumption and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a conventional direct-view organic EL display device, a red light emitting element, a green light emitting element, and a blue light emitting element are often manufactured by a mask vapor deposition process. That is, an RGB color-separated structure is achieved. However, it is difficult to adopt the RGB color-separated structure in an organic EL display device having a fine pixel pitch due to the accuracy of mask alignment and the like. Therefore, a &#x201c;white method&#x201d; structure is adopted in which three light emitting layers of a red light emitting layer, a green light emitting layer, and a blue light emitting layer are laminated over all pixels and white light is emitted from each light emitting element. Each light emitting element includes a color filter. In addition, by causing white light emitted from a light emitting element to pass through a color filter, red light, green light, or blue light is obtained.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2006-278257</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the white method, white light emitted from a light emitting element is color-separated by a color filter. Therefore, light absorption (loss) in the color filter is large, and luminous efficiency is &#x2153; or less of the luminous efficiency of the RGB color-separating method disadvantageously. For this disadvantage, a reflective film is formed on a light emitting element, and a microcavity (resonator structure) is formed between a transparent electrode and the reflective film disposed in the light emitting element. In addition, for example, from Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2006-278257, technology is known in which in a light emitting element having three layers of a red light emitting layer, a green light emitting layer, and a blue light emitting layer, a red light emitting element that selectively emits red light is disposed by optimizing a microcavity for red light emission. Similarly, a green light emitting element that selectively emits green light is disposed by optimizing a microcavity for green light emission, and a blue light emitting element that selectively emits blue light is disposed by optimizing a microcavity for blue light emission However, in this technology, although light extraction efficiency is improved, luminous efficiency and color purity are lower than those in the RGB color-separating method.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a light emitting element unit having a configuration and a

Note that the transparent conductive layer may be used as an upper layer (that is, may be located on a second substrate side), and the semi-transmissive conductive layer may be used as a lower layer (that is, may be located on a first substrate side). Alternatively, the transparent conductive layer may be used as a lower layer, and the semi-transmissive conductive layer may be used as an upper layer. In addition, in this case, for example, a form can be adopted in which the transparent conductive layer contains an oxide of indium and zinc (IZO), and the semi-transmissive conductive layer contains an alloy of magnesium (Mg) and silver (Ag).

Therefore, mask alignment as in the RGB color-separated structure is unnecessary, and it is easy to manufacture various display devices, for example, a micro-display such as an organic EL display device with a fine pixel pitch or a large-scale display such as a large-scale organic EL display device to which a vapor deposition mask is hardly applied. Moreover, the first light emitting element has a first light emitting portion including the 1a-th electrode, the first organic layer, and the 2a-th electrode. The second light emitting element has a second light emitting portion including the 1b-th electrode, the second organic layer, and the 2b-th electrode. The third light emitting element has a third light emitting portion including the 1c-th electrode, the third organic layer, and the 2c-th electrode. In each of the light emitting portions, microcavity (resonator structure) can be optimized. Alternatively, each of the light emitting elements has a light emitting portion of a first electrode, an organic layer, and a second electrode, in which the first electrodes constituting the respective light emitting elements do not overlap with each other between the light emitting elements. Therefore, microcavity (resonator structure) can be optimized in each of the light emitting portions.

However, the present disclosure is not limited to these Examples. The configurations and structures of the light emitting element unit, the light emitting element, and the organic EL display device described in Examples are illustrative and can be changed appropriately. In Examples 1 and 3, (the first light emitting element, the second light emitting element, and the third light emitting element) are constituted by (a red light emitting element, a green light emitting element, and a blue light emitting element), respectively. Alternatively, (the first light emitting element, the second light emitting element, and the third light emitting element) can be constituted by (a red light emitting element, a blue light emitting element, and a green light emitting element), (a green light emitting element, a red light emitting element, and a blue light emitting element), (a green light emitting element, a blue light emitting element, and a red light emitting element), (a blue light emitting element, a red light emitting element, and a green light emitting element), or (a blue light emitting element, a green light emitting element, and red light emitting element), respectively. The first organic layer, the second organic layer, and the third organic layer may be patterned into, for example, a strip shape, if desired.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0257">A light shielding layer may be disposed between a light emitting element and a light emitting element in order to prevent light emitted from a certain light emitting element from entering a light emitting element adjacent to the certain light emitting element to cause optical crosstalk. In other words, a groove may be formed between a light emitting element and a light emitting element, and the groove may be filled with a light shielding material to form the light shielding layer. By disposing the light shielding layer in this way, it is possible to reduce a ratio at which light emitted from a certain light emitting element enters an adjacent light emitting element, and to suppress occurrence of a phenomenon that color mixing occurs and chromaticity of the entire pixels is shifted from desired chromaticity. In addition, color mixing can be prevented. Therefore, color purity increases when monochromatic light is emitted from a pixel, and a chromaticity point is deep. Therefore, a color gamut is widened, and a range of color expression of the display device is widened. Alternatively, a light shielding property may be imparted to a black matrix layer BM.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0258">The display device in the present disclosure can be applied to a lens interchangeable single-lens reflex type digital still camera. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>A</figref> illustrates a front view of the digital still camera, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>B</figref> illustrates a rear view thereof.
