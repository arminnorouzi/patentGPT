num="0104">Representative applications of methods and apparatus according to the present application are described in this section. These examples are being provided solely to add context and aid in the understanding of the described embodiments. It will thus be apparent to one skilled in the art that the described embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps have not been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the described embodiments. Other applications are possible, such that the following examples should not be taken as limiting.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part of the description and in which are shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in accordance with the described embodiments. Although these embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable one skilled in the art to practice the described embodiments, it is understood that these examples are not limiting; such that other embodiments may be used, and changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the described embodiments.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">This paper describes attachment apparatuses that provide easy and fast attachment to or detachment from a device. According to the described embodiments, an attachment apparatus can include a length of material and at least one attachment point at which an attachment element(s) is located. The attachment point can be arranged at a position of the length of material and the associated attachment element can be configured to attach to a separate device or apparatus or in some cases, attach to another attachment element at another attachment point on the length of material. The separate device can take many forms. The separate device can include personal devices, such as a cellular telephone, luggage, personal electronic device, or any other suitable separate device. The attachment element can use any of a number of attachment protocols to secure the attachment point to the separate device. The attachment protocols can include methods and mechanisms such as, for example, a magnetic attraction between a magnetic or ferrous element disposed at the attachment point and a corresponding magnetic element on the separate device. The attachment protocols can include a magnetic element in combination with a mechanical element such as a fastener, and so on. The magnetic element can take the form of a permanent magnet, a magnetized metallic object (formed of ferrous material), magnetically attractable metal and so forth.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The attachment apparatus can form an attachment between at least two objects. The attachment can be symmetric, or reversible, by which it is meant that the attachment between the at least two objects can be independent of the relative positions of the two objects. In other words, the attachment can remain the same regardless of the relative orientation of the objects with respect to each other. For example, in accordance with a symmetric attachment between two objects, the positioning of the objects can be reversed with respect to each other without affecting the manner in which the two objects attach. A representative symmetric attachment element can include a magnetic element. The magnetic element has an intrinsic polarity (N, S) and can magnetically attract a ferrous object with either magnetic pole equally. Accordingly, the magnetic attachment between the ferrous object and the magnet is inherently symmetric (i.e., reversing the magnetic polarity as observed by the ferrous object has no effect on the attachment between the magnetic element and the ferrous object). However, if the second object also possesses intrinsic polarity, then the attachment between the two objects becomes asymmetric since the attachment will depend upon the relative positions of the two objects. As above, if the two objects are positioned such that opposite magnetic poles interact, then the objects are magnetically attracted to each other. On the other hand, if the two objects are positioned in a reverse order such the like magnetic poles interact, and then the two objects will magnetically repel each other. In this way, the attachment element can be arranged to exhibit either symmetric attachment or asymmetric attachment properties.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some cases, the attachment element can be configured to exhibit both symmetric and asymmetric attachment elements depending upon a particular use. Symmetric and asymmetric attachment can be very advantageous. An asymmetric attachment apparatus can provide for preferred attachment. By preferred attachment, an attachment system that exhibits asymmetric attachment can allow only for a selected attachment configuration and any other attachment configurations are rejected. For example, if a user is left handed, a preferred attachment configuration is one that affords the left handed user a comfortable grasp of an object, such as a purse. In this regard, an asymmetric attachment system can be used to attach a handle to the purse that suits the left handedness of the user and rejects any other configuration (such as would be the case if an attempt to attach the handle in a right handed manner). Accordingly, the magnetic elements can be arranged in such a way that the strap system will attach to a flexible member or an object in only a pre-selected and preferred orientation and location. In this regard, the attachment can be described as asymmetric. An asymmetric attachment system can use magnets that create an attractive force in only a preferred orientation and creates a repulsive force otherwise. In this way, the asymmetric attachment system can actively reject an undesired arrangement when magnetic elements are juxtaposed in such a way that a magnetic repulsive force is created. The magnetic repulsive force can be used to eject or otherwise prevent an object from being attached to a flexible member, for example, in any but the preferred arrangement.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In other embodiments, the attachment apparatus can take on additional forms. For example, the attachment apparatus can include both mechanical attachment elements and magnetic attachment elements. In some embodiments, the magnetic attachment element can include magnetic elements. The magnetic elements can be arranged in a continuous manner or in a discrete manner. The magnetic elements can be arranged in patterns. The magnetic patterns can be linear in nature (one dimensional), planar in nature (two dimensional), or occupy a volume of space in accordance with a three dimensional pattern. By utilizing magnetic patterns, the attachment element can provide additional service beyond those associated with a simple attachment. For example, a discrete linear pattern can provide for discrete adjustment of a magnetically active band such as an arm band. The placement of magnetic elements in the magnetic pattern can take many forms. The placement can be striped, checkerboard, circular, rectangular, and the like. The magnetic elements can be arranged in a symmetric arrangement that can provide a reversible attachment between objects. The magnetic pattern can be used to attach a flexible member to an object (or another flexible member) in a pre-defined orientation in a repeatable manner. Therefore, a magnetic attachment element that includes magnetic elements arranged in a magnetic pattern can be well suited for applications that require repeated attachments. Such applications can include flexible members such as arm bands, bracelets and such.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The use of magnetic elements affords a user of the strap system with the ability to easily interchange selected elements of the attachment system. For example, a magnetic element can form a symmetric attachment with a ferrous material since the magnetic attraction induced will always be attractive in nature (presuming the ferrous material has no extrinsic magnetic field). Accordingly, magnetic elements can be interchanged with other magnetic elements without altering the basic magnetic attachment with the ferrous object. This ability to easily swap elements of the strap system affords a user with a wide variety of options with respect to attaching objects and flexible members. For example, a symmetric strap system can provide a user with the ability to easily transition from a left handed arrangement to a right handed arrangement. This can be very useful for situations where handedness can be important, such as carrying a purse.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Accordingly, a magnetic attachment mechanism as described herein can include a magnet that can magnetically attract a corresponding attachment element such as a snap or lock. In some embodiments, the magnet can be disposed within a recess or embedded with a member. In this way, the magnetic attraction can be personalized for a particular user. For example, by providing magnets embedded within.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Hereinafter, detailed discussion of a plurality of embodiments of the disclosure is presented. Each embodiment presented may be configurable to function with additional embodiments in a coordinated manner, may function entirely individually, or may be altered from the particular forms illustrated.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified diagram of an attachment or strap system <b>10</b>, in accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure. Strap system <b>10</b> can generally be configured to bind one object or to hold a number of objects together. The objects can be aesthetic elements, mechanical elements, electrical elements and/or the like. Strap system <b>10</b> can be, for example, configured to encircle a portion of a body to secure an article or loads to the body. For example, strap system <b>10</b> can be secured to a waist, arms, legs, neck, and the like. Moreover, strap system <b>10</b> can be configured to help attach two portions of an object together. For example, strap system <b>10</b> can be used in soft goods such as purses, garments, accessories, or other clothing. By way of example, strap system <b>10</b> can be used to connect a flap to the pouch of a purse or first and second flaps of a shoe or a cover to a case. These and other embodiments will be discussed in great detail below.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In a particular embodiment, strap system <b>10</b> can include at least flexible member <b>12</b> and attachment element <b>14</b>. Attachment element <b>14</b> can releasably connect/secure flexible member <b>12</b> to itself, to another flexible member <b>12</b>, or to an object (e.g., strap on strap, strap to strap, or strap on/to object). Attachment element <b>14</b> can work alone or in conjunction with another attachment element located on the flexible member itself, on another flexible member, or on an object. Attachment element <b>14</b> can take many forms such as mechanical, magnetic, magnetic/mechanical and so forth. In this regard, attachment element <b>14</b> can be a fastener, clasp, clinch, snap, clamp, cinch, buckle, and/or the like. Flexible member <b>12</b> can be a strap, strip, cord, band, belt, ribbon, flap, girth, shackle, thong, and/or the like. In essence, flexible member <b>12</b> can be any length of material. Attachment element <b>14</b> can be fixed relative to the flexible member <b>12</b>. In some cases, attachment element <b>14</b> can be removable. In one embodiment, attachment element(s) <b>14</b> can be disposed on or within flexible member(s)/object(s) <b>12</b>. By way of example, attachment element <b>14</b> can be embedded within flexible member <b>12</b> such that it is not visible or otherwise hidden from view and provides flexible member <b>12</b> with a continuous or unbroken surface. Alternatively or additionally, attachment element <b>14</b> can be mounted or integrated on the surface of flexible member <b>12</b>. Alternatively or additionally, attachment element <b>14</b> can be a separate discrete component that is carried by flexible member <b>12</b>. The manner in which flexible member <b>12</b> interfaces with itself, to another flexible member, or to an object via the attachment element(s) <b>14</b> can be widely varied. In one embodiment, flexible member <b>12</b> interfaces with itself, to another flexible member, or to an object in a layered fashion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). That is, the attachment elements can be placed adjacent or overlaid relative to one another along their respective lengths. In another embodiment, flexible member <b>12</b> can interface with itself, to another flexible member, or to an object at its end or ends (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In yet another embodiment, flexible member <b>12</b> can interface with itself, to another flexible member, or to object via a clasp or buckle <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). In this regard, clasp or buckle <b>18</b> can be a separate part or it can be integrated with or carried by flexible member <b>12</b>. In yet another embodiment, flexible member <b>12</b> can interface with itself, to another flexible member, or to object <b>16</b> via a loop (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). It should be appreciated that any combination of the above can be used.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref> show embodiments of attachment system <b>14</b> having discrete arrangements of magnetic elements. In one embodiment, one or more of the attachment system(s) <b>14</b> can be configured with a magnetic feature. The magnetic feature can provide a magnetic force (attraction or repulsion) that helps secure the flexible member <b>12</b> to itself, to another flexible member <b>12</b>, or to an object. The magnetic element can also be used to properly align flexible member to an object. The magnetic element can be configured in such a way that attachment system <b>14</b> secures flexible member <b>12</b> in a specific orientation or arrangement. For example, the magnetic element can cause flexible member <b>12</b> to take on a specific length along the lines of an arm band sized to fit a particular user's arm without further user adjustments. The magnetic element can be widely varied. In this regard, attachment system <b>14</b> can include a magnet or a plurality of magnets. The plurality of magnets can be arranged pattern that can be discrete or continuous or a combination of both. In another embodiment, attachment system <b>14</b> can include a ferrous material that interfaces with a magnet. In yet another embodiment, the attachment element can includes a mechanical interlock such as a fixed button/snap or mechanism with moving parts (hook/catch) that cooperates with a magnet and/or ferrous material.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In a strap on strap configuration, the position of flexible member <b>12</b> relative to itself, another flexible member or an object is adjustable via attachment element(s) <b>14</b>. That is, attachment system <b>14</b> can be configured with multiple locking positions. It can be that only the flexible member adjusts or it can be that they both adjust. This can be accomplished through indexed or continuous attachment. Using the magnetic embodiments mentioned above, in one implementation, flexible member <b>12</b> can include single magnetic feature <b>14</b> that interfaces with multiple magnetic features <b>14</b> of flexible member <b>12</b> or object (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). It should be noted that flexible member <b>12</b> can be a continuous loop having a first and second ends that can wrap around and meet each other. The first and second ends can each have associated attachment features. In other embodiments, at least two flexible members can be joined by attachment feature <b>14</b> creating in essence a single joined entity. In any case, multiple magnetic features <b>14</b> can be positioned one after another along a length of flexible member <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> show a more continuous distribution of magnetic elements. In one example, multiple magnetic features <b>14</b> can be spaced apart to provide distinct separate positions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>). In yet another implementation, flexible member <b>12</b> can include single magnetic feature <b>14</b> that can interface with elongated magnetic feature <b>14</b> having a length that can be greater than that of the single magnetic feature (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). Accordingly, the relative lengths of magnetic element <b>14</b> can be widely varied.

In this embodiment, attachment feature <b>14</b> can take the form of a buckle that accommodates and secures snap. In some embodiments, attachment feature <b>14</b> can use mechanical features to secure buckle and snap whereas in other embodiments, attachment feature <b>14</b> can use magnetic elements, or a combination of magnetic and ferrous elements for securing buckle and snap. Moreover, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref> shows a loop attachment system <b>10</b> in which flexible member <b>12</b> include attachment feature <b>14</b> that includes attachment elements that are spaced apart and are arranged to engage with each other so as to afford flexible member <b>12</b> the ability to form loop <b>26</b> that can engage an object. Loop attachment system <b>10</b> can be used to form an arm or leg band that can be used to releasably secure an electronic device to a user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> illustrate a capture type strap system <b>10</b>. In particular, capture strap system <b>10</b> can include member <b>12</b> and distributed attachment feature <b>14</b>. Distributed attachment feature <b>14</b> can include attachment elements that are distributed in such a way that by cooperation, member <b>12</b> is attached to object <b>16</b>. Distributed attachment system <b>14</b> can utilize magnetic elements, mechanical elements, or a combination of magnetic and mechanical elements. The attachment can be symmetric or asymmetric.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> is a diagram of a strap system <b>10</b> in accordance with one embodiment. The strap system <b>10</b> is generally configured to bind one object or to hold a number of objects together. The objects may be aesthetic elements, mechanical elements, electrical elements and/or the like. The strap system <b>10</b> may for example be configured to encircle a portion of an object and/or to secure loads to the object. For example, the strap system may be used to secure an article to a body part. By way of example, the strap system may be used to secure a device to an arm or arm. The strap system may also be configured to help attach two portions of an object together. For example, the strap system may be used in soft goods such as purses, garments, accessories, or other clothing. By way of example, the strap system may be used to connect a flap to the pouch of a purse or first and second flaps of a shoe or a cover to a case. These and other embodiments will be discussed in greater detail below. The strap system can include attachment elements that are mechanical, magnetic, or a combination of mechanical and magnetic elements. Magnetic attachment elements can rely upon magnetic polarity between cooperating magnetic elements. In some cases, the magnetic polarity can provide a symmetric attachment. For example, a magnetic element regardless of magnetic polarity can form a symmetric magnetic attachment with a ferrous attachment element having no intrinsic magnetic polarity. In this way, the orientation of the magnetic element with respect to the ferrous attachment element will have no effect on the attachment. On the other hand, if both attachment elements possess an intrinsic magnetic polarity, then the attachment can be asymmetric since the attachment depends upon the spatial relationship between the magnetic elements and in particular whether a magnetic attraction or repulsion force is generated. In any case, strap system <b>10</b> includes one or more flexible members <b>12</b>, attachment system <b>14</b>, and carrier module <b>16</b> from which flexible members <b>12</b> extend. The carrier module <b>16</b> may be widely varied. In the illustrated example, the carrier module <b>16</b> is a pouch configured for receiving an electronic device. The pouch may receive for example any number of electronic devices including, for example, media players, communication devices, and so on. It can also receive other devices whether mechanical, electrical, and/or the like. The pouch may include a window for allowing access to the electronic device contained within the pouch. While a pouch is shown, it should be appreciated that this is not a limitation and that the carrier module <b>16</b> can take a variety of forms including soft and hard cases or skins. In addition, it may even be a device itself such as a media player, communication device or any of the others mentioned above. The flexible members <b>12</b> may also be widely varied. The flexible members <b>12</b> may be a strap, strip, cord, band, belt, ribbon, flap, girth, shackle, thong, and/or the like. In essence, it can be any length of material. In the illustrated embodiment, the flexible members <b>12</b> are straps or bands that extend along a length such that they can be wrapped around another object in order to secure the carrier module to the other object. By way of example, the straps may be used to secure the carrier module <b>16</b> to a portion of a body or an article of clothing. In cases such as this, the user does not have to hold the strap system or any load that is being carried by the strap system.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The strap system <b>10</b> includes a releasable set of one or more flexible members proximate the end that couple to the carrier module. By releasable it is meant that the flexible members can be secured to the carrier module <b>16</b> such that they cooperate as a single unit or they can be removed from the carrier module <b>16</b> such that they are discrete parts. In this manner, different flexible members can be added/removed to/from the carrier module. In order to help enable this function, the strap system <b>10</b> may include a first attachment system <b>14</b> (or a carrier attachment system) proximate the interface between the flexible member <b>12</b> and the carrier module <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, the first attachment system <b>14</b> includes a carrier side attachment feature and a flexible member side attachment features. These attachment features work together to releasably hold the flexible members <b>12</b> to the carrier module <b>16</b>. These features can be widely varied. In the illustrated embodiment, the flexible member side attachment feature includes an end member that engages a buckle located on the carrier member. The end member is located at the end of the flexible member and includes a mechanical structure that is received by the buckle. For example the buckle may include an opening that receives the end member therein. That is, the end member is sized and dimensioned for insertion and retention within the opening in the buckle. It should be appreciated that this particular implementation is not a limitation and that other configurations may be used. For example, instead of an end member the flexible member itself may pass through the opening and connect to another portion of the flexible member such that a loop is formed around the buckle. These and other embodiments will be described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some cases, the carrier module <b>16</b> and flexible member <b>12</b> or some combination of the two includes an additional retention feature to help hold the flexible member <b>12</b> relative to the carrier module <b>16</b>. For example, with respect to the embodiment mentioned above, the buckle and/or the end member may include a retention feature to help keep the end member within the opening of the buckle. The retention member may be widely varied and may include detents, snaps, latches, catches, hooks, magnets and/or the like. The retention mechanism can take many forms. For example, the retention member can take the form of a magnet or magnetic elements arranged in such a way to provide either symmetric or asymmetric attachment. The retention mechanism can include mechanical or a combination of mechanical and magnetic aspects.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In accordance with one embodiment, the strap system <b>10</b> includes a detachable set of one or more flexible members along its length and/or proximate the end opposite the carrier module. By detachable it is meant that the flexible members can be attached to themselves and/or another flexible member. When attached, they cooperate as a single unit to form a closed loop. The closed loop can be positioned around an object as mentioned above. When detached, they are separate parts thereby freeing the object. In this manner, the flexible members can be open and closed to secure and free the strap system to/from the object. In order to help enable this function, the strap system <b>10</b> may include a second attachment system <b>18</b> (or strap attachment system) proximate the flexible member(s). The second attachment system <b>18</b> may be widely varied. The attachment system may include one or more attachment elements such as fastener, clasp, clinch, snap, clamp, cinch, buckle, magnets and/or the like. The attachment elements can be fixed, removable or adjustable relative to the flexible member. In one embodiment, the attachment element(s) are disposed on or within the flexible member(s). By way of example, the attachment element may be embedded within the flexible member <b>12</b> such that it is not visible, hidden from view and/or provides a continuous or unbroken surface. Alternatively or additionally, the attachment element(s) may be mounted or integrated on the surface of the flexible member. Alternatively or additionally, the attachment element(s) may be a separate discrete component that is carried by the flexible member.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Strap system <b>10</b> can generally be configured to bind one object or to hold a number of objects together. The objects can be aesthetic elements, mechanical elements, electrical elements and/or the like. Strap system <b>10</b> can be, for example, configured to encircle a portion of a body to secure other objects or loads to the body. For example, strap system <b>10</b> can be secured to a waist, arms, legs, arms, neck, and the like. Moreover, strap system <b>10</b> can be configured to help attach two portions of an object together. For example, strap system <b>10</b> can be used in soft goods such as purses, garments, accessories, or other clothing. By way of example, strap system <b>10</b> can be used to connect a flap to the pouch of a purse or first and second flaps of a shoe or a cover to a case. These and other embodiments will be discussed in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Attachment system <b>14</b> can be magnetic, mechanical or a combination of both. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> shows an accessory system for portable electronic device <b>20</b>. The accessory system can include a flap pivotally attached to a cover suitable for supporting electronic device <b>20</b>.

Object <b>16</b> can represent an entire object or a portion of an object to which flexible member <b>12</b> can be attached using, for example, magnets embedded with flexible member <b>12</b>. In this way, the magnets cannot be seen and the magnetic attraction can be personalized in such a way that the magnetic attachment can be &#x201c;softened&#x201d;. By softened it is meant that although a secure magnetic attachment is created, the manner that the attachment is formed is smooth and does not possess (if desired) a hard mechanical sound when attachment is made. Therefore, by embedding or otherwise overlaying the magnetic elements, a user can experience, again if desired, a &#x201c;snap-less&#x201d; magnetic attachment. On the other hand, if the use desires the sound and feel of a secure &#x201c;snap&#x201d; then by simply exposing or otherwise reducing the interfacing layers of member <b>12</b>, the desired degree of &#x201c;snap&#x201d; can be provided. In one embodiment, object <b>16</b> can represent an edge of an electronic device and flexible member <b>12</b> can represent a strap configured to secure the electronic device. It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> shows cross-sectional view A-A of strap system <b>120</b>. As depicted, an opening can be provided in object <b>16</b> and flexible member <b>12</b> can be inserted through the opening in object <b>16</b>. Flexible member <b>12</b> can include end cap <b>122</b> located at a free end of flexible member <b>12</b>. End cap <b>122</b> can be mechanically coupled to flexible member <b>12</b> using adhesives, threading, crimping, or any other feasible means of providing a robust connection. In some embodiments, end cap <b>122</b> can include one or more flanges along a surface facing away from flexible member <b>12</b>. Furthermore, the opening in object <b>16</b> can include a recess configured to interlock with the flanges on end cap <b>122</b> and prevent flexible member <b>12</b> from passing through the opening in object <b>16</b>. In other embodiments, the flanges on end cap <b>122</b> and recess in object <b>16</b> can be replaced by any interlocking structure capable of preventing flexible member <b>12</b> from passing through object <b>16</b>. For example, interlocking angled surface can be included in both end cap <b>122</b> and object <b>16</b>. In still other embodiments, a second recess can be provided at an opposite end of the opening in object <b>16</b>, allowing flexible member <b>12</b> to be inserted from the opposite direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>C and <b>12</b>D</figref> show isometric and cross-sectional views respectively of such a configuration.

As shown above, flexible member <b>12</b> can include end cap <b>122</b> and flanges on end cap <b>122</b> can interlock with a recess provided in object <b>16</b>. In addition, magnetic features <b>134</b> can be located within object <b>16</b> and magnetic features <b>136</b> can be located within end cap <b>122</b>. It should be noted that while two magnetic features are depicted in each of object <b>16</b> and end cap <b>122</b>, any number of individual magnetic features can be used. Moreover, magnetic features <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> can represent magnets, ferrous materials, or any combination thereof In one embodiment, magnetic features <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> can be oriented to allow flexible member <b>12</b> to be inserted from either end of object <b>16</b>. For example, both magnetic features <b>134</b> can have a polarity P1 and both magnetic features <b>136</b> can have a polarity P2. The attractive forces between opposing poles of magnetic features <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> can cause end cap <b>122</b> to remain securely within the opening in object <b>16</b> once placed in position. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>, flexible member <b>12</b> can be inserted through a lower surface of object <b>16</b> and the above mentioned polarities of magnetic features <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> can still operate to retain flexible member <b>12</b> within object <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref> show strap system <b>140</b>, demonstrating another embodiment of the disclosure.

Furthermore, the polarities of magnetic features <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> can be reversed. For example, the left instance of magnetic feature <b>142</b> can have a polarity P1 while the right instance of magnetic feature <b>142</b> can have a polarity P2. Similarly, the left instance of magnetic feature <b>144</b> can have a polarity P2 while the right instance of magnetic feature <b>144</b> can have a polarity P1. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, opposing poles are aligned with one another so an attractive force can secure end cap <b>122</b> within the opening in object <b>16</b>.

The magnetic material can, for example, take the form of strands of magnetic material or material capable of having a magnetic field induced. The strands can be fitted together in a mesh or woven pattern forming in the process a weave, or mesh, not unlike a fabric, the strands being analogous to yarn or thread. It should be noted that the strands can be ferromagnetic in nature in which certain materials, such as iron, that are attracted to magnetic fields generated by, for example, a magnet. Ferromagnetic materials can also have a magnetic field induced therein using an external magnetic field to create and align magnetic domains within the ferromagnetic material. In this way, a woven substrate formed of ferromagnetic strands can exhibit a small or no intrinsic magnetic field but selected portions can be magnetized by a focused magnetic field having the effect of magnetizing selected strands or groups of stands of woven material. Likewise, magnetic properties of selected strands or groups of strands can be altered by the application of an external magnetic field. For example, the magnetic field strength of a strand or group of strands can be altered (increased or decreased) by the application of an appropriately configured external magnetic field. Moreover, an external energy source (such as a laser) can demagnetize selected strands or groups of strands by heating which can randomize the orientation of magnetic domains within a strand or group of strands. It should also be noted that some strands may exhibit diamagnetic behavior that causes the strand to repel an external magnetic field. In this way, a woven substrate can include strands some of which are ferromagnetic, some of which are diamagnetic and others of which exhibit no magnetic properties or ability to become magnetized.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">The strands can possess an intrinsic magnetism or a magnetic field can be induced in a selected strand or strands. The resulting magnetic field can take many forms capable of providing a number of useful services. For example, the strands can be arranged in a linear pattern. In one embodiment, selected ones of the strands can possess an intrinsic polarity in which case, magnetic regions can be interleaved with non-magnetic regions. In some cases, selected strands can have their magnetic fields dampened using, for example, a laser that reduces or eliminates the alignment of magnetic domains within the strands. In this way, selected portions (or even individual strands) can be de-magnetized to form a distribution of magnetic regions and non-magnetic regions.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>43</b>-<b>51</b></figref> illustrate various embodiments of a substrate formed of a plurality of strands of various forms some of which can exhibit ferromagnetic properties, some of which can exhibit diamagnetic properties, some of which can be non-magnetic and some of which can be induced to become magnetic (or become non-magnetic) using an external agent. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref> shows magnetic strap <b>430</b> formed of woven magnetic material. The magnetic material can take many forms that includes ferrous metal such as iron. In addition, the magnetic material can include a magnetic substrate populated by magnetic particles, or a plurality of magnetic elements which taken together form a substantially continuous magnetic substrate formed of discrete magnetic components. The magnetic components can include strands interleaved or woven into a fabric like structure that is flexible, strong, and provides a magnetic medium for magnetic attachment for a device.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref> shows magnetic attachment system <b>440</b> in the form of magnetic strap <b>442</b> in accordance with the described embodiments. Magnetic strap <b>442</b> can include a plurality of strands <b>444</b> some of which can exhibit magnetic behavior. For example, strands <b>444</b> can be magnetic and exhibit a magnetic field whereas adjacent strand <b>446</b> can exhibit no or only a negligible magnetic field. In this way, magnetic strap <b>442</b> can exhibit a magnetic pattern that takes the form of a number of parallel magnetic regions <b>446</b> separated from each other by non-magnetic regions <b>448</b>. In this way, magnetic strap <b>442</b> can form an attachment with itself or another magnetically active strap or object. In some cases, an interaction with the linear magnetic pattern can be used for preferential attachment. Accordingly, by judiciously arranging magnetically active strands and non-magnetically active strands, magnetic strap <b>442</b> can be used to repeatedly attach in a preferred configuration. For example, magnetic strap <b>442</b> can be used as a armband than can be magnetically fixed in such a way that magnetic strap <b>442</b> will always form the armband having a specific size.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref> shows another embodiment of magnetic strap in the form of magnetic strap <b>450</b>. Magnetic strap <b>450</b> can include substrate <b>452</b>. Substrate <b>452</b> can be magnetic or non-magnetic. In the embodiment shown, however, substrate <b>452</b> is non-magnetic in nature and is formed of a number of interwoven (or interleaved) strands of non-magnetic material. Magnetic material in the form of magnetic bands <b>454</b> can be secured to selected ones of substrate <b>452</b>. Magnetic bands <b>454</b> can be secured to selected ones of the strands that form substrate <b>452</b>. In this way, a magnetic pattern can be formed in substrate <b>452</b>. In this example, the magnetic pattern can be linear in nature. In this case, the magnetic pattern can include magnetic bands <b>454</b> separated by non-magnetic regions <b>456</b>. However, it should be noted that this example is but one of many. In some cases, substrate <b>452</b> can be magnetic and bands <b>454</b> can be non-magnetic in which case an inverse magnetic pattern can be formed. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b></figref> shows magnetic pattern <b>460</b> in which substrate <b>462</b> is formed of a number of bands <b>464</b> interleaved with selected strands <b>466</b>. In this way, a magnetic pattern that is orthogonal to the magnetic pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref> can be formed. It should be noted that magnetic patterns can be combined. For example, the magnetic pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref> can be combined with that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b></figref> to form a two dimensional rectangular pattern of magnetic elements. It should also be noted that any magnetic pattern can be altered. For example, an external energy source can be used to de- magnetize selected magnetic elements. In this way, the magnetic pattern can be altered in a manner that can be used to customize an application for which magnetic strap is used.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b></figref> shows yet magnetic strap <b>470</b> in accordance with the described embodiments. Magnetic strap <b>470</b> can include substrate <b>472</b> and (non-magnetic) strands <b>474</b> interleaved with (magnetic strands) <b>476</b> forming a pattern of doubled magnetic bands. Again it should be noted that the various magnetic patterns can be widely varied. For example, the magnetic patterns can be combined to form linear patterns, two dimensional patterns and in some cases three dimensional patterns. For example, a three dimensional pattern can be formed by incorporating magnetic elements within substrate <b>472</b> or on a bottom surface of substrate <b>472</b>. In some cases, substrate <b>472</b> can be formed of a number of layers of strands in which some of the layers can be associated with magnetic elements to form the three dimensional magnetic pattern.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>48</b></figref> thru <b>51</b> show other examples of magnetic straps. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> shows magnetic strap <b>480</b> includes substrate <b>482</b> formed of a number of interlinking circular elements <b>484</b> some of which are magnetic (and some of which can be induced to be magnetic). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref> shows strap <b>490</b> where substantially all the interlinking circular elements are magnetic. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref> shows magnetic strap <b>490</b> includes substrate <b>492</b> of interlinked loops <b>494</b> of material (similar to a chain link fence) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref> shows an embodiment where substantially all of the interlinked loops are magnetic.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">It should be noted that magnetic patterns can be used to control the strength and/or direction of the magnetic fields thereby providing the desired attraction and break forces. In fact, it may be that the straps are designed to have different magnetic strengths depending upon the user or the environment. For the active environment then the force can be higher while in a non-active environment, the force can be lower.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">A modular strap family includes one or more base units and one or more strap sets. It should be appreciated however that any number of base units and straps sets may be provided (n+1). Each of base units may be configured differently. For example, although they all include functional elements, the function elements may be configured differently. For example base unit may have functional unit. Functional units may for example include one or more functional elements such as displays, buttons, controllers, and the like. Furthermore, each of the base units may have a different enclosure. By different enclosure, it may be a different color, different material, different shape, different accoutrements, different patterns, etc. Essentially the enclosures are configured to provide a different aesthetic or different look and feel than the other enclosures in the family. As such, the purchaser or user can select the base unit with the desired look and feel and the desired functionality. This may be at the time of purchase thus allowing differentiation from other purchasers or it may be that all or some portion of the base units come in a set such that the user can select the right base unit for the right moment. In one example, one base unit may be configured for exercise while another may be configured for a business setting. Any combination of enclosure and functional features may be provided to create a different base unit (N+1).</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Referring to the strap sets, like the base units, each of the straps may be configured differently. For example, the functional aspects and the aesthetic aspects may be configured differently. The first strap may have a first characteristic, the second strap may have a second characteristic, the third strap may have a third characteristic, the fourth strap may have a fourth characteristic with each characteristic being different, the characteristic may be in mechanical configuration such as material properties, structural features each of which can help define flexibility or rigidity, tactile feel, and the like or aesthetic properties such as color, patterns, materials, etc. each of which can provide a different look and feel. Furthermore, each of the strap sets may have a different attachment mechanism, one for each strap in the set. The attachment mechanisms can be widely varied and generally selected from any of these mentioned previously in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>49</b></figref>. Generally, they are configured to engage one another such that they are locked into place relative to one another thereby securing each of the straps in the strap set to one another, making them a single cooperating system. For example, they may be attached into a loop. The attachment mechanisms can include multiple locking nodes in order to change the size of the loop, i.e., adjustable. Of course, the attachment mechanisms may also be configured to disengage from one another such that they are released relative to one another thereby un-securing each of the straps from one another. In one embodiment, the attachment mechanisms include a magnetic feature such that they snap and hold into place with magnetic force and release when a force is applied greater than the magnetic force (breaking force).</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Like the base units, the straps are configured to provide a different function and/or aesthetic or different look and feel than the other straps in the family. As such, the purchaser or user can select the strap set with the desired look and feel and the desired functionality. This may be at the time of purchase thus allowing differentiation from other purchasers or it may be that all or some portion of the straps come in a set such that the user can select the right base unit for the right moment. In one example, one strap may be configured for exercise while another may be configured for a business setting. Any combination of aesthetic and functional features may be provided to create a different strap (N+1). When combined with the different base units, the family becomes extremely customizable. The user can create a different article by selecting one base unit to go along with one strap set. If multiple sets are provided, any number of different article configurations can be made.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In accordance with this application, the family may include a standardized attachment mechanism at the interface or engagement between the strap sets and the base units. That is, each set or each base unit has the same attachment mechanism such that they can be interchanged with one another. Unlike the straps and base units themselves which can be different, the attachment mechanisms provided on each set of straps are the same and the attachment mechanisms provided on each of the base units are the same. The attachment mechanisms can be widely varied and generally selected from any of these mentioned previously in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>51</b></figref>. Generally, they are configured to engage one another such that they are locked into place relative to one another thereby securing the strap set to the base unit, making them a single cooperating system.

In one embodiment, the attachment mechanisms include a magnetic feature such that they snap and hold into place with magnetic force and release when a force is applied greater than the magnetic force (breaking force).</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">The electronic device can take many forms such as a portable media player according to one embodiment of the disclosure. The media player is, for example, suitable for use as the battery powered portable media player. The media player includes a processor that pertains to a microprocessor or controller for controlling the overall operation of the media player. The media player stores media data pertaining to media assets in a file system and a cache. The file system is, typically, a storage disk or a plurality of disks. The file system typically provides high capacity storage capability for the media player. However, since the access time to the file system is relatively slow, the media player can also include a cache. The cache is, for example, Random-Access Memory (RAM) provided by semiconductor memory. The relative access time to the cache is substantially shorter than for the file system. However, the cache does not have the large storage capacity of the file system. Further, the file system, when active, consumes more power than does the cache. The power consumption is particularly important when the media player is a portable media player that is powered by a battery (not shown). The media player also includes a RAM and a Read-Only Memory (ROM). The ROM can store programs, utilities or processes to be executed in a non-volatile manner. The RAM provides volatile data storage, such as for the cache.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The media player also includes a user input device that allows a user of the media player to interact with the media player. For example, the user input device can take a variety of forms, such as a button, keypad, dial, etc. Still further, the media player includes a display (screen display) that can be controlled by the processor to display information to the user. A data bus can facilitate data transfer between at least the file system, the cache, and the processor. The media player also includes a bus interface that couples to a data link. The data link allows the media player to couple to a host computer over a wired connection.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">In one embodiment, the media player serves to store a plurality of media assets (e.g., songs) in the file system. When a user desires to have the media player play a particular media item, a list of available media assets is displayed on the display. Then, using the user input device, a user can select one of the available media assets. The processor, upon receiving a selection of a particular media item, supplies the media data (e.g., audio file) for the particular media item to a coder/decoder (CODEC). The CODEC then produces analog output signals for a speaker. The speaker can be a speaker internal to the media player or external to the media player. For example, headphones or earphones that connect to the media player would be considered an external speaker.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Additional alterations from those particularly described and illustrated herein are apparent from the teachings presented herein.
