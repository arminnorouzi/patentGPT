A dental technician or dentist enters the data manually in the respective documentation tool or enters them on an order slip. This is tedious, time-consuming and error-prone. As a result, information in the processing procedure is often not or only insufficiently documented and passed on.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">US 20210178639, 20210310903, 20210191370, 20210102527, 20180159937, 20170315516, 20140303755, 20140028441, 20150227943, 20200397534, and U.S. Ser.

US 20220148717 and 20210196576 are directed to medical device and reporting systems and are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is the technical aim of the present invention to provide a processing device for processing a dental indication, with which relevant status or state data can be passed on and documented in a simple manner.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This technical problem is solved by objects according to the independent claims. Technically advantageous embodiments are the subject of the dependent claims, the description and the drawings.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, the technical problem is solved by a processing device for processing a dental indication, comprising an electronic status or state detection device for detecting status or state data of the processing device and/or the dental indication; and an electronic generation device for generating a code comprising the status data. A dental indication is an artificially produced object used in a patient's mouth, such as a crown, a bridge, a full or partial denture, an aligner, a grinding splint, an implant, an abutment, or a telescopic prosthesis. The processing device is used to process or fabricate the dental indication in a technical process. The processing device achieves the technical advantage that the status data can be exchanged in a simple manner via the generated code and can be passed on to other devices.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a technically advantageous embodiment of the processing device, the processing device comprises a display device for displaying the code. The display device is formed, for example, by an electronic matrix display. This achieves, for example, the technical advantage that the code can be read directly on the processing device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further technically advantageous embodiment of the processing device, the display device is configured to display the code in an optically detectable or scannable manner. This provides, for example, the technical advantage that the code can be automatically read opto-electronically by another device having a camera or a scanner.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further technically advantageous embodiment of the processing device, the code is a bar code, a QR code, a text code or a machine-readable code. This achieves, for example, the technical advantage that the status data can be integrated into the code in an efficient and automatically detectable manner.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further technically advantageous embodiment of the processing device, the processing device comprises a data interface for electronically sending the code. The interface is, for example, a wireless or wired data interface for an electronic network, such as a network card or a WLAN interface. This provides, for example, the technical advantage that the code can be transmitted electronically directly to other devices.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further technically advantageous embodiment of the processing device, the processing device comprises a detection interface for optically detecting data of a manufacturing material. The detection interface is formed, for example, by an electronic camera for capturing an image and a corresponding scanning program for scanning the captured image. This achieves, for example, the technical advantage that data of used manufacturing materials can be captured in a simple and fast manner and can also be integrated into the code.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further technically advantageous embodiment of the processing device, the code comprises data on an identification number of the processing device, on a manufacturing material, on a number of operating hours, on a calibration performed, on a due date for the next calibration, on error messages and warnings, on statistics, on the programs or jobs used, on a running process, on a process parameter, on jobs processed during processing, on materials used during processing, on an installed software version and/or on error-free execution of a process. This achieves, for example, the technical advantage of integrating data for further processing steps or documentation steps into the code.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further technically advantageous embodiment of the processing device, the processing device is a dental or dental materials processing device including, but not limited to, a milling device, a 3D printer, a firing furnace, a press furnace, a sintering furnace, a scanner, a light curing device, a post-exposure device, a mixing system, a color measuring system, a polymerization device, a sterilization device, a dental technician handpiece or a cleaning device. This achieves, for example, the technical advantage of integrating data from dental machining processes into the code.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a second aspect, the technical problem is solved by a processing system comprising a processing device according to one of the first aspect; and a software application for receiving the code. The software application may be implemented on a mobile phone, a tablet PC, augmented reality glasses or a computer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, the subject matter may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-usable or computer-readable storage medium having computer-usable or computer-readable program code embodied in the medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system. In the context of this document, a computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be any medium that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. It may take the form of a computer program product comprising program code which is stored on a machine-readable medium, the machine-readable medium comprising computer instructions executable by a processor, which computer instructions cause the processor to perform the method described above. This achieves the technical advantage of being able to easily forward and process the code.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a third aspect, the technical problem is solved by a method for processing a dental indication, comprising the steps of detecting status data of the processing device and/or the dental indication; and generating a code comprising the status data. Thereby, the same technical advantages are achieved as by the processing device according to the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a technically advantageous embodiment of the method, the code is displayed optically or sent via a data interface. This achieves, for example, the technical advantage that the code can be transmitted quickly and easily.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a further technically advantageous embodiment of the method, data on an identification number of the processing device, on a manufacturing material, on a number of operating hours, on a calibration performed, on a due date for the next calibration, on error messages and warnings, on statistics of the programs or jobs used, on a running process, on a process parameter, on jobs processed during processing, on materials used during processing, on an installed software version and/or on error-free execution of a process are recorded and/or embedded in the code. This also achieves, for example, the technical advantage that data for further processing steps or documentation steps are integrated into the code.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a further technically advantageous embodiment of the method, the code is transmitted to a data node. The data node may be, for example, a local or remote computer, a mobile phone or a tablet. The data node is, for example, connected to the processing device via a data channel and can perform further processing steps based on the code. This achieves, for example, the technical advantage of integrating data for further processing steps or documentation steps into the code.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further technically advantageous embodiment of the method, the code is stored in an electronic patient file. The patient file can be stored in a digital manner centrally and decentrally, such as on an internet server or a local PC as a file or in a database. The patient file can be stored in a tamper-proof manner by digitally signing it using a cryptographic method or by storing it as a data record in a blockchain. This has the technical advantage, for example, of providing secure documentation for a dentist.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a further technically advantageous embodiment of the method, a plausibility check is performed to determine whether a manufacturing material or machine parameters are suitable for a predetermined dental indication. In this plausibility check, it can be checked whether a manufacturing material is suitable for the processing device or a particular processing method. The result of this plausibility check can also be integrated into the code as status data. This achieves the technical advantage, for example, that errors in the machining process can be prevented or detected.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Examples of embodiments of the invention are shown in the drawings and will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of a processing device;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an illustration of a manufacturing system including a processing device and a software application for receiving a code;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a block diagram for an exemplary manufacturing process; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> a block diagram of a method for processing a dental indication.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of a processing device <b>100</b>. The processing device <b>100</b> is a device used as part of a processing method that produces or processes a dental indication <b>103</b>. This may be, for example, including but not limited to, a milling device, a 3D printer, a firing furnace, a press furnace, a sintering furnace, a scanner, a light-curing device, a post-exposure device, a mixing system, a color measurement system, a polymerization device, a sterilization device, a dental technician handpiece, or a cleaning device for the dental indication <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The processing device <b>100</b> includes an electronic status detection device <b>105</b> for detecting status data of the processing device <b>100</b> and/or the dental indication <b>103</b> with suitable electrical circuitry and/or a sensor. In addition, the status detection device <b>105</b> may include one or more sensors for sensing the status data. The electrical circuitry may include the components and wiring needed to operate the particular sensors associated with the device, and/or to receive and process the output signals generated by the sensors. This circuitry can include, but is not limited to: analog and digital circuitry; CPUs; processors; circuit boards; memory; firmware; and controllers.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The status condition data may be, for example, static data of the processing device <b>100</b> or dynamic data of a machining process. For example, an internal identification number or a digital hour meter of the processing device <b>100</b> can be read by the electronic status detection device <b>105</b>. Through the electronic status detection device <b>105</b>, the time of a performed calibration of the processing device <b>100</b> can be determined. Digital information about error messages and warnings can be acquired by the electronic status detection device <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Statistics about programs or jobs in use, data about a machining process in progress, and/or process parameters may be detected by the electronic status detection device <b>105</b>. In addition, data may be collected about jobs that are currently being processed or about manufacturing materials that are currently being used. In addition, the status detection device <b>105</b> may detect data about an installed software version and/or about an error-free execution of a process as status data. Further, data about the currently executing process may be detected as status data of the processing device <b>100</b>, such as process parameters, processed objects/orders, loading status, material information. However, this information can generally also be added manually.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The status data thus detected is transmitted by the status detection device <b>105</b> to an electronic generation device <b>107</b>, which dynamically generates a code <b>109</b> from the data. The code <b>109</b> contains the status data provided in each case. For example, the code <b>109</b> is a bar code, a QR code, a text code, or a machine-readable code generated by an appropriate algorithm based on the transmitted status data. For this purpose, the generation device <b>107</b> may be implemented by a microprocessor or by means of a digital circuit. The code <b>109</b> may be generated or displayed, for example, by pressing a button on the processing device.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The code <b>109</b> is then transmitted to and displayed on a display device <b>111</b>. The display device may be, for example, an electronic display on which the code <b>109</b> is displayed as a QR code, bar code or text code. However, the code <b>109</b> may also be output on paper from a printer. From this display device <b>111</b>, the code <b>109</b> may in turn be scanned by another electronic device, such as a mobile phone, tablet computer or augmented reality glasses. It is also possible for the code <b>109</b> to be passed in machine-readable form to another device via a digital data interface <b>113</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In principle, any processing device <b>100</b> having a suitable display device <b>111</b> for visually displaying the code <b>109</b> is suitable. If the resolution of the display device <b>111</b> is not large enough to display the code <b>109</b> with the appropriate information, the status data can also be divided into several smaller codes <b>109</b> which appear simultaneously or successively on the display device <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an illustration of a processing system <b>200</b> including the processing device <b>100</b> and a software application for receiving the code <b>109</b>. For example, the computer <b>119</b> includes software that allows the dental indication <b>103</b> to be designed by a user. Once the data set is completed at the computer <b>119</b>, it is digitally transmitted to the processing device <b>100</b> via a data channel <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The processing device <b>100</b> processes the dental indication <b>103</b> based on the transmitted data set. In this process, the aforementioned condition data may be obtained. The code <b>109</b>, in which the condition data is embedded, is generated by the generation device <b>107</b> and then visually displayed on the display device <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">This code <b>109</b> can then in turn be optically read by a suitable device <b>123</b>, such as a mobile phone, a tablet PC or AR glasses. This device <b>123</b> may then extract and further process the status data thus transmitted from the code <b>109</b>. For example, a log containing manufacturing data of a device <b>123</b> dental indication <b>103</b> can be added to the list of processed dental indications.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this regard, a plausibility check may further be performed in which the manufacturing material <b>117</b> is first detected. This may be done by an optical scanning process via a detection interface <b>115</b>, which is used to capture the data of the manufacturing material <b>117</b>. The detection interface <b>115</b> is formed, for example, by an electronic camera and image recognition software.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, the manufacturing material <b>117</b> may be identified in the following manner:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0040">Character recognition on the label (product name, LOT number);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0041">Coloring of the label or packaging;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0042">Comparison of the label with a label retrieved from a database; and/or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0043">Form of packaging.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0041" num="0044">Subsequently, a plausibility check is performed to determine whether the detected manufacturing material <b>117</b> is also suitable for the dental indication <b>103</b> and can be processed by the processing device <b>100</b> in the desired manner.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0045">For this purpose, the respective machine parameters of the processing device <b>100</b> can be considered as status data. If the plausibility check runs with a positive result, processing is released by the processing device <b>100</b>.

In addition to the patient data, the dental technician may contain further information about the material to be used, such as metal ceramics or zirconium oxide.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0099">In step S<b>202</b>, this information is transferred from the dentist to the dental technician and documentation is created for the patient case or existing documentation from the dentist is reused. This may work, for example, if the dentist and the dental technician use shared software that allows the patient case to be documented together. This software can run on a mobile device such as a mobile phone, tablet PC or augmented reality (AR) glasses.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0100">In step S<b>203</b>, the dental technician may, for example, design a dental crown as a dental indication <b>103</b> from zirconia based on the data on the computer, which is manufactured on a milling machine as a processing device <b>100</b>. Upon completion of the fabrication, for example, a barcode may be displayed that includes information in the status data such as the selected material, the minimum wall thickness, and other parameters of the dental crown or processing device <b>100</b> as status data. This barcode can be scanned by the dental technician using a mobile phone, and the information can be added to the order using a documentation tool.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0101">Further status data is generated on the milling machine during the manufacturing process. For example, the tools used and the material are detected. After completion of the milling process, this information and other information about the process, such as error messages or warnings that have occurred or a unique identification number of the milling machine, can be read in via a QR code and added to the order as status data via the QR code.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0102">In step S<b>204</b>, the dental crown is separated from a block, ground and then sintered. In a sintering furnace, relevant information such as a unique identification of the sintering furnace, the selected sintering program, actually measured temperatures, error messages are again recorded and stored in the code <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0103">In step S<b>205</b>, the restoration is further built up using the layering technique, for example. Materials used here, such as a ceramic powder, and the information on how they were fired can also be recorded. For this purpose, a QR code may be displayed on the sintering furnace with the information of the sintering furnace. The detection of the materials may be done via a QR code provided on the packaging or on the material itself, such as on the press blank.

This results in complete, secure, and paperless documentation of the respective dental indication, which can be provided to the dentist for insertion and (possibly to a reduced extent) for forwarding to the customer. The documentation can be integrated into an electronic patient file.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a block diagram of a method for processing the dental indication.

In principle, if the display device <b>111</b> for the code <b>109</b> is available, complex interface components can be dispensed with. This can also be advantageous if battery-operated machining equipment is to operate in a consumption-optimized manner. In order to integrate an older processing device <b>100</b> into the method, only a software update is required in which it is defined which information is stored in the code <b>109</b>, the size of the code <b>109</b>, the basic design of the code <b>109</b> and when the code <b>109</b> is displayed.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0111">The method can be used for a documentation requirement in all medical fields and thus also in the dental field for the dentist and at the dental technician, since the status data of the processing device <b>100</b> play an important role here, with which the dental indication <b>103</b> is processed. In addition, a time saving results for a simple and complete documentation of the status data.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0112">The method can also be used for processing devices <b>100</b> that do not have an interface for integration to higher-level systems.
