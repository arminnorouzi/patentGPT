In the description of the embodiments of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;a plurality of/the plurality of&#x201d; means two or more unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the description of the embodiments, the expressions &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; and &#x201c;connected&#x201d; and derivatives thereof may be used. For example, the term &#x201c;connected&#x201d; may be used in the description of some embodiments to indicate that two or more components are in direct physical or electrical contact with each other. For another example, the term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; may be used in the description of some embodiments to indicate that two or more components are in direct physical or electrical contact. However, the term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; or &#x201c;communicatively coupled&#x201d; may also mean that two or more components are not in direct contact with each other, but still cooperate or interact with each other.

In the accompanying drawings, thicknesses of layers and regions are enlarged for clarity. Therefore, variations in shape with respect to the accompanying drawings due to, for example, manufacturing technologies and/or tolerances may be envisaged. Therefore, the exemplary embodiments should not be construed as being limited to the shapes of the regions shown herein, but including shape deviations due to, for example, manufacturing. For example, an etched region shown in a rectangular shape generally has a feature of being curved. Therefore, the regions shown in the accompanying drawings are schematic in nature, and their shapes are not intended to show actual shapes of the region in a device, and are not intended to limit the scope of the exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a display apparatus <b>00</b> in the related art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the display apparatus <b>00</b> includes a plurality of light-emitting portions for emitting blue light <b>01</b>, and a color filter layer <b>02</b> and a light shielding pattern <b>03</b> that are disposed on a light-exit side of the plurality of light-emitting portions for emitting blue light <b>01</b>. The color filter layer <b>02</b> includes a plurality of filter portions <b>021</b> (e.g., green filter portions, red filter portions and blue filter portions). The plurality of filter portions <b>021</b> correspond to the plurality of light-emitting portions for emitting blue light <b>01</b> in a one-to-one manner (i.e., a single light-emitting portion for emitting blue light <b>01</b> and a single filter portion <b>021</b> are located in a same sub-pixel). The plurality of filter portions <b>021</b> are used to filter blue light entering therein, so as to transmit light of three primary colors used for color display (e.g., the green filter portion may transmit only green light, the red filter portion may transmit only red light, and the blue filter portion may transmit only blue light), thereby realizing full-color display. The light shielding pattern <b>03</b> is disposed between any adjacent filter portions <b>021</b>. The light shielding pattern <b>03</b> has a function of absorbing light in the visible wavelength spectrum, and is used to separate the filter portions <b>021</b> to prevent cross-color between different filter portions <b>021</b> from affecting display effects.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">However, in the display apparatus <b>00</b>, a brightness of the red light emitted by the red filter portion and a brightness of the green light emitted by the green filter portion are both relatively low, and a brightness of the blue light emitted by the blue filter portion is relatively high. That is, the display apparatus <b>00</b> has a problem that a light-emitting brightness of red sub-pixels and a light-emitting brightness of green sub-pixels are low, while a light-emitting brightness of blue sub-pixels is high. Such a problem causes a relatively high power consumption of the display apparatus <b>00</b> when white images are displayed.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Based on this, some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a display panel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the display panel <b>1</b> includes at least one pixel unit <b>10</b>. The pixel unit <b>10</b> includes a first sub-pixel <b>11</b>, a second sub-pixel <b>12</b>, a third sub-pixel <b>13</b> and a fourth sub-pixel <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the first sub-pixel <b>11</b> includes a first color filter portion <b>111</b>. The first color filter portion <b>111</b> is configured to emit light of a first color (e.g., the first color filter portion <b>111</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is configured to emit red light). The second sub-pixel <b>12</b> includes a second color filter portion <b>121</b>. The second color filter portion <b>121</b> is configured to emit light of a second color (e.g., the second color filter portion <b>121</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is configured to emit green light). The third sub-pixel <b>13</b> includes a third color filter portion <b>131</b>. The third color filter portion <b>131</b> is configured to emit light of a third color (e.g., the third color filter portion <b>111</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is configured to emit blue light). The light of the third color, the light of the first color and the light of the second color light are light of three primary colors. Here, it will be noted that, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is only an example of the present disclosure, but not a limitation to the embodiments of the present disclosure. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the first color filter portion <b>111</b>, the second color filter portion <b>121</b> and the third color filter portion <b>131</b> only need to be capable of emitting the light of the three primary colors. For example, the light of the three primary colors is red light, green light and blue light. For another example, the light of the three primary colors is red light, yellow light and blue light.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>D</figref>, the fourth sub-pixel <b>14</b> includes a fourth color filter portion <b>141</b>. A material of the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> includes at least one light conversion material. The at least one light conversion material is configured to convert a portion of light directed to the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> into light of at least one primary color. The light of the at least one primary color is capable of being mixed with the other portion of the light directed to the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> to generate white light.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, in a case where the light directed to the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> is blue light and red light, the light conversion material in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> (e.g., a green light conversion material <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) can convert a portion of the blue light into green light, and then the obtained green light is mixed with the red light and the other portion of the blue light directed to the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b>, so that a purpose of emitting white light is achieved. For another example, in a case where the light directed to the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> is blue light and red light, the light conversion material in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> (e.g., a yellow light conversion material <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) can convert a portion of the blue light into yellow light, and then the obtained yellow light may be mixed with the red light and the other portion of the blue light directed to the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b>, so that the purpose of emitting white light is achieved. For still another example, in a case where the light directed to the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> is blue light, the light conversion material in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> (e.g., the green light conversion material <b>101</b> and a red light conversion material <b>103</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>) can convert a portion of the blue light into green light and red light, and then the obtained green light and red light are mixed with the other portion of the blue light, so that the purpose of emitting white light is achieved.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It will be noted that, the light conversion material in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> may be a light conversion material that converts short-wavelength light into long-wavelength light (e.g., converts blue light into green light), or a light conversion material that converts long-wavelength light into short-wavelength light (e.g., converts red light into green light). The embodiment of the present disclosure does not limit this, as long as a requirement that light obtained after conversion is capable of being mixed with unconverted light to generate white light is met.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the display panel provided in the embodiments of the present disclosure, due to an arrangement of the fourth sub-pixel that can emit white light, the white images may be displayed by just controlling corresponding fourth sub-pixels to emit light, while first sub-pixels (e.g., red sub-pixels), second sub-pixels (e.g., green sub-pixels) and third sub-pixels (e.g., blue sub-pixels) do not need to emit light simultaneously to output white light to display the white images. Therefore, low light-emitting brightness of the red sub-pixels and the green sub-pixels and high light-emitting brightness of the blue sub-pixels will not result in high power consumption when the display panel displays white images. In other words, when displaying the white images, compared with the display apparatus in the related art, the display apparatus having the display panel has an advantage of low power consumption. In addition, it is also beneficial to further improve a service life of the display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>D</figref>, the light conversion material in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> includes at least one of the green light conversion material <b>101</b>, the yellow light conversion material <b>102</b> and the red light conversion material <b>103</b>. The green light conversion material <b>101</b> is configured to convert received light into green light. The yellow light conversion material <b>102</b> is configured to convert the received light into yellow light. The red light conversion material <b>103</b> is configured to convert the received light into red light.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In a case where the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> includes the green light conversion material <b>101</b> and the red light conversion material <b>103</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, a doping mass percentage of the red light conversion material <b>103</b> in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> is approximately 0.5 times a doping mass percentage of the green light conversion material <b>101</b> in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> (where &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; means that there may be an upward fluctuation or a downward fluctuation on the basis of 0.5 times, for example, it may also be 0.4 times to 0.6 times in practical applications); and/or as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> includes a first film layer a<b>1</b> and a second film layer a<b>2</b> that are sequentially stacked in a direction E from a light-incidence side of the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> to a light-exit side of the fourth color filter portion, the first film layer a<b>1</b> is provided with the red light conversion material <b>103</b>, and the second film layer a<b>2</b> is provided with the green light conversion material <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this embodiment, by setting the doping mass percentage of the red light conversion material <b>103</b> in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> to be approximately 0.5 times the doping mass percentage of the green light conversion material <b>101</b> in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b>, an intensity of the red light obtained after conversion by the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> is less than an intensity of the green light obtained after conversion by the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b>. Moreover, by providing the first film layer a<b>1</b> and the second film layer a<b>2</b>, the first film layer a<b>1</b> being provided with the red light conversion material <b>103</b>, and the second film layer a<b>2</b> being provided with the green light conversion material <b>101</b>, it may be possible to make the red light conversion material play a role in sufficient light conversion. Such a design is beneficial to improve a purity of the white light generated after mixing, and then improve display effects of a white image the display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It will be noted that, in a case where the doping mass percentage of the red light conversion material <b>103</b> in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> is approximately 0.5 times the doping mass percentage of the green light conversion material <b>101</b> in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b>, the two materials may be directly mixed with each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, or may be respectively added into the first film layer a<b>1</b> and the second film layer a<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>. On the basis of the illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, for example, a thickness of the first film layer a<b>1</b> may be set to be approximately 0.5 times a thickness of the second film layer a<b>2</b> (where &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; means that there may be an upward fluctuation or a downward fluctuation on the basis of 0.5 times, for example, it may also be 0.4 times to 0.6 times in practical applications). In this case, it may be possible to make the doping mass percentage of the red light conversion material <b>103</b> in the first film layer a<b>1</b> close to the doping mass percentage of the green light conversion material <b>101</b> in the second film layer a<b>1</b>, which is further conductive to improving conversion effect of light in the first film layer a<b>1</b> and the second film layer a<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the doping mass percentage of the light conversion material (i.e., all light conversion materials in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b>, e.g., includes at least one of the green light conversion material, the yellow light conversion material and the red light conversion material) in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> is in a range of 15% to 90%, inclusive. For example, the doping mass percentage may be in a range of 50% to 75%, inclusive. For example, the doping mass percentage may be 70%. Such a design prevents the light directed to the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> from being completely absorbed and converted by the light conversion material in the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b>, so that the light obtained after conversion by the fourth color filter portion <b>141</b> may be mixed with unconverted light to output white light.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Any one of the first color filter portion <b>111</b>, the second color filter portion <b>121</b> and the third color filter portion <b>131</b> may be provided according to the following examples.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>D</figref>, the first color filter portion <b>111</b> includes the red light conversion material <b>103</b>; alternatively, the first color filter portion <b>111</b> includes both a red filter material <b>105</b> and the red light conversion material <b>103</b>. The red filter material <b>105</b> is configured to transmit only red light. The red light conversion material <b>103</b> is configured to convert received light into red light.

Moreover, in a case where the first color filter portion <b>111</b> includes both the red filter material <b>105</b> and the red light conversion material <b>103</b>, the two materials may be directly mixed with each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, alternatively, a portion of the first color filter portion <b>111</b> having the red filter material <b>105</b> may be disposed on a light-exit side of a portion of the first color filter portion <b>111</b> having the red light conversion material <b>103</b>. With such a design, in a case where light directed to the first color filter portion <b>111</b> is not completely converted by the portion of the first color filter portion <b>111</b> having the red light conversion material <b>103</b>, unconverted light may be filtered by using the portion of the first color filter portion <b>111</b> having the red filter material <b>105</b>. Therefore, the first color filter portion <b>111</b> may be prevented from emitting light of undesired colors.
