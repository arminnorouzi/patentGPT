It is provided that the individual cell receptacles are situated in such a way that a distance between the main plane and the intermediate plane is in a range between 54% and 60%, in particular, in a range between 56% and 58%, of a diameter of the rechargeable battery cells. As a result, a rechargeable battery pack having an optimal geometry may be advantageously provided for a flexible installation in a consumer.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, the rechargeable battery pack is, in particular, part of a system, which is made up of the rechargeable battery pack and a consumer, the consumer being provided with energy during the operation via the rechargeable battery pack. The rechargeable battery pack may, for example, be designed as a hand-held power tool rechargeable battery pack or as an electric bicycle rechargeable battery pack. The rechargeable battery pack is designed, in particular, as an exchangeable rechargeable battery pack, which is preferably designed to be detachable from the consumer without tools. The rechargeable battery pack is designed, in particular, to be connectable to a charging device for charging the rechargeable battery pack. Alternatively or in addition, the rechargeable battery pack may also be designed in such a way that it is chargeable in the state connected to the consumer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The consumer may be designed, in particular, as a gardening tool such as, for example, a lawn mower or a hedge trimmer, as a household appliance such as, for example, an electric window cleaner or hand-held vacuum cleaner, as a hand-held power tool such as, for example, an angle sander, a power screw driver, a power drill, a drill hammer, etc., as an electric means of transportation such as, for example, an electric bicycle in the form of a Pedelec or eBike, or as a measuring tool such as, for example, a laser range finder. In addition, it is also possible that the consumer is designed as a different, in particular, portable device such as, for example, a construction site lamp, a suction device or a construction site radio.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, the housing of the rechargeable battery pack is designed preferably as an exterior housing. The rechargeable battery pack, in particular, the housing of the rechargeable battery pack, may be detachably connectable via a mechanical interface to the consumer and/or to a charging device. The housing of the rechargeable battery pack may include one or multiple housing parts. The housing includes at least one housing part, which is designed as an exterior housing part. The exterior housing part in this case delimits the rechargeable battery pack to the outside and may be touched by a user. In addition, the housing may include at least one internal housing part, which is fully enclosed by the at least one housing part. The housing of the rechargeable battery pack includes, in particular, a cell holder for accommodating the rechargeable battery cells, the individual cell receptacles being assigned to the cell holder. The cell holder is designed preferably as one of the housing parts, the cell holder being capable of being designed as an exterior housing part and/or as an interior housing part. The housing of the rechargeable battery pack may include one or multiple cell holders. The housing parts are connected to one another in a force-fitting, form-fitting and/or materially bonding manner.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, the cell holder is formed preferably from a synthetic material, in particular from a thermoplastic synthetic material. The cell holder is formed preferably from a temperature-resistant synthetic material, preferably from a fiber-reinforced synthetic material. The cell holder is formed, in particular, as one part or as one piece. One piece is understood within the context of the present application to mean, in particular, a component, which is formed from one piece and not from multiple components that are connected to one another in a materially bonding and/or force-fitting and/or form-fitting manner. Accordingly, a one-piece component is made of one single material. One part is understood within the context of this application to mean multiple components, which are connected to one another in a materially bonding manner, for example, via 2K injection molding or a material bond. A one-part component may thus be made of one or of multiple materials. Alternatively, it is also possible that the cell holder has a multipart design, the different parts being connected to one another in a force-fitting and/or form-fitting manner. The rechargeable battery pack may include one or multiple cell holders, which are situated next to one another and/or behind one another.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, the rechargeable battery pack is connectable via a mechanical interface to the consumer in a force-fitting and/or form-fitting manner. The mechanical interface preferably includes at least one actuating element, via which the connection of the rechargeable battery pack to the consumer and/or to the charging device is detachable. The actuating element may, for example, be designed as a lock, a knob, a lever or push button. The actuating element may be situated on the rechargeable battery pack or on the consumer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, the rechargeable battery pack includes at least one electrical interface, via which the rechargeable battery pack is electrically connectable to the consumer and/or to the charging device. The rechargeable battery pack may, for example, be charged and/or discharged via the electrical connection.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Alternatively or in addition, it is also possible that pieces of information from the rechargeable battery pack to the consumer and vice versa are conveyable via the electrical interface. The electrical interface is designed preferably as a contact interface, in which the electrical connection takes place via a physical contact of at least two conductive components. The electrical interface includes preferably at least two electrical contact elements. One of the electrical contact elements is, in particular, designed as a plus contact and the other electrical contact element is designed as a minus contact. In addition, the electrical interface may include at least one additional contact, which is designed to transfer additional pieces of information to the consumer and/or to the charging device. The additional contacts may be designed as signal contacts, coding contacts, temperature contacts, bus contacts, etc. The electrical contact elements may, for example, be designed as resilient contact elements in the form of contact tulips or as flat contacts in the form of contact blades. Alternatively or in addition, the electrical interface may include a secondary charging coil element for inductive charging.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, according to an example embodiment of the present invention, the rechargeable battery pack preferably includes electronics. The electronics may include, for example, a circuit board, a processing unit, a control unit, a transistor, a capacitor and/or a memory unit. In addition or alternatively, it is also possible that pieces of information are ascertained by the electronics. The electronics are designed for controlling or regulating the rechargeable battery pack and/or the consumer. The electronics include, in particular, a battery management system (BMS), which is designed for monitoring the rechargeable battery pack. The BMS is designed, in particular, to prevent an overcharging and/or a deep discharging of the rechargeable battery pack. The BMS is designed preferably for correct cell balancing. The electronics may also include one or multiple sensor elements, for example, a temperature sensor for ascertaining the temperature within the rechargeable battery pack or a motion sensor for ascertaining motions. The electronics may alternatively or additionally include a coding element such as, for example, a code resistor. The electronic contact elements of the electrical interface of the rechargeable battery pack may be situated on the circuit board of the electronics or may be connected to the circuit board. A circuit board is understood within the context of this application to mean circuit carrier, which includes an organic or inorganic substrate, for example, IMS. The circuit board may be designed as a rigid circuit board or as a flexible circuit board. In addition, the circuit board may be a printed circuit board or a bare circuit board. The circuit board may have a single layer or may have a multilayer design.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, the cell holder includes at least one rechargeable battery cell receptacle. The rechargeable battery cell receptacle may be designed as an individual cell receptacle for accommodating a single rechargeable battery cell or as a multi-cell receptacle for accommodating multiple rechargeable battery cells. The rechargeable battery cell receptacle is designed, in particular, in such a way that in the state connected to the rechargeable battery cell, a major portion of the outer surface, in particular, a major portion of the lateral surface of the rechargeable battery cell, is enclosed by the rechargeable battery receptacle. At least 60%, preferably at least 70%, preferably at least 90% of the lateral surface of the rechargeable battery, in particular, is enclosed by the rechargeable battery cell receptacle. The rechargeable battery cell receptacle is designed preferably in such a way that the at least one rechargeable battery cell abuts an interior surface of the rechargeable battery cell receptacle and is fixed by the rechargeable battery cell receptacle. The cell holder includes a wall between two rechargeable battery cell receptacles, which insulates the rechargeable battery cell receptacles spatially and electrically and/or thermally from one another.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, the rechargeable battery cell may be designed as a galvanic cell, which has a structure in which one cell pole is positioned at one end and a further cell pole is positioned at the opposite end. The rechargeable battery cell includes, in particular, a positive cell pole at one end and a negative pole at an opposite end. The rechargeable battery cells are designed preferably as NiCd rechargeable battery cells or NiMh rechargeable battery cells, particularly preferably as lithium-based rechargeable battery cells or lithium-ion rechargeable battery cells. Alternatively, it is also possible, for example, that the rechargeable battery cell is designed as a pouch cell. The rechargeable battery voltage of the rechargeable battery pack is generally a multiple of the voltage of an individual rechargeable battery cell and results from the (parallel or serial) switching of the rechargeable battery cells. Thus, current rechargeable battery cells having a voltage of 3.6 V result in an exemplary rechargeable battery voltage of 3.6 V, 7.2 V, 10.8 V, 14.4 V, 18 V, 36 V, 54V, 108 V, etc. The rechargeable battery cell is designed preferably at least essentially as a cylindrical round cell, the cell poles being situated at ends of the cylindrical shape.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, the rechargeable battery pack includes, in particular, at least one cell connector, which is designed for electrically connecting the rechargeable battery cells to the electronics, in particular, to the circuit board and/or to the electrical contact elements. The cell connectors may have a one-piece, one-part or multipart design. The cell connectors may be connected to the housing of the rechargeable battery pack, in particular to the cell holder, in a force-fitting and/or form-fitting manner. It is equally possible that the cell connector is partially or fully encapsulated by the housing, in particular, by the cell holder. The cell connector is formed from a metallic material. The cell connector may, for example, be formed from a pure copper (copper content &#x3e;95%), from a copper alloy or from a nickel compound, from a steel, in particular, hilumin or from an aluminum alloy or aluminum. The cell connectors may be materially bonded at end faces or at the lateral surface of the rechargeable battery cells.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The cell connector includes a cell connection element for electrically connecting the rechargeable battery cells and a circuit board connection element for electrically connecting to the circuit board. The cell connection element in this case abuts directly and immediately the rechargeable battery cell, in particular, a cell pole of the rechargeable battery cell and is preferably materially bonded with the cell pole. The material bond may take place using a soldering method or using a welding method, in particular, using a resistance welding method or using a laser welding method. Alternatively or in addition, a material bond using an ultrasonic welding method is also possible. The weld connection in this context differs from the solder connection, in particular, in that in the case of the weld connection, a partial melting of the components to be connected takes place. The material bond may take place with the aid of a material bonding means. In the case of a soldering method, the material bonding means may be formed as solder or as a solder layer. In the case of a welding method, the material bonding means may, for example, be formed as a metal platelet, which increases the resistance locally. The circuit board connection element may be connected directly to the circuit board, for example, to a contact surface of the circuit board, or indirectly to the circuit board, for example, via an electrical contact element.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The circuit board is designed preferably as a rigid circuit board including an organic substrate. The circuit board includes an upper side and a lower side, the lower side facing the rechargeable battery cells. The circuit board may include one or multiple gaps for the cell connector. The gap is designed in such a way that with the aid of the gap, a passage is formed between the upper side and the lower side. The gap may be situated at the edge of the circuit board or within the circuit board. The gap may thus have a closed or an open edge.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, the center axes of the individual cell receptacles extend coaxially or in parallel to an accommodation direction, along which the rechargeable battery cells are mounted or inserted in the individual cell receptacles. The diameter of the rechargeable battery cells is subject to a certain production-related tolerance. The individual cell receptacles may be rigidly designed, an inner diameter of the individual cell receptacles being designed to be greater than the diameter of the rechargeable battery cells. Rechargeable battery cells having a tolerance-related larger diameter thus have less clearance in the individual cell receptacles than the rechargeable battery cells having a tolerance-related smaller diameter. The individual cell receptacles may also include a fastening means for the radial fixation of the rechargeable battery cells in the individual cell receptacles. Thus, a clearance-free and stable accommodation may be advantageously implemented. The radial fixation takes place via an application of a radial force on the rechargeable battery cells by the fastening means.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A center axis of the cylindrical rechargeable battery cells in the accommodated state extends essentially coaxially to the center axis of the individual cell receptacles. Due to the manufacturing tolerance, the center axis of the rechargeable battery cells may extend in parallel to and slightly offset from the center axis of the individual cell receptacles.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, it is provided according to an example embodiment of the present invention, that the cell holder includes 2n+3 individual cell receptacles, n&#x2265;1, in particular, being 1. As a result, a sufficiently large power supply for the consumer may be advantageously implemented. The rechargeable battery pack, in particular, the cell holder, includes at least two rechargeable battery cells per main plane. The intermediate plane may also include one or multiple rechargeable battery cells.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is further provided that a distance between the two main planes is designed to be greater than a distance between the center axes of the individual cell receptacles in the respective main planes. The distance of the rechargeable battery cells within a main plane is preferably designed to be the same.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is also provided that the adjacent main planes have essentially the same distance from the intermediate plane.

In the specific embodiment shown, one electrode is placed on cell connector <b>118</b> above connection point <b>126</b> and the second electrode is placed directly on weld platelet <b>168</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Alternatively, it would also be possible that cell connector <b>118</b> includes two circuit board connection elements <b>120</b>, which extend via a gap separately and in parallel to one another, and in each case an electrode is placed on a circuit board connection element <b>120</b> in such a way that the gap is situated between the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Since the connection also takes place by application of force on circuit board <b>114</b> in the area of connection point <b>126</b>, rechargeable battery pack <b>100</b> includes, in particular, cell holder <b>110</b>, a support element <b>170</b>, on which circuit board <b>114</b> rests in the area of connection point <b>126</b> and is supported thereby. Thus, support element <b>170</b> is designed both as a mounting stop for aligning circuit board <b>114</b> and as a counter bearing during the welding process. Mounting aid <b>160</b> and support element <b>170</b> are designed by way of example as one piece with cell holder <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Cell connector <b>118</b>, in particular, circuit board connection element <b>120</b>, includes a dimple <b>172</b>, via which the bearing surface of cell connector <b>118</b> [that bears] on weld platelet <b>168</b> is reduced. Dimple <b>172</b> of cell connector <b>118</b> in this case extends in the direction of circuit board <b>114</b>. The energy or heat required for welding is introduced essentially in the area of dimple <b>172</b>. This area thus corresponds to a direct weld area <b>174</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Connection point <b>126</b> includes a cavity <b>176</b> in direct weld area <b>174</b>, which is designed to locally reduce the heat transfer during the welding process. Cavity <b>176</b> is formed between weld platelet <b>168</b> and circuit board <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Cavity <b>176</b> is formed in the specific embodiment shown by a recess <b>178</b> in contact surface <b>164</b> and a recess <b>180</b> in solder layer <b>166</b>. Recesses <b>178</b>, <b>180</b> have, by way of example, the same cross section, but it is also possible that recesses <b>178</b>, <b>180</b> have different cross sections and thus different sizes. Recesses <b>178</b>, <b>180</b>, for example, have a rectangular cross section, however, other shapes such as, for example, square, round, triangular, polygonal, etc. are also possible.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">An overheating in direct weld area <b>174</b> is thus prevented by cavity <b>176</b> and the heat is better distributed over entire weld area <b>182</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">For the expansion of trapped air, circuit board <b>114</b> also includes degassing channels <b>186</b>, which are designed by way of example as recesses in solder layer <b>166</b> and in contact surface <b>164</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">An alternative specific embodiment of connection point <b>126</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>.
