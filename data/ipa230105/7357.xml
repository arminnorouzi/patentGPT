However, because of children's rapidly changing tastes in content, it can be very difficult for parents to identify content that their children will not object to. This problem is further exacerbated by the plethora of content available to choose from. If parents continuously include content in their children's playlist that their children do not like, they will receive frequent requests from their children for new content. This can be very disruptive to the current activities that parents and children are engaging in and a source of frustration for both parties.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Systems and methods are provided herein for providing a first user with recommendations of media assets for inclusion in a playlist for a second user based on the second user's viewing activity. These systems and methods receive, from the second user, an expression of disinterest in a media asset included in the playlist for the second user, update a user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest, and determine a recommendation for another media asset based on the updated user profile associated with the second user. These systems and methods then generate for display for the first user the recommendation for another media asset.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An interactive media guidance application receives, from the first user, a selection of a plurality of media assets to be included in the playlist for the second user. For example, the interactive media guidance application may generate for display a plurality of media asset identifiers (e.g., text listings, graphical listings, audio listings and other suitable identifiers) and corresponding selectable options (e.g., &#x201c;select,&#x201d; &#x201c;add to playlist,&#x201d; and other suitable options) to allow the first user to select the plurality of media assets for inclusion in the playlist. For example, the interactive media guidance application may generate for display media asset identifiers for media assets A through Z along with a selectable &#x201c;add to playlist&#x201d; option corresponding to each of these media asset identifiers. The interactive media guidance application may receive, from the first user (e.g., Mom), a selection of the selectable &#x201c;add to playlist&#x201d; options corresponding to media asset identifiers for media assets A, B and C.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The interactive media guidance application generates for display, for the second user, the plurality of media assets in the playlist. For example, the interactive media guidance application may generate for display the media asset identifiers corresponding to media assets A, B and C for the second user (e.g., Teddy). The interactive media guidance application receives, from the second user, an expression of disinterest in a first media asset of the plurality of media assets. For example, the interactive media guidance application may receive, from Teddy, an expression of disinterest in media asset A. An expression of disinterest in a media asset is any suitable means of communicating that the media asset fails to satisfy the second user in some aspect.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receiving the expression of disinterest in the first media asset comprises the interactive media guidance application receiving a request from the second user to remove the first media asset from the playlist prior to playback of the first media asset. The interactive media guidance application may generate for display a variety of selectable options corresponding to each media asset identifier in the playlist for the second user. For example, the interactive media guidance application may generate for display selectable options &#x201c;play&#x201d; and &#x201c;remove from playlist&#x201d; corresponding to media asset identifier for media asset A. Upon receiving a selection of the &#x201c;remove from playlist&#x201d; option for media asset A prior to receiving any selection of the &#x201c;play&#x201d; option for media asset A, the interactive media guidance application determines that the interactive media guidance application has received the expression of disinterest in media asset A from the second user.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receiving the expression of disinterest in the first media asset comprises the interactive media guidance application receiving a request to terminate playback of the first media asset before a threshold time has elapsed from a start time of the playback of the first media asset. The threshold time defines a minimum period of time that the second user will spend viewing a media asset if the second user does not have a disinterest in the media asset. The threshold time may be a constant time period (e.g., 10 minutes) or a variable time period determined based on the length of a media asset (e.g., 25% of the length of a media asset). In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application may determine the threshold time based on the playlist associated activity of the second user. For example, if the interactive media guidance application determines that the second user has an unusually short attention span in general, the interactive media guidance application may set the threshold time to a higher value. The interactive media guidance application may access a data structure (e.g., threshold parameters data structure) associated with the user profile associated with the second user or a separate data structure to determine the value corresponding to the threshold time. The interactive media guidance application may use a Boolean comparison function to determine whether the time elapsed from a start time of the playback of the first media asset exceeds the threshold time. For example, if the threshold time is 10 minutes and the interactive media guidance application receives a request from the second user to terminate playback of media asset A after five minutes of playback, the interactive media guidance application determines that the interactive media guidance application has received the expression of disinterest in media asset A from the second user.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application may wait a predefined period of time upon receiving a request to terminate playback of the first media asset before the threshold time has elapsed before determining that the request constitutes the expression of disinterest in the first media asset. The interactive media guidance application may determine a total playback time for the first media at the end of the predefined period. For example, the interactive media guidance application may maintain a total playback time data structure and the interactive media guidance application may update the value of total playback time of the first media asset in this data structure based on the current time and playback of the first media asset. The interactive media guidance application may use a Boolean comparison function to determine whether the total playback time for the first media asset at the end of the predefined period of time is less than the threshold time. Upon determining that the total playback time for the first media asset at the end of the predefined period of time is less than the threshold time, the interactive media guidance application may determine that the interactive media guidance application has received the expression of disinterest in the first media asset. For example, the interactive media guidance application may, upon receiving the second user request to terminate playback of media asset A after five minutes of playback, may wait for a 24 hour period before determining whether the request constitutes an expression of disinterest in media asset A. If, for example, the second user resumes playback of the media asset A for another 15 minutes during the 24 hour period, the interactive media guidance application may determine that the total playback time for media asset A at the end of the pre-defined time period is 20 minutes. In this case, the interactive media guidance application may determine, because the total playback time for media asset A exceeds the threshold time, that the request does not constitute an expression of disinterest in media asset A.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receiving the expression of disinterest in the first media asset comprises the interactive media guidance application determining that a proportion of the first media asset viewed uninterrupted by the second user is less than a threshold proportion. The threshold proportion defines a minimum proportion of a media asset (e.g., 60% of a media asset) that the second user will spend viewing uninterrupted if the second user does not have a disinterest in the media asset. The interactive media guidance application may access a data structure (e.g., threshold parameters data structure) associated with the user profile associated with the second user or a separate data structure to determine the value corresponding to the threshold proportion. The interactive media guidance application may use a Boolean comparison function to determine whether the proportion of the first media asset viewed uninterrupted by the second user is less than the threshold proportion (e.g., &#x201c;proportion viewed uninterrupted &#x3c;threshold proportion&#x201d; Boolean function). In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application may adapt the value of the threshold proportion based on the playlist associated activity of the second user (e.g., the threshold may be set to be 40% if the second user frequently views media assets with interruptions). Interruptions to viewing may be pausing playback, fast-forwarding, performing other activities simultaneously with playback of the media asset (e.g., simultaneously playing back another media asset, browsing social media, executing another application) and other suitable interruptions. For example, the threshold proportion may be 50%. If the second user fast-forwards through 65% of media asset A, the interactive media guidance application determines that the proportion of the first media asset viewed uninterrupted is 35%. In this case, the interactive media guidance application receives a &#x201c;true&#x201d; value from the &#x201c;proportion viewed uninterrupted &#x3c;threshold proportion&#x201d; Boolean function and the interactive media guidance application determines that the interactive media guidance application has received the expression of disinterest in media asset A from the second user.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receiving the expression of disinterest in the first media asset comprises the interactive media guidance application receiving a feedback about the first media asset from the second user and the interactive media guidance application determining that the feedback corresponds to a pre-defined expression of disinterest. Feedback about the first media asset may be structured responses (e.g., a score, a response to a prompt such as &#x201c;Did you like the media asset?&#x201d;), unstructured comments and any other suitable means of communicating the second user's level of disinterest in the first media asset. The interactive media guidance application may access a data structure (e.g., threshold parameters data structure) associated with the user profile associated with the second user or a separate data structure to determine a pre-defined expression of disinterest. The interactive media guidance application may determine that the feedback corresponds to a pre-defined expression of disinterest using a Boolean comparison function.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, the interactive media guidance application may generate for display a selectable option &#x201c;Rate this media asset&#x201d; corresponding to each media asset in the playlist. Upon receiving a selection of the &#x201c;Rate this media asset&#x201d; option, the interactive media guidance application may generate for display selectable options (e.g., letter ratings system, numerical rating system, and any other suitable rating criteria) for receiving the rating from the second user. For example, the interactive media guidance application may receive a selection of the &#x201c;Rate this media asset&#x201d; option corresponding to media asset A from the second user. In response, the interactive media guidance application may generate for display selectable options A, B, C, D, E and F. The interactive media guidance application may receive a selection of the option C from the second user. The interactive media guidance application may then access a data structure associated with the playlist (e.g., threshold parameters data structure) to determine a value corresponding to the pre-defined expression of disinterest. For example, the threshold parameters data structure may include C, D, E and F as pre-defined expressions of disinterest. In this case, the interactive media guidance application receives a &#x201c;true&#x201d; result from a &#x201c;feedback==pre-defined expression of disinterest&#x201d; Boolean function. Upon receiving the &#x201c;true&#x201d; result, the interactive media guidance application may determine that the interactive media guidance application has received an expression of disinterest in media asset A from the second user.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receives unstructured feedback such as unstructured text (e.g., response to some equivalent of the prompt &#x201c;Leave comments&#x201d;), social media activity (e.g., posting information about a media asset on social media such as &#x201c;Watched media asset A. It was very bad.&#x201d;), audio and/or video feedback and other suitable unstructured feedback. In these cases, the interactive media guidance application may perform additional analytical steps to determine the level of disinterest expressed by the second user. For example, the interactive media guidance application may receive text response &#x201c;This was so boring that I wanted do my homework instead.&#x201d; to the &#x201c;Leave comments&#x201d; selectable option corresponding to media asset A. The interactive media guidance application may perform semantic analysis on the text to determine a level of disinterest expressed in the text response. The interactive media guidance application may then determine, based on the level of disinterest that has been pre-defined as an expression of disinterest in a data structure associated with the playlist (e.g., threshold parameters data structure) or a separate data structure, whether the text response constitutes an expression of disinterest. For example, the interactive media guidance application may determine, based on semantic analysis, that the level of disinterest expressed in the text response &#x201c;This was so boring that I wanted do my homework instead&#x201d; is 85%. The interactive media guidance application may access the threshold parameters data structure to determine that the level of disinterest pre-defined as an expression of disinterest is 50%. In this case, the interactive media guidance application determines that the interactive media guidance application has received an expression of disinterest in media asset A from the second user.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The interactive media guidance application, based on receiving the expression of disinterest, updates a user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset from the second user. For example, upon receiving the expression of disinterest in media asset A from Teddy, the interactive media guidance application updates Teddy's user profile. In some embodiments, the user profile associated with the second user includes a plurality of attributes and corresponding weights. Attributes may be descriptors typically associated with media content such as but not limited to genre (e.g., drama, comedy, animation, science fiction), actor, director, producer, studio (e.g., Walt Disney Studios, Warner Bros. Entertainment, NBC Universal) plot, key words, key sequences. For example, Teddy's user profile may include an attributes data structure that includes the attributes animation, science fiction, Walt Disney Studios, plot x and plot y and the corresponding weights. In some embodiments, the weights are initialized to default values based on the age of the second user.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The interactive media guidance application may determine, for example, that Teddy is 11 years old. The interactive media guidance application may then access a data structure (e.g., default attributes settings data structure) to determine the default values of weights corresponding to the attributes included in the attributes data structure in Teddy's user profile for an 11 year old. The interactive media guidance application may then initialize the values of the weights corresponding to the attributes in the attributes data structure in Teddy's user profile with the default values of the weights for an 11 year old from the default attributes settings data structure. For example, the interactive media guidance application may determine, by accessing the default attributes settings data structure, that the default values of weights corresponding to the attributes animation, science fiction, Walt Disney Studios, plot x and plot y for an 11 year old are 3, 1, 3, 2, and 1 respectively. The interactive media guidance application may then set the values of the weights corresponding to the attributes animation, science fiction, Walt Disney Studios, plot x and plot y to 3, 1, 3, 2, and 1 respectively in the attributes data structure in Teddy's user profile.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the first media asset has an associated first plurality of attributes. For example, media asset A has the attributes science fiction, Walt Disney Studios and plot x. The interactive media guidance application may retrieve metadata corresponding to the first media asset by querying a database (e.g., content listings database of the content source providing media asset A) for the metadata corresponding to the first media asset. The interactive media guidance application may perform the query using database management languages such as SQL, JAPQL, CODASYL or another suitable language. The interactive media guidance application may extract the first plurality of attributes from the metadata corresponding to the first media asset using a suitable metadata extraction tool.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application updates the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset by decreasing weights corresponding to the first plurality of attributes in the user profile. For example, the interactive media guidance application may, upon receiving the expression of disinterest in media asset A, decrease the weights corresponding to science fiction, Walt Disney Studios and plot x in the attributes data structure in Teddy's user profile. From the previous example, the interactive media guidance application initially set the weights corresponding to the attributes science fiction, Walt Disney Studios and plot x to 1, 3 and 2 respectively. After receiving the expression of disinterest in media asset A, the interactive media guidance application may decrease the weights corresponding to science fiction, Walt Disney Studios and plot x to 0, 2 and 1 respectively.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, an attribute of the first plurality of attributes associated with the first media asset may not be included in the user profile associated with the second user. In such an instance, the interactive media guidance application may update the user profile associated with the second user to include the attribute. For example, an attribute associated with media asset A may be actor X. The interactive media guidance application may determine (e.g., by using a Boolean query function) that the attribute actor X is not included in the attributes data structure in Teddy's user profile. The interactive media guidance application may then update the attributes data structure in Teddy's user profile to include the attribute actor X.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application determines whether the number of expressions of disinterest received during a period of time exceeds a threshold number of expressions of disinterest during the period of time. The period of time (e.g., one hour) and the threshold number of expressions of disinterest (e.g., five expressions of disinterest) may be some default value or provided by the first user. The interactive media guidance application may access a data structure (e.g., threshold parameters data structure) associated with the user profile associated with the second user or a separate data structure to determine the values corresponding to the period of time and the threshold number of expressions of disinterest. For example, the interactive media guidance application may maintain a counter of the number of expressions of disinterest received during the period of time. The interactive media guidance application may continuously update the value of the counter based on the current time and receiving an expression of disinterest in a media asset. Each time the interactive media guidance application receives an expression of disinterest, the interactive media guidance application may compare the updated value of the counter with the threshold number of expressions of disinterest during the period of time to determine if the value of the counter exceeds the threshold number of expressions of disinterest. For example, the interactive media guidance application may use a Boolean comparison function (e.g., &#x201c;counter &#x3e;threshold number&#x201d; Boolean comparison function) to perform this determination.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application may, in response to determining that the number of expressions of disinterest received during a period of time does not exceed the threshold number, update the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset. Techniques by which the interactive media guidance application may update the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset discussed previously are applicable here. For example, upon receiving an expression of disinterest in media asset A, the interactive media guidance application may determine that the updated value of the counter of the number of expressions of disinterest received during one hour is 3. In this case, the interactive media guidance application receives a &#x201c;false&#x201d; result from the &#x201c;counter &#x3e;threshold number&#x201d; Boolean comparison function, and the interactive media guidance application determines that the counter does not exceed the threshold number. The interactive media guidance application may then update Teddy's user profile based on the expression of disinterest in media asset A.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application may, in response to determining that the number of expressions of disinterest received during a period of time exceeds the threshold number, make no changes to the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset. For example, upon receiving an expression of disinterest in media asset A, the interactive media guidance application may determine that the updated value of the counter of the number of expressions of disinterest received during one hour is 6. In this case, the interactive media guidance application receives a &#x201c;true&#x201d; result from the &#x201c;counter &#x3e;threshold number&#x201d; Boolean comparison function and the interactive media guidance application determines that the counter exceeds the threshold number. In this instance, the interactive media guidance application may make no changes to Teddy's user profile based on the expression of disinterest in media asset A.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The interactive media guidance application determines a recommendation for a second media asset for inclusion in the playlist for the second user based on the updated user profile associated with the second user. The interactive media guidance application may use any suitable recommendation algorithm to determine a recommendation for a second media asset based on the updated user profile. In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application may determine a second plurality of attributes associated with the second media asset. Manners in which the interactive media guidance application may determine attributes associated with a media asset from the metadata corresponding to the media asset discussed previously are applicable here. The interactive media guidance application may compare the second plurality of attributes with the plurality of attributes and the corresponding weights in the user profile associated with the second user to determine a similarity coefficient for the second media asset. For example, the interactive media guidance application may sum the weights corresponding to the second plurality of attributes in the user profile associated with the second user to determine the similarity coefficient for the second media asset. The interactive media guidance application may then compare the similarity coefficient for the second media asset to a threshold similarity coefficient using a Boolean comparison function. The interactive media guidance application may access a data structure (e.g., threshold parameters data structure) associated with the user profile associated with the second user or a separate data structure to determine the value corresponding to the threshold similarity coefficient. In some embodiments, upon determining that the similarity coefficient for the second media asset exceeds the threshold similarity coefficient, the interactive media guidance application determines that the second media asset should be recommended for inclusion in the playlist for the second user.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">From the previous example, after Teddy's user profile is updated based on the expression of disinterest in media asset A, the plurality of attributes in the attributes data structure are animation, science fiction, Walt Disney Studios, plot x and plot y and the corresponding weights are 3, 0, 2, 1, and 1 respectively. For example, media asset M has attributes animation and Walt Disney Studios, and media asset F has attributes science fiction and plot x. The interactive media guidance application may determine the similarity coefficients for media asset M and media asset F to be 5 and 1, respectively. The threshold similarity coefficient may be 2. In this case, the interactive media guidance application may determine, based on the results of a Boolean comparison function, that only media asset M should be recommended for inclusion in the playlist for Teddy.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The interactive media guidance application, upon determining a recommendation for a second media asset for inclusion in the playlist for the second user, generates for display, for the first user, the recommendation for the second media asset. From the previous example, the interactive media guidance application, upon determining that media asset M should be recommended for inclusion in the playlist for Teddy, generates for display, for Mom, a recommendation to include media asset M in the playlist for Teddy.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receives, from the first user, an expression of disinterest in the recommendation for the second media asset. For example, the interactive media guidance application may receive an expression of disinterest in media asset M from Mom (e.g., a request from Mom to remove media asset M from the recommendations). In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application, in response to receiving the expression of disinterest in the recommendation for the second media asset, updates the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the recommendation. For example, the interactive media guidance application may update Teddy's user profile based on the request from Mom to remove media asset M from the recommendations. Techniques by which the interactive media guidance application may update the user profile associated with the second user discussed previously are applicable here. The interactive media guidance application may determine a recommendation for a third media asset for inclusion in the playlist for the second user based on the updated user profile associated with the second user. Manners in which the interactive media guidance application performs this determination discussed previously are applicable here. The interactive media guidance application may generate for display, for the first user, the recommendation for the third media asset. For example, the interactive media guidance application may determine that media asset X should be recommended for inclusion in the playlist for Teddy. The interactive media guidance application may then generate for display, for Mom, a recommendation to include media asset X in the playlist for Teddy.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receives, from the first user, a selection of a subset of media assets of the plurality of media assets to be included in the playlist for the second user for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded. For example, the interactive media guidance application may generate for display a selectable option (e.g., some equivalent of &#x201c;Disregard expression of disinterest in media asset by second user&#x201d;) corresponding to each media asset identifier to allow the first user to select the subset of media assets for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded. For example, the interactive media guidance application may receive a selection from Mom to include media assets A, B and C in the playlist for Teddy. The interactive media guidance application may also receive, from mom, a selection of the selectable option &#x201c;Disregard expression of disinterest in media asset by second user&#x201d; corresponding to media asset A. In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application, upon receiving the selection of the subset of media assets for the second user for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded, stores the media assets identifiers corresponding to the subset of media assets in a data structure (e.g., &#x201c;disregard list&#x201d;). For example, the interactive media guidance application may store the media asset identifier for media asset A in the &#x201c;disregard list&#x201d; data structure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application updating the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset further comprises the interactive media guidance application determining whether the first media asset is included in the subset of media assets for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded. For example, the interactive media guidance application, upon receiving the expression of disinterest in the first media asset from the second user, may use a Boolean comparison function to compare the media asset identifier of the first media asset with the media asset identifiers stored in the &#x201c;disregard list&#x201d; data structure. The interactive media guidance application may determine that the first media asset is included in the subset of media assets for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded if the Boolean comparison function returns a &#x201c;true&#x201d; result. The interactive media guidance application may determine that the first media asset is not included in the subset of media assets for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded if the Boolean comparison function returns a &#x201c;false&#x201d; result.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application, in response to determining that the first media asset is included to the subset of media assets for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded, makes no changes to the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset. For example, the interactive media guidance application receives an expression of disinterest in the media asset A from Teddy and the interactive media guidance application determines that media asset A is included in the &#x201c;disregard list&#x201d; data structure. In this instance, the interactive media guidance application makes no changes to Teddy's user profile based on the expression of disinterest in media asset A. In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application, in response to determining that the first media asset is not included in the subset of media assets for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded, updates the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset. For example, the interactive media guidance application receives an expression of disinterest in the media asset B from the Teddy and the interactive media guidance application determines that media asset B is not included in the &#x201c;disregard list&#x201d; data structure. In this instance, the interactive media guidance application updates Teddy's user profile based on the expression of disinterest in media asset B. Techniques by which the interactive media guidance application may update Teddy's user profile based on the expression of disinterest in media asset B discussed previously are applicable here.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Parents create playlists for their children so that the children can view approved content without continuously interrupting them to request permission to view the content. In order to minimize interruptions, parents have to choose content that their children will not object to. Given the plethora of available content and children's rapidly changing tastes, it is virtually impossible for parents to manually track types of content their children typically object to and, based on those objections, select content that is least likely to be objected to. As a result, parents invariably include content that their children object to and receive frequent requests from their children for new content. This can be very disruptive to the current activities that parents and children are engaging in and a source of frustration for both parties.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Systems and methods provided herein address this issue by monitoring expressions of disinterest in content received from a child, updating the child's user profile based on the expressions of disinterest and providing a recommendation for other content, determined based on the updated child's user profile, to the parent. This approach uses a more complete set of parameters for determining content to recommend and can consequently identify content that is least likely to be objected to more accurately.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Conventional systems may determine recommendations for other content based on what the child has watched. Consequently, because they do not take into account expressions of disinterest in content received from a child, conventional systems are more likely than the proposed invention to recommend content that will be objected to. For example, the child may have watched content <b>1</b>. Based on this, conventional systems may recommend content <b>2</b>. However, content <b>2</b> may have attribute A that the child had previously expressed disinterest in. Because conventional systems do not monitor for expressions of disinterest, conventional systems would recommend content <b>2</b>, which would subsequently be objected to by the child. The proposed invention would determine that content <b>2</b> should not be recommended based on the previously received expression of disinterest and would recommend other content that is less likely to be objected to.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It should be noted that the systems and/or methods described above may be applied to, or used in accordance with, other systems, methods and/or apparatuses in this disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The above and other objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative display of the interactive media guidance application in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts another illustrative display of the interactive media guidance application in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an illustrative embodiment of a display screen that may be used to provide media guidance application listings and other media guidance information, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows another illustrative embodiment of a display screen that may be used to provide media guidance application listings, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative user equipment (UE) device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative media system in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart of illustrative steps involved in providing a first user with recommendations of media assets for inclusion in a playlist for a second user based on the second user's viewing activity in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart of illustrative steps involved in step <b>706</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) when receiving, from the second user, the expression of disinterest in the first media asset of the plurality of media assets in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart of illustrative steps involved in step <b>708</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) when updating the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset from the second user in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart of illustrative steps involved in step <b>710</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) when determining the recommendation for the second media asset for inclusion in the playlist for the second user based on the updated user profile associated with the second user in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As referred to herein, an &#x201c;interactive media guidance application,&#x201d; or a &#x201c;media guidance application&#x201d; or, sometimes, a &#x201c;media guidance application&#x201d; or a &#x201c;guidance application&#x201d; is an application that allows a user to consume, and/or navigate to content.

An expression of disinterest in a media asset is any suitable means of communicating that the media asset fails to satisfy the second user in some aspect.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receiving the expression of disinterest in the first media asset comprises the interactive media guidance application receiving a request from the second user to remove the first media asset from the playlist prior to playback of the first media asset. For example, the interactive media guidance application may receive, via user input interface <b>510</b>, a selection of the &#x201c;Remove from playlist&#x201d; <b>126</b> option prior to any selection of the &#x201c;Play&#x201d; <b>124</b> option. In this instance, the interactive media guidance application may determine that the interactive media guidance application has received the expression of disinterest in &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> from the second user.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receiving the expression of disinterest in the first media asset comprises the interactive media guidance application receiving a request to terminate playback of the first media asset before a threshold time has elapsed from a start time of the playback of the first media asset. The threshold time defines a minimum period of time that the second user will spend viewing a media asset if the second user does not have a disinterest in the media asset. The threshold time may be a constant time period (e.g., 10 minutes) or a variable time period determined based on the length of a media asset (e.g., 25% of the length of a media asset). In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application may determine the threshold time based on the playlist associated activity of the second user. For example, if the interactive media guidance application determines that the second user has an unusually short attention span in general, the interactive media guidance application may set the threshold time to a higher value. The interactive media guidance application may access a data structure (e.g., threshold parameters data structure stored locally in storage <b>508</b> or remotely in media content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b>) associated with the user profile associated with the second user or a separate data structure to determine the value corresponding to the threshold time. The interactive media guidance application may use a Boolean comparison function to determine whether the time elapsed from a start time of the playback of the first media asset exceeds the threshold time. For example, if the threshold time is 10 minutes and the interactive media guidance application receives a request from the second user to terminate playback of &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> after five minutes of playback (e.g., selection of a termination option 5 minutes after a selection of &#x201c;Play&#x201d; <b>124</b> option), the interactive media guidance application determines that the interactive media guidance application has received the expression of disinterest in &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> from the second user.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application may wait a predefined period of time upon receiving a request to terminate playback of the first media asset before the threshold time has elapsed before determining that the request constitutes the expression of disinterest in the first media asset. The interactive media guidance application may determine a total playback time for the first media at the end of the predefined period. For example, the interactive media guidance application may maintain a total playback time data structure and the interactive media guidance application may update the value of total playback time of the first media asset in this data structure based on the current time and playback of the first media asset. The interactive media guidance application may use a Boolean comparison function to determine whether the total playback time for the first media asset at the end of the predefined period of time is less than the threshold time. Upon determining that the total playback time for the first media asset at the end of the predefined period of time is less than the threshold time, the interactive media guidance application may determine that the interactive media guidance application has received the expression of disinterest in the first media asset. For example, the interactive media guidance application may, upon receiving the second user request to terminate playback of &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> after five minutes of playback, may wait for a 24 hour period before determining whether the request constitutes an expression of disinterest in media asset A. If, for example, the second user resumes playback of the &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> for another 15 minutes during the 24 hour period, the interactive media guidance application may determine that the total playback time for &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> at the end of the pre-defined time period is 20 minutes. In this case, the interactive media guidance application may determine, because the total playback time for &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> exceeds the threshold time, the request does not constitute an expression of disinterest in &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receiving the expression of disinterest in the first media asset comprises the interactive media guidance application determining that a proportion of the first media asset viewed uninterrupted by the second user is less than a threshold proportion. The threshold proportion defines a minimum proportion of a media asset (e.g., 60% of a media asset) that the second user will spend viewing uninterrupted if the second user does not have a disinterest in the media asset. The interactive media guidance application may access a data structure (e.g., threshold parameters data structure stored locally in storage <b>508</b> or remotely in media content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b>) associated with the user profile associated with the second user or a separate data structure to determine the value corresponding to the threshold proportion. The interactive media guidance application may use a Boolean comparison function to determine whether the proportion of the first media asset viewed uninterrupted by the second user is less than the threshold proportion (e.g., &#x201c;proportion viewed uninterrupted &#x3c;threshold proportion&#x201d; Boolean function). In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application may adapt the value of the threshold proportion based on the playlist associated activity of the second user (e.g., the threshold may be set to be 40% if the second user frequently views media assets with interruptions). Interruptions to viewing may be pausing playback, fast-forwarding, performing other activities simultaneously with playback of the media asset (e.g., simultaneously playing back another media asset, browsing social media, executing another application) and other suitable interruptions. For example, the threshold proportion may be 50%. If the second user fast-forwards through 65% of &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b>, the interactive media guidance application determines that the proportion of the first media asset viewed uninterrupted is 35%. In this case, the interactive media guidance application receives a &#x201c;true&#x201d; value from the &#x201c;proportion viewed uninterrupted &#x3c;threshold proportion&#x201d; Boolean comparison function and the interactive media guidance application determines that the interactive media guidance application has received the expression of disinterest in &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> from the second user.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receiving the expression of disinterest in the first media asset comprises the interactive media guidance application receiving a feedback about the first media asset from the second user and the interactive media guidance application determining that the feedback corresponds to a pre-defined expression of disinterest. Feedback about the first media asset may be structured responses (e.g., a score, a response to a prompt such as &#x201c;Did you like the media asset?&#x201d;), unstructured comments and any other suitable means of communicating the second user's level of disinterest in the first media asset. The interactive media guidance application may access a data structure (e.g., threshold parameters data structure stored locally in storage <b>508</b> or remotely in media content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b>) associated with the user profile associated with the second user or a separate data structure to determine a pre-defined expression of disinterest. The interactive media guidance application may determine that the feedback corresponds to a pre-defined expression of disinterest using a Boolean comparison function.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, the interactive media guidance application may generate for display selectable options &#x201c;Rate this media asset&#x201d; <b>128</b>, &#x201c;Rate this media asset&#x201d; <b>140</b> and &#x201c;Rate this media asset&#x201d; <b>152</b> to allow the second user to rate &#x201c;Media Asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b>, &#x201c;Media Asset A&#x201d; <b>134</b> and &#x201c;Media Asset A&#x201d; <b>146</b>, respectively. Upon receiving a selection of any of <b>128</b>, <b>140</b> and <b>152</b>, the interactive media guidance application may generate for display selectable options (e.g., letter ratings system, numerical rating system, and any other suitable rating criteria) for receiving the rating from the second user. For example, the interactive media guidance application may receive a selection of the &#x201c;Rate this media asset&#x201d; <b>128</b>&#x2033; option corresponding to &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> from the second user. In response, the interactive media guidance application may generate for display selectable options A, B, C, D, E and F. The interactive media guidance application may receive a selection of the option C from the second user. The interactive media guidance application may then access a data structure associated with the playlist (e.g., threshold parameters data structure stored locally in storage <b>508</b> or remotely in media content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b>) to determine a value corresponding to the pre-defined expression of disinterest. For example, the threshold parameters data structure may include C, D, E and F as pre-defined expressions of disinterest. In this case, the interactive media guidance application receives a &#x201c;true&#x201d; result from a &#x201c;feedback==pre-defined expression of disinterest&#x201d; Boolean function. Upon receiving the &#x201c;true&#x201d; result, the interactive media guidance application may determine that the interactive media guidance application has received an expression of disinterest in &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> from the second user. Similarly, the interactive media guidance application may determine that the interactive media guidance application has received an expression of disinterest in &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> from the second user upon receiving a selection of the &#x201c;Dislike&#x201d; <b>132</b> option.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receives unstructured feedback such as unstructured text (e.g., response to some equivalent of the prompt &#x201c;Leave comments&#x201d;), social media activity (e.g., posting information about a media asset on social media such as &#x201c;Watched media asset A. It was very bad.&#x201d;), audio and/or video feedback and other suitable unstructured feedback. For example, the interactive media guidance application may receive a selection of the &#x201c;Leave comments&#x201d; <b>158</b> option. In response, the interactive media guidance application may provide the user an option to input text comments via user input interface <b>510</b>. In such cases, the interactive media guidance application may perform additional analytical steps to determine the level of disinterest expressed by the second user. For example, the interactive media guidance application may receive text response &#x201c;This was so boring that I wanted do my homework instead.&#x201d; to the &#x201c;Leave comments&#x201d; <b>158</b> selectable option corresponding to &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b>. The interactive media guidance application may perform semantic analysis on the text to determine a level of disinterest expressed in the text response. The interactive media guidance application may then determine, based on the level of disinterest that has been pre-defined as an expression of disinterest in a data structure associated with the playlist (e.g., threshold parameters data structure stored locally in storage <b>508</b> or remotely in media content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b>) or a separate data structure, whether the text response constitutes an expression of disinterest. For example, the interactive media guidance application may determine, based on semantic analysis, that the level of disinterest expressed in the text response &#x201c;This was so boring that I wanted do my homework instead&#x201d; is 85%. The interactive media guidance application may access the threshold parameters data structure to determine that the level of disinterest pre-defined as an expression of disinterest is 50%. In this case, the interactive media guidance application determines that the interactive media guidance application has received an expression of disinterest in &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> from the second user.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The interactive media guidance application, based on receiving the expression of disinterest, updates a user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset from the second user. For example, upon receiving the expression of disinterest in media asset A from Teddy, the interactive media guidance application updates Teddy's user profile. In some embodiments, the user profile associated with the second user includes a plurality of attributes and corresponding weights. Attributes may be descriptors typically associated with media content such as but not limited to genre (e.g., drama, comedy, animation, science fiction), actor, director, producer, studio (e.g., Walt Disney Studios, Warner Bros. Entertainment, NBC Universal) plot, key words, key sequences. For example, Teddy's user profile may include an attributes data structure that includes the attributes animation, science fiction, Walt Disney Studios, plot x and plot y and the corresponding weights. In some embodiments, the weights are initialized to default values based on the age of the second user.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The interactive media guidance application may determine, for example, that Teddy is 11 years old. The interactive media guidance application may then access a data structure (e.g., default attributes settings data structure stored locally in storage <b>508</b> or remotely in media content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b>) to determine the default values of weights corresponding to the attributes included in the attributes data structure in Teddy's user profile for an 11 year old. The interactive media guidance application may then initialize the values of the weights corresponding to the attributes in the attributes data structure in Teddy's user profile with the default values of the weights for an 11 year old from the default attributes settings data structure. For example, the interactive media guidance application may determine, by accessing the default attributes settings data structure, that the default values of weights corresponding to the attributes animation, science fiction, Walt Disney Studios, plot x and plot y for an 11 year old are 3, 1, 3, 2, and 1 respectively. The interactive media guidance application may then set the values of the weights corresponding to the attributes animation, science fiction, Walt Disney Studios, plot x and plot y to 3, 1, 3, 2, and 1, respectively, in the attributes data structure in Teddy's user profile.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the first media asset has an associated first plurality of attributes. For example, &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> has the attributes science fiction, Walt Disney Studios and plot x. The interactive media guidance application may retrieve metadata corresponding to the first media asset by querying a database (e.g., content listings database of the content source providing media asset A located at media content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b>) for the metadata corresponding to the first media asset. The interactive media guidance application may perform the query using database management languages such as SQL, JAPQL, CODASYL or another suitable language. The interactive media guidance application may extract the first plurality of attributes from the metadata corresponding to the first media asset using a suitable metadata extraction tool.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application updates the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset by decreasing weights corresponding to the first plurality of attributes in the user profile. For example, the interactive media guidance application may, upon receiving the expression of disinterest in &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b>, decrease the weights corresponding to science fiction, Walt Disney Studios and plot x in the attributes data structure in Teddy's user profile. From the previous example, the interactive media guidance application initially set the weights corresponding to the attributes science fiction, Walt Disney Studios and plot x to 1, 3 and 2 respectively. After receiving the expression of disinterest in &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b>, the interactive media guidance application may decrease the weights corresponding to science fiction, Walt Disney Studios and plot x to 0, 2 and 1 respectively.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, an attribute of the first plurality of attributes associated with the first media asset may not be included in the user profile associated with the second user. In such an instance, the interactive media guidance application may update the user profile associated with the second user to include the attribute. For example, an attribute associated with &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>122</b> may be actor X. The interactive media guidance application may determine (e.g., by using a Boolean query function) that the attribute actor X is not included in the attributes data structure in Teddy's user profile. The interactive media guidance application may then the update the attributes data structure in Teddy's user profile to include the attribute actor X.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application determines whether number of expressions of disinterest received during a period of time exceeds a threshold number of expressions of disinterest during the period of time. The period of time (e.g., one hour) and the threshold number of expressions of disinterest (e.g., five expressions of disinterest) may be some default value or provided by the first user. The interactive media guidance application may access a data structure (e.g., threshold parameters data structure stored locally in storage <b>508</b> or remotely in media content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b>) associated with the user profile associated with the second user or a separate data structure to determine the values corresponding to the period of time and the threshold the number of expressions of disinterest. For example, the interactive media guidance application may maintain a counter of the number of expressions of disinterest received during the period of time. The interactive media guidance application may continuously update the value of the counter based on the current time and receiving an expression of disinterest in a media asset. Each time the interactive media guidance application receives an expression of disinterest, the interactive media guidance application may compare the updated value of the counter with the threshold number of expressions of disinterest during the period of time to determine if the value of the counter exceeds the threshold number of expressions of disinterest. For example, the interactive media guidance application may use a Boolean comparison function (e.g., &#x201c;counter &#x3e;threshold number&#x201d; Boolean comparison function) to perform this determination.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application may, in response to determining that the number of expressions of disinterest received during a period of time does not exceed the threshold number, update the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset.

In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application, upon receiving the selection of the subset of media assets for the second user for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded, store the media assets identifiers corresponding to the subset of media assets in a data structure (e.g., &#x201c;disregard list&#x201d; stored locally in storage <b>508</b> or remotely in media content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b>). For example, the interactive media guidance application may store the media asset identifier for &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>204</b> in the &#x201c;disregard list&#x201d; data structure.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application updating the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset further comprises the interactive media guidance application determining whether the first media asset is included in the subset of media assets for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded. For example, the interactive media guidance application, upon receiving the expression of disinterest in the first media asset from the second user, may use a Boolean comparison function to compare the media asset identifier of the first media asset with the media asset identifiers stored in the &#x201c;disregard list&#x201d; data structure. The interactive media guidance application may determine that the first media asset is included in the subset of media assets for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded if the Boolean comparison function returns a &#x201c;true&#x201d; result. The interactive media guidance application may determine that the first media asset is not included in the subset of media assets for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded if the Boolean comparison function returns a &#x201c;false&#x201d; result.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application, in response to determining that the first media asset is included in the subset of media assets for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded, makes no changes to the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset. For example, the interactive media guidance application receives an expression of disinterest in the &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>204</b> from the Teddy and the interactive media guidance application determines that &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>204</b> is included in the &#x201c;disregard list&#x201d; data structure. In this instance, the interactive media guidance application makes no changes to Teddy's user profile based on the expression of disinterest in &#x201c;Media asset A&#x201d; <b>204</b>. In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application, in response to determining that the first media asset is not included in the subset of media assets for which the expression of disinterest from the second user is to be disregarded, updates the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the first media asset. For example, the interactive media guidance application receives an expression of disinterest in the &#x201c;Media asset B&#x201d; <b>210</b> from Teddy, and the interactive media guidance application determines that &#x201c;Media asset B&#x201d; <b>210</b> is not included in the &#x201c;disregard list&#x201d; data structure. In this instance, the interactive media guidance application updates Teddy's user profile based on the expression of disinterest in media asset B. Techniques by which the interactive media guidance application may update Teddy's user profile based on the expression of disinterest in &#x201c;Media asset B&#x201d; <b>210</b> discussed previously are applicable here.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receives, from the first user, an expression of disinterest in the recommendation for the second media asset. For example, the interactive media guidance application may receive an expression of disinterest in &#x201c;Media asset M&#x201d; <b>228</b> from Mom upon receiving a selection of the &#x201c;Remove from playlist&#x201d; <b>232</b> option via user input interface <b>510</b>. In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application, in response to receiving the expression of disinterest in the recommendation for the second media asset, updates the user profile associated with the second user based on the expression of disinterest in the recommendation. For example, the interactive media guidance application may update Teddy's user profile based on the request from Mom to remove &#x201c;Media asset M&#x201d; <b>232</b> from the recommendations. Techniques by which the interactive media guidance application may update the user profile associated with the second user based discussed previously are applicable here. The interactive media guidance application may determine a recommendation for a third media asset for inclusion in the playlist for the second user based on the updated user profile associated with the second user. Manner in which the interactive media guidance application performs this determination discussed previously are applicable here. The interactive media guidance application may generate for display, for the first user, the recommendation for the third media asset. Display <b>234</b> is an example of display that the interactive media guidance application may generate for recommending the third media asset. For example, upon determining that media asset X should be recommended for inclusion the playlist for Teddy, the interactive media guidance application may include media asset identifier &#x201c;Media asset X&#x201d; <b>236</b> along with selectable options &#x201c;Add to playlist&#x201d; <b>238</b> and &#x201c;Remove from Recommendations&#x201d; <b>240</b> in display <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The amount of content available to users in any given content delivery system can be substantial.

Circuitry <b>504</b> may also include digital-to-analog converter circuitry and analog-to-digital converter circuitry for converting between digital and analog signals. The tuning and encoding circuitry may be used by the user equipment device to receive and to display, to play, or to record content. The tuning and encoding circuitry may also be used to receive guidance data. The circuitry described herein, including for example, the tuning, video generating, encoding, decoding, encrypting, decrypting, scaler, and analog/digital circuitry, may be implemented using software running on one or more general purpose or specialized processors. Multiple tuners may be provided to handle simultaneous tuning functions (e.g., watch and record functions, picture-in-picture (PIP) functions, multiple-tuner recording, etc.). If storage <b>508</b> is provided as a separate device from user equipment <b>500</b>, the tuning and encoding circuitry (including multiple tuners) may be associated with storage <b>508</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">A user may send instructions to control circuitry <b>504</b> using user input interface <b>510</b>. User input interface <b>510</b> may be any suitable user interface, such as a remote control, mouse, trackball, keypad, keyboard, touch screen, touchpad, stylus input, joystick, voice recognition interface, or other user input interfaces. Display <b>512</b> may be provided as a stand-alone device or integrated with other elements of user equipment device <b>500</b>. For example, display <b>512</b> may be a touchscreen or touch-sensitive display. In such circumstances, user input interface <b>510</b> may be integrated with or combined with display <b>512</b>. Display <b>512</b> may be one or more of a monitor, a television, a liquid crystal display (LCD) for a mobile device, amorphous silicon display, low temperature poly silicon display, electronic ink display, electrophoretic display, active matrix display, electro-wetting display, electrofluidic display, cathode ray tube display, light-emitting diode display, electroluminescent display, plasma display panel, high-performance addressing display, thin-film transistor display, organic light-emitting diode display, surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED), laser television, carbon nanotubes, quantum dot display, interferometric modulator display, or any other suitable equipment for displaying visual images. In some embodiments, display <b>512</b> may be HDTV-capable. In some embodiments, display <b>512</b> may be a 3D display, and the interactive media guidance application and any suitable content may be displayed in 3D. A video card or graphics card may generate the output to the display <b>512</b>. The video card may offer various functions such as accelerated rendering of 3D scenes and 2D graphics, MPEG-2/MPEG-4 decoding, TV output, or the ability to connect multiple monitors. The video card may be any processing circuitry described above in relation to control circuitry <b>504</b>. The video card may be integrated with the control circuitry <b>504</b>. Speakers <b>514</b> may be provided as integrated with other elements of user equipment device <b>500</b> or may be stand-alone units. The audio component of videos and other content displayed on display <b>512</b> may be played through speakers <b>514</b>. In some embodiments, the audio may be distributed to a receiver (not shown), which processes and outputs the audio via speakers <b>514</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The guidance application may be implemented using any suitable architecture. For example, it may be a stand-alone application wholly-implemented on user equipment device <b>500</b>. In such an approach, instructions of the application are stored locally (e.g., in storage <b>508</b>), and data for use by the application is downloaded on a periodic basis (e.g., from an out-of-band feed, from an Internet resource, or using another suitable approach). Control circuitry <b>504</b> may retrieve instructions of the application from storage <b>508</b> and process the instructions to generate any of the displays discussed herein. Based on the processed instructions, control circuitry <b>504</b> may determine what action to perform when input is received from input interface <b>510</b>. For example, movement of a cursor on a display up/down may be indicated by the processed instructions when input interface <b>510</b> indicates that an up/down button was selected.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is a client-server based application. Data for use by a thick or thin client implemented on user equipment device <b>500</b> is retrieved on-demand by issuing requests to a server remote to the user equipment device <b>500</b>. In one example of a client-server based guidance application, control circuitry <b>504</b> runs a web browser that interprets web pages provided by a remote server. For example, the remote server may store the instructions for the application in a storage device. The remote server may process the stored instructions using circuitry (e.g., control circuitry <b>504</b>) and generate the displays discussed above and below. The client device may receive the displays generated by the remote server and may display the content of the displays locally on equipment device <b>500</b>. This way, the processing of the instructions is performed remotely by the server while the resulting displays are provided locally on equipment device <b>500</b>. Equipment device <b>500</b> may receive inputs from the user via input interface <b>510</b> and transmit those inputs to the remote server for processing and generating the corresponding displays. For example, equipment device <b>500</b> may transmit a communication to the remote server indicating that an up/down button was selected via input interface <b>510</b>. The remote server may process instructions in accordance with that input and generate a display of the application corresponding to the input (e.g., a display that moves a cursor up/down). The generated display is then transmitted to equipment device <b>500</b> for presentation to the user.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is downloaded and interpreted or otherwise run by an interpreter or virtual machine (run by control circuitry <b>504</b>). In some embodiments, the guidance application may be encoded in the ETV Binary Interchange Format (EBIF), received by control circuitry <b>504</b> as part of a suitable feed, and interpreted by a user agent running on control circuitry <b>504</b>. For example, the guidance application may be an EBIF application. In some embodiments, the guidance application may be defined by a series of JAVA-based files that are received and run by a local virtual machine or other suitable middleware executed by control circuitry <b>504</b>. In some of such embodiments (e.g., those employing MPEG-2 or other digital media encoding schemes), the guidance application may be, for example, encoded and transmitted in an MPEG-2 object carousel with the MPEG audio and video packets of a program.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">User equipment device <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> can be implemented in system <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> as user television equipment <b>602</b>, user computer equipment <b>604</b>, wireless user communications device <b>606</b>, or any other type of user equipment suitable for accessing content, such as a non-portable gaming machine. For simplicity, these devices may be referred to herein collectively as user equipment or user equipment devices, and may be substantially similar to user equipment devices described above. User equipment devices, on which a media guidance application may be implemented, may function as a standalone device or may be part of a network of devices. Various network configurations of devices may be implemented and are discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">A user equipment device utilizing at least some of the system features described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may not be classified solely as user television equipment <b>602</b>, user computer equipment <b>604</b>, or a wireless user communications device <b>606</b>. For example, user television equipment <b>602</b> may, like some user computer equipment <b>604</b>, be Internet-enabled allowing for access to Internet content, while user computer equipment <b>604</b> may, like some user television equipment <b>602</b>, include a tuner allowing for access to television programming. The media guidance application may have the same layout on various different types of user equipment or may be tailored to the display capabilities of the user equipment. For example, on user computer equipment <b>604</b>, the guidance application may be provided as a web site accessed by a web browser. In another example, the guidance application may be scaled down for wireless user communications devices <b>606</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In system <b>600</b>, there is typically more than one of each type of user equipment device but only one of each is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. In addition, each user may utilize more than one type of user equipment device and also more than one of each type of user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some embodiments, a user equipment device (e.g., user television equipment <b>602</b>, user computer equipment <b>604</b>, wireless user communications device <b>606</b>) may be referred to as a &#x201c;second screen device.&#x201d; For example, a second screen device may supplement content presented on a first user equipment device. The content presented on the second screen device may be any suitable content that supplements the content presented on the first device. In some embodiments, the second screen device provides an interface for adjusting settings and display preferences of the first device. In some embodiments, the second screen device is configured for interacting with other second screen devices or for interacting with a social network. The second screen device can be located in the same room as the first device, a different room from the first device but in the same house or building, or in a different building from the first device.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The user may also set various settings to maintain consistent media guidance application settings across in-home devices and remote devices. Settings include those described herein, as well as channel and program favorites, programming preferences that the guidance application utilizes to make programming recommendations, display preferences, and other desirable guidance settings. For example, if a user sets a channel as a favorite on, for example, the web site www.allrovi.com on their personal computer at their office, the same channel would appear as a favorite on the user's in-home devices (e.g., user television equipment and user computer equipment) as well as the user's mobile devices, if desired. Therefore, changes made on one user equipment device can change the guidance experience on another user equipment device, regardless of whether they are the same or a different type of user equipment device. In addition, the changes made may be based on settings input by a user, as well as user activity monitored by the guidance application.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The user equipment devices may be coupled to communications network <b>614</b>. Namely, user television equipment <b>602</b>, user computer equipment <b>604</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>606</b> are coupled to communications network <b>614</b> via communications paths <b>608</b>, <b>610</b>, and <b>612</b>, respectively. Communications network <b>614</b> may be one or more networks including the Internet, a mobile phone network, mobile voice or data network (e.g., a 4G or LTE network), cable network, public switched telephone network, or other types of communications network or combinations of communications networks. Paths <b>608</b>, <b>610</b>, and <b>612</b> may separately or together include one or more communications paths, such as, a satellite path, a fiber-optic path, a cable path, a path that supports Internet communications (e.g., IPTV), free-space connections (e.g., for broadcast or other wireless signals), or any other suitable wired or wireless communications path or combination of such paths. Path <b>612</b> is drawn with dotted lines to indicate that in the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> it is a wireless path and paths <b>608</b> and <b>610</b> are drawn as solid lines to indicate they are wired paths (although these paths may be wireless paths, if desired). Communications with the user equipment devices may be provided by one or more of these communications paths, but are shown as a single path in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Although communications paths are not drawn between user equipment devices, these devices may communicate directly with each other via communication paths, such as those described above in connection with paths <b>608</b>, <b>610</b>, and <b>612</b>, as well as other short-range point-to-point communication paths, such as USB cables, IEEE 1394 cables, wireless paths (e.g., Bluetooth, infrared, IEEE 802-11x, etc.), or other short-range communication via wired or wireless paths. BLUETOOTH is a certification mark owned by Bluetooth SIG, INC. The user equipment devices may also communicate with each other directly through an indirect path via communications network <b>614</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">System <b>600</b> includes content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b> coupled to communications network <b>614</b> via communication paths <b>620</b> and <b>622</b>, respectively. Paths <b>620</b> and <b>622</b> may include any of the communication paths described above in connection with paths <b>608</b>, <b>610</b>, and <b>612</b>. Communications with the content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b> may be exchanged over one or more communications paths, but are shown as a single path in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. In addition, there may be more than one of each of content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b>, but only one of each is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. (The different types of each of these sources are discussed below.) If desired, content source <b>616</b> and media guidance data source <b>618</b> may be integrated as one source device. Although communications between sources <b>616</b> and <b>618</b> with user equipment devices <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, and <b>606</b> are shown as through communications network <b>614</b>, in some embodiments, sources <b>616</b> and <b>618</b> may communicate directly with user equipment devices <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, and <b>606</b> via communication paths (not shown) such as those described above in connection with paths <b>608</b>, <b>610</b>, and <b>612</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Content source <b>616</b> may include one or more types of content distribution equipment including a television distribution facility, cable system headend, satellite distribution facility, programming sources (e.g., television broadcasters, such as NBC, ABC, HBO, etc.), intermediate distribution facilities and/or servers, Internet providers, on-demand media servers, and other content providers. NBC is a trademark owned by the National Broadcasting Company, Inc., ABC is a trademark owned by the American Broadcasting Company, Inc., and HBO is a trademark owned by the Home Box Office, Inc. Content source <b>616</b> may be the originator of content (e.g., a television broadcaster, a Webcast provider, etc.) or may not be the originator of content (e.g., an on-demand content provider, an Internet provider of content of broadcast programs for downloading, etc.). Content source <b>616</b> may include cable sources, satellite providers, on-demand providers, Internet providers, over-the-top content providers, or other providers of content. Content source <b>616</b> may also include a remote media server used to store different types of content (including video content selected by a user), in a location remote from any of the user equipment devices. Systems and methods for remote storage of content, and providing remotely stored content to user equipment are discussed in greater detail in connection with Ellis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,761,892, issued Jul. 20, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Media guidance data source <b>618</b> may provide media guidance data, such as the media guidance data described above. Media guidance data may be provided to the user equipment devices using any suitable approach. In some embodiments, the guidance application may be a stand-alone interactive television program guide that receives program guide data via a data feed (e.g., a continuous feed or trickle feed). Program schedule data and other guidance data may be provided to the user equipment on a television channel sideband, using an in-band digital signal, using an out-of-band digital signal, or by any other suitable data transmission technique. Program schedule data and other media guidance data may be provided to user equipment on multiple analog or digital television channels.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, guidance data from media guidance data source <b>618</b> may be provided to users' equipment using a client-server approach. For example, a user equipment device may pull media guidance data from a server, or a server may push media guidance data to a user equipment device. In some embodiments, a guidance application client residing on the user's equipment may initiate sessions with source <b>618</b> to obtain guidance data when needed, e.g., when the guidance data is out of date or when the user equipment device receives a request from the user to receive data. Media guidance may be provided to the user equipment with any suitable frequency (e.g., continuously, daily, a user-specified period of time, a system-specified period of time, in response to a request from user equipment, etc.). Media guidance data source <b>618</b> may provide user equipment devices <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, and <b>606</b> the media guidance application itself or software updates for the media guidance application.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some embodiments, the media guidance data may include viewer data. For example, the viewer data may include current and/or historical user activity information (e.g., what content the user typically watches, what times of day the user watches content, whether the user interacts with a social network, at what times the user interacts with a social network to post information, what types of content the user typically watches (e.g., pay TV or free TV), mood, brain activity information, etc.). The media guidance data may also include subscription data. For example, the subscription data may identify to which sources or services a given user subscribes and/or to which sources or services the given user has previously subscribed but later terminated access (e.g., whether the user subscribes to premium channels, whether the user has added a premium level of services, whether the user has increased Internet speed). In some embodiments, the viewer data and/or the subscription data may identify patterns of a given user for a period of more than one year. The media guidance data may include a model (e.g., a survivor model) used for generating a score that indicates a likelihood a given user will terminate access to a service/source. For example, the media guidance application may process the viewer data with the subscription data using the model to generate a value or score that indicates a likelihood of whether the given user will terminate access to a particular service or source. In particular, a higher score may indicate a higher level of confidence that the user will terminate access to a particular service or source. Based on the score, the media guidance application may generate promotions and advertisements that entice the user to keep the particular service or source indicated by the score as one to which the user will likely terminate access.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Media guidance applications may be, for example, stand-alone applications implemented on user equipment devices. For example, the media guidance application may be implemented as software or a set of executable instructions which may be stored in storage <b>508</b>, and executed by control circuitry <b>504</b> of a user equipment device <b>500</b>. In some embodiments, media guidance applications may be client-server applications where only a client application resides on the user equipment device, and server application resides on a remote server. For example, media guidance applications may be implemented partially as a client application on control circuitry <b>504</b> of user equipment device <b>500</b> and partially on a remote server as a server application (e.g., media guidance data source <b>618</b>) running on control circuitry of the remote server. When executed by control circuitry of the remote server (such as media guidance data source <b>618</b>), the media guidance application may instruct the control circuitry to generate the guidance application displays and transmit the generated displays to the user equipment devices. The server application may instruct the control circuitry of the media guidance data source <b>618</b> to transmit data for storage on the user equipment. The client application may instruct control circuitry of the receiving user equipment to generate the guidance application displays.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Content and/or media guidance data delivered to user equipment devices <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, and <b>606</b> may be over-the-top (OTT) content. OTT content delivery allows Internet-enabled user devices, including any user equipment device described above, to receive content that is transferred over the Internet, including any content described above, in addition to content received over cable or satellite connections. OTT content is delivered via an Internet connection provided by an Internet service provider (ISP), but a third party distributes the content. The ISP may not be responsible for the viewing abilities, copyrights, or redistribution of the content, and may only transfer IP packets provided by the OTT content provider. Examples of OTT content providers include YOUTUBE, NETFLIX, and HULU, which provide audio and video via IP packets. Youtube is a trademark owned by Google Inc., Netflix is a trademark owned by Netflix Inc., and Hulu is a trademark owned by Hulu, LLC. OTT content providers may additionally or alternatively provide media guidance data described above. In addition to content and/or media guidance data, providers of OTT content can distribute media guidance applications (e.g., web-based applications or cloud-based applications), or the content can be displayed by media guidance applications stored on the user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Media guidance system <b>600</b> is intended to illustrate a number of approaches, or network configurations, by which user equipment devices and sources of content and guidance data may communicate with each other for the purpose of accessing content and providing media guidance. The embodiments described herein may be applied in any one or a subset of these approaches, or in a system employing other approaches for delivering content and providing media guidance. The following four approaches provide specific illustrations of the generalized example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In one approach, user equipment devices may communicate with each other within a home network. User equipment devices can communicate with each other directly via short-range point-to-point communication schemes described above, via indirect paths through a hub or other similar device provided on a home network, or via communications network <b>614</b>. Each of the multiple individuals in a single home may operate different user equipment devices on the home network. As a result, it may be desirable for various media guidance information or settings to be communicated between the different user equipment devices. For example, it may be desirable for users to maintain consistent media guidance application settings on different user equipment devices within a home network, as described in greater detail in Ellis et al., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0251827, filed Jul. 11, 2005. Different types of user equipment devices in a home network may also communicate with each other to transmit content. For example, a user may transmit content from user computer equipment to a portable video player or portable music player.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In a second approach, users may have multiple types of user equipment by which they access content and obtain media guidance. For example, some users may have home networks that are accessed by in-home and mobile devices. Users may control in-home devices via a media guidance application implemented on a remote device. For example, users may access an online media guidance application on a website via a personal computer at their office, or a mobile device such as a PDA or web-enabled mobile telephone. The user may set various settings (e.g., recordings, reminders, or other settings) on the online guidance application to control the user's in-home equipment. The online guide may control the user's equipment directly, or by communicating with a media guidance application on the user's in-home equipment. Various systems and methods for user equipment devices communicating, where the user equipment devices are in locations remote from each other, is discussed in, for example, Ellis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,046,801, issued Oct. 25, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In a third approach, users of user equipment devices inside and outside a home can use their media guidance application to communicate directly with content source <b>616</b> to access content. Specifically, within a home, users of user television equipment <b>602</b> and user computer equipment <b>604</b> may access the media guidance application to navigate among and locate desirable content. Users may also access the media guidance application outside of the home using wireless user communications devices <b>606</b> to navigate among and locate desirable content.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In a fourth approach, user equipment devices may operate in a cloud computing environment to access cloud services. In a cloud computing environment, various types of computing services for content sharing, storage or distribution (e.g., video sharing sites or social networking sites) are provided by a collection of network-accessible computing and storage resources, referred to as &#x201c;the cloud.&#x201d; For example, the cloud can include a collection of server computing devices, which may be located centrally or at distributed locations, that provide cloud-based services to various types of users and devices connected via a network such as the Internet via communications network <b>614</b>. These cloud resources may include one or more content sources <b>616</b> and one or more media guidance data sources <b>618</b>. In addition or in the alternative, the remote computing sites may include other user equipment devices, such as user television equipment <b>602</b>, user computer equipment <b>604</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>606</b>. For example, the other user equipment devices may provide access to a stored copy of a video or a streamed video. In such embodiments, user equipment devices may operate in a peer-to-peer manner without communicating with a central server.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The cloud provides access to services, such as content storage, content sharing, or social networking services, among other examples, as well as access to any content described above, for user equipment devices. Services can be provided in the cloud through cloud computing service providers, or through other providers of online services. For example, the cloud-based services can include a content storage service, a content sharing site, a social networking site, or other services via which user-sourced content is distributed for viewing by others on connected devices. These cloud-based services may allow a user equipment device to store content to the cloud and to receive content from the cloud rather than storing content locally and accessing locally-stored content.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">A user may use various content capture devices, such as camcorders, digital cameras with video mode, audio recorders, mobile phones, and handheld computing devices, to record content. The user can upload content to a content storage service on the cloud either directly, for example, from user computer equipment <b>604</b> or wireless user communications device <b>606</b> having content capture feature. Alternatively, the user can first transfer the content to a user equipment device, such as user computer equipment <b>604</b>. The user equipment device storing the content uploads the content to the cloud using a data transmission service on communications network <b>614</b>. In some embodiments, the user equipment device itself is a cloud resource, and other user equipment devices can access the content directly from the user equipment device on which the user stored the content.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Cloud resources may be accessed by a user equipment device using, for example, a web browser, a media guidance application, a desktop application, a mobile application, and/or any combination of access applications of the same. The user equipment device may be a cloud client that relies on cloud computing for application delivery, or the user equipment device may have some functionality without access to cloud resources. For example, some applications running on the user equipment device may be cloud applications, i.e., applications delivered as a service over the Internet, while other applications may be stored and run on the user equipment device. In some embodiments, a user device may receive content from multiple cloud resources simultaneously. For example, a user device can stream audio from one cloud resource while downloading content from a second cloud resource. Or a user device can download content from multiple cloud resources for more efficient downloading. In some embodiments, user equipment devices can use cloud resources for processing operations such as the processing operations performed by processing circuitry described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">As referred herein, the term &#x201c;in response to&#x201d; refers to initiated as a result of.

For example, process <b>700</b> may be executed by control circuitry <b>504</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) as instructed by the interactive media guidance application implemented on user equipment <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, and/or <b>606</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). In addition, one or more steps of process <b>700</b> may be incorporated into or combined with one or more steps of any other process or embodiment.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Process <b>700</b> begins at <b>702</b>, where control circuitry <b>504</b> receives, from the first user, a selection of a plurality of media assets to be included in the playlist for the second user.
