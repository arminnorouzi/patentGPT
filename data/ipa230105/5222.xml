redundant tracking system comprising multiple redundant tracking sub-systems, enabling seamless transitions between such tracking sub-systems, provides a solution to this problem by merging multiple tracking approaches into a single tracking system. This system is able to combine tracking objects with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) and 3DoF through combining and transitioning between multiple tracking systems based on the availability of tracking indicia tracked by the tracking systems. Thus, as the indicia tracked by any one tracking system becomes unavailable, the redundant tracking system seamlessly switches between tracking in 6DoF and 3DoF thereby providing the user with an uninterrupted experience.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="203.62mm" wi="144.95mm" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="214.21mm" wi="146.64mm" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="229.28mm" wi="153.92mm" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="206.42mm" wi="144.70mm" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="215.82mm" wi="149.27mm" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="223.94mm" wi="148.67mm" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="227.75mm" wi="136.91mm" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="183.30mm" wi="154.60mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="227.41mm" wi="144.53mm" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="227.41mm" wi="144.53mm" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="221.91mm" wi="156.80mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="178.73mm" wi="133.94mm" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="222.42mm" wi="151.30mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="225.21mm" wi="148.59mm" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="231.39mm" wi="157.82mm" file="US20230005223A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

More particularly, but not by way of limitation, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an apparatus and method for redundant DoF object tracking.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Object tracking systems can be used to create engaging and entertaining augmented reality (AR) experiences, in which 3D graphics content appears to be present in the real world. However, such tracking is subject to frequent tracking failure due to environmental conditions, user actions, unanticipated visual interruption between camera and object/scene being tracked, etc. Traditionally, tracking failure causes the AR experience either to disappear or otherwise behave erratically and breaks the illusion of the 3D graphics being present in the real world. This undermines the perceived quality of AR as a whole.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To easily identify the discussion of any particular element or act, the most significant digit or digits in a reference number refer to the figure number in which that element is first introduced.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing an example messaging system for exchanging data (e.g., messages and associated content) over a network in accordance with some embodiments, wherein the messaging system includes a redundant tracking system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is block diagram illustrating further details regarding a messaging system, according to example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating data which may be stored in the database of the messaging server system, according to certain example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a structure of a message, according to some embodiments, generated by a messaging client application for communication.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example access-limiting process, in terms of which access to content (e.g., an ephemeral message, and associated multimedia payload of data) or a content collection (e.g., an ephemeral message story) may be time-limited (e.g., made ephemeral) in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating various modules of a redundant tracking system, according to certain example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram depicting an object rendered within a three-dimensional space by a redundant tracking system, according to certain example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for tracking an object rendered in a three-dimensional space, according to certain example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for generating and rendering an object in a three-dimensional space, according to certain example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for tracking an object rendered in a three-dimensional space, according to certain example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a hybrid tracking matrix, according to certain example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for generating and rendering an object in a three-dimensional space, according to certain example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a representative software architecture, which may be used in conjunction with various hardware architectures herein described and used to implement various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating components of a machine, according to some example embodiments, able to read instructions from a machine-readable medium (e.g., a machine-readable storage medium) and perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">GLOSSARY</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">&#x201c;CARRIER SIGNAL&#x201d; in this context refers to any intangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding, or carrying instructions for execution by the machine, and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible medium to facilitate communication of such instructions.

In this example, the coupling may implement any of a variety of types of data transfer technology, such as Single Carrier Radio Transmission Technology (1&#xd7;RTT), Evolution-Data Optimized (EVDO) technology, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology, Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology, third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) including 3G, fourth generation wireless (4G) networks, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard, others defined by various standard setting organizations, other long range protocols, or other data transfer technology.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">&#x201c;EMPHEMERAL MESSAGE&#x201d; in this context refers to a message that is accessible for a time-limited duration. An ephemeral message may be a text, an image, a video and the like. The access time for the ephemeral message may be set by the message sender. Alternatively, the access time may be a default setting or a setting specified by the recipient. Regardless of the setting technique, the message is transitory.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">&#x201c;MACHINE-READABLE MEDIUM&#x201d; in this context refers to a component, device or other tangible media able to store instructions and data temporarily or permanently and may include, but is not be limited to, random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), buffer memory, flash memory, optical media, magnetic media, cache memory, other types of storage (e.g., Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM)) and/or any suitable combination thereof. The term &#x201c;machine-readable medium&#x201d; should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, or associated caches and servers) able to store instructions. The term &#x201c;machine-readable medium&#x201d; shall also be taken to include any medium, or combination of multiple media, that is capable of storing instructions (e.g., code) for execution by a machine, such that the instructions, when executed by one or more processors of the machine, cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies described herein. Accordingly, a &#x201c;machine-readable medium&#x201d; refers to a single storage apparatus or device, as well as &#x201c;cloud-based&#x201d; storage systems or storage networks that include multiple storage apparatus or devices. The term &#x201c;machine-readable medium&#x201d; excludes signals per se.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">&#x201c;COMPONENT&#x201d; in this context refers to a device, physical entity or logic having boundaries defined by function or subroutine calls, branch points, application program interfaces (APIs), or other technologies that provide for the partitioning or modularization of particular processing or control functions. Components may be combined via their interfaces with other components to carry out a machine process. A component may be a packaged functional hardware unit designed for use with other components and a part of a program that usually performs a particular function of related functions. Components may constitute either software components (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium) or hardware components. A &#x201c;hardware component&#x201d; is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain physical manner. In various example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone computer system, a client computer system, or a server computer system) or one or more hardware components of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware component that operates to perform certain operations as described herein. A hardware component may also be implemented mechanically, electronically, or any suitable combination thereof. For example, a hardware component may include dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured to perform certain operations. A hardware component may be a special-purpose processor, such as a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). A hardware component may also include programmable logic or circuitry that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. For example, a hardware component may include software executed by a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor. Once configured by such software, hardware components become specific machines (or specific components of a machine) uniquely tailored to perform the configured functions and are no longer general-purpose processors. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware component mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations. Accordingly, the phrase &#x201c;hardware component&#x201d; (or &#x201c;hardware-implemented component&#x201d;) should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware components are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware components need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where a hardware component comprises a general-purpose processor configured by software to become a special-purpose processor, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respectively different special-purpose processors (e.g., comprising different hardware components) at different times. Software accordingly configures a particular processor or processors, for example, to constitute a particular hardware component at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware component at a different instance of time. Hardware components can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware components. Accordingly, the described hardware components may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple hardware components exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) between or among two or more of the hardware components. In embodiments in which multiple hardware components are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware components may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware components have access. For example, one hardware component may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware component may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware components may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information). The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented components that operate to perform one or more operations or functions described herein. As used herein, &#x201c;processor-implemented component&#x201d; refers to a hardware component implemented using one or more processors. Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented, with a particular processor or processors being an example of hardware. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented components. Moreover, the one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a &#x201c;cloud computing&#x201d; environment or as a &#x201c;software as a service&#x201d; (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), with these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., an Application Program Interface (API)). The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processors or processor-implemented components may be located in a single geographic location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or a server farm). In other example embodiments, the processors or processor-implemented components may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">&#x201c;PROCESSOR&#x201d; in this context refers to any circuit or virtual circuit (a physical circuit emulated by logic executing on an actual processor) that manipulates data values according to control signals (e.g., &#x201c;commands&#x201d;, &#x201c;op codes&#x201d;, &#x201c;machine code&#x201d;, etc.) and which produces corresponding output signals that are applied to operate a machine. A processor may, for example, be a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) processor, a Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) processor, a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), a Digital Signal Processor (DSP), an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), a Radio-Frequency Integrated Circuit (RFIC) or any combination thereof. A processor may further be a multi-core processor having two or more independent processors (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;cores&#x201d;) that may execute instructions contemporaneously.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">&#x201c;TIMESTAMP&#x201d; in this context refers to a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, for example giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Tracking systems are subject to frequent tracking failure due to environmental conditions, user actions, unanticipated visual interruption between camera and object/scene being tracked, etc. Traditionally, such tracking failures would cause a disruption in the presentation of objects in a three-dimensional space. For example, the objects may disappear or otherwise behave erratically, thereby interrupting the illusion of the object being presented within the three-dimensional space. This undermines the perceived quality of the three-dimensional experience as a whole.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Traditional tracking systems rely on a single approach (Natural Feature Tracking (NFT), Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), Gyroscopic, etc.) that each have breaking points in real world usage due to inaccurate sensor data, movement, loss or occlusion of visual marker, or dynamic interruptions to a scene. Further, each approach may have individual limitations in capability. For example, a gyroscopic tracking system can only track items with three degrees of freedom (3DoF). Further, utilization of single tracking systems provide inaccurate or unstable position estimation, due to inherent limitations of each individual system. For example, an NFT system may not provide sufficient pitch, yaw, or roll estimation due to the inaccuracies of visual tracking alone, while gyroscopic tracking systems provide inaccurate translation (up, down, left, right).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A redundant tracking system comprising multiple redundant tracking sub-systems, enabling seamless transitions between such tracking sub-systems, provides a solution to this problem by merging multiple tracking approaches into a single tracking system. This system is able to combine tracking objects with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) and 3DoF through combining and transitioning between multiple tracking systems based on the availability of tracking indicia tracked by the tracking systems. Thus, as the indicia tracked by any one tracking system becomes unavailable, the redundant tracking system seamlessly switches between tracking in 6DoF and 3DoF thereby providing the user with an uninterrupted experience. For example, in the case of visual tracking systems (e.g., NFT, SLAM), tracking indicia typically analyzed to determine orientation may be replaced with gyroscopic tracking indicia from a gyroscopic tracking system. This would thereby enable transitioning between tracking in 6Dof and 3DoF based on the availability of tracking indicia.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some example embodiments, to transition between tracking in 6DoF and 3DoF, the redundant tracking system gathers and stores tracking indicia within a tracking matrix that includes translation indicia (e.g., up, down, left, right) and rotation indicia (e.g., pitch, yaw, roll). The translation indicia gathered by an NFT system may thereby be extracted from the tracking matrix and utilized when future translation indicia gathered by the NFT system become inaccurate or unavailable. In the meantime, the rotation indicia is continued to be provided by the gyroscope. In this way, when the mobile device loses tracking indicia, the tracked objects that are presented in the three-dimensional space will not be changed abruptly at the frame when the tracking indicia are lost. Subsequently, when the target tracking object reappears in the screen, thus a new translate T<sub>1 </sub>is obtained, the translation part of the view matrix will then be taking advantage of the new translation T<sub>1</sub>, and use T<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>0 </sub>as the translation of the view matrix.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The redundant tracking system is configured to render and display an object at a position in a three-dimensional space. For example, the redundant tracking system may maintain a set of templates to generate objects to be displayed in the three-dimensional space. Upon receiving a selection of a template from among the set of templates, and a selection of a position in the three-dimensional space, the redundant tracking system generates and assigns the object to the position within the three-dimensional space.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The redundant tracking system may thereby track the position of the object relative to a user device in the three-dimensional space by one or more tracking system, in 6DoF. For example, the one or more tracking systems of the redundant tracking system may collect and analyze a set of tracking indicia (e.g., roll, pitch, yaw, natural features and elements detected within the presentation of a space, etc.) in order to track the position of the object relative to the user device in the three-dimensional space with 6DoF. In such embodiments, the redundant tracking system may transition between tracking systems based on the availability of the tracked indicia to maintain consistent tracking in 6DoF.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Upon detecting an interruption of one or more indicia from among the set of indicia tracked, such that tracking in 6DoF becomes unreliable or impossible, the redundant tracking system transitions to tracking the object in the three-dimensional space in 3DoF in order to prevent an interruption of the display. For example, the redundant tracking system may transition from a first tracking system (or first set of tracking systems among the set of tracking systems) to a second tracking system among the set of tracking systems (or second set of tracking systems), wherein the second tracking system is capable of tracking the object with 3DoF in the three-dimensional space, based on the tracking indicia available.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some example embodiments, the set of tracking systems of the redundant tracking system include a gyroscopic tracking system, an NFT system, as well as a SLAM tracking system. Each tracking system among the set of tracking system may analyze tracking indicia in order to track a position of an object within a three-dimensional space. For example, to track an object with 6DoF, the redundant tracking system may require at least six tracking indicia to be available. As tracking indicia become obstructed or unavailable for various reasons, the redundant tracking system may transition between the available tracking systems among the set of tracking systems in order to maintain 6DoF, or transition to 3DoF if necessary.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing an example messaging system <b>100</b> for exchanging data (e.g., messages and associated content) over a network.

In such cases, the curation interface <b>208</b> operates to automatically make payments to such users for the use of their content.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The annotation system <b>206</b> provides various functions that enable a user to annotate or otherwise modify or edit media content associated with a message. For example, the annotation system <b>206</b> provides functions related to the generation and publishing of media overlays for messages processed by the messaging system <b>100</b>. The annotation system <b>206</b> operatively supplies a media overlay (e.g., a SNAPCHAT filter) to the messaging client application <b>104</b> based on a geolocation of the client device <b>102</b>. In another example, the annotation system <b>206</b> operatively supplies a media overlay to the messaging client application <b>104</b> based on other information, such as, social network information of the user of the client device <b>102</b>. A media overlay may include audio and visual content and visual effects. Examples of audio and visual content include pictures, texts, logos, animations, and sound effects. An example of a visual effect includes color overlaying. The audio and visual content or the visual effects can be applied to a media content item (e.g., a photo) at the client device <b>102</b>. For example, the media overlay including text that can be overlaid on top of a photograph generated taken by the client device <b>102</b>. In another example, the media overlay includes an identification of a location overlay (e.g., Venice beach), a name of a live event, or a name of a merchant overlay (e.g., Beach Coffee House). In another example, the annotation system <b>206</b> uses the geolocation of the client device <b>102</b> to identify a media overlay that includes the name of a merchant at the geolocation of the client device <b>102</b>. The media overlay may include other indicia associated with the merchant. The media overlays may be stored in the database <b>120</b> and accessed through the database server <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one example embodiment, the annotation system <b>206</b> provides a user-based publication platform that enables users to select a geolocation on a map, and upload content associated with the selected geolocation.

Filters for which data is stored within the annotation table <b>312</b> are associated with and applied to videos (for which data is stored in a video table <b>310</b>) and/or images (for which data is stored in an image table <b>308</b>). Filters, in one example, are overlays that are displayed as overlaid on an image or video during presentation to a recipient user. Filters may be of varies types, including a user-selected filters from a gallery of filters presented to a sending user by the messaging client application <b>104</b> when the sending user is composing a message. Other types of filers include geolocation filters (also known as geo-filters) which may be presented to a sending user based on geographic location. For example, geolocation filters specific to a neighborhood or special location may be presented within a user interface by the messaging client application <b>104</b>, based on geolocation information determined by a GPS unit of the client device <b>102</b>. Another type of filer is a data filer, which may be selectively presented to a sending user by the messaging client application <b>104</b>, based on other inputs or information gathered by the client device <b>102</b> during the message creation process. Example of data filters include current temperature at a specific location, a current speed at which a sending user is traveling, battery life for a client device <b>102</b> or the current time.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Other annotation data that may be stored within the image table <b>308</b> is so-called &#x201c;lens&#x201d; data.

Similarly, the image table <b>308</b> stores image data associated with messages for which message data is stored in the entity table <b>302</b>. The entity table <b>302</b> may associate various annotations from the annotation table <b>312</b> with various images and videos stored in the image table <b>308</b> and the video table <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A story table <b>306</b> stores data regarding collections of messages and associated image, video or audio data, which are compiled into a collection (e.g., a SNAPCHAT story or a gallery). The creation of a particular collection may be initiated by a particular user (e.g., each user for which a record is maintained in the entity table <b>302</b>) A user may create a &#x201c;personal story&#x201d; in the form of a collection of content that has been created and sent/broadcast by that user. To this end, the user interface of the messaging client application <b>104</b> may include an icon that is user selectable to enable a sending user to add specific content to his or her personal story.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A collection may also constitute a &#x201c;live story,&#x201d; which is a collection of content from multiple users that is created manually, automatically or using a combination of manual and automatic techniques. For example, a &#x201c;live story&#x201d; may constitute a curated stream of user-submitted content from varies locations and events. Users, whose client devices have location services enabled and are at a common location event at a particular time may, for example, be presented with an option, via a user interface of the messaging client application <b>104</b>, to contribute content to a particular live story.

In this case, a new ephemeral message <b>502</b>, added to the ephemeral message story <b>504</b>, with a new story participation parameter <b>510</b>, effectively extends the life of an ephemeral message story <b>504</b> to equal the value of the story participation parameter <b>510</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0084">Responsive to the ephemeral timer system <b>202</b> determining that an ephemeral message story <b>504</b> has expired (e.g., is no longer accessible), the ephemeral timer system <b>202</b> communicates with the messaging system <b>100</b> (and, for example, specifically the messaging client application <b>104</b> to cause an indicium (e.g., an icon) associated with the relevant ephemeral message story <b>504</b> to no longer be displayed within a user interface of the messaging client application <b>104</b>.

Should any one or more of the tracking indicia tracked by the first tracking sub-system <b>604</b>A become obstructed or unavailable, the tracking of the object in the three-dimensional space would become disrupted.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0093">At operation <b>808</b>, in response to the disruption detection module <b>606</b> detecting a disruption of one or more tracking indicia, the tracking module <b>604</b> transitions to one or more other tracking sub-systems (e.g., the second tracking sub-system <b>604</b>B and/or the third tracking sub-system <b>604</b>C) to maintain tracking of the object relative to the client device <b>102</b> in the three-dimensional space. In doing so, the redundant tracking system <b>124</b> may transition from 6DoF to 3DoF, wherein 3DoF measures pitch, roll, and yaw, but does not measure translations. As the tracking indicia again become available, the redundant tracking system <b>124</b> may thereby transition from 3DoF back to 6DoF. For example, when the NFT system becomes unavailable, the tracking module <b>604</b> may utilize the last tracking indicia gathered and tracked by the NFT system throughout the subsequent 3DoF experience.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating operations of the redundant tracking system <b>124</b> in performing a method <b>900</b> for generating and presenting an object at a position relative to the client device <b>102</b> in a three-dimensional space, according to certain example embodiments.
