In this context, the fifth wheel hitches involve universal products that are typically operated by untrained operators, and may be configured to connect trailers to pickup trucks for a load range of about 7,000 lbs. up to about 32,000 lbs. or even more. Current fifth wheel hitches give limited to no feedback to the operator. Operators have to rely on visual feedback to determine the state of the coupling, which offers certain challenges.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These types of connections are prone to giving secondary load feedback through the towing vehicle occupants either in single, repeatable or oscillatory manner. Over the years, various products have been developed to resolve the issue. These, however, resulted in either trading noise for comfort or further customer dissatisfaction factors. Current fifth wheel hitches are limited in their flexibility. If the customers buy a new or different towing vehicle, there may not be an option to transfer the fifth wheel to the different towing vehicle unless the mounting system is identical. The proliferation of non-standard under bed structures means that these parts are becoming more and more application specific.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of these shortcomings, there is a need for an improved fifth wheel hitch to overcome the afore-mentioned shortcomings.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure contemplates a fifth wheel hitch with improved comfort and ease of use for its operator.

The kingpin receiving assembly <b>100</b> may comprises a pivot bushing assembly <b>102</b> (preferably, the kingpin receiving assembly <b>100</b> includes a pair of pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the kingpin receiving assembly <b>100</b> may include a top plate <b>110</b> carried on a first frame member <b>120</b>, and a second frame member <b>130</b>. The top plate <b>110</b> may be a landing/skid plate configured to receive and connect the fifth wheel head. The first frame member <b>120</b> may be saddle-likely shaped and can be located inside a second frame member <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0053">The pivot bushing assembly <b>102</b> transmits a shear stress from the fifth wheel head and further distributes these forces along the frame members <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>. The one pivot bushing assembly <b>102</b> selectively and adjustably engages the first frame member <b>120</b> with the second frame member <b>130</b> of the kingpin receiving assembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show example, non-limiting front and rear pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b> as described below.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0054">The pivot bushing assembly allows a higher shear strength of the pin inserted through the second frame member <b>130</b>. The first frame member <b>120</b> may pivot with respect to the second frame member <b>130</b> about the front and rear pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b>. The front and rear pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b> may allow higher shear strength during operation of the kingpin receiving assembly <b>100</b>. The front and rear pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b> may allow separate isolation fore and aft. The front and rear pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b> may allow vertical forces to be a metal on metal contact, which may provide additional strength. The front and rear pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b> may be a serviceable part, i.e., it may be replaced. The front and rear pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b> may be tunable part, i.e., one can adjust stiffness or adjust the gap present to adjusting the functioning of the front and rear pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0055">More specifically, the pivot bushing assembly <b>102</b> may transmit shear load during operation of the fifth wheel hitch. The bolt or pin inserted therethrough is no longer the limiting factor as to the forces that may be applied. Instead, the front pivot bushing assembly <b>102</b> may support the load. As the structure of the pivot bushing assembly <b>102</b> may be more stout than the pin or bolt itself, this may allow for the additional shear load.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0056">The pivot bushing assembly <b>102</b> may also allow for adjustment of the friction applied during operation of the fifth wheel hitch and/or dampening in rotation. This may allow a reduction or elimination of the rattle that otherwise occurs in prior art systems. The pivot bushing assembly <b>102</b> may be adjusted or tuned to provide just enough friction to avoid rattling during rotation between the first frame member <b>120</b> and second frame member <b>130</b> about the first pivot bushing assembly <b>102</b> (and/or the second pivot bushing assembly).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0057">The pivot bushing assemblies need not be identical. As a non-limiting example, the assembly toward the front of the hitch assembly may be designed for increased strength, while the rear bushing allows for friction and/or rotation dampening. Other combinations are possible. In the description of the front and rear pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b> may perform the same function.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a non-limiting exemplary embodiment of an at least one pivot bushing assembly <b>102</b> in accordance with the present disclosure. The pivot bushing assembly <b>102</b> may be similar to the configuration of either or both of the rear and front installations. The pivot bushing assembly <b>102</b> includes a bolt <b>210</b>, a bushing <b>220</b>, and an end cap <b>230</b>, all of which may be made from a strength material such as any appropriate grade of steel or other similar metals or alloys.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0059">The bolt <b>210</b> passes through the cylindrical bushing <b>220</b>. The bushing <b>220</b> includes a generally cylindrical body portion <b>222</b> that may be of any appropriate configuration. The cylindrical body <b>222</b> may also include two flattened portions or radially projecting flanges at one or both ends (as shown, a flange is on the outside facing in contact with frame <b>130</b>). A polymeric isolator <b>225</b>, having a generally hollow cylindrical form conforming to that of the bolt <b>210</b> and bushing <b>220</b> combination, is positioned around the bushing <b>220</b> at one end. An end cap <b>230</b> held in place by fastener <b>235</b> partially or completely encloses the isolator <b>225</b>. Notably, polymeric isolator bushing <b>225</b> creates an offset so that the end of bushing <b>220</b> and the interior cup of the end cap <b>230</b> do not necessarily come into contact, thereby reducing wear and delivering the other benefits of the assembly <b>102</b>, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0060">The bolt <b>210</b> covered at one end with an end cap <b>230</b>. A fastener <b>235</b> selectively and adjustably engages the bolt <b>210</b> (e.g., via a threaded connection) to urge the end cap <b>230</b> into compressing the polymeric bushing <b>225</b>, which may be manufactured by a polymeric material (or any other appropriate elastomeric material). The polymeric material may be configured to limit the free movement, rattling movement, from the first frame member <b>120</b> and/or the second frame member <b>130</b>. The bushing <b>225</b> may be configured to act to absorb vibration that may occur and reduce the friction present. This may allow for a reduction in rattling during operation of the applicable fifth wheel hitch.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0061">The bolt <b>210</b>, the bushings <b>220</b>, <b>225</b>, and the end cap <b>230</b>, respectively, may be of any appropriate shape or size, such as having a generally tubular, square, rectangular, or the like shape, and may be sized generally to fit in fifth wheel hitch. In some embodiments, the bolt <b>210</b>, the bushings <b>220</b>, <b>225</b>, and the end cap <b>230</b>, respectively, may be formed from a single generally continuous piece, such as a generally continuous and generally rectangular-shaped tubular member. By way of a non-limiting example, the bolt <b>210</b>, the sleeve <b>220</b>, and the end cap <b>230</b>, respectively, may be formed by stamping, which may create a generally smooth, reinforced, tubular structure.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0062">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the bolt <b>210</b> may not receive any shear stress and may only get tensional or compressional stress along the fore-aft direction. It should be noted that when terms fore and aft are utilized herein that is describing the direction of travel of the vehicle in a forward and reverse direction. The bolt <b>210</b> may be adjusted for dampening purposes. In some embodiments, the bolt <b>210</b> may be rotated it may get greased, and may be rebuilt at the joint for HD loading. The pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b> may be utilized for a hitch roll, a pitch articulation and/or both within a hitch design.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a pair of pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b> may be of a similar configuration or different configuration and may be substantially similar configuration to the assemblies <b>102</b> above. When compared to current state of the art, this pair of pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b> may isolate the fore-aft trailer load, thereby dampening an oscillation. They may also isolate fore-aft trailer load input while controlling travel accurately to not allow undulation and/or overload of the isolator. Further still, these pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b> may create a low rotational force that may keep the fifth wheel hitch from rattling when it is not connected and allow all vertical load structurally without getting an isolation from a large contact area for an increased durability. This may be dependent on vehicle suspension of the towing vehicle in order to avoid a ride harmonics. Finally, the pivot bushing assemblies <b>102</b> may further allow load sharing between the front and the rear pivot bushings for more structurally efficient design.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0064">Anti-Rattling, Vertically Adjustable Attachment Members</p><p id="p-0045" num="0065">The fifth wheel hitch may include comfort assembly including features such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b>C</figref>.
