Particularly, however not exclusively, the invention pertains to a computer-implemented system and method for measuring the health of a real estate in relation to indoor air quality.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In many countries, buildings have standards and guidelines for measuring indoor air quality to assess and protect the health and wellbeing of the occupants of the building. People are spending more time indoors and technical functionalities of the indoor building have grown complex. There are various factors that can contribute to the air quality consisting of technical factors like design of the building and wrong adjustments of heating- and ventilation systems that can lead to issues in temperature, moisture, ventilation and pressure differentials of the building. In addition, incorrectly working building can lead to the presence of indoor air pollutants e.g. PM10, PM2.5, CO, CO2, HCHO, TVOC, bacteria, fungi, SO2, and NO2 also contribute to indoor air quality. Even though these indoor air pollutants and poor ventilation or moisture can cause only slight discomfort in health to human body without threat of life, the possibility of chronic illnesses or cancer could be increased if people are exposed under the polluted air with lower concentration of emission in the long term.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Technical malfunctioning of the structural and mechanical factors contribute to how the indoor air quality is perceived and the effectiveness and general wellbeing of people inside it.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Interpretation of indoor air quality in relation to several factors like moisture, temperature, pressure differential, and presence of air pollutants require measuring each of these parameters individually and making a general conclusion with expertise and knowledge required by humans to judge on the air quality. In addition, even if the quality of indoor air can be measured by several sensors available in the industry, there is not yet a defined mechanism how to use it for measuring building health index.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some prior art solutions presented in patent publications include US 2013174646 A1, which discloses a monitoring system that uses data points to form a residence-specific fingerprint for a building with the goal of monitoring especially indoor air comfort and air quality safety for people. US 2016231014 A1 discloses a system for managing environmental conditions inside a building wherein the system may compute a comfort level or productivity level score corresponding to the environmental condition in the structure based upon the received environmental data and facilitate control of the HVAC systems in the building to adjust conditions in the building. CN 110410931 A discloses a system particularly for measuring indoor air quality and facilitating control and regulation of the indoor air quality. US 2015369505 A1 discloses another solution for controlling indoor air quality.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The objective of the embodiments of the present invention is to at least alleviate one or more of the aforementioned drawbacks evident in the prior art particularly in the context of building condition monitoring. The objective is generally achieved with a computer-implemented method and system in accordance with the claims.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention comprises a method for measuring the health status of a building using health monitoring system that uses parameters measured by at least one or more sensors installed into a building, measuring at least room temperature, Carbon-di-oxide and differential pressure, and optionally one or more parameters, that the system may be configured to measure. The monitoring system uses these parameters measured by the sensors and sent over a network communication system to determine the health status of the building over a measurement window, which health status may be further displayed over one or more user interfaces. The advantage of the calculated health index and other individual measured parameters is that it may give the information how the building health is developing in a simple format that may be used to decide technical functioning of ventilation, heating, building health and risks caused by building users.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention focuses particularly on a method for collecting data over a period of time from a multiple different sensors pertaining to building and using the collected data to calculate an index indicating the health of the building, and not necessarily any current state of conditions in said building. The calculated index is comparable with other buildings and its use for measuring the functioning of the building, which may be used to determine whether the building needs fixing, which is different from real-time environment comfort monitoring and adjustment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Examples of technical effect of the present solution in relation to prior art include index calculation methodology that is comparable so that different building may be compared in how they function and how their function develops over time, which may be used e.g. for deciding when a building needs renovation. This is a different aim and use of the method when compared to the prior art as the cited documents commonly refer to monitor indoor air quality for optimization and control purposes with an aim for real-time environment comfort for users.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The expression &#x201c;a number of&#x201d; may herein refer to any positive integer starting from one (1).

Pressure difference is a pressure difference between two spaces, for example indoor-outdoor, or indoor-indoor. Buildings are designed to maintain proper pressure difference.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0030">Room temperature: It is defined as the range of indoor air temperatures, that is configured for indoor settings.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0031">Carbon-di-oxide: Carbon-di-oxide (CO2) is a byproduct of combustion, as well as a result of the metabolic process in living organisms. Because carbon dioxide is a result of human metabolism, concentrations within a building often are used to indicate whether adequate fresh air is being supplied to the space.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">Other parameters that may be optionally configured to the system for later measurements are:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0033">Humidity: Humidity represents the amount of water or moisture in the air.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0034">Radon: Radon is a radioactive gas that is generated naturally in the soil and enters the house from the ground. Radon is one of the leading causes of lung cancer in many developed countries. Its concentration in buildings varies regionally and even locally.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0035">TVOC: is defined as the total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) in indoor air. Correctly working building ventilation should ventilate compounds out of the building. High concentrations within a building might indicate failure in ventilation system or risk of high TVOC sources inside the building. High TVOC levels might cause sensory effects like sensory irritation, dryness, weak inflammatory irritation in eyes, nose, airways and skin.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0036">Particulate matter: is the sum of all solid and liquid particles suspended in air. These particles vary greatly in size, composition, and origin. Particles are released in for example burning processes, traffic and industrial processes. When inhaled, some Particles can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs. Correctly working building ventilation should filter Particles from the outside air.

For example, when the room is occupied by humans, active time can be calculated from amount of CO2 in the air. If the room is used as a cold storage, active time can be defined from temperature.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0038">The sensors shall measure and collect the measurements for at least Carbon-di-oxide, room temperature and pressure differential and optionally any other additional parameters configured to be measured by the building monitoring system.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0039">The system architecture of the building monitoring system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises a building [<b>101</b>], a communication system [<b>102</b>], a central computational center, such as a server, terminal or other such computing entity, acting as an intelligent building monitoring system [<b>103</b>], a plurality of display devices where the health index is presented [<b>104</b>], and a computer where the health index is presented or used for further processing [<b>105</b>].</p><p id="p-0034" num="0040">The detailed architecture of the building in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> comprises plurality of rooms [<b>200</b>], in which each room can be one or more partitions including interior wall [<b>202</b>] or fa&#xe7;ade structure [<b>204</b>], the ceilings comprising interior side [<b>206</b>] and exterior side [<b>208</b>], where in the rooms may have sensor [<b>210</b>] installed at the interior side of one wall [<b>204</b>] to measure at least pressure differential through the fa&#xe7;ade structure, sensor [<b>212</b>] installed on another wall [<b>204</b>] in the building to measure one of the parameters configured to be measured by the building monitoring system, room sensor [<b>214</b>] installed in another wall [<b>202</b>] to measure same or a different parameter configured to be measured by the building monitoring system, sensor [<b>216</b>] installed in another wall [<b>202</b>] of the building to measure at least pressure differential between outside and inside walls of a room, sensor [<b>218</b>] installed to measure at least pressure differential between the outside [<b>220</b>] and inside floor of the room in the building.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the method in which at least one or more sensors may be installed inside a room of a building, where each of the sensors as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may measure at least Carbon di-oxide, differential pressure and temperature, wherein the sensors may measure and store the values over a measurement period locally in the volatile memory in the sensors, and send it through a wireless communication system; wherein the data is pre-processed by the intelligent building monitoring system and refined for index calculation and then aggregated over a period of time to present the final index calculation and display over a plurality of the devices.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates another deployment of building monitoring system where the computation device, a plurality of display devices where the health index is presented [<b>404</b>] a computer where the health index is presented or used for further processing [<b>405</b>] may be installed inside the building or plurality of buildings [<b>405</b>], which is monitored remotely by such building monitoring system.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates another deployment of building monitoring system where there may be one or a plurality of local gateways [<b>506</b>], which gateways [<b>506</b>] may receive measurements from the sensors installed in the building through a communication system and send it the building monitoring system for further processing.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0044">The building monitoring system may be configured to know the context including at least one of the listed building locations, room type, active time of room when there are inhabitants or building specific technical details including either the ventilation type, covered area, heating type or some of them.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0045">The building monitoring system may also use data from the users of the building when there are inhabitants, as an input parameter for usage when measuring the building health index.

Using that, it shall validate the measurements to find the time when one or more of the measurements are within or outside the acceptable range over a measurement period. For example co2 is in acceptable range when the measurements are below threshold value 950 ppm during the active time of the room or location. Threshold value may vary depending on the type of the location or room. Interpolation is done between measurement points to get accurate durations of acceptable ranges. Each of these validated ranges tell how long a period of time the measurements have been in the acceptable range and how long a period of time they have been outside the acceptable range.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0048">A large set of such measurements over a longer period shall, give the information to the system to tell how the indoor air quality in the room of one or more buildings from where measurements were collected, is working as such. To find the building health index or one or more rooms in the building, the system may use methods like adding a weighted score to parameters in the range of 1-10 and use it to provide building health index.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0049">Additionally, since the CO2 measurement is available, the system may be able to use the data from occupancy rate and acceptable range calibrated to the system to find if in certain time or period the system reaches alarming level and the ventilation mechanism or other tools to improve the building health index need to fine-tune.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0050">The building health index and other individual measured parameters may provide information of how the building health is developing, how is the air quality and the intelligent building monitoring system may use the index to suggest change in the ventilation, pressure, temperature settings or flow or add/remove/modify one or more of the technical functions installed in the building to reach desired health index.
