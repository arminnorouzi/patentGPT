Acute diseases associated with <i>S. pyogenes </i>occur mainly in respiratory tract, bloodstream or skin. Streptococcal disease is most often a respiratory infection (pharyngitis or tonsillitis) or a skin infection (pyoderma). Acute <i>S. pyogenes </i>infections may present as pharyngitis (strep throat), scarlet fever (rash), impetigo (infection of the superficial layers of the skin) or cellulitis (infection of the deep layers of the skin). Invasive, toxigenic infections can result in necrotizing fasciitis, joint or bone infections, myositis, meningitis, endocarditis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Patients may also develop immune-mediated post-streptococcal sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis, following acute infections caused by <i>S. pyogenes</i>, which occur in 1-3% of untreated infections. These conditions and their pathology are not attributable to dissemination of the bacteria per se, but to aberrant immunological reactions to Group A streptococcal antigens. Due to the occasional cases of rapidly progressive disease and the risk of serious sequelae in untreated infections, <i>S. pyogenes </i>remains a major health concern.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, the accurate and rapid identification of Streptococcal infections can be critical to provide prompt and appropriate treatment to patients.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides devices, methods and improved diagnostic kits for detecting Group A <i>Streptococcus </i>(also referred to herein as &#x201c;Strep A&#x201d;) in biological samples.

As normal flora, <i>S. pyogenes </i>can infect when defenses are compromised or when the organisms are able to penetrate the constitutive defenses. The cell surface of <i>S. pyogenes </i>accounts for many of the bacterium's determinants of virulence, especially those concerned with colonization and evasion of phagocytosis and the host immune responses. The surface of the bacterium is incredibly complex and chemically-diverse. Antigenic components include capsular polysaccharide (C-substance), cell wall peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and a variety of surface proteins, including M protein, fimbrial proteins, fibronectin-binding proteins, (e.g. Protein F) and cell-bound streptokinase.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Rapid methods of diagnosing microbial infections are necessary to provide timely results for guiding clinical therapy. Some of the most effective of these rapid methods have been immunologically based. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to microbe-specific antigens have been developed and used in immunoassays to identify specific microbes in biological samples. For example, immunoassays for the identification of group A streptococcal antigens in human samples are useful for the early detection of <i>S. pyogenes </i>infection, so that proper antibiotic therapy may be initiated. Group A <i>Streptococcus </i>in pharyngeal exudates can be identified by polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to antigens specific for Group A <i>Streptococcus</i>. One such test is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,460, providing a one-step lateral flow assay for Group A <i>Streptococcus</i>-specific antigens. However, tests relying on pharyngeal swabs are often complicated by a high false positive rates. Although instructions for use of pharyngeal swab tests specifically direct the user to avoid contacting the tongue, cheek and/or teeth with the swab, inadvertent contact often occurs, nonetheless.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Epithelial cells originating from the tongue, cheek and/or teeth may contain molecular mimics of one or more components of the <i>S. pyogenes </i>cell wall, and a polyclonal antibody specific for Group A <i>Streptococcus </i>may bind and &#x201c;recognize&#x201d; epitopes on the epithelial cells in a test subject not infected by or carrying Group A strep, resulting in a false positive result. Specifically, salivary mucin and other glycosylated proteins found in the oral cavity contain the sugar, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, as a glycan constituent. N-acetyl-D-glucosamine is believed to be the immunodominant constituent of the Group A Strep (GAS) carbohydrate antigen epitope. Consequently, the presence of these glycoproteins in a throat swab specimen can cause false positive results in immunoassays designed to detect Group A Strep. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies are commonly used as reagents in immunoassays for Group A Strep, and typically contain a mixture of clones of variable affinity and specificity. Previous studies have reported that the addition of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine can improve assay specificity, thus reducing interference (false positives) caused by salivary proteins. However, this effect is accompanied by a significant reduction in assay sensitivity. See US 2013/0196337. A highly specific and sensitive immunoassay with a reduced rate of both false positives and false negatives is needed to provide accurate detection of Group A <i>Streptococcus </i>infection.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present disclosure demonstrates that when N-propionyl-D-glucosamine, 2-N-butanoyl-D-glucosamide, Bis-(2-(D-2-deoxy-glucosaminyl))-PEG3-amide, m-PEG4-glucosamine, m-PEG6-glucosamine, or m-PEG10-glucosamine is included in the reagents of the lateral flow assay, it preferentially binds to the antibody clones that are less specific for the intact GAS antigen epitope, thus preventing those antibodies from cross-reacting with mucin and other glycoproteins. As demonstrated herein, the inclusion of N-propionyl-D-glucosamine, 2-N-butanoyl-D-glucosamide, Bis-(2-(D-2-deoxy-glucosaminyl))-PEG3-amide, m-PEG4-glucosamine, m-PEG6-glucosamine, or m-PEG10-glucosamine in lateral flow immunoassays eliminates or significantly reduces assay signal due to the presence of mucin, while retaining increased sensitivity for Group A Strep antigens.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present technology belongs.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the upper and lower limits of that range is also specifically disclosed.

As used herein, &#x201c;antibodies&#x201d; (includes intact immunoglobulins) and &#x201c;antigen binding fragments&#x201d; specifically bind to a molecule of interest (or a group of highly similar molecules of interest) to the substantial exclusion of binding to other molecules (for example, antibodies and antibody fragments that have a binding constant for the molecule of interest that is at least 10<sup>3 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>greater, at least 10<sup>4</sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>greater or at least 10<sup>5 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>greater than a binding constant for other molecules in a biological sample). The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; also includes genetically engineered forms such as chimeric antibodies (for example, humanized murine antibodies), heteroconjugate antibodies (such as, bispecific antibodies). See also, Pierce Catalog and Handbook, 1994-1995 (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill.); Kuby, J., <i>Immunology, </i>3<sup>rd </sup>Ed., W.H. Freeman &#x26; Co., New York, 1997.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">More particularly, antibody refers to a polypeptide ligand comprising at least a light chain immunoglobulin variable region or heavy chain immunoglobulin variable region which specifically recognizes and binds an epitope of an antigen. Antibodies are composed of a heavy and a light chain, each of which has a variable region, termed the variable heavy (V<sub>H</sub>) region and the variable light (V<sub>L</sub>) region. Together, the V<sub>H </sub>region and the V<sub>L </sub>region are responsible for binding the antigen recognized by the antibody. Typically, an immunoglobulin has heavy (H) chains and light (L) chains interconnected by disulfide bonds. There are two types of light chain, lambda (&#x3bb;) and kappa (&#x3ba;). There are five main heavy chain classes (or isotypes) which determine the functional activity of an antibody molecule: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE. Each heavy and light chain contains a constant region and a variable region, (the regions are also known as &#x201c;domains&#x201d;). In combination, the heavy and the light chain variable regions specifically bind the antigen. Light and heavy chain variable regions contain a &#x201c;framework&#x201d; region interrupted by three hypervariable regions, also called &#x201c;complementarity-determining regions&#x201d; or &#x201c;CDRs&#x201d;. The extent of the framework region and CDRs have been defined (see, Kabat et al., <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, </i>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1991, which is hereby incorporated by reference). The Kabat database is now maintained online. The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are relatively conserved within a species. The framework region of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, largely adopt a &#x3b2;-sheet conformation and the CDRs form loops which connect, and in some cases form part of, the &#x3b2;-sheet structure. Thus, framework regions act to form a scaffold that provides for positioning the CDRs in correct orientation by inter-chain, non-covalent interactions.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The CDRs are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen. The CDRs of each chain are typically referred to as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, numbered sequentially starting from the N-terminus, and are also typically identified by the chain in which the particular CDR is located. Thus, a V<sub>H </sub>CDR3 is located in the variable domain of the heavy chain of the antibody in which it is found, whereas a V<sub>L </sub>CDR1 is the CDR1 from the variable domain of the light chain of the antibody in which it is found. An antibody that binds a target protein will have a specific V<sub>H </sub>region and the V<sub>L </sub>region sequence, and thus specific CDR sequences. Antibodies with different specificities (i.e. different combining sites for different antigens) have different CDRs. Although it is the CDRs that vary from antibody to antibody, only a limited number of amino acid positions within the CDRs are directly involved in antigen binding. These positions within the CDRs are called specificity determining residues (SDRs) &#x201c;Immunoglobulin-related compositions&#x201d; as used herein, refers to antibodies (including monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, recombinant antibodies, multispecific antibodies, bispecific antibodies, etc.) as well as antibody fragments. An antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof specifically binds to an antigen.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The term &#x201c;antigen binding fragment&#x201d; refers to a fragment of the whole immunoglobulin structure which possesses a part of a polypeptide responsible for binding to antigen. Examples of the antigen binding fragment useful in the present technology include scFv, (scFv)<sub>2</sub>, scFvFc, Fab, Fab&#x2032; and F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, but are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used herein, &#x201c;associated&#x201d; refers to coincidence with the development or manifestation of a disease, condition or phenotype. Association may be due to, but is not limited to, genes responsible for housekeeping functions whose alteration can provide the foundation for a variety of diseases and conditions, those that are part of a pathway that is involved in a specific disease, condition or phenotype and those that indirectly contribute to the manifestation of a disease, condition or phenotype.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">By &#x201c;binding affinity&#x201d; is meant the strength of the total noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen or antigenic peptide). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). Affinity can be measured by standard methods known in the art, including those described herein. A low-affinity complex contains an antibody that generally tends to dissociate readily from the antigen, whereas a high-affinity complex contains an antibody that generally tends to remain bound to the antigen for a longer duration.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used herein, &#x201c;chromophore&#x201d; refers to a moiety with absorption characteristics, i.e., are capable of excitation upon irradiation by any of a variety of photonic sources. Chromophores can be fluorescing or non-fluorescing, and include, among others, dyes, fluorophores, luminescent, chemiluminescent, and electrochemiluminescent molecules.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As used herein, the term &#x201c;detecting&#x201d; refers to determining the presence of a target polypeptide in the sample. Detection does not require the method to provide 100% sensitivity and/or 100% specificity.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, an &#x201c;effective amount of N-propionyl-D-glucosamine, 2-N-butanoyl-D-glucosamide, Bis-(2-(D-2-deoxy-glucosaminyl))-PEG3-amide, m-PEG4-glucosamine, m-PEG6-glucosamine, or m-PEG10-glucosamine&#x201d; refers to a quantity of N-propionyl-D-glucosamine, 2-N-butanoyl-D-glucosamide, Bis-(2-(D-2-deoxy-glucosaminyl))-PEG3-amide, m-PEG4-glucosamine, m-PEG6-glucosamine, or m-PEG10-glucosamine that is sufficient to preferentially bind to the antibody (or antigen binding fragment) clones that are less specific for the intact GAS antigen epitope, thus preventing those clones from cross-reacting with mucin and other glycoproteins.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, the term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; means a protein determinant capable of specific binding to an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and non-conformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents. In some embodiments, the epitope is a conformational epitope or a non-conformational epitope.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">&#x201c;Homology&#x201d; or &#x201c;identity&#x201d; or &#x201c;similarity&#x201d; refers to sequence similarity between two peptides or between two nucleic acid molecules. Homology can be determined by comparing a position in each sequence which may be aligned for purposes of comparison. When a position in the compared sequence is occupied by the same nucleobase or amino acid, then the molecules are homologous at that position. A degree of homology between sequences is a function of the number of matching or homologous positions shared by the sequences. A polynucleotide or polynucleotide region (or a polypeptide or polypeptide region) has a certain percentage (for example, at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99%) of &#x201c;sequence identity&#x201d; to another sequence means that, when aligned, that percentage of bases (or amino acids) are the same in comparing the two sequences. This alignment and the percent homology or sequence identity can be determined using software programs known in the art. In some embodiments, default parameters are used for alignment. One alignment program is BLAST, using default parameters. In particular, programs are BLASTN and BLASTP, using the following default parameters: Genetic code=standard; filter=none; strand=both; cutoff=60; expect=10; Matrix=BLOSUM62; Descriptions=50 sequences; sort by=HIGH SCORE; Databases=non-redundant, GenBank+EMBL+DDBJ+PDB+GenBank CDS translations+SwissProtein+SPupdate+PIR. Details of these programs can be found at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Biologically equivalent polynucleotides are those having the specified percent homology and encoding a polypeptide having the same or similar biological activity. Two sequences are deemed &#x201c;unrelated&#x201d; or &#x201c;non-homologous&#x201d; if they share less than 40% identity, or less than 25% identity, with each other.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">&#x201c;Isolated antibody,&#x201d; as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody which is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds to the protein of interest is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than the protein of interest). An isolated antibody that specifically binds to an epitope, isoform or variant of the protein of interest may, however, have cross-reactivity to other related antigens, e.g., from other species (e.g., species homologs). Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">&#x201c;Label&#x201d; refers to any moiety that, when attached to a moiety described herein, e.g., a peptide, protein or antibody, renders such a moiety detectable using known detection methods, e.g., spectroscopic, photochemical, electrochemiluminescent, and electrophoretic methods. Various labels suitable for use in the present disclosure include labels which produce a signal through either chemical or physical means, wherein the signal is detectable by visual or instrumental means. Exemplary labels include, but are not limited to, gold nanoparticles, fluorophores and radioisotopes. Such labels allow direct detection of labeled compounds by a suitable detector, e.g., a fluorometer or a reflectance reader. Such labels can include enzymes and substrates, chromogens, catalysts, fluorescent compounds, phosphorescent compounds, chemiluminescent compounds, and radioactive labels. Typically, a visually detectable label is used, thereby providing for instrumental (e.g. spectrophotometer or a reflectance reader) readout of the amount of the analyte in the sample. Labels include enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase, galactosidase (alpha and/or beta), and alkaline phosphatase. Suitable substrates include 3,3&#x2032;,5,5&#x2032;-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and 1,2 dioxetane. The method of detection will depend upon the labeled used, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. Examples of suitable direct labels include gold nanoparticles, radiolabels, fluorophores, chromophores, chelating agents, particles, chemiluminescent agents and the like.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the label is a direct label, i.e., a label that itself is detectable or produces a detectable signal, or an indirect label, i.e., a label that is detectable or produces a detectable signal in the presence of another compound. A &#x201c;labeled second antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody that is attached to a detectable label. The label allows the antibody to produce a detectable signal that is related to the presence of analyte in the fluid sample.

Examples of suitable indirect labels include enzymes capable of reacting with or interacting with a substrate to produce a detectable signal (such as those used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT)), ligands capable of binding a labeled moiety, and the like. Suitable enzymes useful as indirect labels include, by way of example and not limitation, alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, lysozyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase and urease.

Thus in screening the general population it is inevitable that many people with positive test results will be false positives. The rarer the abnormality, the higher the certainty that a negative test indicates no abnormality, and the lower the certainty that a positive result truly indicates an abnormality. The prevalence can be interpreted as the probability before the test is carried out that the subject has the disease, known as the prior probability of disease. The positive and negative predictive values are the revised estimates of the same probability for those subjects who are positive and negative on the test, and are known as posterior probabilities. The difference between the prior and posterior probabilities is one way of assessing the usefulness of the test.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0060">For any test result, one can compare the probability of obtaining that result if the patient truly had the condition of interest with the corresponding probability if he or she were healthy.

Sensitivity relates to the ability of a diagnostic test to identify positive results and is computed as the number of true positives divided by the sum of the number of true positives and the number of false negatives. &#x201c;Specificity&#x201d; measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified (e.g., the percentage of healthy subjects who are correctly identified as not having the condition). Specificity relates to the ability of a diagnostic test to identify negative results and is computed as the number of true negatives divided by the sum of the number of true negatives and the number of false positives. Sensitivity and specificity are closely related to the concepts of type I and type II errors. A theoretical, optimal prediction aims to achieve 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, however theoretically any predictor will possess a minimum error bound known as the Bayes error rate.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">For any test, there is usually a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, which can be represented graphically using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In some embodiments, a ROC is used to generate a summary statistic. Some common versions are: the intercept of the ROC curve with the line at 90 degrees to the no-discrimination line (also called Youden's J statistic); the area between the ROC curve and the no-discrimination line; the area under the ROC curve, or &#x201c;AUC&#x201d; (&#x201c;Area Under Curve&#x201d;), or A&#x2032; (pronounced &#x201c;a-prime&#x201d;); d&#x2032; (pronounced &#x201c;d-prime&#x201d;), the distance between the mean of the distribution of activity in the system under noise-alone conditions and its distribution under signal-alone conditions, divided by their standard deviation, under the assumption that both these distributions are normal with the same standard deviation.
