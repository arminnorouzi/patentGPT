The resist patterns and subsequently transferred patterns go through excessive trimming processes with either RIE or IBE techniques to achieve the desired CD sizes. However, due to resist pattern edge roughness, CD uniformity control cannot be met after such excessive trimming processes. Similar challenges are faced in other areas of HDD head processes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there is a need for a method for ultra-fine CD patterning for magnetic head devices that achieves significant CD uniformity and scaling capability.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Broadly, embodiments of the present disclosure provide methods for ultra-fine CD patterning for magnetic head devices that achieve significant CD uniformity and scaling capability.

Those of skill in the art will recognize that other steps may be employed and in varying order and that the inventions disclosed herein are not limited to such, but that the above definition is provided for convenience and ease of description.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the method includes providing a film stack <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>. In some embodiments, the film stack includes a substrate <b>101</b>, a MR sensor layer <b>102</b>, and a hard mask layer <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The substrate <b>101</b> can be any suitable substrate known in the art for the HDD industry. The substrate is a structural substrate having mechanical strength to support the overlying layers. Substrates used are generally metal, glass, or a carbon material such as a polymer or composite, and may be metal alloys or composite glass materials such as glass/ceramic blends. The substrate is generally magnetically impermeable with diamagnetic, or only very weak paramagnetic, properties.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The MR sensor layer <b>102</b> can be any suitable MR sensor layer known in the art. In some embodiments, a MR sensor layer <b>102</b> includes two ferromagnetic layers which are separated by a non-magnetic conductive layer in the sensor stack. One of the ferromagnetic layers is a pinned layer wherein the magnetization direction is fixed by exchange coupling with an adjacent anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) pinning layer. The second ferromagnetic layer is a free layer wherein the magnetization vector can rotate in response to external magnetic fields. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the magnetization direction of the free layer is aligned perpendicular to that of the pinned layer by the influence of hard bias layers on opposite sides of the sensor stack. When an external magnetic field is applied by passing the sensor over a recording medium along an air bearing surface (ABS), the free layer magnetic moment may rotate to a direction which is parallel to that of the pinned layer which is a lower resistance state than in the perpendicular alignment. In some embodiments, the two ferromagnetic layers are separated by a thin non-magnetic dielectric layer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The hard mask layer <b>103</b> can be formed from one or more layers of any suitable material or combination of materials. The hard mask layer <b>103</b> can be deposited by any suitable method. Preferably, the hard mask layer is deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD), or atomic layer deposition (ALD).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the hard mask layer <b>103</b> is one layer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>. In some embodiments, the hard mask layer <b>103</b> composes SiO2 or high-k material, wherein the high-k materials include, but are not limited to, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, hafnium oxide (HfO2), hafnium silicon oxide (HfSiO), hafnium silicon oxynitride (HfSiON), hafnium tantalum oxide (HMO), hafnium titanium oxide (HMO), hafnium zirconium oxide (HfZrO), metal oxides, metal nitrides, metal silicates, transition metal-oxides, transition metal-nitrides, transition metal-silicates, oxynitrides of metals, metal aluminates, zirconium silicate, zirconium aluminate, zirconium oxide, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, hafnium dioxide-alumina (HfO2-Al2O3) alloy, and/or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the method includes patterning the hard mask layer <b>103</b> using a first mask to define the critical shape patterns other than the CD as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>. In some embodiments, patterning the hard mask layer <b>103</b> includes applying a photoresist layer over the hard mask layer <b>103</b>. In some embodiments, the photoresist layer includes a photoresist and a bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC), a photoresist with silicon content, or a BARC with spin on carbon. In some embodiments, the photoresist layer is formed by spin coating.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, patterning the hard mask layer <b>103</b> includes exposing the photoresist layer to a light source through a first mask (e.g., photomask) like the mask <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>. After exposure to the light source, the photoresist layer can then be developed, forming a resist pattern. The hard mask layer <b>103</b> can then be etched (e.g., by a dry etch, such as plasma etching) to pattern the hard mask layer <b>103</b> and the remaining portions of the photoresist layer can be removed. In some embodiments, the plasma etching can use a plasma of reactive gases such as fluorocarbons, oxygen, chlorine, boron trichloride, optionally with nitrogen, argon, helium or other gas.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the method further includes forming a mandrel pattern <b>104</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> using a second mask to define the CD <b>99</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> that requires tight CD control. In some embodiments, the formation of the mandrel pattern <b>104</b> includes depositing a mandrel material layer, such as a dielectric material (e.g., silicon oxide, silicon nitride, or any other suitable material discussed herein), forming a resist pattern using a second mask (e.g., photomask) like the mask <b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, and etching the mandrel material layer using the resist layer as an etch mask, thereby forming the mandrel pattern <b>104</b>. The resist pattern includes a resist material sensitive to a radiation beam and is formed by a lithography process. In some embodiments, the lithography process includes coating a resist layer on the mandrel material layer, performing a lithography exposure process to the resist layer according to the second mask, developing the exposed resist layer to form the resist pattern.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, a resist is not necessary and forming the mandrel pattern <b>104</b> can be formed directly using resist-less pattern formation techniques with the second mask like the mask <b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> like soft lithography, Dip-Pen nanolithography, and evaporation through a shadow mask or stencil.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, forming a sidewall spacer pattern <b>105</b> on sidewalls of the mandrel pattern <b>104</b> and (removing the mandrel pattern <b>104</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>. In some embodiments, forming the sidewall spacer pattern <b>105</b> is by a self-aligned ALD spacer patterning step. In some embodiments, the formation of the sidewall spacer pattern <b>105</b> includes depositing a conformal layer of spacer material on the mandrel pattern <b>104</b>, and thereafter etching (e.g., by a wet etch or a dry etch, such as plasma etching) the conformal layer of spacer material, thereby forming the sidewall spacer pattern <b>105</b>. The conformal layer of spacer material may include a dielectric material (such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon carbide) or any materials discussed herein but is different from the mandrel material layer to achieve etching selectivity during the etch. In some embodiments, the conformal layer of spacer material is deposited by ALD.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the conformal layer can be deposited by high temperature ALD. In some embodiments, by &#x201c;high temperature&#x201d; it is meant that the temperature of the deposition process ranges from greater than 150&#xb0; C., greater than 200&#xb0; C., greater than 250&#xb0; C., greater than 300&#xb0; C., greater than 350&#xb0; C., greater than 400&#xb0; C., greater than 450&#xb0; C., 500&#xb0; C. to 1000&#xb0; C., or 500&#xb0; C. to 800&#xb0; C., 500&#xb0; C. to 750&#xb0; C., 550&#xb0; C. to 750&#xb0; C., 600&#xb0; C. to 750&#xb0; C.; or 600&#xb0; C. to 800&#xb0; C. Materials for high temperature ALD include carbon for Al2O3ALD, SiO2 ALD, SiON ALD, Al2O3 for SiO2 ALD, and SiO2 with Al2O3ALD. For some embodiments, carbon can be removed by oxygen RIE etch, Al2O3 can be removed by alkali solution wet etch, and SiO2 by HF wet etch. Preferably, when the conformal layer is deposited by high temperature ALD, a resist is not used and the mandrel pattern can be formed directly using resist-less pattern formation techniques with the second mask like the mask <b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> like soft lithography, Dip-Pen nanolithography, and evaporation through a shadow mask or stencil</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the conformal layer can be deposited by low temperature ALD. In some embodiments, by &#x201c;low temperature&#x201d; it is meant that the temperature of the deposition process ranges from less than 400&#xb0; C., less than 300&#xb0; C., less than 200&#xb0; C., less than 150&#xb0; C., less than 100&#xb0; C., 25-200&#xb0; C., preferably from 100-200&#xb0; C., 25-150&#xb0; C., and 100-150&#xb0; C. Preferably, by &#x201c;low temperature&#x201d; it is meant that the temperature of the deposition process is less than 150&#xb0; C. Preferably, the temperature of the deposition process is lower than the glass transition temperature of the mandrel pattern such that the mandrel pattern will not deform during ALD deposition.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the method further includes removing the mandrel pattern <b>104</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>. The mandrel pattern <b>104</b> is removed by an etch process that selectively removes the mandrel material layer but substantially does not etch the conformal layer of spacer material.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Also provided is a second method for critical dimension (CD) uniformity control for magnetic head devices.

In some embodiments, a MR sensor layer <b>202</b> includes two ferromagnetic layers which are separated by a non-magnetic conductive layer in the sensor stack. One of the ferromagnetic layers is a pinned layer wherein the magnetization direction is fixed by exchange coupling with an adjacent anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) pinning layer. The second ferromagnetic layer is a free layer wherein the magnetization vector can rotate in response to external magnetic fields. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the magnetization direction of the free layer is aligned perpendicular to that of the pinned layer by the influence of hard bias layers on opposite sides of the sensor stack. When an external magnetic field is applied by passing the sensor over a recording medium along an air bearing surface (ABS), the free layer magnetic moment may rotate to a direction which is parallel to that of the pinned layer which is a lower resistance state than in the perpendicular alignment. In some embodiments, the two ferromagnetic layers are separated by a thin non-magnetic dielectric layer.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The hard mask layer <b>203</b> can be formed from one or more layers of any suitable material or combination of materials.
