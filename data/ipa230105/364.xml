id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a fluid circuit and a blood pressure measurement device used for blood pressure measurement.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, blood pressure measurement devices used for measuring a blood pressure are being used as means to check health status at home, as well as in medical facilities. A blood pressure measurement device detects vibration of the artery wall to measure blood pressure by, for example, inflating and contracting a cuff wrapped around the upper arm or the wrist of a living body and detecting the pressure of the cuff using a pressure sensor.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such a blood pressure measurement device, there is known a technique that the blood pressure measurement device includes a sensing cuff for measuring a blood pressure and a plurality of cuffs including a pressing cuff that presses the sensing cuff against a living body. The blood pressure measurement device includes a pump and supplies a fluid, for example, air to the cuff by the pump to inflate the cuff</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, JP 2009-22477 A discloses a technique of the blood pressure measurement device that disposes an orifice as a fluid resistor between a pressing cuff and a sensing cuff and includes a fluid circuit that reduces an amount of air injection. In such a blood pressure measurement device, a flow rate changes in proportion to a pressure difference between the pressing cuff on a primary side of the orifice and the sensing cuff on a secondary side of the orifice. Citation List&#x2014;Patent Literature: Japanese Patent Application No.: JP 2009-22477 A.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the blood pressure measurement device described above, the flow rate of air supplied from a pump changes in proportion to the pressure difference between the pressing cuff on the primary side of the orifice and the sensing cuff on the secondary side of the orifice. Therefore, a change in pressurizing time of a living body during blood pressure measurement changes an amount of air inflow to the sensing cuff, causing an error in the amount of air injection to the sensing cuff</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Similarly, in a configuration including three or more cuffs, providing a fluid resistor, such as an orifice, between the cuff on the primary side and the cuff on the secondary side changes the amount of air inflow to the cuff on the secondary side.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, the pressurization time of the living body during blood pressure measurement changes depending on, for example, a thickness of a measurement site of a subject, a state of winding of an arm band, and a pump property. Further, the amount of air injection supplied to the sensing cuff needs to be smaller than an amount of intake air supplied to the pressing cuff. Therefore, as the orifice provided between the pressing cuff and the sensing cuff, an orifice having a large fluid resistance needs to be used. Such an orifice requires a fine pinhole and requires expensive and highly accurate processing technique.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a fluid circuit and a blood pressure measurement device that allow controlling a pressure ratio of a plurality of cuffs.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution To Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect, there is provided a fluid circuit that includes a first cuff, a first fluid resistor, a second fluid resistor, and a second cuff. The first cuff is connected to a secondary side of a pump that supplies a fluid to a secondary side. The first fluid resistor is connected to a secondary side of the first cuff. The second fluid resistor is provided on a secondary side of the first fluid resistor and connected to an atmosphere. The second cuff is provided between the first fluid resistor and the second fluid resistor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Here, the fluid includes a liquid and air. The cuff includes a bag-like structure that is wound around, for example, an upper arm and a wrist of a living body when a blood pressure is measured and inflates by supply of a fluid. When the fluid is air, the bag-like structure is an air bag inflated by, for example, air.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to this aspect, the fluid supplied to the secondary side by the pump is supplied to the first cuff, passes through the first fluid resistor, and is supplied to a flow path between the first fluid resistor and the second fluid resistor. Further, the fluid supplied to the flow path between the first fluid resistor and the second fluid resistor is supplied to the second cuff, passes through the second fluid resistor, and is exhausted to the atmosphere. Thus, a flow rate of the fluid supplied to the second cuff becomes smaller than a flow rate of the fluid supplied to the first cuff. Furthermore, a flow rate of the fluid exhausted to the atmosphere becomes smaller than the flow rate of the fluid supplied to the second cuff. That is, a pressure ratio between a pressure of the first cuff and a pressure of the second cuff becomes constant by the use of a fluid resistance ratio between the first fluid resistor and the second fluid resistor. Thus, the fluid circuit allows setting the pressure of the first cuff and the pressure of the second cuff as desired pressures.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the fluid circuit according to the one aspect described above, there is provided a fluid circuit that includes a first valve. The first valve is provided in parallel with the first fluid resistor. The first valve opens when a pressure of the second cuff is higher than a pressure of the first cuff by a predetermined value or more.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to this aspect, in the fluid circuit, in a case where the pressure of the first cuff decreases due to, for example, exhaust of the fluids of the first cuff and the second cuff, when the pressure of the first cuff becomes lower than the pressure of the second cuff, the first valve opens. Thus, when the pressure of first cuff is higher than the pressure of the second cuff, the fluid of the first cuff is preferentially exhausted, and the fluid of the second cuff is exhausted through the respective first fluid resistor and second fluid resistor. Additionally, when the pressure of the first cuff becomes lower than the pressure of the second cuff, the first valve opens and an exhaust rate of the fluid of the second cuff increases.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the fluid circuit according to the aspect described above, there is provided a fluid circuit that includes a second valve and a third fluid resistor. The second valve is provided in parallel with the first fluid resistor. The second valve opens when a pressure of the first cuff is higher than a pressure of the second cuff by a predetermined value or more. The third fluid resistor is connected to a secondary side of the second valve. The third fluid resistor is provided in parallel with the first fluid resistor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to this aspect, as the pressure of the first cuff increases, a differential pressure with the pressure of the second cuff increases. However, the differential pressure between the first cuff and the second cuff can be reduced by the use of the second valve and the third fluid resistor provided in parallel with the first fluid resistor.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thus, the fluid circuit can increase the second cuff to a desired pressure without requiring a pump having a high capacity. In the fluid circuit according to the aspect described above, there is provided a fluid circuit in which at least one of the first fluid resistor and the second fluid resistor is formed by connecting a plurality of orifices in parallel, in series, or in series and parallel. According to this aspect, by setting an arrangement of a plurality of flow rate resistors, the fluid resistors used for fluid resistance can be the fluid resistors taking into account pressure dependence.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an aspect, there is provided a blood pressure measurement device that includes a pump, a fluid circuit, an on-off valve, a pressure sensor, and a control unit. The pump supplies a fluid to a secondary side. The fluid circuit is according to any one of the aspects described above. The on-off valve is provided between the pump and the first cuff. The on-off valve opens and closes a flow path to the atmosphere. The pressure sensor is connected to the second cuff. The control unit that controls the pump and the on-off valve based on a pressure detected by the pressure sensor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to this aspect, the blood pressure measurement device can drive the pump based on the pressure of the second cuff, and thus the fluid can be supplied to the second cuff until at least the second cuff reaches a preferred pressure.

The display device <b>12</b> is, for example, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) or an Organic Electro Luminescence Display (OELD). The display device <b>12</b> displays various types of information including date and time and measurement results of, for example, blood pressure values, such as a systolic blood pressure and a diastolic blood pressure, and a heart rate in response to a control signal from the control substrate <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A user inputs an instruction with the operation device <b>13</b>. For example, the operation device <b>13</b> is a sensor that includes a plurality of buttons and detects an operation of the button, for example, a pressure-sensitive or capacitive touch panel provided on, for example, the case <b>11</b> and the display device <b>12</b>, and a microphone for receiving an instruction by sound. When operated by the user, the operation device <b>13</b> converts the instruction into an electrical signal and outputs the electrical signal to the control substrate <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The pump <b>14</b> is, for example, a piezoelectric pump. The pump <b>14</b> compresses a fluid and supplies the compressed fluid to the fluid circuit <b>3</b> through the flow path unit <b>15</b>. The pump <b>14</b> is electrically connected to the control substrate <b>20</b>. The pump <b>14</b> drives based on the control signal provided from the control substrate <b>20</b>. Here, any gas or any liquid can be employed as the fluid. In the present embodiment, the fluid is air.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The flow path unit <b>15</b> connects the pump <b>14</b>, the on-off valve <b>16</b>, and the pressure sensor <b>17</b> to the fluid circuit <b>3</b>. The flow path unit <b>15</b> is any of, for example, a tube, a pipe, a tank, and a hollow portion and a groove formed in the case <b>11</b>, or a combination thereof. As a specific example, the flow path unit <b>15</b> forms a flow path from the pump <b>14</b> to a secondary side, and forms a flow path <b>15</b><i>a </i>that is formed by branching a portion of the flow path from the pump <b>14</b> to the secondary side.

The flow path unit <b>15</b> forms a flow path <b>15</b><i>c </i>that connects the pressure sensor <b>17</b> to the fluid circuit <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The on-off valve <b>16</b> is electrically connected to the control substrate <b>20</b>. The on-off valve <b>16</b> is controlled by the control substrate <b>20</b>. For example, the on-off valve <b>16</b> is opened and closed by control of the control substrate <b>20</b>. The on-off valve <b>16</b> is connected to the atmosphere by the flow path unit <b>15</b> and is switched to an open state to connect the pump <b>14</b> and the fluid circuit <b>3</b> to the atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The on-off valve <b>16</b> is an exhaust valve that opens the flow path on the secondary side of the pump <b>14</b> to the atmosphere. In addition, for example, the on-off valve <b>16</b> is, for example, a quick exhaust valve to set an opening degree of the on-off valve <b>16</b> or an opening area of the flow path unit <b>15</b> such that a fluid resistance becomes low as much as possible and allows quick exhaust. Note that each of the drawings illustrates the on-off valve <b>16</b> as the quick exhaust valve <b>16</b>. The on-off valve <b>16</b> is switched to a closed state when air is supplied to the fluid circuit <b>3</b> during blood pressure measurement. In addition, when the fluid circuit <b>3</b> is exhausted, the on-off valve <b>16</b> is controlled by the control substrate <b>20</b> so as to be switched from the closed state to the open state. Further, the on-off valve <b>16</b> may be formed such that the opening degree is adjustable.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The pressure sensor <b>17</b> detects a pressure of the cuff disposed on the secondary side of the fluid circuit <b>3</b>, and in the present embodiment, a pressure of a sensing cuff <b>73</b> described later of the fluid circuit <b>3</b>. As a specific example, the pressure sensor <b>17</b> is fluidly connected to the sensing cuff <b>73</b> via the flow path unit <b>15</b>, and detects the pressure inside the sensing cuff <b>73</b>.

The communication device <b>19</b> transmits information, such as information controlled by the control substrate <b>20</b> and measured blood pressure values and pulse, to an external device, or receives, for example, a program for software update from an external device and transmits this to the control unit.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the present embodiment, the external device is, for example, an external terminal, such as a smartphone, a tablet terminal, a personal computer, and a smart watch.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the present embodiment, the communication device <b>19</b> and the external device may be directly connected, or may be connected over a network.

Further, the communication device <b>19</b> and the external device may be connected by wireless communication means, such as Bluetooth (registered trademark), Near Field Communication (NFC), and infrared communication. Furthermore, the communication device <b>19</b> and the external device may be connected over a wired communication line, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) and a Local Area Network (LAN) connection with a cable. Thus, the communication device <b>19</b> may include a plurality of communication means, such as a wireless antenna and a micro-USB connector.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The control substrate <b>20</b> includes, for example, a substrate, a storage unit <b>54</b>, and a control unit <b>55</b>. The control substrate <b>20</b> is constituted by mounting the storage unit <b>54</b> and the control unit <b>55</b> on a substrate.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The substrate is fixed to the case <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The storage unit <b>54</b> is a memory mounted on the substrate. The storage unit <b>54</b> includes, for example, a Random Access Memory (RAM) and a Read Only Memory (ROM). The storage unit <b>54</b> stores various types of data. For example, the storage unit <b>54</b> pre-stores, for example, program data for controlling the overall blood pressure measurement device <b>1</b>, the pump <b>14</b>, and the fluid circuit <b>3</b>, settings data for setting various functions of the blood pressure measurement device <b>1</b>, and calculation data for calculating a blood pressure value and a pulse from the pressure measured by the pressure sensor <b>17</b> to be changeable. The storage unit <b>54</b> stores information, such as a measured blood pressure value, a measured value of, for example, a pulse, and a pressure value measured by the pressure sensor <b>17</b>. The storage unit <b>54</b> can store various types of data generated by a measurement processing unit <b>55</b><i>a </i>in the control unit <b>55</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The control unit <b>55</b> includes a single or a plurality of processors mounted on the substrate. For example, the processor is a Central Processing Unit (CPU). The control unit <b>55</b> controls the operation of the entire blood pressure measurement device <b>1</b> and the operations of the pump <b>14</b> and the fluid circuit <b>3</b> based on the programs stored in the storage unit <b>54</b> to perform a predetermined operation (function). In addition, in accordance with the read program, the control unit <b>55</b> performs, for example, predetermined operation, analysis, or process in the control unit <b>55</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The control unit <b>55</b> is electrically connected to and supplies power to the display device <b>12</b>, the operation device <b>13</b>, the pump <b>14</b>, the on-off valve <b>16</b>, and the pressure sensor <b>17</b>. Additionally, the control unit <b>55</b> controls the operations of the display device <b>12</b>, the pump <b>14</b>, and the on-off valve <b>16</b>, based on electrical signals output by the operation device <b>13</b> and the pressure sensor <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, the control unit <b>55</b> includes a main CPU that controls the operation of the overall blood pressure measurement device <b>1</b> and a sub-CPU that controls the operation of the fluid circuit <b>3</b>. Note that, for example, the control unit <b>55</b> may be configured to perform all the controls of the blood pressure measurement device <b>1</b> in one CPU. For example, the main CPU obtains measurement results, such as blood pressure values, for example, the systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure, and the heart rate, from the electrical signals output by the pressure sensor <b>17</b>, and outputs image signals corresponding to the measurement results to the display device <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, the sub-CPU drives the pump <b>14</b> and the on-off valve <b>16</b> to feed compressed air to the fluid circuit <b>3</b> when an instruction to measure the blood pressure is input from the operation device <b>13</b>. In addition, the sub-CPU controls driving and stop of the pump <b>14</b> and opening and closing of the on-off valve <b>16</b> based on the electrical signal output by the pressure sensor <b>17</b>. The sub-CPU controls the pump <b>14</b> and the on-off valve <b>16</b> to supply the compressed air to the fluid circuit <b>3</b> and selectively depressurize the fluid circuit <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thus, the control unit <b>55</b> configures a portion of all of the respective functions performed by the control unit <b>55</b> in hardware by, for example, one or a plurality of integrated circuits. For example, the control unit <b>55</b> includes the measurement processing unit <b>55</b><i>a. </i>For example, the measurement processing unit <b>55</b><i>a </i>controls the pump <b>14</b> and the on-off valve <b>16</b> to supply air to the fluid circuit <b>3</b>, and calculates the blood pressure by an oscillometric method based on the pressure of the sensing cuff <b>73</b> described later of the fluid circuit <b>3</b> detected by the pressure sensor <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The fluid circuit <b>3</b> includes a cuff structure <b>6</b>, a tube group <b>7</b>, and a fluid control unit <b>9</b>. The fluid circuit <b>3</b> fluidly connects the cuff structure <b>6</b> and the fluid control unit <b>9</b> by the tube group <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Note that when air is supplied from the pump <b>14</b> to the fluid circuit <b>3</b>, in the air flow, the pump <b>14</b> side (the device body <b>2</b> side) becomes the primary side and the fluid circuit <b>3</b> side becomes the secondary side. However, during exhaust, the on-off valve <b>16</b> side (the device body <b>2</b> side) becomes the secondary side and the fluid circuit <b>3</b> side becomes the primary side. However, in the description of the configuration of the fluid circuit <b>3</b>, for convenience of explanation, the primary side and the secondary side are defined based on the flow direction of air when the air is supplied from the pump <b>14</b> to the cuff structure <b>6</b> and the tube group <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The cuff structure <b>6</b> includes a plurality of cuffs. Here, the cuff is wrapped around, for example, a wrist of a living body to measure a blood pressure and includes a single or multi-layer bag-like structures that are inflated by being supplied with a fluid. The bag-like structure is inflated by fluid. In the present embodiment, since the fluid is air, the bag-like structure is an air bag.

The first cuff <b>71</b> is fluidly connected to the pump <b>14</b>. The first cuff <b>71</b> is inflated by the air from the pump <b>14</b>. The first cuff <b>71</b> is a pressing cuff that is inflated to press the second cuff <b>73</b> against the living body. Hereinafter, the first cuff <b>71</b> will be described as the pressing cuff <b>71</b>. The pressing cuff <b>71</b> is formed by, for example, stacking a plurality of fluidly connected air bags in the pressing direction of the second cuff <b>73</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The second cuff <b>73</b> is provided on the secondary side of the first cuff <b>71</b>.

The second cuff <b>73</b> is disposed in a region where the arteries <b>210</b> are present in the living body <b>200</b> when the blood pressure measurement device <b>1</b> is attached to the living body. The second cuff <b>73</b> is a sensing cuff for calculating the blood pressure in blood pressure measurement. Hereinafter, the second cuff <b>73</b> will be described as the sensing cuff <b>73</b>. The sensing cuff <b>73</b> is supplied with air and is pressed by the inflated pressing cuff <b>71</b> to compress the region where the arteries <b>210</b> are present in the living body <b>200</b> through the use of the inflated pressing cuff <b>71</b>.

Further, the example in which the fluid resistors <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>28</b> are orifices has been described. Here, the orifice is the flow rate resistor that reduces the pressure on the downstream side of the orifice when the fluid flows by reducing the flow path.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">Here, the increase in flow rate resistor of the orifice is remarkable as the flow rate resistor (fluid resistor) at low pressure increases due to an influence of viscosity and as the orifice diameter decreases. Therefore, by connecting the orifices having small orifice diameters in parallel, it is possible to obtain the flow rate resistor with high pressure dependence. Also, by connecting the orifices having large diameters in series, the flow rate resistor having low pressure dependence can be obtained. For example, the orifice diameters of the flow rate resistors disposed in series are set to be larger than the orifice diameters of the flow rate resistors disposed in parallel. In this way, setting the orifice diameters and the arrangement of the plurality of flow rate resistors allow configuring the fluid resistors <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>28</b> taking into account a pressure dependent effect.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">Thus, at least one of the two or more fluid resistors <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>28</b> used in the blood pressure measurement device <b>1</b> may be configured by combining a plurality of flow rate resistors as orifices. That is, the fluid resistors <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>25</b>, or <b>28</b> may have a configuration in which pressure dependence is appropriately set by disposing the plurality of flow rate resistors in series, in parallel, or a combination of in series and parallel.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">By providing the plurality of flow rate resistors in series, in parallel, or in series and parallel, the resistance values and the pressure dependence of the fluid resistors <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>28</b> can be arbitrarily set. In other words, by appropriately setting the plurality of flow rate resistors, the fluid control units <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>A, and <b>9</b>B can be strictly matched with required cuff properties. That is, in the differential pressure control of the fluid control units <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>A, and <b>9</b>B, depending on the pressure value in the cuff, a deviation between the differential pressure and the insufficient compression force of the pressing cuff possibly increases. However, by preferably setting the pressure dependence of the fluid resistors <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>28</b>, the blood pressure measurement device can set the arbitrary compression properties, such as decreasing or increasing the pressure of compressing the wrist <b>200</b> by the cuff structure <b>6</b>. Therefore, the deviation between the differential pressure and the insufficient compression force of the pressing cuff can be reduced regardless of the pressure value in the cuff, and the accuracy of blood pressure measurement by the blood pressure measurement device can be improved.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">Next, as an example of the blood pressure measurement device <b>1</b> including the first fluid resistor <b>21</b> and the second fluid resistor <b>22</b> using the plurality of orifices (flow rate resistors), the blood pressure measurement device <b>1</b> according to a twelfth embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is an explanatory view illustrating the blood pressure measurement device <b>1</b> according to the twelfth embodiment.
