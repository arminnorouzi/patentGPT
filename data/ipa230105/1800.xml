It should be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a photograph of a BIW <b>10</b> with a battery box <b>12</b> is shown. The battery box <b>12</b> extends between and along rails <b>14</b> of the BIW <b>10</b> and is mechanically coupled to the BIW <b>10</b> via the rails <b>14</b>. And though not shown in the figure, it should be understood that a plurality of battery modules that store and provide electric energy to at least one electric motor <b>16</b> are disposed within the battery box <b>12</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;rail&#x201d; or &#x201c;rails&#x201d; refers to for aft structural member that assists with energy absorption either by impact, durability or shock of the AEV.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an exploded view of a conventional battery box <b>20</b> is shown. The battery box <b>20</b> includes a plurality of battery box components such as a top cover panel <b>202</b>, a plurality of cross members <b>204</b>, cooling system panels <b>206</b>, and a frame <b>208</b> with a plurality of side walls <b>209</b>. In addition, the battery box <b>20</b> can include brackets and/or rails <b>210</b> for mounting to the frame <b>208</b> and to a BIW (not shown) and a lower shield panel <b>212</b> with transverse (y direction) supports <b>113</b>. In some variations one or more of the plurality of battery box components are formed from sheet metal, e.g., steel sheet metal or aluminum alloy sheet metal.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be understood that construction of the battery box <b>20</b> includes one more operations such as stamping to form one or more of the battery box components, hot stamping to form one or more of the battery box components, quenching of one or more of the hot stamped battery box components, bending one or more sheet metal pieces to form battery box components, and welding two or more of the battery box components together, among others. For example, in order to form the frame <b>208</b>, at least two of the side walls <b>209</b> are welded together. And to join and seal the lower shield panel <b>212</b> to the frame <b>208</b>, the lower shield panel <b>212</b> is welded to the frame <b>208</b> with or without additional sealant applied along the welds and corners between the two components. It should also be understood that each assembly operation required to construct the battery box <b>20</b> adds cost and possible dimensional variation to the assembly of the battery box <b>20</b>. Furthermore, the battery box <b>20</b> does not have or include external load bearting features to translate or absorb impact loads of an AEV.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a perspective view of another conventional battery box <b>30</b> configured to mount to a BIW <b>350</b> is shown. And similar to the battery box <b>20</b>, the battery box <b>30</b> includes a top cover panel (not shown), a plurality of cross members <b>304</b>, cooling system panels (not shown), a frame <b>308</b> with a plurality of side walls <b>309</b>, a pair of rails <b>310</b> for mounting to the BIW <b>350</b>, and a lower shield panel <b>312</b>. In some variations one or more of the plurality of battery box components are formed from sheet metal, e.g., steel sheet metal or aluminum alloy sheet metal. In addition, and in order to reduce the number of operations (e.g., welds) to form the battery box <b>30</b>, at least two corners <b>309</b><i>a </i>of the frame <b>308</b> are formed via plastic deformation of a single side wall <b>309</b> component (e.g., bending, draw bending or stamping) such that welding of the corners <b>309</b><i>a </i>is not required. However, forming the corners <b>309</b><i>a </i>in this manner requires the corners <b>309</b><i>a </i>to have a predefined radius &#x2018;R&#x2019; that reduces the storage capacity of the battery box <b>30</b>. That is, the radius R of the corners <b>309</b><i>a </i>reduces the volume of the battery box <b>30</b> and thereby reduces the volume of battery modules that can be held and stored in the battery box <b>30</b> (storage capacity) compared to the battery box <b>20</b> with &#x201c;sharp&#x201d; corners. Also, in some variations, the pair of rails <b>310</b> are formed as extruded rails for improved strength with factors such as alloy selection, billet heating, die design, die lubrication, and extrusion process parameters affecting the microstructure and cost of such extruded rails.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, a first portion <b>400</b> of a battery box <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) according to the teachings of the present disclosure is shown. In some variations the first portion <b>400</b> and is a lower half or lower compartment of the battery box <b>40</b>, while in other variations the first portion <b>400</b> is an upper half or upper compartment of the battery box <b>40</b>. And in contrast to the battery boxes <b>12</b>, <b>20</b>, and <b>30</b>, the first portion <b>400</b> is formed from a single lightweight casting such that assembly of a plurality of components to form the first portion <b>400</b> is not necessary. Also, and in contrast to the battery box <b>30</b>, the first portion does not include corners with a relatively large radius (e.g., compared to corners with generally a 90&#xb0; angle) such that the storage capacity of the battery box <b>40</b> is enhanced or increased compared to the battery box <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first portion <b>400</b> includes a bottom wall <b>402</b>, a side wall <b>404</b>, a plurality of cross members <b>406</b> that form a plurality of battery compartments <b>408</b> to hold and store a plurality of battery modules <b>500</b>, and a pair of rails <b>410</b> for mounting or securely attaching the first portion <b>400</b> to a BIW (not shown) or chassis rails of an AEV.
