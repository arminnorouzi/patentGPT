A coatings roller cover can be attached over the roller cage and used to apply coatings to a surface. The roller cage and roller cover rotate smoothly to allow the roller cover to distribute the coating effectively. It is desirable to allow the roller cover to be removed from the coatings roller, but for the roller cage to remain captured on the frame wire.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">To achieve these objectives, coatings rollers can have bearings fixed to the frame wire, which promote smooth rotation of the roller cage around the bearings, while also acting as a stop to mitigate accidental removal of the roller cage from the frame wire. There are few common ways that the bearings can be fixed to the frame wire. As an example, peening, swedging, pinning, or threading may be used in combination with or without a washer to hold the bearings on the frame.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Using these types of methods and techniques can potentially weaken and reduce the structural integrity and strength of the frame wire.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, forming a hole in the frame wire for the use of a pin, or deforming the frame wire to create a catch may reduce the structural integrity of the frame wire. This can lead to failure of the frame wire when, for example, a longer roller cage and roller cover are being used, heavier product is being used in conjunction with the roller cover, and/or if the user is applying a greater force on the coatings roller.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One or more techniques and systems are described herein for a coatings roller assembly, including a coatings roller frame and a roller cage. The roller assembly can comprise a handle coupled with a wire frame configured to operably hold a roller cage. Bearings can be fixed to the roller frame at a first and second end. Instead of using typical pinning or swedging techniques for holding the bearing, a sleeve can be crimped into place over a treated surface of the wire frame at the first end. In this way, for example, the structural integrity of the wire frame can be substantially maintained, providing for improved durability and a longer life for the roller assembly.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one implementation of coatings application roller cage apparatus a frame wire can comprise a first end and second end, a first bend, second bend, and third bend, a treated portion comprising a roughened surface between the second end and third bend. Further, in this implementation, the roller cage apparatus can comprise a swedge disposed proximate the third bend between the second end and third bend of the frame wire. An inner bearing and outer bearing can be fixed to the frame wire to operably mitigate rotation around the frame wire. A sleeve can be fixedly crimped onto the treated portion, the inner bearing disposed between the sleeve and the swedge. Additionally, an inner bushing can be operably disposed on the inner bearing, and an outer bushing can be disposed on the outer bearing. A roller cage can be disposed over the inner bushing and outer bushing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations.

In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Systems and techniques can be devised for creating a roller cage assembly that uses a crimped sleeve disposed over a treated surface of a wire frame to operably hold roller bearings in place. In one aspect, a coatings roller assembly can comprise a coatings roller frame and a roller cage, where the roller frame comprises a frame wire. In this aspect, the frame wire can comprise a sleeve that is crimped or otherwise secured into place along the roller frame. In one implementation, the crimped sleeve can provide for more effective retention of an inner bearing and, thus the roller cage on the frame wire. As an example, capturing the roller cage on the frame wire using the sleeve can mitigate compromising the integrity and strength of the frame wire. In this example, improved strength can reduce incidence of failure during use. As a result, longer, heavier, and more robust frame wires and roller cages can be created and used by the one or more apparatus described herein. The increased strength may also allow for the use of heavier products in combination with the coatings roller.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Accordingly, in one implementation, the coatings roller assembly can comprise the roller frame, the roller cage, the frame wire, a handle, the inner bearing, an outer bearing, an inner bushing, and an outer bushing. In this implementation, the frame wire has a first end, a second end, a first bend, a second bend, and a third bend. A sleeve can be engaged with the frame wire (e.g., by sliding it over the second end of the frame wire), and the sleeve can be positioned at a desired location along the frame wire between the second end of the frame wire and the third bend in the frame wire. The sleeve can be fixedly engaged the wire, such as by crimping it into place in the desired position. As one example, an initial shape of the sleeve may be annular or ring-like, with an internal diameter larger than the external diameter of the frame wire. In this example, after the sleeve is crimped it can comprise a polygonal (e.g. hexagonal) shape. As an example, a hexagonal shape can provide six locations where a friction force fit is applied to the frame wire. Further, determining that the polygonal shape (e.g. hexagonal crimp shape) has been created in accordance with a desired specification (e.g., amount of desired force applying a specified shape and size) may be determined by applying a shaped tool (e.g., a hexagonally shaped tool). For example, the tool can comprise a void shaped and sized to accommodate a properly crimped sleeve. In this example, if the crimped sleeve fits within the shaped void of the tool, the crimp can be considered to have been created properly. As an example, the sleeve can be crimped using a hydraulic press, or other suitable means. Additionally, the sleeve can be formed from aluminum, or other suitable metals, such as steel, bronze, brass, etc.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one implementation, in order to improve mechanical interference between the frame wire and the sleeve, the frame wire can be treated. As an example, the frame wire surface can be treated by knurling the surface, or otherwise roughing the surface using such processes and tools, for example, as striations and rings. Other mechanical or chemical processes may be used to treat the surface of the frame wire to improve friction fit with the sleeve. Increasing the friction and physical contact between the inner surface of the sleeve and the outer surface of the frame wire can help improve the strength of the connection, and thus improve the ability of the sleeve to hold the roller cage on the frame wire. In one implementation, the surface treatment can be performed merely in the area over which the sleeve is to be positioned. For example, the appropriate crimp strength and desired sleeve deformation, needed to create the strong capture of the roller cage on the frame wire, can be achieved without fracturing or breaking the sleeve in the crimping process.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is to be appreciated that there are other ways, or other combinations of ways, of attaching the sleeve to the frame wire. For example, soldering, welding, an adhesive or glue, various forms of interference fits, dissimilar materials - such as a plastic to metal connection, a collar in combination with an Allen key, or a process to treat a plastic sleeve whereby the sleeve is heated to allow it to expand and then to shrink around the frame wire as it cools, may be used. An adhesion promotor may also be used in combination with any of these methods.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one implementation of manutacturing a roller cage assembly, prior to assembling the sleeve on the frame wire, a portion of the surface of the frame wire can be treated (e.g., roughened). The treated portion can comprise the location on the frame wire that the sleeve will be placed, such as near the third bend, along a long straight portion where the roller frame is operably disposed. Further, in this implementation, a swedge can be formed or placed proximate the third bend of the frame wire. As an example, the swedge can be formed by crimping or pressing a portion of the surface of the frame wire to create at least one raised portion (e.g., an ear) on the wire. As an example, the swedge can mitigate translation of the inner bearing toward the third bend, and mitigate rotation of the bearing without potential weakening of the structure of the frame wire. In one example, the swedge can be located along the frame wire between the area of the surface that is treated with the knurling and the third bend.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some implementations, a washer can be disposed on the wire frame proximate the swedge. For example, the washer may be placed over the second end (e.g., slid over) and positioned at the swedge. Further, in this implementation, the inner bearing can be placed on the frame wire, for example, by sliding it over the second end of the frame wire and positioned along the frame wire until it is stopped by the washer and/or the swedge, which has been placed or formed proximate the third bend. In some implementations, the bearing may engage a portion of the swedge to mitigate rotation of the bearing around the wire. For example, in order to receive the ear of the swedge, the inner bearing can be formed with at least one cut-out within an inner surface of the inner bearing. In this implementation, the cut-out can be shaped such that the ear can slot into the cut-out and hold the inner bearing in the desired position, angularly and axially.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one implementation, with the inner bushing disposed on the frame wire, the (e.g. initially ring-shaped) sleeve can be placed on the frame wire (e.g., by sliding over the second end of the frame wire), and positioned over the treated (e.g., knurled) area of the frame wire, and crimped to deform the sleeve to the desired shape (e.g. hexagonal). In this implementation, the inner bearing is fixed to the frame wire by the swedge and the sleeve (e.g., and washer). In this way, for example, the bushing is fixed to the frame wire such that rotation of the bearing is mitigated during operation, and the strength and integrity of the frame wire is maintained.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, in some implementations, the inner bushing can be disposed over a cylindrical portion of the inner bearing, to provide a smooth surface that promotes rotation of the inner bushing, and thus the roller cage. In these implementations, the inner bushing can be place on the frame and engaged with the inner bearing. For example, the inner bushing can be placed (e.g., slid) over the second end of the frame wire, and disposed on the bearing at a desired position between the second end of the frame wire and the third bend.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some implementations, a hole can be formed through the frame wire proximate the second end. For example, the hole can extend perpendicular to the axis of the frame wire and can have a cylindrical cross-section. In this implementation, the outer bearing can comprise a matching hole that aligns with the hole on either side of the frame wire. The outer bearing can be disposed on the second end of the frame wire and can be positioned to align the holes of the outer bearing with the hole in the frame wire. In this implementation, a pin can be inserted through the holes in the outer bearing and the hole in frame wire, thereby fixing the outer bearing angularly and axially to the frame wire. As an example, forming a hole in the frame wire may be less of a concern when disposed proximate the second end of the frame wire because there may be less of a moment arm operably created in the frame wire at the hole the further away the hole is from the third bend. Fixing the outer bearing can mitigate translation of the roller cage toward the third bend, and/or off the second end.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one implementation, the roller cage can be disposed on the frame wire, for example, by sliding it over the second end of the frame wire, over the outer bearing, and over the inner bearing. In this implementation, an inner end of the roller cage can be press-fit into the inner bushing disposed at the inner bearing. For example, the outer surface of the inner bushing and the inner surface of the inner end of the roller cage can have complimentary formations, (e.g., tabs and recesses) to promote secure interlocking of the inner bushing and the roller cage. Further, the outer bushing can be rotatably disposed on a cylinder of the outer bearing, which promotes smooth rotation of the outer bushing and roller cage on the outer bearing, proximate the second end of the frame wire. In one example, the outer end of the roller cage can be press-fit into the outer bushing. Further, in an example, the outer surface of the outer bushing and the inner surface of the outer end of the roller cage can have complimentary formations to promote secure interlocking of the outer bushing and the roller cage.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other examples, the connections of the inner bushing and the outer bushing to the roller cage may be opposite the previous example. In such other examples, the bushings can be press-fit into the ends of the roller cage. In these examples, the outer surfaces of the roller cage, and the inner surfaces of the bushings may have complimentary formations (e.g., tabs and recesses) to promote secure interlocking of the bushings and the roller cage.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one implementation, the roller cage may comprise a dog-bone shape, which tapers in the middle. In some implementations, the roller cage may comprise a cylindrical shape. In one example, the roller cage may be one of the known lengths, such as approximately nine inches, or nine-and-a-half inches. In another example, the roller cage may comprise a length of approximately fourteen inches. The length of the frame wire between the third bend and the second end may be greater than or equal to the length of the fully assembled roller cage (e.g. roller cage with the bushing attached at either end).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one implementation, a roller cover may be operably, removeably attached to the roller cage by sliding it over the second end of the frame wire, over the outer bushing, and along the length of the roller cage until an inner end of the roller cover is aligned with an inner end of the inner bushing. In one example, the roller cover may be equal to the length of the fully assembled roller cage.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one implementation, the frame wire may be configured to reduce the weight of the coatings roller assembly. As an example, the frame wire may be comprised of aluminum, steel, or other appropriate metals. In some implementations, a steel wire may be coated with zinc or chrome, which may improve the strength and/or corrosion resistance of the frame wire. Further, in one example, the frame wire may have a thickness of three-eighths of an inch, five-sixteenths of an inch, or any other suitable thickness for the given application. Improving the strength of the frame wire by using zinc- or chrome-coated steel, in combination with using a lesser thickness, may produce a more durable frame while also retaining, or improving, the light-weight nature of the coatings roller assembly.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one implementation, a handle may be attached to the first end of the frame wire. Any means for interlocking the frame wire to the handle within the sound judgment of those of skill in the art may be used. In one example, the handle may have a first end defining a chamber which is configured to receive the first end of the frame wire and a length of the frame wire between the first end of the frame wire and the first bend. In some examples, the first end of the frame wire or the frame wire proximate the first end may have a handle engagement portion configured to secure the wire frame to the handle. The handle engagement portion may be a sleeve, which surrounds the frame wire. The sleeve may be attached by any suitable means, such as heat-shrinking or an adhesive. In one example, an interlocking ball pin may be embedded within the tirst end of the wire frame by a swedge to engage the sleeve. In some examples, the sleeve may include ribs designed to engage corresponding ribs positioned within the chamber of the handle. In another example, the handle engagement portion may have external threads configured to engage corresponding internal threads in the chamber of the handle. In another example, the frame wire may be press-fit directly into the chamber of the handle. The chamber and handle may also be heated for attachment with the handle engagement portion and consequently allowed to shrink around the handle engagement portion as the chamber and handle cool.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one implementation, the second end of the handle may be designed to engage an insert. In one example, the insert may be threadably or adhesively engages with the handle. The insert may also be press-fitted into the handle. Further, for example, the insert may include internal treads designed to engage complimentary external threads on an extension pole. The extension pole may be engaged the handle to provide increased reachability to the user.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, comprising a component diagram of an exemplary apparatus <b>100</b> in accordance with one or more portions of one or more systems described herein.

As another example, the roughed surface can comprise an abraded area that is formed into the surface of the frame wire <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As illustrated, a first stop <b>116</b> is disposed on the frame wire <b>102</b> proximate to the third bend <b>112</b>, between the second end <b>106</b> and the third bend <b>112</b>. In some implementations the first stop <b>116</b> can comprise a swedge that is formed (e.g., pressed, welded, crimped, molded, etc.) into the frame wire <b>102</b>. In another implementation, the first stop <b>116</b> can comprise a pinned arrangement, such as a pin disposed through a via in the frame wire <b>102</b>.

That is, for example, the treated portion <b>114</b> can be formed onto the frame wire <b>102</b>, a sleeve or ring can be fitted over the treated portion <b>114</b>, and the sleeve or ring can be crimped in place to form a fixedly engaged second stop <b>118</b> on the frame wire <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some implementations, the treated portion <b>114</b> can comprise an area that is sized merely to fit the second stop <b>118</b>, such that the second stop <b>118</b> covers most or all of the treated portion <b>114</b>. In some implementations, the treated portion <b>114</b> can comprise a coating that provides an adherence surface for the second stop <b>118</b> on the wire frame <b>102</b>. That is, for example, an adhesive can be applied at the treated portion <b>114</b>, and the second stop (e.g., sleeve) can be fit over the treated portion <b>114</b>, and then second stop <b>118</b> can be fixed in place by crimping. In this way, for example, a crimped sleeve may provide for an improved adherence to the frame wire <b>102</b> in combination with the treated portion, such as using the roughened area or adhesive coated area. As an example, a sleeve can be crimped onto a patterned area of the frame wire <b>102</b> to provide improved fixed engagement of the sleeve, for longer use life of the apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A, and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the example apparatus can comprise an inner bearing <b>120</b> that is engaged with the frame wire <b>102</b>.

That is, for example, the first stop <b>116</b> and second stop <b>118</b> provide stops to the bearing with regard to lateral movement along the frame wire <b>102</b>. In this example, the second stop <b>118</b> can mitigate lateral movement of the inner bearing <b>120</b> along the frame wire <b>102</b> toward the second end <b>106</b>, and the first stop <b>116</b> can mitigate lateral movement of the inner bearing <b>120</b> along the frame wire <b>102</b> toward the third bend <b>112</b>.

In this example, a body portion <b>352</b> of an example bearing <b>320</b> can comprise one or more slots <b>354</b>. In this example, the slots <b>354</b> can be configured to be complementary to the swedge(s) formed in the frame wire <b>102</b>, such that the bearing body <b>352</b> can engage with, and slide over the swedge(s). In this way, for example, during operation the engagement of the slots <b>354</b> in body <b>352</b> with the swedge(s) <b>316</b> can prevent the bearing <b>320</b> from rotating around the frame wire <b>302</b>. As an example, this type of complementary arrangement of the bearing <b>320</b> with the first stop (e.g., swedges <b>316</b>) may facilitate manufacturing of the apparatus <b>300</b>, such that a bearing <b>320</b> can be easily slid onto the frame wire from the second end, and engage with the swedges <b>316</b> (e.g., of other complementary stop). In other implementations, the bearing body <b>352</b> can be heat pressed onto the swedges <b>316</b> such that the body <b>352</b> is formed onto the swedge <b>316</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>4</b></figref>, a coating applicator cage frame <b>122</b> can be disposed over the inner bearing <b>120</b> to operably rotate with rotation of the inner bearing <b>120</b>.
