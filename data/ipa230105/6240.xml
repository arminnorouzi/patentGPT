In addition to supporting ionic transport between a cathode and anode, the material limits electrical contact of the two components to prevent electrical shorting between cathode and anode materials. Battery separators may be formulated by balancing a number of characteristics of the component. For example, battery separators may include materials selected based on compatibility with electrode materials or electrolyte materials, electrochemical stability, thermal stability, flexibility, and other factors. Battery separators can include combinations of components as well. For example, woven polymeric separators are sometimes utilized in battery designs because of the porosity provided. An issue with woven polymeric separators, however, is that they may be less thermally stable, and may shrink during operation or during abuse conditions, which may lead to shorting. More thermally stable designs may include non-woven polymers and/or ceramic separators. However, these designs may lose mechanical flexibility and have reduced permeability, and may require increased thicknesses due to manufacturing limitations. For example, ceramic separators having a thickness less than a few dozen micrometers may exhibit a brittle structure reducing handling capability. Ceramic separators may also lack a shutdown capability allowing the separator to limit or reduce ionic transfer between electrodes during abuse conditions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Conventional technologies have been limited to utilizing ceramic separators with technologies that allow for increased thickness. For example, many conventional mobile devices may not include ceramic separators due to constraints on the thickness of a separator, which may be half the thickness needed for ceramic stand-alone separators. As many electrode assembly operations utilize roll-to-roll or winding processes, ceramic separators may be incapable of winding unless maintained above a few dozen micrometers in thickness. Additionally, the dense ceramic structure may be characterized by reduced air permeability and lower ionic transport rates, which may affect operation of the produced batteries. Ceramic separators may also be characterized by limited adhesion with the electrode active material. Without sufficient adhesion, the active material may swell during operation or produce dendrites affecting cycle life of the produced battery.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present technology may overcome these issues by forming separators including multiple layers including a first layer having a ceramic material, and a second layer including an adhesive. The layers may be formed directly over additional cell materials, which may act as a support for the ceramic material. This may produce battery cell components that may be wound, while being characterized by reduced thicknesses over conventional materials. Separators according to some embodiments of the present technology may also include additional features including porogens or microencapsulated materials providing additional improvements over conventional materials. Accordingly, the present technology provides separators characterized by improved thermal stability and other operational characteristics compared to conventional designs.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present technology additionally addresses issues related to formation of ceramic materials. As surface area increases with ceramic materials, manufacturing may become more difficult as issues related to aggregation of particulate matter may increase. By utilizing materials that may include particular characteristics, and/or by producing the ceramic materials in controlled manufacturing processes, the present technology may produce improved ceramic materials. The materials may be characterized by slurries having improved uniformity, viscosity, and deposition characteristics, which may allow ceramic materials of reduced thickness to be produced. These ceramic materials may be used as standalone separators, or may be used in combination separators of reduced thickness. These improved manufacturing processes may also be applicable in a variety of other industries that may use or include thin film ceramic materials, as well as in general manufacturing of ceramic materials where the present techniques may be useful.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although the remaining portions of the description will routinely reference lithium-ion batteries, it will be readily understood by the skilled artisan that the technology is not so limited. The present designs may be employed with any number of battery or energy storage devices, including other rechargeable and primary, or non-rechargeable, battery types, as well as electrochemical capacitors also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors.

Aspects of the present technology may further be utilized in additional industries in which ceramic materials may be used. Accordingly, the disclosure and claims are not to be considered limited to any particular example discussed, but can be utilized broadly with any number of devices that may exhibit some or all of the electrical or chemical characteristics of the discussed examples.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an exemplary energy storage device <b>100</b> according to some embodiments of the present technology.

In some examples, electrode active material <b>115</b> is an anode material and includes a carbon-containing compound such as graphite or a lithium-containing compound such as lithium titanate.

The separator may be positioned between active materials for an anode and a cathode in embodiments, and may be formed directly over an electrode active material <b>205</b>. In some embodiments an additional layer, such as a polymer layer may be disposed between the electrode active material <b>205</b> and the separator. Exemplary separator <b>200</b> is characterized by a first separator layer <b>210</b>, and a second separator layer <b>260</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">First separator layer <b>210</b> includes one or more materials including a ceramic material in some embodiments. Incorporating a ceramic material into the separator structure may afford dimensional stability as well as reduced thermal shrinkage. When incorporated as a particulate material, ceramics may include a platelet structure, which may increase tortuosity through the separator structure, or reduce porosity. Both pore size and pore structure relate to the ease with which ions, such as lithium ions, for example, may pass through the separator structure. The more tortuous the path through the structure, the more cycling rate capability may be reduced. Accordingly, first separator layer <b>210</b> is not completely composed of ceramic materials in some embodiments, or may include additional materials that allow porosity to be adjusted within the first separator layer <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, a binder is included in the first separator layer with the ceramic materials, which provides a structure that maintains particular ion throughput characteristics for the separator. As illustrated within an unspecified spacing <b>225</b>, binder material <b>220</b> may form polymer chains among ceramic particles <b>215</b>. The ceramic particles <b>215</b> and the binder <b>220</b> are the materials composing the first separator layer in some embodiments, while in some embodiments additional materials may also be included in the first separator layer <b>210</b>. When the ceramic particles and binder substantially make up the first separator layer, the ceramic particles may be included at greater than or about 40 wt. % of the first separator layer, and in embodiments the ceramic particles may be included at greater than or about 50 wt. %, greater than or about 60 wt. %, greater than or about 70 wt. %, greater than or about 80 wt. %, greater than or about 90 wt. %, greater than or about 95 wt. %, or more of the first separator layer, with the balance being the binder material and/or additional components of the first separator layer when included.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, in embodiments the binder is included at less than or about 60 wt. % of the first separator layer. In some embodiments, the binder may be included at less than or about 50 wt. %, less than or about 40 wt. %, less than or about 30 wt. %, less than or about 20 wt. %, less than or about 10 wt. %, less than or about 5 wt. %, or less of the first separator layer, with the balance being the ceramic particles, and/or any additional components that may be included in the first separator layer.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Binders utilized with the present technology may be characterized by a glass transition temperature above operational temperatures of the battery cell. By utilizing binders having a higher glass transition temperature, separators according to the present technology are characterized by improved thermal and dimensional stability in embodiments, and are less prone to shrinking over cell lifetime or during abuse conditions, or may shrink to a lesser degree than separators including binders characterized by a lower glass transition temperature. In some embodiments, one or more including all binders utilized in the first separator layer may be characterized by a glass transition temperature greater than or about 100&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Combinations of materials, amounts of materials, and characteristics of the materials themselves may produce binders characterized by a glass transition temperature of any temperature within any particular range over 100&#xb0; C., or within smaller ranges, such as between about 190&#xb0; C. and about 300&#xb0; C. or less, in some embodiments. By utilizing binders characterized by higher glass transition temperatures, produced first separator layers may be characterized by reduced flexibility or ductility compared to layers produced with other binders. However, the amount and types of binders may be modified, functionalized, or adjusted to limit cracking or other issues related to malleability, while still maintaining the desired thermal and dimensional stability characteristics.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A variety of materials may be used as binders according to the present technology. Binders may include any polymeric materials that may be characterized by any of the previously noted glass transition temperatures, compatibility with the ceramic particles, or chemical or electrochemical stability with electrolyte materials that may be used within battery cells. Exemplary materials that may be used or included with binders of the present technology may include polyimides. The polyimides may be linear or include aromatic moieties, and may include semi-aromatic polyimides. Exemplary polyimides may also be modified to incorporate additional functional moieties including carboxylate moieties, for example. The binder materials may also include polyamides, which may also be aliphatic, semi-aromatic, or otherwise include aromatic moieties such as aramids. Exemplary materials may include amorphous polymers, such as polyamide imides, for example, or other polymeric materials that are characterized by glass transition temperatures as discussed above, and exhibit other properties suitable for battery cells according to the present technology.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Ceramic materials that may be incorporated with the binders for the first separator layer <b>210</b> may include any ceramic that may afford additional dimensional stability to the separator design. The ceramic materials may include oxides, nitrides, carbides, hydroxides, and titanates of a number of materials. Exemplary elements for these compounds may be or include barium, copper, tin, strontium, boron, iron, lead, zirconium, chromium, magnesium, silicon, aluminum, titanium, yttrium, or zinc, and may include any of these materials at any oxidation state. For example, exemplary ceramic materials may include oxides or nitrides of any of the noted elements, and may include aluminum nitride, aluminum oxide, including alpha, beta, and gamma classes of aluminum, boron nitride, including hexagonal crystalline form, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, silicon nitride, silicon aluminum oxynitride or Sialon, as well as any other ceramic materials or combination.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">By producing separators according to embodiments of the present technology, reduced thickness separators may be produced compared to conventional ceramic separators. For example, while conventional standalone ceramic separators may be limited to thicknesses greater than or about 20 &#x3bc;m, the present technology may produce separators, including one or both of separator layers <b>210</b> and <b>260</b>, and/or an additional 15 layer between the first layer <b>210</b> and electrode active layer <b>205</b>, that are less than or about 30 &#x3bc;m in thickness, and may be characterized by a thickness of less than or about 25 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 20 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 18 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 16 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 15 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 14 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 13 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 12 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 11 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 10 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 9 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 8 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 7 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 6 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 5 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 4 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 3 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 2 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 1 &#x3bc;m, or less in embodiments. Additionally, by forming the separator layers directly over electrode materials or current collectors as described further below, separators according to embodiments of the present technology may be wound into rolls of materials that may be later processed into particular cell form factors and configurations. When ceramic separators are formed over a liner, such as with conventional devices, the thickness is often limited to a minimum above a few dozen micrometers to allow adequate handling of the produced separator. Once the liner or carrier film is removed, the separator is then placed in a cell. The present technology is not limited in this respect, because the ceramic layer may be formed directly over the electrode active material, or a polymeric film, which may also provide the benefit of allowing the composite product to be wound during fabrication.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Exemplary first separator layer <b>210</b> may also include one or more additional components, such as porogen <b>240</b> or microencapsulated material <b>250</b>. Porogen <b>240</b> may be included within the layer to allow additional porosity to be produced during fabrication. For example, porogen <b>240</b> may include a low-molecular-weight polymer or monomer that may evaporate when exposed to an energy source, such as ultraviolet light, an e-beam, or a heat source. By adjusting the wavelength or intensity of the energy source, more or less porogen may be dissolved, which may adjust the porosity and tortuosity through the separator layer. Accordingly, porosity and air permeability may be maintained to facilitate ionic transportation through exemplary battery cell separators of the present technology. In some embodiments, a porogen may not be incorporated. For example, depending on the ceramic material utilized, such as gamma alumina as one non-limiting example, the porosity through the separator layer may be sufficient, and additional porosity through porogen dissolution may not be performed, although in some embodiments incorporation of porogen or a lesser inclusion may be performed.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Exemplary separators according to the present technology may be characterized by a porosity greater than or about 15%, and may be characterized by a porosity greater than or about 20%, greater than or about 30%, greater than or about 40%, greater than or about 50%, greater than or about 60%, greater than or about 70%, greater than or about 80%, or more, although porosity may be maintained below or about 85%, below or about 80%, below or about 75%, below or about 70%, below or about 65%, or below or about 60% or less, to provide adequate control over transfer across the separator. Porosity may also be maintained within any range encompassed by any of these ranges or between any two noted or encompassed percentages.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As noted previously, air permeability may be related to porosity and pore tortuosity across a thickness of the separator, which may affect ionic transfer across the separator during operation in a battery cell. Air permeability may be measured as the time in seconds to pass 100 cubic centimeters of air across the separator. Separators according to the present technology may be characterized by air permeability across the separator of less than or about 400 s/100 cc. In some embodiments, the separator may be characterized by air permeability of less than or about 350 s/100 cc, less than or about 300 s/100 cc, less than or about 250 s/100 cc, less than or about 200 s/100 cc, less than or about 150 s/100 cc, less than or about 100 s/100 cc, less than or about 50 s/100 cc, or less. Any of the air permeability numbers may relate to any number of separator components or layers as well as any thickness of the separator or individual layers.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">First separator layer <b>210</b> also includes a microencapsulated material <b>250</b> in some embodiments. Dispersed throughout the first separator layer <b>210</b>, microencapsulated material <b>250</b> may provide an additional feature to cause shutdown of ionic transfer during abuse events. Because ceramic materials may be characterized by high thermal stability, the separator may maintain functionality during these events. Microencapsulated material <b>250</b> may operate to fill pores of the first separator layer <b>210</b>, which may reduce, limit, or halt ionic transfer across the separator. For example, microencapsulated material <b>250</b> may include a first material <b>252</b> contained within a second material <b>254</b>. The second material <b>254</b> may form a shell about the first material <b>252</b>, which may be a flowable material. The second material <b>254</b> may be characterized by a breakdown temperature, which may be a melting temperature in some embodiments, although the breakdown temperature may also be a temperature at which the first material <b>252</b> may be expressed from the second material <b>254</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The breakdown temperature may be based on a cell operation temperature in some embodiments. For example, for cell designs configured to operate at temperatures below 100&#xb0; C., the breakdown temperature may be greater than 100&#xb0; C. The breakdown temperature may also be a relative temperature to the cell operating temperature, such as a temperature at least about 10&#xb0; C. above the cell operating temperature, at least about 20&#xb0; C. above the cell operating temperature, at least about 30&#xb0; C. above the cell operating temperature, at least about 40&#xb0; C. above the cell operating temperature, at least about 50&#xb0; C. above the cell operating temperature, or higher. Once the first material <b>252</b> is released from the second material <b>254</b>, the first material may flow within the first separator layer <b>210</b> to fill pores within the structure, and block ionic movement across the separator.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Second separator layer <b>260</b>, may be included along the first separator layer <b>210</b> opposite the electrode material <b>205</b>. Binders and ceramics utilized in separators according to the present technology may provide reduced adhesion to electrode active materials utilized in the cell. During cell cycling, as the active materials may swell, interfacial issues may extend without adequate adhesion between the separator and the electrode. This may allow further swelling, which may affect capacity or other capabilities of the battery cell. By incorporating an additional adhesive material, which may be second separator layer <b>260</b> or material included within the layer, the present technology may overcome issues related to binders characterized by improved thermal stability.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Exemplary adhesives may include a variety of adhesive materials that may couple or bond with both the first separator layer <b>210</b> of the separator as well as an adjacent electrode active material. Suitable adhesives may include multiple adhesive materials including polymeric materials. Exemplary polymeric materials may be materials including acetate, acrylate, vinyl groups, styrene, or any other materials that may be utilized according to the present technology. For example, exemplary adhesives may include acrylate and/or polyvinylidene fluoride (&#x201c;PVDF&#x201d;), including poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene), the morphology of which may be controlled to limit reductions in porosity. For example, the adhesives may be provided in ovular or spherical as well as other shaped segments, which allow additional spacing between adhesive particles. In some embodiments the second separator layer <b>260</b> may also be applied discontinuously across the surface of the first separator layer <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Exemplary adhesive particles may be characterized by a diameter of less than or about one micrometer in embodiments, and may be characterized by a diameter of less than or about 900 nm, less than or about 800 nm, less than or about 700 nm, less than or about 600 nm, less than or about 500 nm, less than or about 400 nm, less than or about 300 nm, less than or about 200 nm, less than or about 100 nm, or less. Additionally, the adhesive may be applied so as to further limit the effect on porosity or air permeability. For example, the second separator layer <b>260</b> may be staggered, or patch coated, along a surface of the first separator layer <b>210</b>. In non-limiting embodiments, the second separator layer may be particles, lines, or other shapes of adhesive particles formed across the surface of the first separator layer.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When an additional adhesive is applied along a surface of the separator, the adhesive may block or otherwise affect the pores through the separator. This may affect air permeability, which may be related to rate capability of a battery cell in which the separator may be disposed. By utilizing any of a number of forms of discontinuous coating, the adhesive may be incorporated to reduce an impact on porosity and permeability, while providing sufficient adhesion to an electrode active material. Additionally, when the adhesive particles include a rounded, ovular, or spherical shape, gaps may be maintained about particles included in the adhesive layer. This may allow separators according to embodiments of the present technology to maintain any of the porosity or air permeability characteristics described previously.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Discontinuous coatings may be formed in any number of ways as noted above, such as with various coating techniques. Additionally, loading of the adhesive, or the amount of adhesive deposited, may be adjusted to create more of a patched distribution of adhesive, which may produce a non-uniform coating affording increased porosity and permeability. For example, lower loading of adhesive may be applied, such as in a sputtered application, to limit uniformity. The loading may be less than or about 10 g/m<sup>2</sup>, and in some embodiments the loading may be less than or about 9 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 8 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 7 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 6 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 5 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 4 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 3 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 2 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 1 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 0.9 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 0.8 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 0.7 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 0.6 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 0.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 0.4 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 0.3 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 0.2 g/m<sup>2</sup>, less than or about 0.1 g/m<sup>2</sup>, or less.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a ceramic material layer <b>300</b> that may be formed as a standalone film, or may be formed over a polymeric film, and which may be used in separators according to some embodiments of the present technology, as well as additional applications for which thin ceramic films may be useful. Ceramic material layer <b>300</b> may include any or all of the aspects, materials, or characteristics of separator <b>200</b> in some embodiments, and may be utilized in battery cells, such as cell <b>100</b> discussed above. For example, ceramic material layer <b>300</b> may include a combination material layer <b>310</b> that may incorporate one or more ceramic particles <b>315</b>, and binders <b>320</b> within unspecified spacing <b>325</b>. In some embodiments ceramic material layer <b>300</b> may also include an adhesive material <b>360</b> similar to adhesive material <b>260</b> described above. These embodiments may include when the ceramic material layer <b>300</b> is used as or in a separator, such as for a battery, or other material for which additional adhesion capabilities may be included, although adhesive material <b>360</b> may not be used in embodiments including in some battery separator designs.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments ceramic material layer <b>300</b> may include particular materials configured to provide selected characteristics to the layer. For example, ceramic particles <b>315</b> may differ from, or be a subset of, ceramic particles <b>215</b>, and may be specifically ceramic particles that alone or in combination produce or are characterized by a particular surface area. For example, different ceramic materials may be characterized by a range of surface areas, including within individual material oxides. As one non-limiting example, aluminum oxide may include various crystalline structure phases including alpha, gamma, chi, kappa, theta, eta, and delta, for example. These phases may not be characterized by similar surface areas, however, and may affect the operation and manufacturing of ceramic material layer <b>300</b>. For example, while particles of alpha aluminum oxide may be characterized by a surface area of approximately 8 m<sup>2</sup>/g, particles of gamma aluminum oxide may be characterized by a surface area of over 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Other materials and ceramics as described previously may be characterized by similar properties. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the ceramic materials used in ceramic material layer <b>300</b> may be characterized by a surface area, either individually or in combination, of greater than or about 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g, greater than or about 20 m<sup>2</sup>/g, greater than or about 30 m<sup>2</sup>/g, greater than or about 40 m<sup>2</sup>/g, greater than or about 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g, greater than or about 60 m<sup>2</sup>/g, greater than or about 70 m<sup>2</sup>/g, greater than or about 80 m<sup>2</sup>/g, greater than or about 90 m<sup>2</sup>/g, greater than or about 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g, or greater.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Ceramic materials utilized in the present technology may also afford additional benefits for the ceramic material layer <b>300</b>, including scavenging capabilities in some embodiments. For example, in lithium-ion battery cells, certain chemical reactions may occur between electrolytic components and components included in the anode or cathode active materials. These reactions may produce gaseous materials such as hydrogen fluoride. Production of hydrogen fluoride or other gaseous components may cause the battery cell to swell. Without binding the present technology to any particular theory of operation, some ceramic materials may operate to adsorb hydrogen fluoride to the surface of the ceramic, which may reduce or limit swelling of the battery cell. As surface area increases, the adsorption capabilities may increase as well. Returning to the non-limiting example of alpha and gamma alumina, alpha phase alumina, characterized by a lower surface area, may be capable of adsorbing less than 2 mg HF/g of ceramic. However, gamma phase alumina, characterized by a higher surface area, may be capable of adsorbing greater than 7 mg HF/g of ceramic. Other materials and ceramics as described previously may be characterized by similar properties. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the ceramic materials used in ceramic material layer <b>300</b> may be characterized by a scavenging capability with respect to HF or other fluids, either alone or in combination, of greater than or about 2 mg/g of the ceramic material, and may be characterized by a scavenging capability of greater than or about 3 mg/g, greater than or about 4 mg/g, greater than or about 5 mg/g, greater than or about 6 mg/g, greater than or about 7 mg/g, greater than or about 8 mg/g, greater than or about 9 mg/g, or more.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Any of the materials discussed previously may be used alone or in combination to tune either surface area or scavenging of the ceramic material used in layer <b>300</b>. In some embodiments the materials may include one or more of aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, zirconium oxide, silicon oxide, titanium oxide, copper oxide, tin oxide, or chromium oxide, and may utilize one or more of these materials in any phase or form.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As discussed previously, utilizing ceramic materials characterized by increased surface area ceramic materials may cause manufacturing difficulties. However, the present technology may utilize improved manufacturing techniques allowing the formation of reduced thickness ceramic material layers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> identifies selected operations in a method <b>400</b> of forming a ceramic material. The method may be used in forming ceramic material layers, which may be used in any of the separator or thin film materials noted previously, as well as in additional or alternative ceramic formation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Method <b>400</b> may begin by admixing ceramic material with one or more fluids to produce a first mixture at operation <b>405</b>. The ceramic materials may include any of the previously noted materials, and may be characterized by any of the properties described above. The first mixture may be an aqueous mixture, and may include water, such as deionized water, and a dispersant, which will be described in further detail below. To the first mixture may be provided an additional dispersant or material to produce a second mixture at operation <b>410</b>. The second dispersant may be a polymeric dispersant, which may reduce phase separation between the ceramic particles and the aqueous materials. For example, the polymeric dispersant may be an organic polymeric dispersant, such as a cellulose derivative, for example, and may include a long-chain polymeric material to facilitate incorporation of the ceramic materials. In one example, the polymeric dispersant may be carboxymethyl cellulose. The carboxymethyl cellulose may be incorporated as an aqueous solution, such as less than or about 10% carboxymethyl cellulose in water, and may be a solution of less than or about 8% carboxymethyl cellulose, less than or about 6% carboxymethyl cellulose, less than or about 4% carboxymethyl cellulose, or less.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At operation <b>415</b> a binder may be incorporated with the second mixture to form a slurry. The binder may be any of the previously described binder materials, and may be included at any of the previously noted percentages. With the binder, an additional agent may be included to facilitate wetting of the ceramic material to a substrate. Any compatible wetting agent may be utilized in method <b>400</b>, and in some embodiments an alcohol may be utilized including denatured alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, for example. Mixing may be performed at any or between any of the operations noted above, and may include multi-step mixing including lower and higher speed mixing, including de-foaming final mixing, or any other mixing techniques. Once formed, the slurry may be coated or deposited on a substrate at operation <b>420</b>. The substrate may be a carrier film, a polymer film for a separator, an electrode including an electrode active material, or any other material on to which a ceramic material layer may be applied. The application may include a variety of coating techniques including slot-die coating, or other deposition processes described further below.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Deposition of the produced ceramic material may increase in difficulty with increased surface area characteristics of the ceramic material used. As surface area increases, particle aggregation may increase, which may increase viscosity and reduce uniformity of the material, and may limit coating to increased thicknesses. The dispersant utilized to form the first mixture may affect the viscosity of the produced slurry, and thus the dispersant may be selected to reduce overall slurry viscosity. Standard dispersants may be used in some embodiments in which the surface area characteristics of the ceramic materials may be lower, however when surface area characteristics of the ceramic materials increase to surface areas greater than or about 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g, standard dispersants may be incapable of effectively reducing slurry viscosity. Accordingly, in some embodiments an ionic dispersant may be utilized as the water-soluble dispersant.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Ionic dispersants utilized in the present technology may include any known ionic dispersants, and may be characterized by a variety of cationic and anionic elements or moieties. The dispersants may include anionic, cationic, and amphoteric materials. The dispersants may include a polymer backbone in some embodiments, and the backbone may be either cationic or anionic. Dispersants including an anionic backbone may include an additional cationic component, and dispersants including a cationic backbone may include an additional anionic component. For example, some dispersant cationic species may include sodium or ammonium, as non-limiting examples, and anionic moieties may include acrylate, polyacrylates, carboxylic acids, phosphates, sulfates, sulfonates, polyionic salts, among other anionic species. Ionic dispersants useful in the present technology may further be ionic dispersants characterized by a polymeric chain having the cationic component located within a repeating moiety of the polymeric chain of the dispersant. For example, and without being bound to any particular theory, because of the high or very high surface area characteristics of some ceramic materials that may be used, such as gamma alumina, longer polymer chain ionic dispersants characterized by the cationic positioning noted above may provide increased charge transfer capabilities to the ceramic materials. This may increase repellant forces of the ceramic materials, which may increase dispersion of the particles, reduce aggregation, and increase uniformity of the produced slurry.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Thus, in some embodiments longer-chain ionic dispersants such as ammonium polymethacrylate, and sodium polyacrylate or polymethacrylate, for example, may be utilized due to the increased number of ions available, as the cationic component may be located within the repeating moiety of the compound. Similarly, in some embodiments these noted ionic dispersants may be utilized over dispersants such as sulfates or sulfonates, where the repeating unit may be, for example, an alkyl moiety that may not impact the available ions from the molecule, which may be limited to one or a specified number of available ions per molecule.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">By utilizing ionic dispersants characterized by the above-noted properties, slurries produced in method <b>400</b> may be characterized by viscosities of less than or about 200 cp in some embodiments. For example, when non-ionic dispersants were utilized to produce slurries, the slurry was characterized by viscosities greater than 1400 cp, which may limit the coating to increased thicknesses, such as several dozen micrometers or more. When ionic dispersants characterized by the above-listed properties were used, the slurry viscosity was below 100 cp. Accordingly, depending on the amounts and components utilized in embodiments of method <b>400</b>, the formed slurry may be characterized by a viscosity of less than or about 500 cp, and may be characterized by a viscosity of less than or about 400 cp, less than or about 300 cp, less than or about 200 cp, or less than or about 100 cp, including any smaller range included in any of these stated ranges.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The viscosity reduction may allow an increased incorporation of ceramic materials, such as greater than 50% incorporation by weight, and greater than 85% incorporation by weight in some embodiments, while additionally allowing coating at limited thickness. For example, in some embodiments slurries were produced with greater than 85% incorporation of ceramic material by weight, with the ceramic materials characterized by a surface area greater than 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and with a viscosity of less than 100 cp. This combination of properties allowed the formation of ceramic material layers on a substrate characterized by a thickness of less than or about 20 &#x3bc;m, and in some embodiments characterized by a thickness of less than or about 15 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 10 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 8 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 5 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 4 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 3 &#x3bc;m, less than or about 2 &#x3bc;m, or less, as well as between about 1 &#x3bc;m and about 4 &#x3bc;m in some embodiments. In some embodiments, subsequent formation of the ceramic material layer, an adhesive layer may be formed overlying the ceramic material layer as previously described.

Sheet <b>800</b> may be substrate <b>805</b> subsequent performance of fabrication process <b>700</b> to form a separator material over electrode active materials. Fabrication process <b>700</b> was described as a continuous process being performed along a moving substrate. Sheet <b>800</b> illustrates how fabrication process <b>700</b> may be performed by discontinuous application of the first separator materials and the second separator materials to allow formation of electrode tab portions of the formed battery components. In embodiments the sheet <b>800</b> may be used in stacked cell formation where layers of material may be disposed vertically. This material may be used from materials formed in fabrication process <b>700</b> or from additional formation techniques.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In many battery cells, the electrode current collectors include a tab portion allowing for delivery or receipt of current to or from the battery cell during operation. The tab portion of current collectors is often formed or cut from the current collector after deposition of the electrode active materials. This cutting process may produce burrs on the current collector, which may be a metal material. These burrs may puncture separators disposed over the current collector and active material, which may cause shorting between layers of a formed battery cell. The present technology may reduce the formation or effect of cut burrs by forming the separator layer over the current collector prior to dicing of the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a current collector <b>805</b> may be provided during a fabrication operation. Although hidden under illustrated separator layers, electrode active materials may be applied discontinuously along the current collector <b>805</b> in some embodiments of the present technology. The electrode active materials may be applied to maintain lateral gaps <b>807</b> across the current collector, and along the substrate between electrode segments. The current collector <b>805</b> may remain exposed within lateral gaps <b>807</b>. A first separator material <b>810</b> and a second separator material <b>815</b> may then be formed overlying the electrode active materials by any of the techniques previously described. Similar to the electrode active material, the first separator material <b>810</b> and the second separator material <b>815</b> may be discontinuously applied over the substrate. At least one of the first separator material and the second separator material, such as first separator material <b>810</b> as illustrated, may be deposited to extend partially within the lateral gaps <b>807</b> laterally across the current collector <b>805</b>. The application may not fully extend across the lateral gaps <b>807</b>, which may maintain a portion of the underlying current collector <b>805</b> exposed within the lateral gaps <b>807</b>. This portion of the exposed current collector <b>805</b>, may form the electrode tab.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Subsequent formation of the layers of electrode and separator materials, a dicing operation may be performed to divide the substrate into a number of battery cell components, such as electrodes including separator materials. The dicing may be performed to produce a number of electrode shaped components <b>820</b>, such as components <b>820</b><i>a</i>, <b>820</b><i>b</i>, <b>820</b><i>c </i>as illustrated. The battery cell electrodes as diced may include an electrode tab <b>825</b> that includes a section of the current collector <b>805</b> exposed within the lateral gaps <b>807</b> across the current collector substrate. The tab <b>825</b> is also partially coated with at least one of the first separator layer <b>810</b> or the second separator layer <b>815</b>. Although three such battery components <b>820</b> are illustrated, it is to be understood that any number of components may be formed depending on the lateral dimensions of the substrate, the size of the components being diced, and the amount of waste material produced, which may be based on the efficiency and precision of the dicing.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional view of a produced battery cell component <b>900</b> according to some embodiments of the present technology. Subsequent the dicing discussed above, an individual component <b>900</b> may be formed that includes a first separator material <b>910</b> and a second separator material <b>915</b> formed over a current collector <b>905</b>. As illustrated, first separator material <b>910</b> may extend into the tab portion of the current collector <b>905</b>, and may extend over an electrode active material <b>907</b>. Accordingly, when the dicing is performed, the portion of the first separator layer <b>910</b> extending onto the current collector <b>905</b> may protect against burrs which may otherwise be formed. Because the first separator layer <b>910</b> may be present prior to dicing, any burrs produced may be contained within the first separator layer, which may encapsulate the burr at the time it is formed.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Forming the separator materials over the electrode active materials and current collectors may provide additional advantages over conventional designs. For example, in battery designs having shapes that are not rectangular, such as L-shaped or T-shaped cells, for example, conventional formation may produce adhesion issues with the separator materials. For example, in many conventional fabrication techniques, the current collector is cut, followed by application of the separator, which is subsequently cut to size. The process may then include the application of heat or pressure to the materials to allow adhesion between the separator and the electrode active materials to occur. However, this process may cause increased stress at the corners where the cutting was performed compared to central areas, which may cause delamination of the separator along corners or edges. Similarly z-folding processes and bi-cell stacking can produce similar issues of inconsistent stress along the interface of the separator. Direct coating processes such as described overcome these issues by forming and laminating the separator prior to dicing, which may afford improved adhesion and reduced delamination at edge regions.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the preceding description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous details have been set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the present technology.
