In a typical cellular communications system, a geographic area is divided into a series of regions that are referred to as &#x201c;cells,&#x201d; and each cell is served by a base station. The base station may include baseband equipment, radios and base station antennas that are configured to provide two-way radio frequency (&#x201c;RF&#x201d;) communications with subscribers that are positioned throughout the cell. In many cases, the cell may be divided into a plurality of &#x201c;sectors,&#x201d; and separate base station antennas provide coverage to each of the sectors. The base station antennas are often mounted on a tower or other raised structure, with the radiation patterns (&#x201c;antenna beams&#x201d;) that are generated by each antenna directed outwardly to serve a respective sector.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A common base station configuration is a &#x201c;three sector&#x201d; configuration in which the cell is divided into three 120&#xb0; sectors in the azimuth plane, and the base station includes three base station antennas that provide coverage to the three respective sectors. The azimuth plane refers to a horizontal plane that bisects the base station antenna that is parallel to the plane defined by the horizon. In a three sector configuration, the antenna beams generated by each base station antenna typically have a Half Power Beam Width (&#x201c;HPBW&#x201d;) in the azimuth plane of about 65&#xb0; so that the antenna beams provide good coverage throughout a 120&#xb0; sector. Typically, each base station antenna will include one or more vertically-extending columns or &#x201c;linear arrays&#x201d; of phased controlled radiating elements. Each linear array generates an antenna beam, or a pair of antenna beams if dual polarized radiating elements are used. By transmitting an RF signal through a column of radiating elements, it is possible to shrink the HPBW of the resultant antenna beam in the elevation plane, which may both increase the gain of the array and reduce interference with adjacent cells. The elevation plane refers to a vertically extending plane that is perpendicular to the azimuth plane. The radiating elements in each linear array typically have an azimuth HPBW of approximately 65&#xb0; so that the antenna beams generated by the linear arrays will provide coverage to a 120&#xb0; sector in the azimuth plane. In more specialized applications, the arrays of radiating elements may be configured to generate antenna beams having larger or smaller azimuth beamwidths, such as azimuth beamwidths of 45&#xb0; or less (e.g., for providing coverage along a straight highway) or 80&#xb0; or more (for providing coverage to sections of a stadium or other venue). The base station antenna may include multiple linear arrays of radiating elements that operate in different frequency bands.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to increase the communication capacity of a base station antenna, the linear arrays are typically implemented using dual-polarized radiating elements. As known to those of skill in the art, RF signals may be transmitted at various polarizations such as horizontal polarization, vertical polarization, slant polarization, right hand circular polarization, left hand circular polarization, etc. Certain polarizations are theoretically &#x201c;orthogonal&#x201d; to each other, meaning that an RF signal transmitted at a certain polarization will not interfere with an RF signal transmitted at an orthogonal polarization, even if both signals are transmitted at the same frequency, from the same location, in the same direction and at the same time. Examples of orthogonal polarizations are vertical and horizontal polarizations or any other pair of linear polarizations that are offset from each other by 90&#xb0;, such as &#x2212;45&#xb0; and +45&#xb0; slant polarizations. A dual-polarized radiating element refers to a radiating element that has radiators that are configured to emit RF energy at two different, typically orthogonal, polarizations. In practice, the RF signals exhibit some level of interaction, but typically the RF signals transmitted at the orthogonal polarizations exhibit low levels of interference with each other.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Most modern base station antennas use slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; cross polarized radiating elements. These radiating elements include a first dipole radiator that extends at an angle of &#x2212;45&#xb0; with respect to a vertical axis when the base station antenna is mounted for use, and a second dipole radiator that extends at an angle of +45&#xb0; with respect to this vertical axis. The first and second dipole radiators cross each other when the radiating element is viewed from the front. Each dipole radiator may include a pair of dipole arms that are center fed with an RF signal that is to be transmitted by the dipole radiator.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front view of a conventional slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; cross-dipole radiating element <b>10</b> that includes a first dipole radiator <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> that extends at an angle of &#x2212;45&#xb0; with respect to a vertical axis (not shown) and a second dipole radiator <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> that extends at an angle of +45&#xb0; with respect to the vertical axis. Herein, when multiple like elements are provided, they may be assigned a two-part reference numeral and referred to individually by their full reference numeral (e.g., dipole radiator <b>20</b>-<b>2</b>) and collectively by the first part of their reference numeral (e.g., the dipole radiators <b>20</b>). Each dipole radiator <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> includes a respective pair of dipole arms <b>30</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>2</b>; <b>30</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>30</b>-<b>4</b> that are center fed by respective first and second feeds that are formed on first and second feed stalks <b>40</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>40</b>-<b>2</b>. The currents flow along the dipole arms <b>30</b> and hence the currents flow in alignment with the respective desired polarizations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Cross-dipole radiating elements are also known in the art that include a horizontal dipole radiator having first and second dipole arms and a vertical dipole radiator having first and second dipole arms. Herein, cross-dipole radiating elements that have horizontal and vertical dipole arms are referred to as H/V cross-dipole radiating elements. While the dipole arms in these radiating elements are physically oriented along respective horizontal and vertical planes, it is possible to configure H/V cross-dipole radiating elements so that they will transmit and receive slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; polarized radiation by simultaneously exciting at least one horizontal dipole arm and at least one vertical dipole arm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate a conventional H/V cross-dipole radiating element <b>50</b> that generates slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; polarized radiation in this manner.

However, due to zoning regulations, wind loading concerns, weight constraints and the like, cellular operators also strongly desire to keep the widths of base station antennas relatively narrow, with maximum widths of 350 mm, 400 mm and 450 mm being imposed for certain types of base station antennas.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, there is considerable interest in base station antennas that include two linear arrays of &#x201c;low-band&#x201d; radiating elements that are used to support service in some or all of the 617-960 MHz frequency band, as well as four linear arrays of &#x201c;high-band&#x201d; radiating elements that are used to provide service in some or all of the 1427-2690 MHz frequency band. The linear arrays of low-band and high-band radiating elements are typically mounted in side-by-side fashion to extend forwardly from a reflector. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic front view of a conventional base station antenna <b>100</b> that includes two vertically-extending linear arrays <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> of low-band radiating elements <b>112</b> and four vertically-extending linear arrays <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-<b>4</b> of high-band radiating elements <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Antennas having the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be used in a variety of applications including multi-input-multi-output (&#x201c;MIMO&#x201d;) applications (e.g., 2xMIMO, 4xMIMO or 8xMIMO) or as multi-band antennas that support cellular service in multiple different frequency ranges (e.g., a 700 MHz low-band linear array <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> and an 800 MHz low-band linear array <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>). These antennas, however, are challenging to implement in a commercially acceptable manner because cellular operators typically desire antennas having widths of less than 450 mm or, more preferably, 400 mm, and it is difficult to fit all of the linear arrays within such a narrow antenna while ensuring that the antenna beams generated by the antenna <b>100</b> have an azimuth HPBW of about 65&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In order to fit all six linear arrays <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> of antenna <b>100</b> onto a reflector that is, for example, 400 mm or less in width, each linear array <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> is located in very close proximity to one or more adjacent linear arrays. Unfortunately, when two linear arrays are mounted in close proximity to each other, interaction may occur between the two linear arrays that may degrade the performance of the antenna.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In particular, when radiating elements of different linear arrays are located in close proximity to each other, some of the RF energy emitted by the radiating elements of a first linear array may couple to the radiating elements of a second adjacent linear array, and vice versa. While much of the &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; RF energy will then reradiate from the radiating elements of the non-excited linear array, the coupling tends to distort the shape of the antenna beam, particularly in the azimuth plane. Moreover, the distortion tends to be frequency dependent, because the amount of coupling tends to be a function of the distance separating adjacent radiating elements in the first and second linear arrays as measured in wavelengths of the RF signal, and since the physical distance between the radiating elements is fixed, the distance in wavelengths varies across the operating frequency band of the radiating elements. While the use of so-called &#x201c;cloaked&#x201d; radiating elements may be used to reduce or eliminate interaction between closely-spaced linear arrays that operate in different frequency bands, such cloaking techniques cannot be used with respect to linear arrays of radiating elements that operate in the same frequency band. Thus, as two linear arrays of radiating elements that operate in the same (or similar) operating frequency bands are brought closer together, the shapes of the antenna beams generated by the linear arrays may be degraded, which may be highly undesirable.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> illustrate the distortion that can occur in the azimuth pattern of an antenna beam when the linear array(s) of radiating elements that are used to generate the antenna beam are located too closely together or to another linear array of radiating elements that operates in the same operating frequency band. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a graph of the simulated azimuth pattern of an antenna beam generated by linear array <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, when the radiating elements <b>122</b> included in the linear arrays <b>120</b> are designed to have a nominal 65&#xb0; azimuth HPBW. The different curves in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> show the azimuth pattern as measured at ten equally spaced frequencies across the 1695-2690 MHz operating frequency band for the radiating elements <b>122</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the azimuth pattern is not very symmetric, as RF energy couples from the radiating elements <b>122</b> of linear array <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> to the radiating elements <b>122</b> of linear array <b>120</b>-<b>2</b>. Moreover, the beamwidth of the main lobe varies significantly as a function of frequency, with the beamwidth being narrower the higher the frequency of the RF signal input to linear array <b>120</b>-<b>1</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the azimuth HPBW of a linear array that is designed to have a 65&#xb0; azimuth beamwidth varies between 65&#xb0; and 85&#xb0; as a function of frequency after the second, passive linear array is added next to the excited linear array, as the added passive array acts as a parasitic element. Such large variation in the azimuth HPBW would be considered unacceptable by cellular operators for most applications.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a graph of the azimuth pattern of an antenna beam generated by high-band linear arrays <b>120</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> of base station antenna <b>100</b> when both linear arrays <b>120</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> are excited by the same RF signal. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, it is assumed that linear arrays <b>120</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>4</b> are omitted from base station antenna <b>100</b>, and that the radiating elements <b>122</b> are designed to have a nominal 45&#xb0; azimuth HPBW. The different curves in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> show the azimuth pattern as measured at ten equally spaced frequencies across the 1695-2690 MHz operating frequency band for the radiating elements <b>122</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when both linear arrays <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> are excited, the azimuth pattern of the resulting antenna beam is symmetric. However, the azimuth beamwidth of the main lobe varies significantly as a function of frequency, with the beamwidth being narrower the higher the operating frequency. In this particular example, the azimuth HPBW varied from 33&#xb0; at the top of the operating frequency band to 47&#xb0; at the bottom of the operating frequency band.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Pursuant to embodiments of the present invention, base station antennas are provided that include at least first and second linear arrays of radiating elements, where the first and second linear arrays operate in the same frequency band. At least some of the radiating elements in the first array are slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; cross-dipole radiating elements that each include a &#x2212;45&#xb0; dipole radiator and a +45&#xb0; dipole radiator, and at least some of the radiating elements in the second array are H/V cross-dipole radiating elements that each include a horizontal dipole radiator and a vertical dipole radiator. All of the radiating elements in the first and second linear arrays may be configured to emit slant &#x2212;45&#xb0; polarized radiation and slant +45&#xb0; polarized radiation. Each slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; cross-dipole radiating element in the first and second linear arrays may be horizontally adjacent (i.e., generally aligned along a horizontal axis when the base station antenna is mounted for normal use) to an H/V cross-dipole radiating element in the first and second linear arrays. It has been found that with this arrangement of radiating elements, the first and second linear arrays may be located in closer proximity to each other without experiencing excessive coupling between the radiating elements of the two arrays. Thus, the base station antennas according to embodiments of the present invention may have reduced physical widths while still providing high performance. Note that herein a slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; cross-dipole radiating element refers to a radiating element that has dipole arms that extend generally at angles of &#x2212;45&#xb0; and +45&#xb0; with respect to a vertical axis when the radiating elements are mounted for normal use, and an H/V cross-dipole radiating element refers to a radiating element that has dipole arms that extend generally at angles of &#x2212;0&#xb0; and 90&#xb0; with respect to a vertical axis when the radiating elements are mounted for normal use. In other words, the terms slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; and H/V refer to the physical orientation of the dipole arms as opposed to the polarization of the radiation patterns generated by the radiating elements.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the first linear array may be formed using slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; cross-dipole radiating elements and the second linear array may be formed using H/V cross-dipole radiating elements (or vice versa). Each slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; cross-dipole radiating element in the first linear array may be horizontally aligned with a respective one of the H/V cross-dipole radiating elements in the second linear array. In other embodiments, each of the first and second linear arrays may include alternating slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; cross-dipole and H/V cross-dipole radiating elements, with each linear array of having one of the two possible alternating patterns. With this arrangement, the three closest radiating elements to each slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; cross-dipole radiating element are H/V cross-dipole radiating elements, and the three closest radiating elements to each slant H/V cross-dipole radiating element are +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; cross-dipole radiating elements.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The above concepts may be expanded beyond two arrays, and may be used, for example, in antennas that have four, eight, sixteen or more linear arrays of radiating elements that operate in the same or similar frequency bands. In some embodiments the radiating elements in these arrays may be arranged in a &#x201c;checkerboard pattern&#x201d; where the +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; cross-dipole radiating elements are positioned in the locations of the first color squares of a checkerboard and the H/V 45&#xb0; cross-dipole radiating elements are positioned in the locations of the second color squares of the checkerboard. This arrangement may have the potential to provide significant performance improvements.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Embodiments of the present invention will now be discussed in greater detail with reference to the accompanying figures.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic front view of a base station antenna <b>200</b> according to embodiments of the present invention that includes a first linear array <b>210</b> of slant +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; cross-dipole radiating elements <b>212</b> and a second linear array <b>211</b> of H/V cross-dipole radiating elements <b>213</b>.

The techniques may also be quite helpful in implementing base station antennas having multiple arrays of high-band radiating elements that operate in all or part of the 1427-2690 MHz frequency band, as the high-band radiating elements operate may operate over large bandwidths and hence may experience larger variation in azimuth beamwidth as a function of frequency if adjacent arrays are located too close together. Moreover, the techniques are also very useful with respect to liner arrays that operate in even higher frequency bands such as the 3.5 GHz or 5 GHz frequency band, as beamforming arrays are often implemented in those frequency bands that have four, eight or even more linear arrays of radiating elements included therein, and positioning those arrays close together may be important due to the large number of linear arrays.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Embodiments of the present invention have been described above with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown.
