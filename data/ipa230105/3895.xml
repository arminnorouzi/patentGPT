light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system has an active modulator to modulate a light signal from an optical source with a low-power mode at a section of a sweep signal to generate a pulsed light signal transmitted towards a target. The LIDAR system has a photodetector to receive a return beam from the target with an amplitude modulated (AM) signal portion and a frequency modulated (FM) signal portion. The LIDAR system determines a target range value for the target based on the AM signal portion and determines a target velocity value for the target based on the FM signal portion.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="57.32mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230003896A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image"

frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system provides amplitude modulation (AM) or time of flight (TOF) signaling to a frequency modulation (FM) modulated light signal. The application of AM modulation or TOF signaling to the FMCW signal enables range and velocity measurement simultaneously from the return signal.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A LIDAR system can provide TOF information with an FM modulated signal or frequency modulated signal as a power and frequency modulated signal. When the power and frequency modulated signal is transmitted to a target, the system can process reflection signals from the target to generate a point set (e.g., data point cloud, target point set, and the like). The target point set processing can include frequency processing to generate target points based on range and Doppler information, and TOF processing to provide TOF range information. The LIDAR system can generate an FM modulated signal and provide the FM modulated signal with TOF signal information via an active modulator or a passive modulator. The combined signal is a power and frequency modulated signal.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to some examples, the described LIDAR system may be implemented in any sensing market, such as, but not limited to, transportation, manufacturing, metrology, medical, augmented reality, virtual reality, and security systems. According to some examples, the described LIDAR system is implemented as part of a front-end of frequency modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) device that assists with spatial awareness for automated driver assist systems or self-driving vehicles, such as part of an automobile, motorcycle, bicycle, scooter, helicopter, or plane, or other vehicle.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example LIDAR system. The LIDAR system <b>100</b> includes one or more of each of a number of components, but may include fewer or additional components than what is illustrated. One or more of the components depicted in LIDAR system <b>100</b> can be implemented on a photonics chip, according to some examples. As shown, the LIDAR system <b>100</b> includes optical circuits <b>112</b> implemented on a photonics chip. In one example, optical circuits <b>112</b> include active optical components. In one example, optical circuits include passive optical components. In one example, optical circuits <b>112</b> include a combination of active optical components and passive optical components. Active optical components refer to components that can generate, amplify, or detect optical signals, or perform a combination of generate, amplify, or detect. In some examples, the active optical component performs operations on optical beams at different wavelengths, and includes one or more optical amplifiers, one or more optical detectors, or other components to perform operations on the light signal.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Free space optics <b>132</b> refers to one or more components that can carry optical signals and route and manipulate optical signals between appropriate input or output ports of the optical circuit and the components of the optical circuit. In one example, free space optics <b>132</b> includes one or more optical components such as taps, wavelength division multiplexers (WDM), splitters/combiners, polarization beam splitters (PBS), collimators, couplers, or other components to direct an optical signal. In some examples, free space optics <b>132</b> includes components to transform the polarization state and direct received polarized light, for example, to optical detectors using a PBS. In one example, free space optics <b>132</b> includes a diffractive element to deflect optical beams having different frequencies at different angles along an axis (e.g., a fast axis).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some examples, LIDAR system <b>100</b> includes optical scanner <b>142</b> that includes one or more scanning mirrors that are rotatable along an axis (e.g., a slow axis) that is orthogonal or substantially orthogonal to the fast axis of the diffractive element. Optical scanner <b>142</b> can steer optical signals to scan an environment according to a scanning pattern. For instance, the scanning mirrors can be rotatable by one or more galvanometers. Incident light from a source optical signal tends to scatter off objects in a target environment, generating a return optical beam or a target return signal. Optical scanner <b>142</b> can collect the return optical beam or the target return signal and provide the return signal for processing. Optical scanner <b>142</b> can return the signal to passive optical circuit components or active optical circuit components of optical circuits <b>112</b>. For example, free space optics <b>132</b> can direct a signal to an optical detector via a polarization beam splitter. In addition to mirrors and galvanometers, examples of optical scanner <b>142</b> can include components such as a quarter-wave plate, lens, anti-reflective coated window, or other component to receive an optical signal.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">To control and support optical circuits <b>112</b> and optical scanner <b>142</b>, LIDAR system <b>100</b> includes LIDAR control system <b>120</b>. LIDAR control system <b>120</b> includes a signal processor, control component, or other device to process control operations for LIDAR system <b>100</b>. The signal processor represents a processing device to control the operation of LIDAR system <b>100</b>. The signal processor can be or include, for example, one or more general-purpose processing devices such as a microprocessor, central processing unit, processing component, or other controller/processor. The signal processor can be, for example, a complex instruction set computing (CISC) microprocessor, a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessor, a very long instruction word (VLIW) microprocessor, or a processor implementing other instruction sets, or processors implementing a combination of instruction sets. In one example, the signal processor can be or include one or more special-purpose processing devices such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a digital signal processor (DSP), network processor, or other computation component.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some examples, LIDAR control system <b>120</b> includes signal processing unit <b>122</b>. Signal processing unit <b>122</b> represents a processing device specific for performing signal computations. For example, signal processing unit <b>122</b> can be a DSP. LIDAR control system <b>120</b> can be configured to output digital control signals to control optical drivers <b>114</b>. In some examples, the digital control signals can be converted to analog signals through signal conversion unit <b>116</b>. For example, signal conversion unit <b>116</b> can include a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Optical drivers <b>114</b> can provide drive signals to active optical components of optical circuits <b>112</b> to drive optical sources such as lasers and amplifiers. In some examples, several optical drivers <b>114</b> and signal conversion units <b>116</b> can be provided to drive multiple optical sources.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">LIDAR control system <b>120</b> can be configured to output digital control signals for optical scanner <b>142</b>. Motion control system <b>150</b> can control galvanometers or other movable components of optical scanner <b>142</b> based on control signals received from LIDAR control system <b>120</b>. For example, a DAC can convert coordinate routing information from LIDAR control system <b>120</b> to signals interpretable by galvanometers in optical scanner <b>142</b>. In some examples, motion control system <b>150</b> can return information to LIDAR control system <b>120</b> about the position or operation of components of optical scanner <b>142</b>. For example, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can convert information about a galvanometer's position to a signal interpretable by LIDAR control system <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">LIDAR control system <b>120</b> can be configured to analyze incoming digital signals. In this regard, LIDAR system <b>100</b> includes free optical receivers <b>134</b> to measure one or more beams received by free space optics <b>132</b>, which can also be passed to optical circuits <b>112</b>. For example, a reference beam receiver can measure the amplitude of a reference beam from an active optical component, and an ADC converts signals from the reference receiver to signals interpretable by LIDAR control system <b>120</b>. Target receivers measure the optical signal that carries information about the range and velocity of a target in the form of a beat frequency, modulated optical signal. The reflected beam can be mixed with a signal from a local oscillator. Optical receivers <b>134</b> can include a high-speed ADC to convert signals from the target receiver to signals interpretable by LIDAR control system <b>120</b>. In some examples, signal conditioning unit <b>136</b> can perform signal conditioning on signals from optical receivers <b>134</b> prior to receipt by LIDAR control system <b>120</b>. For example, the signals from optical receivers <b>134</b> can be provided to an operational amplifier (op-amp) for amplification of the return signals and the amplified signals can be provided to LIDAR control system <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some applications, LIDAR system <b>100</b> includes one or more imaging devices <b>160</b> configured to capture images of the environment, global positioning system (GPS) <b>180</b> configured to provide a geographic location of the system, or other sensor inputs. Image processing system <b>170</b> represents one or more components configured to receive the images from imaging devices <b>160</b> or geographic location from GPS <b>180</b> and prepare the information for receipt and use by LIDAR control system <b>120</b> or other system connected to LIDAR system <b>100</b>. For example, image information can be pre-processed for use by LIDAR control system <b>120</b>. In another example, location information can be formatted for use by LIDAR system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some examples, the scanning process begins with optical drivers <b>114</b> and LIDAR control system <b>120</b>. LIDAR control system <b>120</b> can instruct optical drivers <b>114</b> to independently modulate one or more optical beams, and these modulated signals propagate through the optical circuit to a collimator. The collimator directs the light at the optical scanning system that scans the environment over a preprogrammed pattern defined by motion control system <b>150</b>. Optical circuits <b>112</b> can include a polarization wave plate (PWP) to transform the polarization of the light as it leaves optical circuits <b>112</b>. In some examples, the polarization wave plate can be a quarter-wave plate or a half-wave plate. A portion of the polarized light can be reflected back to optical circuits <b>112</b>. For example, lensing or collimating systems used in LIDAR system <b>100</b> can have natural reflective properties or a reflective coating to reflect a portion of the light back to optical circuits <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Optical signals reflected back from the environment pass through optical circuits <b>112</b> to the receivers. If the polarization of the light has been transformed, it can be reflected by a polarization beam splitter (PBS) along with the portion of polarized light that was reflected back to optical circuits <b>112</b>. Accordingly, rather than returning to the same fiber or waveguide as an optical source, the reflected light is reflected to separate optical receivers. These signals interfere with one another and generate a combined signal. Each beam signal that returns from the target produces a time-shifted waveform. The temporal phase difference between the two waveforms generates a beat frequency measured on the optical receivers (photodetectors). The combined signal can then be reflected to optical receivers <b>134</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Optical receivers <b>134</b> can apply ADCs to convert the analog signals from optical receivers to digital signals. The digital signals are then sent to LIDAR control system <b>120</b>. Signal processing unit <b>122</b> can receive the digital signals and interpret them. In some examples, signal processing unit <b>122</b> also receives position data from motion control system <b>150</b> and galvanometers (not shown) as well as image data from image processing system <b>170</b>. Signal processing unit <b>122</b> can then generate a <b>3</b>D point cloud with information about range and velocity of points in the environment as optical scanner <b>142</b> scans additional points. Signal processing unit <b>122</b> can also overlay a <b>3</b>D point cloud data with the image data to determine velocity and distance of objects in the surrounding area. In one example, LIDAR system <b>100</b> processes satellite-based navigation location data to provide a precise global location.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In operation according to some examples, LIDAR system <b>100</b> is configured to simulate aspects of time of flight signal processing by performing amplitude modulation on a frequency modulated source signal to enable measurement of time of flight as well as range and velocity simultaneously from the return signal.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one example, the FM signal can include TOF information by lowering power or powering off the beam going towards a target for a limited portion of the frequency sweep. In one example, the power is reduced to a low power modulation (TPower Low) during the sweep. In one example, the low power state can be when the modulation is turned off (TPower Off) during the sweep. In one example, the power can be in low power or off state at the beginning of the sweep. In one example, the power can be in low power or off state at the beginning of the up sweep and at the beginning of the down sweep. As one or more beam reflections come back from the target, the TPower signal can be offset in time (TTOF or time of the time of flight signal) with a value corresponding to the range of the object based, at least in part, on one or more signal propagation delays between LIDAR system <b>100</b> and one or more targets. Thus, in this fashion, signal conversion unit <b>116</b> and optical drivers <b>114</b> can modulate TOF information onto an FMCW signal. Optical circuits <b>112</b> and free space optics <b>132</b> can send the signal to the environment for scanning. One or more circuits, units, systems, or devices of LIDAR system <b>100</b> can enter low power mode before, during, and/or after the TPower signal.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Return signals received through free space optics <b>132</b> and free space optical receivers <b>134</b> can be processed with signal conditioning <b>136</b> and processed by LIDAR control system <b>120</b>. Signal processing unit <b>122</b> can compute a TTOF and provide a range measurement that is not a function of Doppler, while the beat frequency is a function of range and Doppler. LIDAR system <b>100</b> can be configured to perform range and Doppler calculation with a single measurement by combining the information of the TTOF and beat frequency.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one example, the FM signal can include AM modulation of any type. The AM modulation can be or include passive modulation or active modulation. The AM information can be extracted separately from the FM modulation, enabling the system to perform range and Doppler determination concurrently. FM modulation low power or power off (TPower Low) can be considered a specific case of AM modulation on the FMCW signal. In some scenarios, signals transmitted and/or processed by LIDAR system <b>100</b> can include any type of FM and AM modulation.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one example, the system computes an estimate of the range using a time domain processing datapath including a correlator and a delay estimator. The estimate of range in combination with frequency domain peaks leads to a more robust estimate of range and velocity per point. As stated above, the system can provide the modulation actively or passively. The active modulation can be active amplitude modulation with an active amplitude modulator. The passive modulation can be passive amplitude modulation with a passive amplitude modulator. For active modulation, the system can provide modulation using a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), modulating optical amplifier gain signal, amplifier gain signal, an optical attenuator, attenuator, laser AM modulation, saturable absorber, optical switch, or other active modulator.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some scenarios, only the transmit signal (TX) or transmit path is modulated. In such a case, the TTOF can be calculated from the electrical signal on an MZM or OA and the low TPower of the received (RX) signal. In some scenarios, the modulation is done in both the TX and local oscillator (LO) path. In such a case, the TTOF can be extracted from the difference in LO and RX signal.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some scenarios, modulation is done using passive modulation. For example, the system can apply a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The system can apply another type of passive amplitude modulation. The system can extract the TOF data from the RX+LO modulation. In some scenarios, the AM part of the FM modulation can be extracted using an I/Q detector.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> represents a time-frequency diagram illustrating an example of LIDAR waveform detection and processing. Diagram <b>200</b> represents a time-frequency diagram of an FMCW scanning signal <b>210</b> that can be used by a LIDAR system, such as system <b>100</b>, to scan a target environment according to some examples. In one example, the scanning waveform <b>210</b>, labeled as f<sub>FM</sub>(t), is a sawtooth waveform (sawtooth &#x201c;chirp&#x201d;) with a chirp bandwidth &#x394;f<sub>C </sub>and a chirp period T<sub>C</sub>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The slope of the sawtooth is given as k=(&#x394;f<sub>C</sub>/T<sub>C</sub>). Diagram <b>200</b> also depicts target return signal <b>220</b> according to some examples. Target return signal <b>220</b>, labeled as f<sub>FM</sub>(t&#x2212;&#x394;t), is a time-delayed version of scanning signal <b>210</b>, where &#x394;t is the roundtrip time to and from a target illuminated by scanning signal <b>210</b>. The roundtrip time is given as &#x394;t=2R/v, where R is the target range, and v is the velocity of the optical beam, which is the speed of light c. The target range, R, can therefore be calculated as R=c(&#x394;t/2).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">When return signal <b>220</b> is optically mixed with scanning signal <b>210</b>, a range-dependent difference frequency, referred to as the beat frequency, &#x394;f<sub>R</sub>(t) is generated. The beat frequency &#x394;f<sub>R</sub>(t) is linearly related to the time delay, &#x394;t, by the slope of the sawtooth k. Thus, &#x394;f<sub>R</sub>(t)=k&#x394;t. Since the target range R is proportional to &#x394;t, the target range R can be calculated as R=(c/2)(&#x394;f<sub>R</sub>(t)/k). Thus, the range R is linearly related to the beat frequency &#x394;f<sub>R</sub>(t).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The beat frequency &#x394;f<sub>R</sub>(t) can be generated, for example, as an analog signal in optical receivers <b>134</b> of system <b>100</b>. The beat frequency can then be digitized by an ADC, for example, in a signal conditioning unit such as signal conditioning unit <b>136</b> in LIDAR system <b>100</b>. The digitized beat frequency signal can then be digitally processed, for example, in a signal processing unit, such as signal processing unit <b>122</b> in system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">It will be understood that target return signal <b>220</b> will, in general, also include a frequency offset (Doppler shift) if the target has a velocity relative to the LIDAR system. The Doppler shift can be determined separately, and used to correct the frequency of the return signal, so the Doppler shift is not shown in diagram <b>200</b> for simplicity and ease of explanation. It should also be noted that the sampling frequency of the ADC will determine the highest beat frequency that can be processed by the system without aliasing. In general, the highest frequency that can be processed is one-half of the sampling frequency (i.e., the &#x201c;Nyquist limit&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one example, and without limitation, if the sampling frequency of the ADC is 1 gigahertz, then the highest beat frequency that can be processed without aliasing (&#x394;f<sub>Rmax</sub>) is 500 megahertz. This limit in turn determines the maximum range of the system as Rmax=(c/2)(&#x394;f<sub>Rmax</sub>/k) which can be adjusted by changing the chirp slope k. In one example, while the data samples from the ADC may be continuous, the subsequent digital processing described below may be partitioned into &#x201c;time segments&#x201d; that can be associated with some periodicity in the LIDAR system. In one example, and without limitation, a time segment might correspond to a predetermined number of chirp periods T, or a number of full rotations in azimuth by the optical scanner.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example of a LIDAR system with active modulation to provide a combined FM and AM signal according to embodiments of the present disclosure.
