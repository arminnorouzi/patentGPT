Examples include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,527,940 and 4,968,891 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/542,793, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Using UV radiation to disinfect liquids offers many advantages that often make it a very attractive option as compared to other methods of disinfecting liquids. It will often provide for improved disinfection in a fast, simple, relatively inexpensive manner.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The effectiveness of UV radiation to disinfect a liquid diminishes rapidly with the distance that the radiation must pass through the liquid, so the surface of the liquid receives stronger radiation than the depths of the liquid. So under conditions of laminar flow, disinfection of the deeper liquid is less than disinfection of the surface of the liquid. Furthermore, relying primarily upon natural turbulence in a liquid to provide for even, thorough disinfection of the liquid can be unreliable.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, a UV disinfectant system comprises a chamber and a plurality of ultraviolet light emitting bulbs. The chamber may have at least one wall transparent to ultraviolet light and define a treatment flow path for liquid to be treated with the ultraviolet light. The plurality of ultraviolet light emitting bulbs may be positioned external to the chamber, adjacent to the transparent wall to direct ultraviolet light into the chamber along the treatment flow path. The system may further include an inflow port, outflow port, and pump. The inflow port may be configured for passage of the liquid to be treated into the treatment flow path. The outflow port may be configured for passage of the treated liquid from the treatment flow path to an outlet of the chamber. The pump may be configured for pumping the liquid through the chamber. The system may further include a static mixer positioned in the chamber and comprising a plurality of vanes extending into the treatment flow path, dimensioned to disrupt laminar flow along the treatment flow path.

The inner tube <b>18</b> is preferably stainless steel having an inner diameter of substantially within a range of from approximately 0.5 inch to approximately 3.25 inch. The inner tube has an outer diameter that is substantially within a range of approximately from approximately 0.75 inch to approximately 3.5 inch.

An opening in a distal end of the inner tube <b>18</b> places the outer flow path in fluid flow communication with the inner flow path. The outer surface of the inner tube <b>18</b> is not transparent with respect to the radiation from the radiation source <b>14</b> and is preferably reflective of the radiation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The static mixer or helical member <b>22</b> is an auger style static mixer that is affixed to the outer diameter of the inner tube <b>18</b>, such as by welding.

Each section <b>47</b> comprises a plurality of bulbs <b>14</b>, one or more reflectors <b>48</b>, and a bracket <b>50</b>. The bracket <b>50</b> supports and aligns the bulbs <b>14</b> and supports and aligns the reflector or reflectors <b>48</b> positioned adjacent to the bulbs <b>14</b>. The reflector <b>48</b> is configured with a curved portion or segment, such as a semi-circular, hyperbolic, or parabolic shaped portion or segment, associated with each bulb <b>14</b>, disposed and aligned to reflect and focus radiation emitted from outer portions of the bulb <b>14</b> back toward the treatment chamber <b>12</b>. The segments are disposed so that the reflector <b>48</b> is generally clamshell shaped. In that regard, a cross section of one segment falling in a common plane of a cross section of an adjoining segment does not form a portion of a common circle or semi-circle with the cross section of the adjoining segment, Each cross section is preferably semi-circular, and each cross section of a segment has an arc length that is greater than approximately 45&#xb0;. The inner surface of the reflector <b>48</b> is selected to be highly reflective of the radiation used. For example, if a UV bulb <b>14</b> is used, the inner surface is preferably polished aluminum. Each section <b>47</b> is secured to its mating section <b>47</b> and is secured within the cabinet <b>66</b> in any number of ways, such as being secured to a back wall of the cabinet or to brackets disposed within the cabinet <b>66</b>. In the embodiment shown, one section <b>47</b> is disposed toward a back portion of the cabinet <b>66</b>, and a mating section <b>47</b> is disposed toward a front portion of the cabinet <b>66</b> so that the front section <b>47</b> may be easily opened to provide access to the treatment chamber <b>12</b> and to the sections <b>47</b> of the illumination unit <b>46</b>. Each section <b>47</b> is independently removable without the need to remove an associated treatment chamber or mated section <b>47</b>. The brackets <b>50</b> of each section <b>47</b> are disposed to place the bulbs <b>14</b> in very close proximity to the outer surface of the outer tube <b>20</b>. In the embodiment shown, in which the modular concept is used, a separate modular illumination unit <b>46</b> is associated with each treatment chamber <b>12</b>. An extra or spare modular illumination unit <b>46</b> may be provided along with the device <b>10</b>. This will reduce down time by making it easy to quickly replace an installed unit <b>46</b> with a spare unit <b>46</b> if the installed unit is in need of repair, maintenance, or replacement.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an alternate embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> &#x26; <b>4</b></figref>, one or more bulb racks <b>52</b> may be used to support and align a plurality of outer tubes <b>20</b> of a plurality of treatment chambers <b>12</b>, along with the bulbs <b>14</b> and reflectors <b>48</b> to be used with each treatment device <b>10</b>.

The cabinet <b>66</b> is preferably made primarily of stainless steel. Other components may be disposed within or positioned near the cabinet <b>66</b>. For example, a power line <b>68</b> may supply power to controls <b>70</b> and to ballast <b>72</b> associated with each bulb <b>14</b>, which may be housed in the cabinet <b>66</b> or separately above the cabinet <b>66</b>. A fan <b>74</b> may be provided for cooling the ballast <b>72</b> and controls <b>70</b>, and drain pipes <b>78</b> may be provided in the cabinet <b>66</b> floor. In the embodiment shown, a separate fan <b>74</b> may be associated each modular illumination unit <b>46</b>, with the fan <b>74</b> disposed to provide a positive pressure cabinet.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is of course understood that any number of different fan <b>74</b> arrangements may be used and that one or more fans may be disposed to provide either a positive pressure cabinet or a negative pressure cabinet.

The centrally located pipes <b>84</b> are disposed to align with input and output pipes <b>30</b> and <b>34</b> of the treatment chambers <b>12</b> when the treatment chambers <b>12</b> are aligned for series flow, such as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> &#x26; <b>6</b></figref>, in operation, a plurality of treatment chambers <b>12</b> are aligned as desired to provide for parallel or series flow through the desired number of treatment chambers <b>12</b>. It is of course understood that a single treatment chamber <b>12</b> may also be used if desired. Once the treatment chambers <b>12</b> are aligned as desired and the cabinet doors <b>86</b> closed for added protection against exposure to UV radiation, the bulbs <b>14</b> are activated to provide UV radiation. The liquid to be treated is then provided to the device <b>10</b> at the desired pressure and flow rate. It is understood that the device <b>10</b> may be used in connection with most any liquid, including but not limited to clear or opaque liquids such as water, including wastewater, juices, brines, marinades, beverages, and the like.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In parallel flow (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) the liquid will pass through and fill the desired number of input manifold segments <b>58</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>b</i>, <b>58</b><i>c </i>and will pass from each input manifold <b>58</b> segment into an associated treatment chamber <b>12</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the liquid passes through the input pipe <b>30</b>, through the housing <b>26</b>, and into the annulus <b>44</b> between the inner tube <b>18</b> and outer tube <b>20</b>. The static mixer <b>22</b> routes the liquid in a tight spiral pattern along a helical path upward through the annulus <b>44</b> to an upper portion of the treatment chamber <b>12</b>. As the liquid passes through the narrow annulus <b>44</b> in close proximity to the bulbs <b>14</b>, UV radiation from the bulbs <b>14</b> provides the desired degree of disinfection. The use of the auger style static mixer <b>22</b> provides for significant mixing and churning of the liquid as it passes upward through the annulus <b>44</b> so that different portions of the liquid are constantly being moved closer to and further from the bulbs <b>14</b>. This ensures thorough and even radiation exposure throughout the liquid and greatly reduces the chances of leaving isolated portions relatively untreated or significantly over-treated. The end cap <b>24</b> arrests upward flow of the liquid and redirects the liquid to flow downward through the inner tube <b>18</b>. The liquid then passes through the inner tube <b>18</b>, through the inner header tube <b>28</b>, and through the output pipe <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the treatment chamber <b>12</b> is aligned to provide for parallel flow (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), the liquid passes from the output pipe <b>34</b> to and through the associated output manifold <b>60</b> segment for further use or treatment. If the treatment chamber <b>12</b> is aligned to provide for series flow (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), the liquid passes from the output pipe <b>34</b> of one treatment chamber <b>12</b> to the input pipe <b>30</b> of another treatment chamber <b>12</b> to repeat the process described above.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The rugged device <b>10</b> may be operated under wide ranges or pressures and flow rates without fear of damaging the device <b>10</b>. For example, the device <b>10</b> may be safely operated at a working pressure reaching or exceeding a pressure that is preferably substantially within a range of from approximately 30 psig to approximately 60 psig and that is more preferably approximately 57 psig. The device <b>10</b> may withstand burst pressures reaching or exceeding a pressure that is preferably substantially within a range of from approximately 100 psig to approximately 300 psig and that is more preferably approximately 286 psig. Desired flow rates for many applications will typically be within a range of from approximately 1 gallon per minute to approximately 20 gallons per minute. Similarly, desired flow rates for typical clean in place cleaning will typically be less than or equal to approximately 25 gallons per minute. Still, much higher flow rates may be desirable for some applications, such as for the batch processing of juice. In the batch processing of juice, it is sometimes desirable to process flow rates reaching or exceeding approximately 70 gallons per minute. The system <b>6</b> may be configured to safely process flows rates of up to approximately 30 gallons per minute, up to approximately 55 gallons per minute, or approximately 80 gallons per minute. A treatment chamber <b>12</b> typically processes approximately 10 to 12 gallons per minute. Parallel flow is typically used for higher rates.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Other modifications, changes and substitutions are intended in the foregoing, and in some instances, some features will be employed without a corresponding use of other features. For example, any number of treatment chambers <b>12</b> may be used, from one to several. Similarly, a configuration of eight bulbs <b>14</b> per treatment chamber <b>12</b> may be used, but any number of bulbs <b>14</b> may be used in connection with a treatment chamber <b>12</b>, from one to several. Also, any number of different types of mixers <b>22</b> may be used in the annulus <b>44</b>, or a mixer <b>22</b> may be omitted. Further, any number of different flow paths may be used, including but not limited to a flow path that is roughly the reverse of that described above. Similarly, strictly series flow may be used, strictly parallel flow may be used, or any number of combinations of series and parallel flows may be used. Also, the header <b>16</b> may be disposed in different locations, such as at the top of the treatment chamber <b>12</b>. Similarly, any number of different methods may be used to route the liquid to or from the annulus <b>44</b> area and to or from the inner tube <b>18</b>. Although bulbs <b>14</b> providing UV radiation are preferred, any number of different types of radiation and types of radiation sources <b>14</b> may be used depending upon the desired application. Further, the reflectors <b>48</b> may take any number of shapes, sizes or configurations or may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A &#x26; <b>9</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A &#x26; <b>10</b>B</figref> illustrate additional embodiments of a static mixer <b>122</b> of a treatment device <b>110</b> for use with a UV disinfectant system <b>106</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref>).

The static mixer <b>122</b> may include dimensions similar to those described above as modified below with respect to the static mixer <b>22</b>. The static mixer <b>122</b> may be positioned within a treatment chamber <b>112</b> adjacent to a flow path of liquid through the chamber <b>112</b>, an example of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> (arrows).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The static mixer <b>122</b> may be structured to create turbulence in liquid flow thereby mixing, e.g., turning over, churning, circulating, or otherwise agitating the liquid to thereby impede laminar flow. The static mixer <b>122</b> comprises extensions, referred to herein as vanes <b>111</b>, located along the outer surface of the inner tube <b>118</b>. The vanes <b>111</b> are positioned along the flow path and are dimensioned to create turbulence by impeding a direct flow of liquid through the treatment chamber <b>112</b>. In particular, the vanes <b>111</b> are dimensioned to create turbulence along the flow path to prevent laminar flow. Thus, when liquid flows along the flow path between the inner tube <b>118</b> and outer tube <b>120</b>, the liquid may be exposed to UV light that shines through a transparent portion of the outer tube <b>120</b> and into the flow path between the inner tube <b>118</b> and the outer tube <b>120</b> to act on the flowing liquid. For example, the vanes <b>111</b> may be dimensioned to create eddies of circulating liquid to disrupt laminar flow and to increase the proportion of the liquid that passes near the inner surface of the outer tube <b>120</b>. The intensity of the UV light drops as the UV light passes through more liquid. So the intensity is greatest, and the disinfecting effect is greatest, closest to the inner surface of the outer tube <b>120</b>. The rate at which the UV light intensity drops as it passes through the liquid may vary depending on factors such as light intensity, liquid composition or transparency/turbidity, outer tube composition or transparency, flow rate, etc.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The vanes <b>111</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A &#x26; <b>9</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A &#x26; <b>10</b>B</figref> comprise a plurality of vanes <b>111</b> positioned along the height, or longitudinal length, of the inner tube <b>118</b> and extend axially into the flow path between the inner tube <b>118</b> and outer tube <b>120</b> to thereby agitate the liquid as it flows there along under the bulbs <b>114</b>.
