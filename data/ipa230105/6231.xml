method for manufacturing a polymer electrolyte membrane and a polymer electrolyte membrane manufactured thereby, and more particularly, to a method for manufacturing a polymer electrolyte membrane having improved ionic conductivity performance while improving impregnation properties of an ion conductor, and a polymer electrolyte membrane manufactured thereby.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fuel cells are batteries provided with a power generation system that directly converts chemical reaction energy such as oxidation/reduction reaction of hydrogen and oxygen contained in hydrocarbon-based fuel materials such as methanol, ethanol, and natural gas into electrical energy, and are in the spotlight as a next-generation clean energy source that can replace fossil energy due to their eco-friendly characteristics with high energy efficiency and low pollutant emission.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such fuel cells have the advantage of being able to output a wide range of outputs with a stack configuration by stacking of unit cells, and exhibit 4 to 10 times the energy density compared to small lithium batteries so that they are attracting attention as small and mobile portable power sources.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A stack that actually generates electricity in a fuel cell has a structure in which several to tens of unit cells composed of a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) and a separator (also called a bipolar plate) are stacked. In general, the membrane-electrode assembly has a structure in which an anode or fuel electrode and a cathode or air electrode are respectively disposed at both sides thereof with the electrolyte membrane being between them.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Fuel cells may be divided into an alkaline electrolyte fuel cell, a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), etc. depending on the state and type of electrolyte. The polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell among them is in the spotlight as a portable, vehicle, and home power supply device due to its advantages such as a low operating temperature of less than 100&#xb0; C., fast start-up and response characteristics, and excellent durability.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typical examples of the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell may include a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) using hydrogen gas as a fuel and a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) using liquid methanol as a fuel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To summarize the reaction that occurs in a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, first, when a fuel such as hydrogen gas is supplied to the anode, hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) and electrons (e) are generated by the oxidation reaction of hydrogen at the anode. The generated hydrogen ions are transferred to the cathode through the polymer electrolyte membrane, and the generated electrons are transferred to the cathode through an external circuit. Oxygen is supplied to the cathode, and oxygen is combined with hydrogen ions and electrons to produce water by the reduction reaction of oxygen.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Meanwhile, in order to realize the commercialization of the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, there are still many technical barriers to be solved, and essential improvement factors include the realization of high performance, long life, and production cost reduction. The component that has the greatest influence on this is the membrane-electrode assembly, and among them, the polymer electrolyte membrane is one of the key factors that have the greatest influence on the performance and price of the membrane-electrode assembly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Requirements of the polymer electrolyte membrane required for operation of the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell include high hydrogen ion conductivity, chemical stability, low fuel permeability, high mechanical strength, low moisture content, excellent dimensional stability, and the like. Conventional polymer electrolyte membranes tend to be difficult to normally exhibit high performance in a specific temperature and relative humidity environment, particularly in high temperature/low humidification conditions. Due to this, the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell to which the conventional polymer electrolyte membrane is applied is limited in its use range.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to simultaneously secure the performance, durability, and mechanical and chemical properties of such a polymer electrolyte membrane, the development of a reinforced composite membrane-type polymer electrolyte membrane to which a reinforcing material is applied has been progressed. However, when a reinforcing material is introduced to improve the mechanical durability of the electrolyte membrane, the resistance loss increases, and the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte membrane decreases so that, as a result, there is a disadvantage in that the performance of a fuel cell comprising the same may be decreased.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Meanwhile, the reinforced composite membrane is manufactured by immersing a porous reinforcing material in a dispersion solution in which an ion conductor is dispersed, or formed by additionally adding an ion conductor layer to one or both surfaces thereof.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">At this time, if the porous reinforcing material is not sufficiently impregnated with the ion conductor, vacant pores interfere with hydrogen ion conduction to lower the hydrogen ionic conductivity, and there is a problem in that this acts as a factor to deteriorate the performance of the fuel cell.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Therefore, it is important to improve the impregnation rate of the reinforced composite membrane in order to prevent a decrease in hydrogen ion conductivity while improving the mechanical durability of the polymer electrolyte membrane. In order to commercialize the polymer electrolyte membrane, mechanical durability should be improved by increasing dimensional stability during wet drying along with high performance. To this end, it is required to secure the optimal structure of the reinforced composite membrane and to improve the ionic conductivity together.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An object of the present disclosure to provide a method for manufacturing a polymer electrolyte membrane that has excellent morphological stability to improve mechanical durability of the electrolyte membrane and the impregnation rate of the polymer electrolyte membrane at the same time so that it has excellent ionic conductivity and can reduce hydrogen permeability.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another object of the present disclosure is to provide an electrolyte polymer membrane manufactured through the method for manufacturing the polymer electrolyte membrane.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another object of the present disclosure is to provide a membrane-electrode assembly comprising the polymer electrolyte membrane.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another object of the present disclosure is to provide a fuel cell comprising the membrane-electrode assembly.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for manufacturing a polymer electrolyte membrane, the method comprising the steps of</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">(a) preparing a porous support containing a plurality of pores,</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">(b) preparing an ion conductor dispersion solution by dispersing an ion conductor in a dispersion medium,</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">(c) contacting the dispersion medium with the porous support to wet the dispersion medium on the porous support, and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">(d) introducing the ion conductor to at least one surface of the porous support by applying the ion conductor dispersion solution to the porous support wetted with the dispersion medium.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The step (c) may be contacting a dispersion medium of a gas state with the porous support.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The step (c) may be performed in a chamber to which the dispersion medium of a gas state is supplied.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The chamber may have an internal temperature of 60&#xb0;

However, the present disclosure can be implemented in various different forms and is not limited to the embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Terms and words used in the present specification are terms selected in consideration of functions in the embodiments, and the meaning of the terms may vary according to the intention or custom of the invention. Therefore, the terms used in the embodiments to be described later, when specifically defined in the present specification, follow the definition, and when there is no specific definition, they should be interpreted as a meaning generally recognized by those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order to clearly express the various layers and regions in the drawings, the thickness is enlarged and the same reference numerals are given to similar parts throughout the specification. When a part, such as a layer, film, region, plate, etc., is &#x201c;on&#x201d; other part, it includes not only the case where the part is &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; the other part, but also the case where another part is in the middle therebetween. Conversely, when a part is &#x201c;just above&#x201d; other part, it mean that there is no another part in the middle therebetween.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hereinafter, a method for manufacturing a polymer electrolyte membrane according to an embodiment will be described.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present disclosure the present disclosure relates to a method for manufacturing a polymer electrolyte membrane capable of minimizing deterioration in the physical durability of an electrolyte membrane due to repetition of humidification and drying conditions in the driving process of a fuel cell and improving the ionic conductivity and performance of the electrolyte membrane, and a polymer electrolyte membrane manufactured thereby.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Specifically, the method for manufacturing a polymer electrolyte membrane according to an embodiment of the present disclosure comprises the steps of (a) preparing a porous support containing a plurality of pores, (b) preparing an ion conductor dispersion solution by dispersing an ion conductor in a dispersion medium, (c) contacting the dispersion medium with the porous support to wet the dispersion medium on the porous support, and (d) introducing the ion conductor to at least one surface of the porous support by applying the ion conductor dispersion solution to the porous support wetted with the dispersion medium.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">First, a porous support containing a plurality of pores is prepared.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The porous support may include, as an example, a highly fluorinated polymer having excellent resistance to thermal and chemical decomposition, preferably a perfluorinated polymer. For example, the porous support may be a copolymer of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or tetrafluoroethylene and CF<sub>2</sub>&#x2550;CFC<sub>n</sub>F<sub>2n+1 </sub>(n is a real number of 1 to 5) or CF<sub>2</sub>&#x2550;CFO&#x2014;(CF<sub>2</sub>CF(CF<sub>3</sub>)O)<sub>m</sub>C<sub>n</sub>F<sub>2n+1 </sub>(m is a real number of 0 to 15, and n is a real number of 1 to 15).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Since the PTFE is commercially used, it may be suitably used as the porous support. Further, an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene polymer (e-PTFE) having a microstructure of polymer fibrils or a microstructure in which nodes are connected to each other by fibrils may also be suitably used as the porous support, and a film having a microstructure of polymer fibrils in which the nodes are not present may also be suitably used as the porous support.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The porous support comprising the perfluorinated polymer may be manufactured into a more porous and stronger porous support by extrusion-molding dispersion polymerized PTFE onto a tape in the presence of a lubricant and stretching the material obtained thereby. Further, the amorphous content of PTFE may be increased by heat-treating the e-PTFE at a temperature exceeding a melting point (about 342&#xb0; C.) of the PTFE. The e-PTFE film manufactured by the above-mentioned method may have micropores having various diameters and porosities. The e-PTFE film manufactured by the above-mentioned method may have pores of at least 35%, and the micropores may have a diameter of about 0.01 &#x3bc;m to 1 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As another example of the porous support, the porous support may be a nonwoven fibrous web.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The nonwoven fibrous web refers to a sheet having a structure of individual fibers or filaments that are interlaid, but not in the same manner as a woven fabric. The nonwoven fibrous web may be manufactured by any one method selected from the group consisting of carding, garneting, air-laying, wet-laying, melt blowing, spunbonding, and stitch bonding.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The fiber may include one or more polymer materials, any material used as a fiber-forming polymer material can be generally used, and specifically, a hydrocarbon-based fiber-forming polymer material may be used. For example, the fiber-forming polymer material may include any one selected from the group consisting of: polyolefins such as polybutylene, polypropylene and polyethylene; polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate; polyamides (nylon-6 and nylon-6,6); polyurethane; polybutene; polylactic acid; polyvinyl alcohol; polyphenylene sulfide; polysulfone; fluid crystalline polymers; polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate; polyacrylonitrile; cyclic polyolefins; polyoxymethylene; polyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomers; and combinations thereof, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As another example of the porous support in the form of a nonwoven fibrous web, the porous support may include a nanoweb in which nanofibers are integrated in the form of a nonwoven fabric containing a plurality of pores.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A hydrocarbon-based polymer which exhibits excellent chemical resistance and has hydrophobicity so that there is no risk of morphological deformation due to moisture in a high-humidity environment may be preferably used as the nanofiber. Specifically, the hydrocarbon-based polymer may include one which is selected from the group consisting of nylon, polyimide, polyaramid, polyetherimide, polyacrylonitrile, polyaniline, polyethylene oxide, polyethylene naphthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, styrene butadiene rubber, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl butylene, polyurethane, polybenzoxazole, polybenzimidazole, polyamideimide, polyethylene terephthalate, polyphenylene sulfide, polyethylene, polypropylene, copolymers thereof, and mixtures thereof, and may preferably include polyimide having more excellent heat resistance, chemical resistance, and morphological stability among them.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The nanoweb is a nanofiber aggregate in which nanofibers manufactured by electrospinning are arranged. At this time, the nanofibers preferably have an average diameter of 40 nm to 5,000 nm when calculating the average of the fiber diameters by measuring 50 fiber diameters using a scanning electron microscope (JSM6700F, JEOL) in consideration of the porosity and thickness of the nanoweb. If the average diameter of the nanofibers is less than 40 nm, the mechanical strength of the porous support may be reduced, and if the average diameter of the nanofibers exceeds 5,000 nm, the porosity may be remarkably dropped and the thickness may be increased.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The nonwoven fibrous web may have a basic weight of 5 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 30 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. When the basic weight of the nonwoven fibrous web is less than 5 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, visible pores are formed so that it may be difficult for the nonwoven fibrous web to function as a porous support, and when it exceeds 30 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, it may be manufactured in a paper or fabric form in which pores are hardly formed.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The porous support may have a porosity of 45% or more, specifically 60% or more. Meanwhile, the porous support preferably has a porosity of 90% or less. If the porous support has a porosity of exceeding 90%, morphological stability may be lowered so that the post-process may not proceed smoothly. The porosity may be calculated by the ratio of the air volume to the total volume of the porous support according to Equation 1 below.

Therefore, the ion conductor is impregnated up to the internal pores of the porous support, thereby reducing the generation of dead pores and improving the mobility of the ion conductor to enable the impregnation rate from the surface of the support to be improved.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">In an embodiment, the support may be in contact with a dispersion medium of a gas state to wet the porous support. Since the dispersion medium of a gas state may be secured by heating the dispersion medium, and the boiling point (BP) of each dispersion medium may vary depending on the type of dispersion medium, the heating temperature of the dispersion medium is appropriately selected by taking into account the properties of the ion conductor to be introduced and the boiling point of the dispersion medium. As such, when the porous support is wetted through the dispersion medium of a gas state, the dispersion medium is wetted to the inside of the micropores of the porous support so that impregnation properties (wetting) of the ion conductor dispersion solution may be increased, and thus the ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte membrane is not reduced, and resistance loss can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">In an embodiment, the wetting process may be performed in a chamber to which the dispersion medium of a gas state is supplied. The chamber refers to a working space in which the porous support is positioned in the internal space and wetted by the dispersion medium of a gas state.

When the chamber has an internal relative humidity of less than 50%, the dispersion medium of a gas state is not transferred to the micropores inside the porous support so that impregnation properties by the ion conductor dispersion solution may decrease, and when the chamber has an internal relative humidity of exceeding 120%, since there may be a problem of stability due to an excessive increase in pressure inside the chamber, and the dispersion medium supplied in the gas state may be condensed back to a high vapor pressure and liquefied, the internal relative humidity of the chamber should be appropriately adjusted within the above range.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">In an embodiment, the chamber may have an internal temperature of 40&#xb0; C. to 120&#xb0; C., preferably 50&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. When the chamber has an internal temperature of less than 40&#xb0; C., since the dispersion medium is not vaporized so that it may be difficult to secure a dispersion medium of a gas state, there is a risk that impregnation properties of the ion conductor may be reduced. When the chamber has an internal temperature of exceeding 120&#xb0; C., since the porous support may be melted to block the micropores, or there may be a problem of stability due to combustion of the dispersion medium of a gas state, the internal temperature of the chamber should be appropriately adjusted within the above range.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">In an embodiment, the dispersion medium and the porous support may be in contact for 0.1 minutes to 60 minutes. When the dispersion medium and the porous support are in contact for less than 0.1 minutes, since the contact time of the dispersion medium and the porous support is short so that the porous support is not sufficiently wetted by the dispersion medium, the ion conductor dispersion solution may not be sufficiently impregnated into the porous support, and when the dispersion medium and the porous support are in contact for more than 60 minutes, the dispersion medium may remain in the porous support after being impregnated with the ion conductor dispersion solution due to excessive wetting of the porous support.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">Next, an ion conductor dispersion solution is applied to the porous support wetted with the dispersion medium to introduce an ion conductor to at least one surface of the porous support.

For each 1,000 cycles, the hydrogen crossover of the MEA was measured using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Specifically, the current density data in the 0.4 to 0.5 V section were extracted by sweeping the 0.2 to 0.5 V section at a scan rate of 0.5 mV/s while injecting hydrogen gas into the anode at a flow rate of 200 NmL/min and nitrogen gas into the cathode at a flow rate of 200 NmL/min at 80&#xb0; C. and 100% RH. The current density value of the section where the voltage is 0 was taken by linear fitting the data. After repeatedly performing the measurements up to 20,000 cycles in accordance with NEDO's mechanical acceleration endurance standard for fuel cell vehicles, the measurements were finished. However, when the hydrogen crossover measured every 1,000 cycles is 10 times or more of the initial hydrogen crossover, the evaluation is terminated in the middle, and the number of cycles performed until then was taken as the wet/dry cycle of the MEA. For example, if the hydrogen crossover measured after the end of a total of 9,000 cycles was less than 10 times the initial hydrogen crossover, but the hydrogen crossover measured after the end of a total of 10,000 cycles became 10 times or more of the initial hydrogen crossover, the wet/dry cycle of the MEA becomes &#x201c;an end of 10,000 cycles&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Hydrogen</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>crossover</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Comparative</entry><entry>Comparative</entry></row><row><entry>(mA/cm<sup>2</sup>)</entry><entry>Example 1</entry><entry>Example 2</entry><entry>Example 3</entry><entry>Example 4</entry><entry>Example 5</entry><entry>Example 1</entry><entry>Example 2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>0 cycle</entry><entry>1.5</entry><entry>1.6</entry><entry>1.6</entry><entry>1.3</entry><entry>1.4</entry><entry>2.5</entry><entry>1.9</entry></row><row><entry>(Before test)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>20,000 cycles</entry><entry>1.7</entry><entry>1.9</entry><entry>1.9</entry><entry>1.4</entry><entry>1.5</entry><entry>30 or more</entry><entry>3.3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>(an end of</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>9,000 cycles)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0125" num="0122">Referring to Table 1 above, the hydrogen crossovers before and after the MEA wet/dry cycle test of the polymer electrolyte membranes according to Examples 1 to 5 were confirmed to be low compared to those of the polymer electrolyte membrane of Comparative Example 1 or Comparative Example 2.
