This typically comprises a generic one piece cushion and as users may be seated in a wheelchair or the like for extensive periods each day, the generic cushion can become quite uncomfortable. Further these types of generic cushions offer fairly limited support to the user's body portions. One attempt to address these issues which is commonly implemented is the provision of custom wheelchairs with custom cushion and/or support element arrangements. These custom arrangements, whilst well suited to the particular user they are created for, are very expensive, are limited to the dimensions of the user when they were created which is not ideal if the intended user of the chair is a child whose dimensions will change very quickly as they grow older, as after a certain period of the time the chair, specifically the custom cushions and/or support elements will no longer be suitable for the user.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is a desire of the present invention to provide a cushion arrangement which addresses the deficiencies mentioned above.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A first aspect of the present invention provides an extendable cushion assembly, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">A cushion which is movable between an extended state and a retracted state;

The cushion <b>3</b> may comprise one or more cushions of a seat. For example, the cushion <b>3</b> may comprise a seat cushion, i.e. a cushion upon which a person sits in-use, however additionally or alternatively it may also be a back cushion, i.e. a cushion which supports a user's back in-use. The cushion <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> is more ideally suited as a seat cushion. The cushion <b>3</b> comprises a plurality of transverse slits <b>5</b>. The slits <b>5</b> being arranged such that they extend transverse the cushion <b>3</b> in a semi-continuous fashion. The cushion <b>3</b> comprises a plurality of rows <b>4</b> of the transverse slits. The rows are spaced apart with respect to one another and are arranged such that they extend parallel to one another. The rows extend in a perpendicular direction to the length of the cushion <b>3</b>. The cushion <b>3</b> is movable between a retracted state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and an extended state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Upon opening of the slits <b>5</b> the cushion <b>3</b> is configured to extend longitudinally, thereby varying the cushion <b>3</b> between the retracted and extended states. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> there is shown a cushion comprising three rows of slits however this is for illustrative purposes only, it should be understood that the cushion could comprise more or less rows depending on the size of the cushion in-use.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0045">One or more of the plurality of rows do not extend up to either edge of the cushion <b>3</b> and one more of the plurality of rows do extend up to the edges of the cushion on both sides, wherein the slits which extend to the edges on either side define open ended slits <b>6</b>. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> typically in every other row the slits will extend up to the edges of the cushion on both sides to define the open ended slits <b>6</b>. Advantageously this maintains structural integrity of the cushion whilst also allowing for a stable extension and retraction of the cushion <b>3</b>. The cushion <b>3</b> is typically made of one or more layers of foam which are joined together by adhesive and/or heat sealing.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> there is shown a first embodiment of a base <b>9</b> to which the cushion <b>3</b> may be coupled, typically releasably coupled, by a suitable attachment means <b>10</b> comprising for example co-operative hook and loop fasteners or adhesive or any other suitable attachment means. The base <b>9</b> is movable between a retracted state, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and one or more extended states such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> respectively.

The forward section <b>13</b> is substantially cuboidal in shape. The two opposing side walls <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of the first part <b>11</b> each comprise a respective channel <b>20</b> within which the second part <b>12</b> is configured to displace. To this end, the second part <b>12</b> typically comprises a bottom part <b>16</b> with two opposing side walls <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> which upstand from opposing edges of the bottom part <b>16</b> such that the second part <b>12</b> is substantially trough-shaped. The side walls <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> of the second part <b>12</b> comprise respective male members <b>19</b>, which are provided on their outward faces, which are configured to slide within the channels <b>20</b> provided in the opposing side walls <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of the first part <b>11</b> such that the first part <b>11</b> can slide longitudinally with respect to the second part <b>12</b> and vice-versa such as to vary the base <b>9</b> between the extended and retracted states such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>5</b></figref>. The male members <b>19</b> may comprise any suitable member such as but not limited to a pin, or screw or any other suitable member. In an alternative embodiment (not shown) the male member <b>19</b> may be provided upon the first part <b>11</b> with the second part <b>12</b> having a female member, i.e. a channel, to allow for the sliding movement of the second part <b>12</b> with respect to the first part <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a plurality of support portions <b>21</b> for supporting one or more body parts of a user in-use. To this end the support portions <b>21</b> are shaped and dimensioned to substantially conform, at least in part, to one or more body parts of a user which they are configured to support. The support portions <b>21</b> may be shaped to the specific dimensions of a particular user or they may be shaped more generally to conform to the average dimensions of a user of a particular age, height, weight or the like. The one or more support portions <b>21</b> comprise attachment means for coupling to the attachment means <b>10</b> provided on the base for coupling the one or more support portions <b>21</b> to the base <b>9</b> and/or cushion <b>3</b> respectively. The attachment means <b>10</b> comprising for example co-operative hook and loop fasteners or adhesive or any other suitable attachment means as mentioned previously.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0049">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, there are shown two different types of support portions <b>21</b>, a posterior support <b>22</b> configured to support a user's posterior and a thigh support <b>23</b> configured to support a user's thighs in-use. To this end, the posterior support <b>22</b> comprises first and second portions <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> which are configured to support either side of a user's posterior in-use. The first and second portions <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> are typically substantially right angled in shape, each having an upstanding right angled edge <b>26</b> from which an inner depression <b>27</b> extends downwards and away therefrom. In-use the posterior support <b>22</b>, when coupled to the base <b>9</b> and/or cushion <b>3</b>, is configured to support a user's posterior with either side of the user's posterior being seated within the respective inner depressions <b>27</b> with the right-angled edges <b>26</b> aiding in retaining the user's posterior within the posterior support <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0050">The thigh support <b>23</b> comprises a substantially semi-cylindrical portion typically having one or more concave depressions <b>29</b> formed on one or more surfaces thereof to aid in seating the user's thigh in-use. Accordingly, the thigh support <b>23</b> may be formed in a singular piece with separate depressions formed therein for each thigh of the user, or it may be made of two parts which are releasably coupleable together via a suitable attachment means <b>10</b>, comprising for example co-operative hook and loop fasteners or adhesive or any other suitable attachment means.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a coupling portion <b>30</b> configured to provide a planar surface upon which to attach one or more of the support portions <b>21</b>. To this end the coupling portion <b>30</b> comprises means for attachment to the base <b>9</b> and means for attachment to one or more of the more support portions <b>21</b>. The one or more support portions <b>21</b> further comprising means for attachment to the cushion <b>3</b>.

As can be seen in the figures the coupling portion <b>30</b> may be seated, typically coupled thereto, at least in part, on top of the bottom part <b>16</b> of the second part <b>12</b> of the base <b>9</b>. Advantageously, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> when the coupling portion is seated on top of the bottom part <b>16</b> the upper surface of the coupling portion <b>30</b> typically lies substantially flush with the upper surface of the forward section of the first part <b>11</b> such as to define a substantially flush surface across both first and second parts <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> of the base <b>9</b>. Advantageously, the flush surface provides a good mounting surface upon which to couple the support portions <b>21</b>. To this end, the posterior support <b>22</b> may be coupled upon opposing sides of the top surface of coupling portion <b>30</b>, typically at the end of the coupling portion <b>30</b> which is furthest away from the first part <b>11</b> of the base <b>9</b>.
