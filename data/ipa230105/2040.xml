Therefore, such wings are sometimes also referred to as horizontal stabilizers, horizontal stabilizer wings, or stabilizer wings.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, helicopters have one or more stabilizer wings placed at the rear end of a tail-unit. In some models, stabilizer wings protrude from a rear part of the tail boom or from the fin. In other models, a single stabilizer wing is placed on top of the fin. The latter configuration in which a single stabilizer wing is placed on top of the fin is sometimes also referred to as a T-tail.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to the location of the stabilizer wings at the aft region of the rotorcraft, they are typically subject to the air flow structures created by the at least one main rotor. These air flow structures, which are sometimes also referred to as wake or rotor wake, interact with the stabilizer wings and determine the aerodynamic load on the stabilizer wings.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The strength of the interaction between a rotor wake and a stabilizer wing depends on the positioning of the stabilizer wing relative to the rotor and on the flight state (e.g., during take-off and landing or during horizontal flight). However, the generation of aerodynamic loads on the stabilizer wing that are significant for the structural sizing of the stabilizer wing can usually not be avoided.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The stabilizer wing generates a certain amount of static aerodynamic load on purpose (e.g., to improve the stability and the handling of the rotorcraft during a flight). However, unwanted unsteady aerodynamic loads also result from the interaction of the rotor wake with the stabilizer wing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These unsteady aerodynamic loads can sometimes reach significant amplitudes, which can lead to fatigue failures of the stabilizer wing. Therefore, special attention during the development of the stabilizer wing is often required to guarantee a structural design that significantly reduces the risk of fatigue failures caused by the unwanted unsteady aerodynamic loads.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The problem is often exacerbated by the fact that one of the dynamic natural frequencies of the stabilizer wing and the tail boom is close to the excitation frequency of the rotor wake. Such resonance conditions between the rotor wake and the stabilizer wing can be avoided by increasing either the structural stiffness or the mass of the stabilizer wing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, increasing the structural stiffness or the mass of the stabilizer wing adds weight in a sensitive area of the rotorcraft as it moves the center of gravity further to the rear. Especially when the stabilizer wing is placed on the fin, the structural and dynamical issues are difficult to solve. As a result, stabilizer wings are rarely placed on the fin, which would otherwise be very beneficial for handling quality and performance.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Instead, most conventional solutions place the stabilizer wing at a position that is in vertical direction below the rotor plane (e.g., at the tail boom). As a result, the interaction between the rotor wake and the stabilizer wing mostly occurs at lower flight speeds. Since air loads increase with flight speed, an interaction between the rotor wake and the stabilizer wing at lower flight speeds generates comparatively moderate unsteady aerodynamic loads, while the static air load on the stabilizer wing is comparatively low. Thus, since the stabilizer wing's structure is subject to the superposition of the static air load and the unsteady aerodynamic loads, the stabilizer wing's structure does not reach its fatigue limits at lower flight speeds.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">At high flight speeds, the rotor wake has changed its trajectory and passes above a low-positioned stabilizer wing (i.e., a stabilizer wing that is located at the tail boom, for instance). Thus, even though the static air load on the stabilizer wing is greater at high flight speeds than at low flight speeds, the comparatively small amplitude of unsteady aerodynamic loads of a low-positioned stabilizer wing has the effect that the total air load remains well within the envelope of the fatigue limits.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, a low-positioned stabilizer wing exhibits reduced handling qualities and performance compared to a high-positioned stabilizer wing (e.g., a stabilizer wing on top of the fin). For example, during hover and/or at low flight speed the low-positioned stabilizer wing lies within the rotor downwash and generates a force directed to the ground, which is sometimes also referred to as downforce. This downforce causes the rotorcraft to pitch up the nose region, which is sometimes also referred to as nose-up pitching.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A nose-up pitching can severely reduce the pilot's vision towards the ground. The nose-up pitching further generates a relatively high stress in the rotor mast. Moreover, the downforce can significantly reduce the payload of the rotorcraft. As an example, the downforce can reduce the payload of a helicopter in the three to four tons class by an amount that is equivalent to one passenger.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, a low-positioned stabilizer wing usually has to be mounted at the tail boom. This leads to a shorter lever arm and thereby to a reduced stabilizing effect compared to a high-positioned stabilizer wing.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some helicopter manufacturers try to overcome the dilemma between handling and performance on one hand and flight stability on the other hand by adopting a high-positioned stabilizer wing. However, as mentioned above, these high-positioned stabilizer wings face the problem of strong unsteady aerodynamic loads caused by the interaction with the rotor wake in cruise flight.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As the unsteady aerodynamic loads pose serious structural problems, a relatively small number of helicopters designed up to date features the high-positioned stabilizer wing. Often, helicopters with high-positioned stabilizer wings include additional means to reduce the unsteady aerodynamic loads. Among such means is the tapering of the stabilizer wings (i.e., the stabilizer wing has a chord length that is longer at the root than at the tips) or the inclusion of structural reinforcements. These reinforcements typically consist of thickening the stabilizer wing at its connection to the tail boom or fin, or installing struts that externally support the stabilizer wing.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, the AV-02 Hughes YAH-64 Advanced Attack Helicopter has a T-Tail (i.e., a stabilizer wing on the fin) with sweep (i.e., the stabilizer wing angles backwards from the root to the tips) and tapering. The Agusta-Bell BA609 features a T-Tail with tapering, whereby the stabilizer wing has straight leading and trailing edges. The RAH-66 Comanche has a T-Tail with a straight stabilizer wing (i.e., a stabilizer wing on top of the fin with straight leading and trailing edges but without a sweep). The Kamov Ka-60 has a T-Tail with a straight stabilizer wing and struts to the fin.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Both measures, the tapering of the stabilizer wing and the reinforcements, are disadvantageous from an aerodynamic point of view, as they increase drag, reduce the effectiveness of the stabilizer wing, and diminish the range of flight states in which the stabilizer wing has the capability to stabilize the rotorcraft.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The document EP 2 899 118 A1 describes a rotorcraft with a fuselage and at least one main rotor, said at least one main rotor being drivable for controlling an associated pitch attitude of said rotorcraft in operation, and said fuselage being equipped with at least one passive wing-type aerodynamic device that is adapted for generating independently of said associated pitch attitude a lift force acting on said fuselage, said lift force being oriented perpendicular to an air flow that is directed in operation of said rotorcraft against said passive wing-type aerodynamic device. The rotorcraft further comprises a fin with a rudder and a tail wing in the form of a T-tail provided at the tail boom of the fuselage. The tail wing may be adjustable in its inclination and act as an additional lifting surface.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The document CN 103 979 105 A describes a vertical take-off and landing type variable-wing aircraft. The vertical take-off and landing type variable-wing aircraft comprises an aircraft body, a main wing, a left wing and a right wing, wherein the main wing is arranged at the lower part of the aircraft body; the left wing and the right wing are respectively connected to two ends of the main wing; a left wing rotation shaft sleeve and a right wing rotation shaft sleeve are mounted in the main wing; one set of left wing rotation shaft in the left wing rotation shaft sleeve is arranged in the left wing; one set of right wing rotation shaft in the right wing rotation shaft sleeve is arranged on the right wing; a left wing steering engine and a right wing steering engine are also arranged in the main wing; the left wing steering engine is used for driving the left wing rotation shaft to adjust the direction of the left wing; the right wing steering engine is used for driving the right wing rotation shaft to adjust the direction of the right wing. The vertical take-off and landing type variable-wing aircraft is capable of realizing the vertical take-off and landing of a model airplane and an unmanned aircraft, quickly realizing various flight states and effectively braking and moving backward in the flight.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The document EP 2 666 719 B1 describes an aircraft that includes a fuselage, at least one main rotor provided with a plurality of blades, at least a pusher propeller with variable pitch, at least one aerofoil and at least one motor rotationally driving the main rotor and each pusher propeller. The aerofoil may comprise two half-wings positioned either side of the fuselage and at least one horizontal stabilizer positioned at one end of the aircraft and provided with at least one moving surface.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The document WO 1999/067130 A1 describes a horizontal stabilizer defining first and second spanwise stations wherein the first spanwise station defines a first angle of incidence and the second spanwise station defines a second angle of incidence and wherein the angle of incidence is different from one station to the other, e.g., one is greater than the other. The horizontal stabilizer functions to favorably affect the spanwise lift distribution to reduce the bending moments about its mounting interface. Various embodiments of the horizontal stabilizer include the use of vertically extending tabs along the trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizer, a stepped-transition to abruptly change the angle of incidence from one station to another, and a distributed twist which gradually changes the angle of incidence.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The document EP 0 254 605 A1 describes a directional and stabilizing device that comprises a ducted tail rotor driven in rotation in a transverse seam formed in a fairing inclined to the vertical by an angle between 0&#xb0; and 45&#xb0;. It also includes a tail &#x201c;in-V&#x201d; attached to the top of the shroud and the two aerodynamic surfaces extend asymmetrically relative to the vertical plane passing through the apex of the fairing. The aerodynamic surfaces and are inclined at angle ranges between 0&#xb0; and 45&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The document U.S. Pat. No. 3,464,650 A describes an aircraft with a flapped rotor/wing for vertical and short take-off and landing (V/STOL) performance. On top of a vertical tail, the aircraft has a horizontal stabilizer, which may be of the all movable type, or have individually movable portions. These individual portions would act as conventional elevators, or could be connected to function as ailerons for roll control in forward flight in the manner of dual function elevation surfaces. Conventional aircraft controls are used to operate the horizontal stabilizer, and the rudder on the vertical tail, for control in forward flight.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Other stabilizer wings are exemplarily described in documents CN 106 516 082 A, US 2016/0031554 A1, WO 2005/005250 A2, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,738,301 A, and 3,902,688 A. These documents respectively describe stabilizer wings in a rotorcraft, which are at least similar to the above described stabilizer wings. The documents EP2409917 and WO2009155584 have been cited.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In summary, the interaction between rotor wake and horizontal stabilizer wings in rotorcrafts is dependent on the flight mode (i.e., hover, low-, or high-speed forward flight) and the placement of the stabilizer wing on the rotorcraft (i.e., low-positioned or high-positioned), which has an impact on the handling, the performance, and the flight stability. High-positioned stabilizer wings provide better handling, performance, and flight stability than low-positioned stabilizer wings. However, as mentioned above, high-positioned stabilizer wings face the problem of strong unsteady aerodynamic loads caused by the interaction with the rotor wake in cruise flight.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is, therefore, an objective to provide a rotorcraft with a fuselage, at least one main rotor, and a stabilizer wing. The stabilizer wing should reduce unsteady aerodynamic loads caused by the interaction with the rotor wake of the at least one main rotor while providing improved handling, performance, and flight stability compared to conventional stabilizer wings.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">This objective is solved by a rotorcraft, which comprises the features of claim <b>1</b>. More specifically, a rotorcraft may comprise a fuselage having a center line, at least one main rotor that generates vortices during operation, and a stabilizer wing that is connected to the fuselage. The stabilizer wing is provided with a left wing tip, a right wing tip, a quarter chord line with a non-zero curvature, such that an interaction between the vortices generated by the at least one main rotor and the quarter chord line is spread out over time, a leading edge that is arc-shaped, and a trailing edge that is arc-shaped.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Advantageously, in the rotorcraft with the at least one main rotor, the above-described stabilizer wing with the quarter chord line having the non-zero curvature leads to reduced unsteady aerodynamic loads caused by the wake of the at least one main rotor on the stabilizer wing. Such stabilizer wings may be used on any rotorcraft with at least one main rotor including vertical take-off and landing aircraft, multicopters, helicopters, drones, etc.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The stabilizer wing has a particular planform (i.e., a particular shape when seen from above). The particular planform of the stabilizer wing reduces the unsteady loads generated by the interaction with the rotor wake of the at least one main rotor. In contrast to existing stabilizer wing planforms, which are mostly rectangular or consist of two trapezoids, a planform is proposed in which the leading and trailing edges feature a curvature.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Accordingly, the quarter chord line of the stabilizer wing is curved. In other words, the line that connects all points that are located at a quarter of the chord length, which is the distance from the leading to the trailing edge of the stabilizer wing along the chord, from the leading edge, is curved. Having a curved quarter chord line advantageously changes the response of the stabilizer wing to the fluctuations of the rotor wake compared to stabilizer wings with a straight quarter chord line.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In fact, a rotor wake exhibits a regular pattern of air flow at cruise flight, and this pattern determines the temporal sequence of load states at the stabilizer wing. A curved quarter chord line alters the relation between the stabilizer wing and the rotor wake flow pattern by reducing the amplitude of unsteady loads. Thereby, the stabilizer wing becomes less receptive to momentary load states of the type that generate high stress at the connection of the stabilizer wing with the rotorcraft (e.g., at the tail boom or the fin), where the stabilizer wing is structurally sensitive. In particular the moment oscillations of the stabilizer wing around the longitudinal axis of the rotorcraft benefit from the reduced interaction between rotor wake and stabilizer wing because these moment oscillations are the most critical for the connection of the stabilizer wing with the rotorcraft from a structural point of view.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Since the proposed new planform of the stabilizer wing considerably reduces the unsteady loads of aerodynamic origin at the attachment location of the stabilizer wing, the attachment fitting of the stabilizer wing may be designed more weight-economically, and more space-economically (i.e., with less potentially negative impact on the aerodynamic shape of the interconnection region between stabilizer wing and tail boom or fin) than attachment fittings of conventional stabilizer wings.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Significant weight savings may be achieved thanks to the reduced unsteady aerodynamic loads. As an example, the stabilizer wing may require less structural reinforcements. As another example, the strength and the weight of the structures to which the stabilizer wing is attached (e.g., the tail boom or the fin) and to which the stabilizer wing transmits the unsteady aerodynamic loads may be structurally reduced as well.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The fin of a rotorcraft is often a structurally weak component. Therefore, a stabilizer wing with a curved quarter chord line that significantly decreases the unsteady loads caused by the rotor wake is especially beneficial when mounted to the fin. In fact, the aerodynamic interaction between the rotor wake and the stabilizer wing occurs at high speed and the unsteady loads at the stabilizer wing usually reach highest amplitudes when the stabilizer wing is mounted to the fin.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Moreover, the exposure time of the stabilizer wing to these high unsteady loads caused by the rotor wake amounts to a large fraction of the operation time of a rotorcraft. The large distance between the stabilizer wing and the fuselage renders the fin attachment into a joint, which responds with large deflections to stabilizer wing loads and exhibits a low natural frequency that is difficult to correct if needed from a structural dynamics point of view.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A stabilizer wing with a curved quarter chord line may achieve the decisive amount of unsteady load reduction that is necessary to realize the otherwise challenging design of a fin-mounted stabilizer wing.

If desired, stabilizer wing <b>133</b> may have a tapered chord length.

In other words, when drawing a connection line between two arbitrary points on the quarter chord line of stabilizer wing <b>133</b>, the quarter chord line segment in between these two arbitrary points is closer to the nose region <b>108</b> than the connection line.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">If desired, the quarter chord line of stabilizer wing <b>133</b> may be curved forward.

Illustratively, the main rotor <b>102</b><i>d </i>efines a main rotor center <b>103</b> and comprises a rotor mast. The rotor mast has a rotor mast axis (e.g., rotor mast axis <b>103</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) that defines a rotational axis of the main rotor <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">During operation, main rotor <b>102</b> may generate air flow structures for providing lift and forward or backward thrust. Such air flow structures are sometimes also referred to as rotor wake or wake. The rotor wake of main rotor <b>102</b> may interact with stabilizer wing <b>133</b>. In particular, the rotor wake may put an aerodynamic load on stabilizer wing <b>133</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The aerodynamic load on stabilizer wing <b>133</b> may be divided into a static aerodynamic load and an unsteady aerodynamic load. The static aerodynamic load is desirable because it improves flight stability and performance. The unsteady aerodynamic load is unwanted because it creates structural stress at the stabilizer wing <b>133</b> and the portions of rotorcraft <b>100</b> to which stabilizer wing <b>133</b> is attached.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The unsteady aerodynamic loads on stabilizer wing <b>133</b> are caused by changes in the air flow speed and/or the air flow direction and may cause lift changes at stabilizer wing <b>133</b>. These lift changes on the stabilizer wing <b>133</b> occur as a response to flow changes at the quarter chord line of stabilizer wing <b>133</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Important changes in air flow speed and direction occur in the rotor wake in form of vortices. Vortices are volumes of air that revolve around an elongated, usually curved axis which is the center of the vortex. In rotorcraft <b>100</b>, vortices are emanating from the tips of rotor blades <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>, <b>102</b><i>d</i>, <b>102</b><i>e. </i></p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Due to the rotor blades' rotation and simultaneous forward motion in the direction of flight, the shape of the axis of a rotor tip vortex resembles that of a helix when seen from above. The helix, while created at the rotor blades' tips, is moving backwards relative to rotorcraft <b>100</b> during forward flight at a speed nearly identical to flight speed. A certain portion of the rotor blade tip vortices will travel by the stabilizer wing <b>133</b> and cause the unsteady aerodynamic loads.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Since lift changes on the stabilizer wing <b>133</b> occur as a response to flow changes at the quarter chord line of stabilizer wing <b>133</b>, unsteady aerodynamic loads on the stabilizer wing <b>133</b> can be modeled approximately by the interaction between the rotor blade tip vortices and the quarter chord line of stabilizer wing <b>133</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As mentioned above, the quarter chord line of stabilizer wing <b>133</b> has a non-zero curvature. Thus, the interaction between the vortices generated by the at least one main rotor <b>102</b> and the quarter chord line may be spread out over time compared to stabilizer wings with a straight quarter chord line.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In fact, due to the helix pattern, rotor blade tip vortices periodically pass by the quarter chord line of stabilizer wing <b>133</b>. For a rotor with N rotor blades, N helix-shaped rotor tip vortex systems are created, and hence N rotor blade tip vortices pass by stabilizer wing <b>133</b> per rotor revolution. Accordingly, the unsteady aerodynamic loads at stabilizer wing <b>133</b> occur periodically with fundamental frequency N per rotor revolution.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Thanks to the curved shape of the quarter chord line, the shape of the periodic unsteady aerodynamic loads at the attachment of stabilizer wing <b>133</b> at fin <b>131</b> or tail boom <b>121</b> may have smoother peaks and reduced amplitudes compared to a stabilizer wing with a straight quarter chord line.

For example, the fin may generate a force to the right (i.e., in positive Y direction) in a rotorcraft with a rotor that rotates counter-clockwise when seen from above. In fact, the force generated by the fin is achieved by a negative pressure on the right surface of the fin.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0166">In this example, an incidence angle of zero degrees between the chord of the stabilizer wing and the XY plane may be on the right side of the fin (i.e., at a span station with a positive Y).
