Both foregoing applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Blowout preventers (BOPs) for oil and gas wells are used to prevent potentially catastrophic events known as blowouts, where high well pressures and uncontrolled flow from a subsurface formation into the well can expel tubing (e.g., drill pipe and well casing), tools and drilling fluid out of a well. Blowouts present a serious safety hazard to drilling crews, the drilling rig and the environment, and can be extremely costly. Typically, BOPs have &#x201c;rams&#x201d; that are opened and closed by actuators. The most common type of actuator is operated hydraulically to push closure elements across a through bore in a BOP housing (itself sealingly coupled to the well) close the well. In some cases the rams have hardened steel shears to cut through a drill string or other tool or device which may be in the well at the time it is necessary to close the BOP.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In typical operational use, unless a problem is detected with an installed BOP, the BOP system is typically left in place for an extended period of time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a conventional BOP stack <b>10</b> mounted to a wellhead <b>12</b> disposed at the sea floor <b>14</b>. A riser <b>16</b> is coupled in between the BOP stack <b>10</b> and a floating platform <b>18</b> to provide a conduit for the drilling fluid return during well construction and for hydrocarbons and other fluids produced from a completed subsea well drilled beneath the sea floor <b>14</b>. Signal and data communication between the platform <b>18</b> and the BOP stack <b>10</b> is typically accomplished via a multiplex or MUX cable <b>22</b> extending along the riser <b>16</b> linking the platform <b>18</b> and BOP stack <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Pyrotechnic based BOPs have been proposed which address shortcomings of conventional hydraulic BOPs. U.S. Pat. No. 10,465,466 issued to Angstmann et al. and assigned to Kinetic Pressure Control Limited describes such pyrotechnic BOPs. Although pyrotechnic based BOPs provide significant advantages compared to conventional BOPs, a need remains for means to monitor and test the ignition or activation mechanisms of such pyrotechnic based BOPs to ensure operational integrity.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An initiator monitoring and actuating system according to one aspect of this disclosure includes a first power supply selectively electrically connectable to a charge initiator.

In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described. In the development of any such actual implementation, numerous implementation-specific decisions may need to be made to obtain design-specific goals, which may vary from one implementation to another. It will be appreciated that such a development effort, while possibly complex and time-consuming, would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for persons of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. The disclosed embodiments are not to be limited to the precise arrangements and configurations shown in the figures, in which like reference numerals may identify like elements. Also, the figures are not necessarily drawn to scale, and certain features may be shown exaggerated in scale or in generalized or schematic form, in the interest of clarity and conciseness.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a cross section view of an example embodiment of a pyrotechnic based BOP <b>100</b> according the present disclosure. The BOP <b>100</b> has a main body <b>30</b> having a through bore <b>32</b>. The BOP <b>100</b> also has a passage <b>34</b> that is transverse to the through bore <b>32</b>. A shearing device <b>36</b> having a cutting edge <b>38</b> is located in the passage <b>34</b> on one side of the through bore <b>32</b>. An end cap <b>40</b> closes off the passage <b>34</b> at one lateral end of the BOP <b>100</b>. A charge <b>42</b>, which may be in the form of a chemical propellant, is deposed on the end cap <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example embodiment of a charge <b>42</b> according to this disclosure. The charge <b>42</b> may have a generally cylindrical body <b>44</b> which houses a chemical propellant <b>46</b>. An end of the charge <b>42</b> is configured with an internal Y-shaped port <b>48</b> leading to a pair of initiators <b>50</b>. Two initiators <b>50</b> are used for operational redundancy. Each initiator <b>50</b> has its own separate activation circuit (described below). Conventional chemical propellants <b>46</b> may be used in implementations of the embodiments as known in the art. Conventional electrically-activated initiators <b>50</b> may also be used as known in the art. When activated via an electrical signal across electrical leads <b>52</b>, the initiator <b>50</b> ignites the chemical propellant <b>46</b>. Once ignited, the chemical propellant <b>46</b> produces high-pressure gases which propel the shearing device (<b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) along the passage (<b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and across the through bore (<b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) to shear anything in the through bore (<b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), as described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 10,465,466 referred to herein above.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In operation, activation of the BOP <b>100</b> to clear and seal the through bore (<b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is triggered only when it is imperative to immediately close off fluid flow from the well (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) via the through bore (<b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, e.g., an imminent well pressure control event). Once ignited, the chemical propellant <b>46</b> is consumed as it produces the high-pressure gases to propel the shearing device (<b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Therefore, activation of an initiator <b>50</b> to ignite the chemical propellant <b>46</b> is a one-time event that is triggered only in critical or emergency situations when it is vital to maintain pressure control of the well.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The critical nature of the BOP <b>100</b> to the overall safety of well operations requires inspection, monitoring, and testing of the system to ensure proper operation in the event activation is necessary. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example embodiment of an electrical circuit <b>200</b> according to this disclosure. The electrical circuit <b>200</b> includes a power supply <b>202</b> (DC voltage). It will be appreciated that the electrical circuit may be electrically connected to devices on the platform (<b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) using, e.g., the MUX cable (<b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) wherein control signals may be sent to the electrical circuit <b>200</b> and sensor signals may be communicated to the devices on the platform.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the power supply <b>202</b> may comprise one or more batteries or may be a remote source electrically coupled to the electrical circuit <b>200</b> to provide power. One circuit leg A links one terminal of the power supply <b>202</b> to one lead (e.g., <b>52</b> (+) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of each initiator (<b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Another circuit leg B links another terminal of the power supply <b>202</b> to the other lead (e.g., <b>52</b> (&#x2212;) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of each initiator (<b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), providing a current return and forming a first closed circuit <b>204</b>. The first closed circuit <b>204</b> may include a resistor <b>206</b>, a programmable logic controller (PLC) <b>208</b>, and a switch or relay <b>210</b>. The first closed circuit <b>204</b> may be configured to provide a constant, low amperage current through one or both initiators (<b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Such current may be obtained, for example, by suitable selection of the value of resistor <b>206</b>. The constant, low amperage current running through first closed circuit <b>204</b> is kept below the activation current needed to ignite the initiators (<b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In this manner, the first closed circuit <b>204</b> may be used to monitor the closed-circuit status of the activation system to ensure circuit integrity.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another circuit leg C may link one terminal of the power supply <b>202</b> to one lead (e.g., <b>52</b> (+) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of each initiator <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Circuit leg B remains linked to the other terminal of the power supply <b>202</b> and to the other lead (e.g., <b>52</b> (&#x2212;) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of each initiator (<b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), providing a second closed circuit <b>212</b> when switch or relay <b>210</b> is closed. The second closed circuit <b>212</b> includes a resistor <b>214</b>, and a pair of switches or relays <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. The second closed circuit <b>212</b> may be configured, such as by suitable selection of a value of resistor <b>214</b> to provide a current of enough amperage to activate and ignite the initiator(s) (<b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The second closed circuit <b>212</b> is powered only when it is desired to ignite the chemical propellant <b>46</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another circuit leg D is coupled into the second closed circuit <b>212</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. This circuit leg D terminates at the other terminal of the power supply <b>202</b> (the terminal end may be coupled directly to the power supply <b>202</b> or linked into circuit leg B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) providing a third closed circuit <b>220</b> when a switch or relay <b>222</b> is closed. The third closed circuit <b>220</b> also includes a resistor <b>224</b> and a shunt (current) meter <b>226</b>. When switch or relay <b>210</b> is open and the third closed circuit <b>212</b> is energized with current sufficient to ignite an initiator <b>50</b>, the third closed circuit <b>220</b> forms the closed circuit for the return terminal to the power supply <b>202</b>. In this manner, switch or relay <b>210</b> may be selectively opened and an initiator fire-test current passed through second and third closed circuits <b>212</b> and <b>220</b> to test system integrity without activating the initiator(s). In some embodiments, an inductive current/voltage-configured programmable logic controller <b>228</b> may be disposed proximate circuit <b>220</b> to determine the current on the various circuit legs as known in the art.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Operation of the switches <b>210</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>222</b> may be performed by the PLC <b>208</b> either or both autonomously and/or by commands sent from the surface. Measurements made by the shunt meter <b>226</b> and the inductive current/voltage-configured programmable logic controller <b>228</b> may be communicated to the surface, e.g., over the MUX cable (<b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although the power supply <b>202</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and is described as a single power supply, some embodiments may comprise more than one power supply. In some embodiments, there may be a first, low current power supply connectible to circuit legs A and B, where the first power supply can only provide current below the activation level of the initiator(s). Such current may be limited by appropriate selection of the resistor <b>206</b> in current leg A, or an equivalent or additional resistor in circuit leg B. Correspondingly, a second power supply may provide activation current to circuit legs A and B, when suitable switches are closed, and suitable selection of value of resistor <b>214</b> in circuit leg C. Thus, the operation of the monitoring and activation system may result from suitable selection of power supplies, or, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, by a single power supply and suitable values of resistors <b>206</b> and <b>214</b> to provide appropriate current for monitoring, testing and activation of the initiator(s).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments according to this disclosure allow one to monitor and test ignition systems a disclosed.
