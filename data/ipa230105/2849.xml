They have irreplaceable advantages in some parts having high strength and complex shapes. The materials used for thermoformed components are classified into plated materials and unplated materials. Plated materials include hot dip galvanized materials, hot dip galvanized alloyed materials, hot dip aluminized materials, materials with inorganic/organic coating layers, etc. A plating layer is mainly aimed to protect steel plates from oxidation and decarburization of the surfaces of the steel plates during a hot stamping forming process. The formed components may be coated and welded directly for use. Unplated materials must be subjected to surface shot blasting after thermoforming, so as to remove the oxide layer generated on the surface; otherwise, subsequent coating and welding of the parts will be affected. The plated thermoforming materials widely used nowadays are mainly aluminum-silicon plated materials, because an aluminum-silicon plating layer exhibits excellent heat resistance, weather resistance and high heat reflectivity. However, conventional aluminum-silicon plated thermoforming materials often have a mottled appearance in use, looking locally inconsistent in surface color.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Chinese Patent Publication No. CN104651590A discloses an aluminum or aluminum alloy coated thermoforming material and a method for manufacturing the same. The method purposefully controls the coating layer thickness and the five-layer structure, thereby guaranteeing the welding performance of the thermoformed member.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Chinese Patent Publication No. CN108588612A discloses an aluminum or aluminum alloy coated thermoformed member. According to this patent application, the coating layer thickness is reduced. The disadvantage is that the protecting effect of the coating layer is degraded. The surface properties of the member are quite susceptible to the fluctuation of the hot forming process, and the performances of the member in subsequent use will be affected in turn.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Chinese Patent Publication No. CN101583486 discloses a hot stamped product made from a coated steel strip and a method for manufacturing the same. The method includes heating, transferring and cooling. However, the hot stamping process is not illustrated, including stamping parameters such as mold clamping speed, pressure holding time, etc. As such, the quality of the stamped product will be unstable. For example, shrinking, cracking and the like will occur. The furnace atmosphere is not controlled during the heating process, such that the atmosphere in the furnace varies during the heating process, especially the oxygen content which changes greatly. As a result, the appearance and color of the product change easily.

During the heating process, aluminum diffuses into the substrate while it is being heated to form an iron-aluminum alloy. The iron-aluminum alloy is rigid and brittle, and has a high melting point.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The surface of the thermoformed part is referred to as a coating layer herein. The melting point of aluminum in the plating layer on the surface of the primary steel sheet is very low, namely about 600&#xb0; C. In the early stage of heating, if the heating rate is too fast, aluminum in the plating layer will melt first and adhere to heating rolls, thereby damaging the plating layer and affecting protection of the plating layer. Further, the coatability, corrosion resistance, and weldability of the thermoformed components will be affected. The heating furnace of the present disclosure is provided with two zones. The main purpose of the low temperature zone is to allow the plating layer to diffuse fully and avoid melting at the early stage of heating, and the main purpose of the high temperature zone is to guarantee the high strength of the thermoformed component.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">During the hot stamping process of the plated steel sheet, the plating layer diffuses gradually during the heating process to form an iron-aluminum alloy layer having a multi-layer structure. At the same time, there is an oxide layer having a porous structure on the surface. Both the alloy layer structure in the coating layer of the thermoformed component and the surface oxide structure have an influence on the product appearance. Local inconsistency often leads to color difference and mottle in the product appearance, affecting the usability of the product.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The inventors of the present disclosure have discovered by research that the C, H or O content and distribution in the surface of the blank product, the uniformity of the plating layer thickness, and the hot stamping process all have significant influences on the appearance of the thermoformed component. If the plating layer thickness is not uniform, the diffusion traces of the elements are different within the same heat treatment time, resulting in different degrees of diffusion and an appearance showing color difference. If the C, H or O content is not uniform, the volatilization and decomposition rates are different during the heating process of the blank in the furnace, resulting in uneven heating of the surface of the blank, such that the diffusion rates and degrees of the surface elements of the blank are different, resulting in uneven color in the appearance of the thermoformed component.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The inventors of the present disclosure have also discovered that the C, H or O in the surface of the blank product mainly comes from oil. Traditionally, a plated steel sheet is not subjected to a degreasing process before hot stamping; instead, it is fed into a heat treatment furnace directly. During the heating process, the oil will be further volatilized or decomposed, thereby influencing the atmosphere at the blank surface. At the same time, residual ash will be produced inevitably after the oil is decomposed, which will affect the final surface elemental composition of the component. In turn, the appearance and coatability of the product will be affected. Therefore, it's preferable that no oil is applied to the plated sheet of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Since it's preferable that no oil is applied to the plated sheet of the present disclosure, no additional water vapor is generated during the heating process, and the dew point will not rise. Thus, it has a very positive effect on the control of the dew point in the furnace, and has a positive effect on the delayed cracking performance of the product. The reason is that water vapor generated by decomposition of oil under heating will inevitably cause the dew point in the furnace to rise, and the risen dew point will evoke hydrogen-induced delayed cracking, resulting in hydrogen embrittlement.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">No oil is applied to the plated steel sheet of the present disclosure. So, there is almost no damage to the heat treatment furnace during the hot stamping process. Because trace acid gases will be generated additionally when oil is heated and decomposed, and will inevitably cause certain damage to the heat treatment furnace, the atmosphere in the hearth needs special management for certain heat treatment furnaces; otherwise, the life of the heat treatment furnace and the product quality are prone to being affected. The step for applying oil can be omitted in the method for manufacturing the thermoformed component according to the present disclosure, and thus the cost can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The weight of the plating layer is uniform across the surface of the plated steel sheet of the present disclosure. The distance and time of diffusion of the plating layer are relatively uniform during the hot stamping process, and the elemental composition in the surface of the thermoformed component is relatively stable.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the hot stamping method of the present disclosure, the heat treatment process takes place in a low temperature zone and a high temperature zone, wherein the low temperature zone can allow the plating layer to diffuse sufficiently slowly to prevent the plating layer from melting, and guarantee the integrity of the plating layer and the uniformity of the surface.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a photograph showing the appearance of the coated thermoformed component of Comparative Example 1;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a photograph showing the appearance of the coated thermoformed component of Comparative Example 2;</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a photograph showing the appearance of the coated thermoformed component of Example 1 according to the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The present disclosure will be further illustrated with reference to the Examples and accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The compositions of the steel sheets used in the Examples according to the disclosure and the Comparative Examples are listed in Table 1.

The holding time was 15 s, and the holding pressure was 10 MPa.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> for the Comparative Examples, because oil was applied to the surfaces of the plated sheets, and the distribution of the oil on the surfaces was uneven, mottle or local color difference was observed in the appearance of the thermoformed products. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the appearance of the unoiled products in the Examples according to the present disclosure, wherein there was no color difference or mottle in the appearance.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The results show that the coated thermoformed components of Examples 1-14 had good coatability, and a coating film having a uniform thickness was formed after coating. The ratio of the standard deviation of the coating film thickness to the average coating film thickness satisfied: 0&#x3c;standard deviation of coating film thickness/average coating film thickness &#x2264;0.1. The coating film adhesion (measured according to Coating Film Adhesion Test Method GBT 9286-1998) was rated as 1 or 0. These coated thermoformed components also had good weldability. In contrast, in the Comparative Examples, after oil was applied to the surfaces of the plated sheets, the oil was not distributed evenly on the surfaces, so mottle or local color difference was observed in the appearance of the thermoformed products, the thickness of the coating film was not uniform, and the adhesion of the coating film was poor.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0000"><tables
