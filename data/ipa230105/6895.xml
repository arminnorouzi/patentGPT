One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one embodiment the invention relates to a method for performing a data center monitoring and management operation, comprising: selecting a service subscription to manage; monitoring asset resource utilization of the subscription service; generating an adaptive service subscription schedule recommendation; and, managing the service subscription based upon the adaptive service schedule recommendation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another embodiment the invention relates to a system comprising: a processor; a data bus coupled to the processor; and a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium embodying computer program code, the non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium being coupled to the data bus, the computer program code interacting with a plurality of computer operations and comprising instructions executable by the processor and configured for: selecting a service subscription to manage; monitoring asset resource utilization of the subscription service; generating an adaptive service subscription schedule recommendation; and, managing the service subscription based upon the adaptive service schedule recommendation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment the invention relates to a computer-readable storage medium embodying computer program code, the computer program code comprising computer executable instructions configured for: selecting a service subscription to manage; monitoring asset resource utilization of the subscription service; generating an adaptive service subscription schedule recommendation; and, managing the service subscription based upon the adaptive service schedule recommendation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention may be better understood, and its numerous objects, features and advantages made apparent to those skilled in the art by referencing the accompanying drawings.

Various aspects of the invention reflect an appreciation that it is common for a typical datacenter to monitor and manage many different assets, such as certain computing and networking devices, described in greater detail herein. Certain aspects of the invention likewise reflect an appreciation that such data center assets are typically implemented to work in combination with one another for a particular purpose. Likewise, various aspects of the invention reflect an appreciation that such purposes generally involve the performance of a wide variety of tasks, operations, and processes to service certain workloads. Accordingly, various aspects of the invention reflect an appreciation that efficient and effective monitoring and management of certain data center assets may assist in optimizing the availability, performance, and reliability of the services offered by a data center.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Certain aspects of the invention likewise reflect an appreciation that a wide variety of cloud computing services are offered on a subscription basis from several cloud providers. However, these service subscriptions are not adaptive to the over, or under, utilization of their associated data center asset resources by an associated workload. More particularly, the cost of such service subscriptions are typically based upon an upper cap of the resources allocated to the service subscription.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Likewise, certain aspects of the invention reflect an appreciation that users of a service subscription may utilize their allocated data center asset resources on an annual basis, yet the resource consumption of many types of workloads may vary greatly over the course of a year. As an example, there may be seasonal fluctuations, such as a specialty store website receiving more traffic around holidays. Likewise, certain aspects of the invention reflect an appreciation that subscribers may be required to choose a service subscription that meets the maximum resource requirements they may have over a certain period of time to avoid outages, and as a result, may pay more than necessary.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">While the user may have the option of upgrading or downgrading the terms of the service subscription, it lacks awareness of how its allocated resources are being utilized. Accordingly, the configuration of the data center asset resources allocated to the service subscription is static, and there is no way to adaptively manage the resources according to changing usage patterns other than manually adding and removing resources. As a result, the subscriber may be paying for resources that are underutilized, or conversely, there may be unanticipated demands on resources that may cause slow response times, service outages, and lower user satisfaction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For purposes of this disclosure, an information handling system may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute, classify, process, transmit, receive, retrieve, originate, switch, store, display, manifest, detect, record, reproduce, handle, or utilize any form of information, intelligence, or data for business, scientific, control, or other purposes.

As an example, a particular workload that is being currently being processed in an on-premises data center monitoring and management environment may need to be scaled. Furthermore, it may be desirable to increase its efficiency. Accordingly, it may need to be allocated additional data center asset resources to achieve these scalability and efficiency goals.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In this example, the workload may currently be allocated five cores of one central processing unit (CPU) in a server, thirty two gigabytes of random access memory (RAM) in the same server, and sixteen terabytes (TB) of random array of independent (RAID) storage.
