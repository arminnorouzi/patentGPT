The electromagnetic suction valve is a normally-open type electromagnetic suction valve in which the valve body is closed by energizing an electromagnetic coil and is opened when a current to the electromagnetic coil is cut off. In a state where the anchor is in contact with a magnetic core, a gap exists between the rod and the valve body. In a case where such a gap does not exist, contact of the valve body with a valve seat is not possible, and the valve can be closed (paragraph 0056).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">PTL 1: JP 2019-27355 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When an electromagnetic suction valve is configured as in the high-pressure fuel supply pump disclosed in PTL 1, in order to secure a gap between a component on the valve body (referred to as a suction valve below) side and a component on the rod side (that is, component on the anchor side) when the valve is closed, it is necessary to set a dimensional tolerance related to the gap to be small in a plurality of components related to the gap.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, even though the dimensional tolerance related to the gap is reduced, securing the gap may not be possible due to integration of tolerance variations because the number of components related to the gap is large.

The sliding portion <b>36</b><i>bb </i>with the anchor support rod <b>45</b>, the sliding portion <b>36</b><i>bd </i>with the suction valve seat member <b>31</b>, an abutting portion <b>36</b><i>bc </i>with the rod <b>30</b><i>b </i>on the suction valve <b>30</b> side, and a seat surface <b>36</b><i>be </i>of the anchor spring <b>40</b> are made of materials that are hardly worn.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The anchor support rod <b>45</b> is held between the outer core <b>33</b><i>b </i>and the inner core <b>33</b><i>a</i>. That is, the anchor support rod <b>45</b> is sandwiched between the outer core <b>33</b><i>b </i>and the inner core <b>33</b><i>a</i>. By using martensitic stainless steel as the material of the anchor support rod <b>45</b>, sliding wear with the anchor sleeve <b>36</b><i>b </i>is suppressed. Further, the anchor support rod <b>45</b> guides the inner periphery of the anchor spring <b>40</b> at an outer peripheral cylindrical portion, and is provided with a flat portion <b>45</b><i>a </i>constituting a seat surface of the anchor spring <b>40</b>. That is, an end portion of the anchor spring (first spring) <b>40</b> on the anchor assembly <b>36</b> side abuts on a spring seat formed at the end portion <b>36</b><i>be </i>of the anchor sleeve (second anchor assembly component) <b>36</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, it is not necessary to form the seat surface of the anchor spring <b>40</b> in the outer core <b>33</b><i>b</i>, and thus it is possible to prevent wear of the outer core <b>33</b><i>b </i>due to the anchor spring <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The anchor spring <b>40</b> is stored radially inside (inner peripheral portion) of an inner cylindrical surface (inner peripheral surface) <b>33</b><i>ac </i>of the inner core <b>33</b><i>a </i>and the inner cylindrical surface (inner peripheral surface) <b>36</b><i>aa </i>of the anchor <b>36</b><i>a</i>, and movement in the radial direction is suppressed by expanded cylindrical surfaces <b>33</b><i>ac </i>and <b>36</b><i>aa </i>and the anchor support rod <b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the inner core <b>33</b><i>a </i>are made of a magnetic material, and plating is performed on the respective collision surfaces in order to prevent wear due to collision between the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the core <b>33</b>. In addition, a gap having a distance obtained by adding the plating thicknesses is provided when the valve is closed. Thus, it is possible to improve the drive responsiveness as compared with a case where the energization is released from a state where the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the core <b>33</b> are directly in contact with each other.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">An appropriate distance is set such that a gap t<b>3</b> (&#x3e;0) is formed between the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the core <b>33</b> when the valve is opened, and a gap t<b>2</b> (&#x3e;0) is formed between the suction valve <b>30</b> and the anchor sleeve <b>36</b><i>b </i>when the valve is closed. As the distance (size) of the gap t<b>3</b> when the valve is opened is set closer to the distance (size) of the gap t<b>1</b>, the valve opening/closing time of the suction valve <b>30</b> is reduced, and the flow rate controllability is improved. On the other hand, if individual variations of components related to the gap t<b>2</b> are not taken into consideration, there is a possibility that the suction valve <b>30</b> does not abut on the suction valve seat <b>31</b><i>a </i>and it is not possible to seal the fuel even in a state where the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>abuts on the core <b>33</b> by energization.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the present example, by adjusting the press-fitting distance L<b>1</b> between the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the anchor sleeve <b>36</b><i>b </i>in accordance with individual variations of the components, the gap t<b>2</b> (&#x3e;0) is formed between the suction valve <b>30</b> and the anchor sleeve <b>36</b><i>b </i>when the valve is closed. The press-fitting portion <b>36</b><i>c </i>(portion indicated by L<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) between the anchor (first anchor assembly component) <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the anchor sleeve (second anchor assembly component) <b>36</b><i>b </i>is set to a press-fitting length at which the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the suction valve <b>30</b> are separated from each other in a state where the suction valve <b>30</b> is closed.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Here, press-fitting means pressing one member (component) into a hole provided in the other member (component) by applying pressure. In a state before press-fitting, the outer diameter of the one member is formed to be larger than the inner diameter of the hole of the other member. In the state after the press-fitting, a strong force is generated between the inner peripheral surface of the hole of the other member and the outer diameter portion (outer peripheral surface) of the one member, and both members are fixed. In the press-fitting portion <b>36</b><i>c </i>in the present example, the outer diameter (diameter) of the outer cylindrical portion (outer peripheral surface) <b>36</b><i>ba </i>of the anchor sleeve <b>36</b><i>b </i>is larger than the inner diameter of the inner cylindrical surface (inner peripheral surface) <b>36</b><i>aa </i>of the anchor <b>36</b><i>a</i>. By press-fitting the outer cylindrical portion <b>36</b><i>ba </i>of the anchor sleeve <b>36</b><i>b </i>into the inner cylindrical surface <b>36</b><i>aa </i>of the anchor <b>36</b><i>a</i>, a strong fixing force is generated between the anchor sleeve <b>36</b><i>b </i>and the anchor <b>36</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The same applies to a press-fitting portion of the fixing portion <b>31</b><i>e. </i></p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">By adjusting the press-fitting distance L<b>1</b> between the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the anchor sleeve <b>36</b><i>b</i>, it is possible to absorb individual variations of components. In this case, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in a state where the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>abuts on the core <b>33</b>, the press-fitting distance L<b>1</b> is adjusted such that a distance L<b>2</b> between the end portion (end surface) <b>33</b><i>ba </i>of the outer core <b>33</b><i>b </i>and the end portion (end surface) <b>36</b><i>bc </i>of the anchor sleeve <b>36</b><i>b </i>becomes a predetermined length. As a result, a variation in the distance L<b>2</b> between the products falls within a predetermined tolerance.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">According to the present example, it is possible to reliably secure a gap between the suction valve (valve body) <b>30</b> and the anchor assembly <b>36</b> (that is, the component on the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>side) in the valve closed state, regardless of the integration tolerance of a plurality of components. From the viewpoint of each component related to the gap, it is not necessary to strictly set the tolerance of each component, and it is easy to manufacture each component. Thus, the yield of each component is improved.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition, since the tolerance of each component is absorbed by the press-fitting distance L<b>1</b>, the maximum tolerance is integrated, so that it is possible to suppress the length of this gap from becoming unnecessarily long. Therefore, in the electromagnetic valve mechanism <b>300</b> in the present example, it is possible to improve the valve opening/closing responsiveness of the suction valve <b>30</b>. As a result, in the high-pressure fuel supply pump <b>100</b> in the present example, it is possible to improve the discharge performance.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In addition, in the high-pressure fuel supply pump <b>100</b> in the present example, since an adjustment shim (adjuster) is not required, it is possible to reduce the number of components. Thus, a process of selecting the adjustment shim or assembling the adjustment shim is not required, and it is possible to reduce the number of components and simplify the assembly facility.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In addition, it is not necessary to measure the integrated tolerance of each component during assembly of the electromagnetic valve mechanism <b>300</b>, and the work process is simplified. This makes it possible to eliminate a matching process of measuring the integrated tolerance of each component and selecting the adjustment shim in accordance with the measurement result.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the anchor assembly <b>36</b> in the present example, the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the anchor sleeve <b>36</b><i>b </i>are assembled by press-fitting, and a welding-less structure is realized. The magnetic material used for the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>is a hardly weldable material, and a magnetic material suitable for the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>can be used due to a welding-less structure. In addition, due to the welding-less structure, welding equipment, check of welding quality, degreasing cleaning, and the like are unnecessary, and measures against sputtering occurring during welding are unnecessary.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Furthermore, in the anchor assembly <b>36</b> in the present example, it is possible to separate the material of the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the material of the anchor sleeve <b>36</b><i>b </i>from each other, to use a magnetic material suitable for the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>as described above, and to use a material having high wear resistance as described above for the anchor sleeve <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Furthermore, since the anchor assembly <b>36</b> in the present example does not have a structure of receiving the mass of the rod and operating integrally with the rod as in PTL 1, it is possible to reduce the weight of the anchor assembly <b>36</b> driven by the magnetic attraction force, and to improve the valve opening/closing responsiveness. Improvement in valve opening/closing responsiveness contributes to an increase in discharge flow rate and improvement in flow rate controllability. In addition, by reducing the weight of the anchor assembly <b>36</b>, it is possible to reduce the collision force acting on the facing surfaces (collision portions) <b>33</b><i>aa </i>and <b>36</b><i>ab </i>of the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the core. It is possible to reduce the damage caused on the facing surfaces <b>33</b><i>aa </i>and <b>36</b><i>ab</i>, and to reduce the collision noise.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Furthermore, since the anchor assembly <b>36</b> in the present example is supported at two points by the sliding portion <b>36</b><i>bb </i>with the anchor support rod <b>45</b> and the sliding portion <b>36</b><i>bd </i>with the suction valve seat member <b>31</b>, the inclination of the anchor assembly <b>36</b> with respect to the axial direction <b>300</b>A is suppressed. Thus, it is possible to suppress partial contact of the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>with the facing surface (magnetic suction surface) <b>33</b><i>aa </i>of the core and to suppress the damage to the magnetic suction surface <b>33</b><i>aa </i>of the core or a coating film (plating or the like) coating the magnetic suction surface <b>33</b><i>aa</i>. In addition, it is possible to prevent fixing (burning) of the anchor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the rod <b>30</b><i>b </i>on the sliding surface. In the structure in which the anchor assembly <b>36</b> is supported at two points (two places), it is possible to reduce the length of a support portion in the axial direction as compared with a structure in which the anchor assembly is supported at one point (one place), which contributes to weight reduction of the anchor assembly <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The electromagnetic valve mechanism <b>300</b> according to the present example described above has the following features.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">(1) In an electromagnetic valve mechanism <b>300</b> including an anchor assembly <b>36</b> and a magnetic core <b>33</b> between which a magnetic attraction force acts, and a suction valve <b>30</b> configured to be able to come into and out of contact with the anchor assembly <b>36</b>, the anchor assembly <b>36</b> includes a first anchor assembly component <b>36</b><i>a </i>having a facing surface <b>36</b><i>ab </i>that faces the magnetic core <b>33</b>, a second anchor assembly component <b>36</b><i>b </i>configured integrally with the first anchor assembly component <b>36</b><i>a</i>, and a press-fitting portion <b>36</b><i>c </i>that fixes the first anchor assembly component <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the second anchor assembly component <b>36</b><i>b</i>.
