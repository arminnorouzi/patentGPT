A memory sub-system can be a storage device, a memory module, or a hybrid of a storage device and memory module. Examples of storage devices and memory modules are described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In general, a host system can utilize a memory sub-system that includes one or more components, such as memory devices that store data. The host system can provide data to be stored at the memory sub-system and can request data to be retrieved from the memory sub-system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Traditionally, caching based architectures are used in a memory sub-system to isolate the host system from the memory sub-system. When a write command is received in the memory sub-system from the host system, data is transferred from the host system to the cache in the memory sub-system. When the write workload exceeds the bandwidth of the media of the memory sub-system to commit, store, or program the data into the media, throttling of the input/output activities in the host system occurs due to the lack of available space in the cache buffer. While such architectures can provide a low latency write using cached data, it has disadvantages when the write workload exceeds the bandwidth of the media of the memory sub-system. For example, the number of outstanding commands that can be issued to the memory sub-system is limited by the size of the cache buffer memory in the memory sub-system. An increased size of the cache buffer memory increases the requirement for the energy storage capability of the power-fail back-up circuitry. Further, when two or more commands are mapped to the same media unit that can execute only one command at a time, a command collision occurs. The collision can lead to both higher buffer memory consumption and higher lifetime of data being stored in the buffer memory. This can result in increased system costs, in terms of increased size requirements for the cache buffer memory and increased energy storage capability of the power-fail hold-up circuitry. Further, a first write stream may block a second write stream by buffering data in the cache buffer memory and leaving no buffer space for the second write stream such that even when there are media units available to execute write commands for the second write stream, the second write stream is blocked for the lack of buffer space in the cache buffer memory.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">At least some aspects of the present disclosure address the above and other deficiencies through timed data transfer between the host system and the memory sub-system. A queuing mechanism is configured to allow commands to be accepted in a memory sub-system without the data to be recorded in the memory sub-system. A queued command can be mapped to a media unit and held in a pending queue per media unit. When the media unit becomes available for executing a write command, the buffer space is allocated for the data of the write command; and the transfer of data for the write command from the host system to the cache buffer memory of the memory sub-system for recording into the media unit is postponed according to the availability of the media unit to accept data. The commands in the queue for the media unit can be executed out of the order in which the commands are received from the host system. The data is transferred via the cache buffer memory just in time for committing, writing, or programming into the media unit. Thus, non-blocking command processing can be performed. Such an arrangement reduces the size requirement of cache buffer memory, and the lifetime of data in the cache buffer memory. For example, the size of cache buffer memory can be reduced to a size that is proportional to the number of media units that are available to support execution of write commands in parallel. The buffer lifetime can be reduced to a time period proportional to the number of data transfers between the host system and the memory sub-system for concurrent execution of the write commands. The significant reduction in cache buffer memory requirements and buffer lifetime reduces the power-fail hold-up requirement. For example, the static random-access memory (SRAM) memory of the controller of the memory sub-system can be used as the cache buffer memory. Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) caching can be eliminated. Such a technique can eliminate the double cost of power-fail-proof of the volatile memory in the computer system, by keeping the more data in the memory that is controlled by the host and that is power-fail-proof using the circuity in the host system. When such a technique is used, an increased number of host write streams and/or collisions do not increase the requirements for the cache buffer memory and power-fail hold-up circuit in the memory sub-system. Further, such a technique can have the benefit of non-blocking and out of order command processing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example computing system <b>100</b> that includes a memory sub-system <b>110</b> in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

An example of a managed memory device is a managed NAND (MNAND) device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The computing system <b>100</b> includes a data transfer manager <b>113</b> in the memory sub-system <b>110</b> that postpones the data transfer for write commands until one or more media units/memory components are determined to be available for committing, storing, writing, or programming the data into the media units/memory components. In some embodiments, the controller <b>115</b> in the memory sub-system <b>110</b> includes at least a portion of the data transfer manager <b>113</b>. In other embodiments, or in combination, the controller <b>116</b> and/or the processing device <b>118</b> in the host system <b>120</b> includes at least a portion of the data transfer manager <b>113</b>. For example, the controller <b>115</b>, the controller <b>116</b>, and/or the processing device <b>118</b> can include logic circuitry implementing the data transfer manager <b>113</b>. For example, the controller <b>115</b>, or the processing device <b>118</b> (processor) of the host system <b>120</b>, can be configured to execute instructions stored in memory for performing the operations of the data transfer manager <b>113</b> described herein. In some embodiments, the data transfer manager <b>113</b> is implemented in an integrated circuit chip disposed in the memory sub-system <b>110</b>. In other embodiments, the data transfer manager <b>113</b> is part of an operating system of the host system <b>120</b>, a device driver, or an application.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The data transfer manager <b>113</b> can schedule the data transfer from the host system <b>120</b> to the memory sub-system <b>110</b> to reduce the amount and time of data buffering in the memory sub-system <b>110</b> before the data is committed, stored, written, or programmed into the media units/memory components <b>102</b> to <b>104</b>. For example, when a media unit (e.g., <b>102</b> or <b>104</b>) is determined to be available (e.g., not busy with other operations) for executing a write command, the data transfer manager <b>113</b> initiates the transfer, from the host system <b>120</b> to the memory sub-system <b>110</b>, of the data for the write command. When the media unit (e.g., <b>102</b> or <b>104</b>) is determined to be busy with operations for another command, the data transfer manager <b>113</b> postpones the transfer, from the host system <b>120</b> to the memory sub-system <b>110</b> for the media unit (e.g., <b>102</b> or <b>104</b>), of the data of queued write commands. In general, the data transfer manager <b>113</b> is configured to initiate the transfer of data from the host system <b>120</b> to the memory sub-system <b>110</b> for a subset of the media units <b>102</b> to <b>104</b> which subset is determined to be available for write operations and postpone the transfer of further data for the remaining subset of the media units <b>102</b> to <b>104</b> that is busy with other operations. Since the data of the write commands is fetched from the host system <b>120</b> just in time for the execution of the write commands, the data transfer manager <b>113</b> can reduce and/or minimize the amount and time of data that is being buffered in the memory sub-system <b>110</b>, in accordance with the bandwidth of the media units/memory components <b>102</b> to <b>104</b> to write, store, commit, or program data for storage.

The erase block set can be erased to remove the data of the stream without erasing the data of other streams.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, each of write streams is permitted to sequentially write at LBA addresses in a zone (e.g., <b>211</b>) in a namespace (e.g., <b>201</b>) allocated on a media <b>203</b> of the memory sub-system <b>110</b>, but prohibited from writing data out of sequence in the LBA address space.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">At block <b>403</b>, a data transfer manager <b>113</b> of the memory sub-system <b>110</b> identifies multiple media units (e.g., <b>109</b>A to <b>109</b>N) in the memory sub-system <b>110</b> that are available to write data concurrently.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">At block <b>405</b>, the data transfer manager <b>113</b> selects first commands from the multiple streams for concurrent execution in the multiple media units that are available to write data.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">At block <b>407</b>, the data transfer manager <b>113</b> initiates, in response to the first commands being selected for concurrent execution in the multiple media units, communication of first data of the first commands from the host system <b>120</b> to a local buffer memory <b>119</b> of the memory sub-system <b>110</b>. For example, the transferring of the first data is postponed until the multiple media units are available to perform write operations for storing the first data. The postponed transfer reduces the time of the first data being buffered. In response to the multiple media units being available to perform write operations, a buffer space in the local buffer memory <b>119</b> is allocated for the first data for the buffering of the first data communicated from the host system <b>120</b> to the memory sub-system <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">At block <b>409</b>, the memory sub-system <b>110</b> executes the first commands concurrently by storing data into the multiple memory units. For example, as soon as the first data has been transferred from the local buffer memory <b>119</b> to the multiple media units, the buffer space allocated for the first data can be released from buffering the first data. In some instances, the buffer space can be released before the multiple media units completes programming/writing the first data.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, at the time of scheduling the first commands for execution, execution second commands can be in progress in a subset of memory units of the media <b>203</b> of the memory sub-system <b>110</b>. Thus, the subset of memory units used for the execution of the second commands are not available for the first commands. After the first commands are scheduled for a subset of memory units of the media <b>203</b> of the memory sub-system <b>110</b>, the data transfer manager <b>113</b> initiates the transfer of the data to be written via the first commands from the host system <b>120</b> to the memory sub-system <b>110</b>. The just-in-time transfer of the data of the first commands reduces the amount and time of data being buffered in the local memory <b>119</b> of the memory sub-system <b>110</b> and thus reduces the capacity requirement of the local memory <b>119</b> and the capacity requirement of the power-fail hold-up circuit <b>141</b> configured for the local memory <b>119</b>. The first commands can be executed in the multiple media units concurrently and/or concurrently with the progress of the execution of the second commands in remaining media units of the memory sub-system <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, the memory sub-system <b>110</b> is configured to buffer, in the local buffer memory <b>119</b>, no more than a predetermined number of units of data. The predetermined number corresponds to the number of media units <b>109</b>A to <b>109</b>N in the memory sub-system <b>110</b> that are capable of operating independent from each other in writing data. Each unit of data is no more than a maximum amount of data to be written in a media unit (e.g., <b>109</b>A or <b>109</b>N) in response to a single write command. Thus, the buffer capacity of the local memory <b>119</b> does not limit the number of write streams the host system <b>120</b> can send to the memory sub-system <b>110</b>. The reduced amount and time of data being buffered in the local memory <b>133</b> can reduce the requirement for the corresponding power-fail hold-up circuit <b>141</b> of the memory sub-system <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The memory sub-system <b>110</b> can accept and queue write commands in one or more queues <b>143</b> in the local memory <b>119</b>. The number of queued write commands can be significantly more than the predetermined number of units of data that can be buffered in the local memory <b>119</b>. Since the performance of the memory sub-system <b>110</b> is limited by the bandwidth of the media units <b>109</b>A to <b>109</b>N to commit, write, store, or program data concurrently in execution of concurrent write commands, the limited buffer capacity of the local memory <b>119</b> for the data of write commands does not impact the performance of the memory sub-system <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">When more commands are queued than what can be executed concurrently, the memory sub-system <b>110</b> can selectively execution certain commands out of their order in arriving in the memory sub-system <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The reduced buffer memory requirement allows the local memory <b>119</b> to be configured as static random access memory (SRAM) of the controller <b>115</b> and thus eliminate the need for DRAM in buffering data to be written in the media <b>203</b> of the memory sub-system <b>110</b>. For example, a capacity of the static random access memory (SRAM) to buffer data of write commands can be less than the capacity required to buffer all of write commands queued in the memory sub-system.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Optionally, each respective media unit (e.g., <b>109</b>A or <b>109</b>N) has a command queue for write commands that are configured to write data into the respective media unit (e.g., <b>109</b>A or <b>109</b>N). The command queue can store multiple write commands; and the local memory <b>119</b> can be configured to limit its buffer memory for the data of the write commands. For example, the buffer memory can be limited to the capacity of a small portion of the commands in the queue. For example, the buffer memory can be limited to the size of the data that can be programmed/written/stored/committed into the respective media unit (e.g., <b>109</b>A or <b>109</b>N) in response to a single write command (or a predetermined number write commands that is smaller than a total number of write commands that can be queued for the respective media unit).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Optionally, the portion of the media layout <b>130</b> for the logical addresses used in the first commands is determined dynamically in response to the determination that the first commands can be executed concurrently in the available media units.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">For example, after the identification of the multiple memory units (e.g., integrated circuit dies) that are available for the execution of next commands, the data transfer manager <b>113</b> can identify, from the block set table <b>307</b>, the physical addresses that can be used to store data of the next commands. The physical addresses can be used to update the corresponding entries in the logical to physical block map <b>303</b> for the LBA addresses used in the next commands.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, when an integrated circuit die (e.g., <b>205</b>) is free to write data, the data transfer manager <b>113</b> can determine a command of a zone that can be written/programmed into the memory cells in the integrated circuit die (e.g., <b>205</b>). From the block set table <b>307</b>, the data transfer manager <b>113</b> and/or the dynamic data placer <b>153</b> can locate an entry for the zone (e.g., <b>205</b>), locate the block identifier <b>375</b> and the page map entry identifier <b>377</b> associated with the identifier <b>373</b> of the integrated circuit die (e.g., <b>205</b>), and use the die identifier <b>373</b>, the block identifier <b>375</b>, and the page map entry identifier <b>377</b> to update the corresponding fields of the entry in the logical to physical block map <b>303</b> for the LBA address <b>331</b> used in the command of the zone (e.g., <b>211</b>). Thus, the command of the zone (e.g., <b>211</b>) can be executed without media access collision for the LBA address <b>331</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some implementations, a communication channel between the processing device <b>118</b> and a memory sub-system <b>110</b> includes a computer network, such as a local area network, a wireless local area network, a wireless personal area network, a cellular communications network, a broadband high-speed always-connected wireless communication connection (e.g., a current or future generation of mobile network link); and the processing device <b>118</b> and the memory sub-system can be configured to communicate with each other using data storage management and usage commands similar to those in NVMe protocol.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">A memory sub-system <b>110</b> in general can have non-volatile storage media. Examples of non-volatile storage media include memory cells formed in an integrated circuit and magnetic material coated on rigid disks. Non-volatile storage media can maintain the data/information stored therein without consuming power. Memory cells can be implemented using various memory/storage technologies, such as NAND logic gate, NOR logic gate, phase-change memory (PCM), magnetic memory (MRAM), resistive random-access memory, cross point storage and memory devices (e.g., 3D XPoint memory). A cross point memory device uses transistor-less memory elements, each of which has a memory cell and a selector that are stacked together as a column. Memory element columns are connected via two perpendicular layers of wires, where one layer is above the memory element columns and the other layer below the memory element columns. Each memory element can be individually selected at a cross point of one wire on each of the two layers. Cross point memory devices are fast and non-volatile and can be used as a unified memory pool for processing and storage.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The controller (e.g., <b>115</b>) of a memory sub-system (e.g., <b>110</b>) can run firmware to perform operations responsive to the communications from the processing device <b>118</b>.
