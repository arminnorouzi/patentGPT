In particular the present invention relates to a mooring buoy for providing power to the vessel.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the maritime industry it is often required to moor vessels when they are not in operation. In some locations, quayside space is at a premium and there is not enough space for every vessel dock. Accordingly some vessels are moored offshore to a mooring buoy while the vessel waits to dock or before the vessel is deployed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In most circumstances, the vessel will consume energy even when moored. This is because a moored vessel may have a residual &#x201c;hotel load&#x201d; and the command bridge and the instruments on the command bridge. For example, the crew accommodation will require lighting and heating which consumes power. A moored vessel may also need to carry out some deck operations with equipment that will also require power. Accordingly, a moored vessel may operate a primary or an auxiliary genset to provide power for the hotel load.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This is undesirable because running the primary or auxiliary genset for only a hotel load will inefficiently consume fuel and emit exhaust emissions such as particulate pollution and CO2 emissions. This may be particularly an issue if the vessel is moored close to shore within a low emissions zone.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to reduce emissions of moored vessels, it is known to &#x201c;cold iron&#x201d; vessel by providing an external power supply to the moored vessel. This means that the primary or auxiliary genset of the vessel does not need to be operational when the vessel is moored or at berth in a port.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Once such known solution is shown in US2013/0266381 which discloses a transfer system for a subsea installation which is fixed to the seabed. The transfer system comprises a transfer element such as a cable for transferring an electric current to a floating arrangement such as a vessel. The transfer system comprises a subsea fender which holds the cable when not in use. A problem with this arrangement is that the electric able can be place under significant tension and damaged if the vessel moves or turns with respect to the transfer system due to wind shear or sea currents.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, the transfer system requires the vessel to be using a dynamic positioning system and vessel thrusters in order to keep the vessel in the same location of the transfer system whilst the fluid is transferred to the vessel. Maintaining a dynamic positioning system will use fuel operating the thrusters and emit exhaust emissions. This means that transfer system is not practical for mooring the vessel for more than a few hours particularly if the location is close to shore.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Examples of the present invention aim to address the aforementioned problems.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the present invention there is a mooring buoy for a vessel comprising: a floating body arranged to project out of the surface of the water; at least one buoy anchoring line connected between the floating body and the sea floor; at least one vessel mooring line connectable between the mooring buoy and the vessel; and at least one moveable electric cable connected to a power supply and the moveable electric cable has a free end connectable to a switchboard of the vessel when the vessel is tethered to the at least one vessel mooring line; wherein the free end of the at least one moveable electric cable is moveable between a retracted position and a connected position and the tension of the at least one vessel mooring line is greater than the tension in the at least one moveable electric cable when the free end of the at least one moveable electric cable is in the connected position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This means that when the vessel is moored to the mooring buoy, the consumption of marine diesel oil or marine gas oil for the vessels wait outside of the port is eliminated or greatly reduced. When the vessel is anchored and stationary, the energy requirements to power auxiliary applications (such as compressors and/or winches) can be met with the mooring buoy. This means that vessels moored to the mooring buoy can draw on electricity generated from wind farms or direct from shore power. Accordingly this reduces greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and particulates that can move towards the shore depending on location, wind, and weather conditions. By connecting a vessel directly to a mooring buoy with an electricity input, efficiency of the vessel marine engines is improved.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Optionally, the mooring buoy comprises a rotatable electrical connection coupled between the at least one moveable electric cable and an input subsea cable.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Optionally, the rotatable electrical connection is an electrical slip ring.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Optionally, the electrical slip ring is sealed in a canister configured to shield the marine environment from the electrical slip ring.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Optionally, the free end of the at least one moveable electric cable is adjacent to the floating body in the retracted position.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Optionally, the free end of the at least one moveable electric cable is arranged to retract towards the floating body when disconnected from the vessel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, the at least one moveable electric cable is arranged to retract due to the weight of the at least one moveable electric cable.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Optionally, the moveable electric cable comprises a clump weight mounted on a portion of the at least one moveable electric cable.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Optionally, the floating body comprises a curved surface for limiting the bend radius of the at least one moveable electric cable.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Optionally, the floating body comprises a chute for receiving the at least one moveable electric cable.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Optionally, the at least one vessel mooring line is retractable towards the floating body.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Optionally, the at least one vessel mooring line is one or more of a line, wire, and/or chain.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Optionally, the free end of the at least one moveable electric cable comprises a magnetic connector.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Optionally, the free end of the at least one moveable electric cable comprises an electrical plug and/or an induction loop.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Optionally, the at least one moveable electric cable is connected to a transformer arranged to vary the voltage of the power supply in dependence of a vessel parameter.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Optionally, a controller is configured to send a control signal to the transformer to vary the voltage of the at least one moveable electric cable in dependence of a vessel parameter.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Optionally, the transformer is configured to supply the voltage at 440 V or 690V.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Optionally, the at least one buoy anchoring line is three buoy anchoring lines.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Optionally, the at least one moveable cable and the at least one vessel mooring line are rotatable about a central axis of the floating body.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Optionally, the at least one moveable cable and the at least one vessel mooring line are rotatable 360 degrees about the central axis of the floating body.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to another aspect of the present invention there is a power system for an offshore vessel comprising: at least one mooring buoy according the previous aspect of the invention;

In this way, when the loading on the mooring buoy <b>100</b> is at a maximum, the mooring buoy anchoring lines <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> catenary will meet the sea floor <b>108</b> some way from the sinker <b>122</b>. By providing the buoy anchoring lines <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> with a chain on the sea floor <b>108</b>, this increases the security of the mooring or may be used to reduce the size of the sinker. The slack mooring also allows the mooring buoy <b>100</b> to move up and down due to the heave motion of the water.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The floating body <b>104</b> of the mooring buoy <b>100</b> comprises one or more floatation devices <b>124</b> for increasing the buoyancy of the floating body <b>104</b>. In some examples, the floatation devices <b>124</b> are surrounded with a curved surface <b>126</b>. The curved surface <b>126</b> is mounted to the floatation devices <b>124</b> with one or more struts <b>128</b>. In some examples, the curved surface <b>126</b> integral with the floatation devices <b>124</b> and no struts <b>128</b> are used.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The curved surface <b>126</b> is arranged to receive a portion of an electric cable <b>130</b>. The curved surface <b>126</b> is profiled to define a maximum bend radius of the electric cable <b>130</b>. In some examples, the curved surface <b>126</b> has a radius of between 1 m and 10 m. In some examples, the curved surface <b>126</b> has a radius of 5 m. In other examples, the curved surface <b>126</b> has a radius of 2 m, 3 m, 4 m, 6 m, 7 m, 8 m, 9 m, 15 m, or 20 m.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some examples, the floating body <b>104</b> comprises a chute <b>142</b> with a hole <b>132</b> for receiving the electric cable <b>130</b> therethrough. The chute <b>142</b> defines a narrowing funnel for receiving and retaining a free end <b>134</b> of the electric cable <b>130</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the hole <b>132</b> is in the centre of the floating body <b>104</b> and concentric with the central axis A-A (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). In some examples, the hole <b>132</b> is not concentric with the axis A-A and is instead located off-centre from the axis A-A. In other examples, the hole <b>132</b> is a cut-out (not shown) in the periphery of the floating body <b>104</b>. By locating the hole <b>132</b> in the centre of the mooring buoy <b>100</b>, the mooring buoy will be more stable when the electric cable <b>130</b> is resting on the curved surface <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Furthermore, the curved surface <b>126</b> of the chute <b>142</b> provides for a smoother recovery of the electric cable <b>130</b> when the electric cable <b>130</b> moves from the extended, connected position to the retracted position. The curved surface <b>126</b> of the chute <b>142</b> is smooth and prevents the electric cable <b>130</b> from snagging on the curved surface <b>126</b> when the electric cable <b>130</b> is being retracted.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The electric cable <b>130</b> is connected to one or more transformers <b>802</b>, <b>804</b> which are connected to a power supply <b>800</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). The power supply <b>800</b> in some examples is connected to a land-based electricity distribution network. In this way, the electric cable <b>130</b> connects the vessel <b>102</b> with shore power. Additionally or alternatively, the electric cable <b>130</b> can be connected to an offshore power supply, such as an offshore wind farm (not shown). In other examples, the electric cable <b>130</b> can be connected to an offshore installation comprising power generation or power storage.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the mooring buoy <b>100</b> will be discussed in further detail. The electrical cable <b>130</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is in a retracted position and the free end <b>134</b> of the electric cable <b>130</b> is moveable between the retracted position and an extended position. In the extended position, the electric cable <b>130</b> is connectable to the vessel <b>102</b>. In this way the extended position and the connected position of the electric cable <b>130</b> as shown in the Figures are the same position.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the extended position, the electric cable <b>130</b> can be connected to the vessel <b>102</b>.

In some examples, the free end <b>134</b> of the electric cable <b>130</b> comprises a plug or socket for connecting respectively with a socket or plug in the switchboard (not shown) of the vessel <b>102</b>. In some other examples, the free end <b>134</b> of the electrical cable <b>130</b> comprises an induction coil (not shown) for engagement with a reciprocal induction coil mounted on the vessel <b>102</b>. The induction coils use electromagnetic induction for transfer of electrical energy to the vessel <b>102</b>. In some examples, the free end <b>134</b> of the electric cable <b>130</b> comprises a magnetic connector for selectively engaging with the vessel <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some examples, the free end <b>134</b> of the electric cable <b>130</b> comprises a plug or socket for connecting respectively with a socket or plug in the deck <b>148</b> of the vessel <b>102</b> for example, at the bow of the vessel <b>102</b>. The socket or plug mounted in the deck of the vessel <b>102</b> is connected to the switchboard. In this way, when the free end <b>134</b> of the electric cable <b>130</b> is connected to the socket or plug in the deck <b>148</b> of the vessel <b>102</b>, the electric cable <b>130</b> is electrically connected to the switchboard of the vessel <b>102</b>. In some examples, the socket or plug in the deck <b>148</b> of the vessel <b>102</b> is retrofittable and a cable (not shown) extends from the bow, side or stern of the vessel <b>102</b> to the switchboard of the vessel <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As mentioned above, the connector <b>136</b> is coupled to the free end <b>134</b> of the electric cable <b>130</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In some examples, the connector <b>136</b> comprises an electric cable seating buoy <b>136</b> having a loop for pulling the electric cable <b>130</b> up to the vessel <b>102</b>. The electric cable seating buoy <b>136</b> sits within the hole <b>132</b> when the electric cable <b>130</b> is in the retracted position. This means that the electric cable <b>130</b> is always in the same position with respect to the mooring buoy <b>100</b> when a vessel <b>102</b> moors to the mooring buoy <b>100</b>. The electric cable seating buoy <b>136</b> has a diameter greater than the hole <b>132</b>. Accordingly, when the electric cable <b>130</b> moves back to the retracted position, the free end <b>134</b> of the electric cable <b>130</b> does not pass through the hole <b>132</b>. Furthermore, the electric cable seating buoy <b>136</b> being connected to the free end <b>134</b> of the electric cable <b>130</b> means that the electric cable <b>130</b> is not pulled up to the vessel <b>102</b> by the socket or plug connection. The electric cable seating buoy <b>136</b> may be removeable from the free end <b>134</b> of the electric cable <b>130</b> once the free end <b>134</b> of the electric cable <b>130</b> has been pull up to the deck <b>148</b> of the vessel <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some examples, the electric cable <b>130</b> is arranged to be urged towards the retracted position. In some examples, the electric cable <b>130</b> is weighted and retracts back to the retracted position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> due to the gravitational force on the electric cable <b>130</b>. Alternatively, the electrical cable <b>130</b> can be retracted back to the retracted position with a winding mechanism such as a winch (not shown). In some examples, the electric cable <b>130</b> comprises a clump weight <b>138</b> for increasing the weight of the electric cable <b>130</b> and urging the electric cable <b>130</b> back to the retracted position.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the clump weight <b>138</b> is positioned underneath the free end <b>134</b> and keeps the electric cable seating buoy <b>136</b> seated in the hole <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Optionally, the electric cable <b>130</b> comprises one or more buoyancy devices <b>140</b> mounted in the middle of the electric cable <b>130</b> to increase the buoyancy of a portion of the electric cable <b>130</b>. In this way, the shape of the electric cable <b>130</b> adopts a &#x201c;lazy wave&#x201d;, &#x201c;s-shape&#x201d; or &#x201c;j-shape&#x201d;. The lazy wave shape of the electric cable <b>130</b> means that the electric cable <b>130</b> improves the strength and fatigue response whilst permitting the electric cable <b>130</b> to move between the retracted and the extended positions.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The mooring buoy <b>100</b> comprises at least one vessel mooring line <b>144</b> connectable between the mooring buoy <b>100</b> and the vessel <b>102</b>. In some examples, the at least one vessel mooring line <b>144</b> are chains or alternatively mooring ropes or wires. In other examples, the one vessel mooring line <b>144</b> can be a combination of a chain, rope and/or wire. In some examples, the at least one vessel mooring line <b>144</b> comprises an UHMwPE (Ultra High Molecular weight Polyethylene) or HMPE (High Modulus Polyethylene) fibre such as &#x201c;DYNEEMA&#xae;&#x201d; (a trade mark of Royal DSM N.V.)</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is a single vessel mooring line <b>144</b> for mooring the vessel <b>102</b> to the mooring buoy <b>100</b>.

Optionally, the single vessel mooring line <b>144</b> is retractable into the floating body <b>104</b> of the mooring buoy <b>100</b>. In this way, the single vessel mooring line <b>144</b> is wound round the floating body <b>104</b>. In some examples, the mooring buoy <b>100</b> comprises a winding mechanism (not shown) such as a winch for retracting and extending the single vessel mooring line <b>144</b> with respect to the mooring buoy <b>100</b>.

In some examples, the vessel mooring line <b>144</b> is connected to a plurality of vessel mooring line location buoys <b>146</b> along its length. This means that the vessel mooring line <b>144</b> floats on the surface <b>106</b> of the water. Alternatively, the vessel mooring line <b>144</b> can be made from a material less dense than water such that it floats. For example, the vessel mooring line <b>144</b> comprise an UHMwPE (Ultra High Molecular weight Polyethylene) or HMPE (High Modulus Polyethylene) fibre with a density less than the density of fresh water or salt water.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this way, the vessel mooring line <b>144</b> either floats on the surface <b>106</b> of the water or vessel mooring line <b>144</b> is retracted into the mooring buoy <b>100</b> when the vessel <b>102</b> is not moored to the mooring buoy <b>100</b>.

A deckhand will secure and lift the vessel mooring line location buoys <b>146</b> on to the deck <b>148</b>. The deckhand may use lifting or winching equipment (not shown) for lifting the vessel mooring line location buoys <b>146</b>.

Accordingly, when the vessel mooring line <b>144</b> is moved away from the mooring buoy <b>100</b>, the electric cable <b>130</b> is also pull away from the mooring buoy <b>100</b>. The connecting line <b>200</b> means that capture of the electric cable <b>130</b> is easier because the deckhand can pull the connecting line <b>200</b> once the vessel mooring line <b>144</b> has been captured.

The plurality of mooring buoys <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c </i>are the same as the mooring buoy <b>100</b> discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The first mooring buoy <b>100</b><i>a </i>is connected to a first transformer <b>802</b> via a first electric cable <b>130</b><i>a</i>. The second and third mooring buoys <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c </i>are connected to a second transformer <b>804</b> via a second electric cable <b>130</b><i>b</i>. The first and second electric cables <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>are the same as the electric cable <b>130</b> as discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The first, second and third mooring buoys <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c </i>are respectively connected to a first, second and third vessel <b>806</b>, <b>808</b>, <b>810</b>. The first, second and third mooring buoys <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c </i>are arranged in a mooring pattern in the coastal water <b>826</b> near the shore <b>824</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The first and second transformers <b>802</b>, <b>804</b> are connected to the same electrical substation <b>812</b> which is connected to an electricity distribution network and/or a power supply <b>800</b>. The power supply can be a land-based power supply or an offshore based power supply. In some examples, the power supply is a renewable energy source such as wind turbine generator, solar cells, tidal or wave generators or any other suitable renewable energy source.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The first and second transformers <b>802</b>, <b>804</b> are configured to output electrical power at different voltages. In this way, different voltages can be supplied to different mooring buoys or different clusters of mooring buoys. This means that different vessels <b>806</b>, <b>808</b>, <b>810</b> can use the mooring buoys <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c </i>even though they may operate a vessel based electric distribution system at different voltages. In other examples, the first and second transformers <b>802</b>, <b>804</b> are configured to deliver electrical power at the same voltage. In some examples, the first transformer <b>802</b> outputs the voltage at 440V. In some examples, the second transformer <b>804</b> outputs the voltage at 690V. In other examples there can be any number of transformers outputting at any required voltages.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some examples, there is a controller <b>814</b> for controlling the first and second transformers <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>. The controller <b>814</b> sends a signal to control the output voltage of the first and/or second transformer <b>802</b>, <b>804</b> via control connections <b>820</b>, <b>822</b>. This means that the controller <b>814</b> can change the output voltage of the mooring buoys <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c </i>dynamically. For example the controller <b>814</b> can change the output voltage of the transformers in dependence of the different types of vessel <b>806</b>, <b>808</b>, <b>810</b> being moored at the mooring buoys <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some examples, the controller <b>814</b> receives parameter information for determining the output voltage of the first and second transformers <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>. The parameter information is a vessel parameter including the operating voltage of the vessel.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some examples, the controller <b>814</b> receives manual input for controlling output voltage of the transformers <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>. Alternatively, the controller <b>814</b> uses a mooring schedule for vessels <b>806</b>, <b>808</b>, <b>810</b> to determine the output voltage of the first and second transformers <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some examples, the electric cables <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>also comprise one or more data signals. Alternatively or additionally, the electric cables <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>also comprise a data cable <b>818</b>. The data signal comprises the vessel parameter information. In some examples the vessel parameter information is sent via the data cable <b>818</b> and/or the electric cable <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>from the vessel <b>806</b>. Alternatively, the vessel parameter information is optionally sent from a satellite controller <b>816</b> which is mounted on the mooring buoy <b>100</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The vessel parameter information is sent to the controller <b>814</b> before the electric cables <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>are energised. This means that the correct output voltage can be selected before the electric cables <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>are live.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In another example two or more examples are combined. Features of one example can be combined with features of other examples.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Examples of the present invention have been discussed with particular reference to the examples illustrated.
