num="0000">Preserving user privacy and preventing surveillance on behalf of users of a virtual reality world. One or more plans are available when a privacy or surveillance risk to a user is detected. In one plan, configurable scripts execute on behalf of the user to create a confusing array of clone avatars that obfuscate the real user avatar behavior. A malevolent avatar, attempting to surveil the user, may have difficulty distinguishing the clones from the user and may miss out on private insights he might otherwise have learned from the user's behavior. In another exemplary privacy plan, a copy of part of the virtual world is spawned, occupied exclusively by the user's avatar, and then merged into the main world. Privacy plans may be selected manually or automatically in response to perceived privacy threats to strike a balance between privacy and enjoyment within the virtual world.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="85.26mm" wi="156.97mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="169.76mm" wi="159.09mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="212.85mm" wi="166.62mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="233.85mm" wi="171.45mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="233.85mm" wi="91.52mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="233.85mm" wi="168.66mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="239.27mm" wi="168.06mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="233.60mm" wi="170.10mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="231.73mm" wi="156.29mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="228.60mm" wi="155.36mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="174.07mm" wi="132.16mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="174.07mm" wi="131.74mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="220.47mm" wi="138.01mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="94.06mm" wi="149.44mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="207.60mm" wi="106.43mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00015" num="00015"><img id="EMI-D00015" he="229.36mm" wi="86.28mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00015.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00016" num="00016"><img id="EMI-D00016" he="195.33mm" wi="152.74mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00016.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00017" num="00017"><img id="EMI-D00017" he="212.51mm" wi="166.54mm" file="US20230004676A1-20230105-D00017.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

VR is a computer technology that provides a simulation of an environment and of a user's presence and interactions within that environment. In a VR experience, a user may be represented by an avatar. An avatar is an active entity rendered within VR and helps provide the sensation of presence. In social VR, there is typically a 1-to-1 correspondence between human participants in the experience and avatars, although this is not necessary as avatars may be controlled by computer processes (in which case they are often referred to as &#x201c;bots&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many VR systems make use of either a computer monitor or a virtual reality headset (also called head-mounted display or HMD), and some such systems provide sound to the user through speakers or headphones. A VR experience can be realistic or can provide an experience that differs from reality. VR is a type of digital experience (DE) that is immersive, blocking-out perception of the real-world. A VR experience may take place in a virtual world (VW). A VW is a particularly designed VR experience. A common scenario is that at least one human-controlled avatar will experience the VW. In a social VW many human controlled avatars experience the VW simultaneously and communicate with one another.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several new products (with consumer price points that are comparable to those of personal computers or less) are now on the market. Additional controllers, to be worn and/or held by VR participants are also commercially and technically viable. Developers are using software development kits and a variety of authoring tools to create individual, collaborative, social, and competitive immersive experiences. Several VR app-stores exist from which customers can purchase and download VR experiences. Content providers such as movie studios are developing new forms of immersive storytelling using VR technology based on their significant digital assets (such as the Star Wars universe).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In parallel to these developments, many users and government policy-makers believe there exist valid concerns about both Internet and data privacy. More specifically, some experts believe that Web user tracking, cookies, big data, application analytics, device fingerprinting, and other fields pose serious threats to users' ability to remain anonymous while using digital services. When privacy is compromised users may be more vulnerable to tracking, targeted advertisements, profiling, and identity theft. To most users&#x2014;even the most tech-savvy&#x2014;attacks on privacy are subtle and some may be unnoticeable until severe damage occurs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Commercially available VR head-mounted displays (HMD) include: Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR. Google Cardboard is a budget HMD made mostly of cardboard, a chassis into which users can fit certain mobile phones. Controllers that are effective for VR uses include the Sony Move controller, the Vive controllers, and Leap Motion, among others.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As technology rapidly improves, the social VR genre will support vast spaces containing many avatars. Commercially available social VR experiences, in which groups of users meet virtually for the main purpose of communicating and interacting are available and include CONVRGE, AltSpaceVR, and vTime. Presently, less immersive 2D and 2.5D games such as The Sims and World of Warcraft allow thousands of players to interact in the same environment, simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above aspects and technology milestones relating to VR and the relatively rapid rate of hardware and software improvements means that it is likely that high fidelity VR experiences will be ubiquitous in the near future. It is also likely that human users will immerse themselves for longer and longer times in virtual worlds, confronted with vast numbers of other avatars, both human-controlled and bots.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Privacy in the physical world can be achieved by avoiding areas of mass surveillance such as public squares, grocery stores, and storefronts. Clothing and makeup can help people remain anonymous, as can masks&#x2014;although for security reasons, some public places and events prohibit masks from being worn.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some anonymity can be achieved while using mobile phones by using a pre-paid phone. A personal cellphone can be encrypted and locked with a passcode but call metadata is generally logged by the wireless carrier. Today's mobile apps are highly instrumented to send all sorts of data collected from the phone and the user-app interactions, including demographic data such as age, device type, etc. Users can evade this by avoiding apps that collect and convey analytic information, by using apps only in &#x201c;airplane mode&#x201d; (which may only be a temporary solution), by using throw-away user ID's and phones, and other tactics.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Anonymous web browsing can be achieved by anonymous no-logging virtual private network (VPN) services. It is debatable how effective these techniques are. Some websites honor Do-not-track flags that the user can enable on a web browser, thereby reducing the tracking that the site does. Web browsers can disable cookies altogether or use private browsing modes. Using encrypted connections for information sharing such Pretty Good Privacy or SSH tunneling can create a secure pipe between the web browser and the endpoint. Unfortunately, none of these techniques provides a guarantee of anonymity or privacy.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As a whole, there is a risk to user of being heavily surveilled and observed, even within virtual environments&#x2014;potentially more so than in the real world. Some significant fraction of virtual worlds are highly social, involve many players (human and machine alike) and many communications, and will be open to free-form inter-player interactions. In addition to good behavior, there is also a risk of toxic, deceptive, and anti-social behaviors. Within VR worlds avatar behaviors might be annoying, threatening, or worse. Social media and video games have been used as means for stalking and bullying. Avatars may&#x2014;in principle&#x2014;be able to watch and surveil other avatars, gather information, and perform analytics on the surveillance data. The possibility and efficacy of such surveillance will be limited by the rules and capabilities of the particular VR platform/engine, API's, the sophistication of the logic controlling the avatar, and more.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the real world, someone who secretly follows and watches a target stands to learn quite a bit about the target's day to day patterns, where he works and lives, where he shops, who he talks to, the gas and coffee he prefers, etc. Similarly, an avatar's behaviors within virtual reality could become liabilities when tracked. Behavior models and profiles created to describe a given avatar might not only be used for good but might be exploited by nefarious agents, for advertising, etc. For example, repetitive behaviors within virtual reality will be understood to be a normal routine, and can thus be exploited. Also, spatial-physical interaction behaviors within VR (anything from inquisitively looking around to certain gestures made while interacting) could, in principle, be aggregated into a model that reflects the mental state of the person controlling the avatar. For example, a mental state of agitation could be detected by observing multiple small, but irregular, movements or gestures, while shame might be detected by lack of interactions with the digital world.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In social VR, a world may be shared by tens, hundreds or maybe thousands of avatars (both human-controlled and bots). In these scenarios, users may be observed and surveilled by these avatars. In such scenarios, it can be difficult to determine whether an encountered avatar is a bot. For example, an advanced bot may be able to pass a simple version of a Turing test, but otherwise may appear to be human-controlled to a casual observer. A bot&#x2014;not limited by the inbound bandwidth of the human perception system&#x2014;is likely to be able to observe and surveil others systematically and efficiently. Even where it is possible to determine whether an avatar is human-controlled, it can be difficult to determine underlying motivations.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is presently difficult to obtain sufficient privacy within a virtual reality experience (e.g. a Social VR experience), due to the possibility of observation or surveillance by human-controlled avatars and/or bots. The problem is likely to increase in severity as virtual worlds become larger, more pervasive, and more realistic. Current capabilities such as invisibility or teleportation do not properly satisfy these needs. There is a need for more advanced techniques and tools in order to preserve a user's privacy in a social VR experience.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure describes systems and methods to achieve increased privacy using a framework for privacy tools suitable for use in a virtual world (VW) in which many avatars may be observing the user at any time, such as social virtual reality. Multiple privacy plans are made available to the user, and such tools may be used singly or in useful combinations in order to increase the user's privacy. Embodiments described herein maintain a sufficient level of usability, for both the user creating the privacy, and other friendly users presently within the VW.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Disclosed embodiments may be particularly useful with a) large numbers of avatars, b) capabilities for moving, acting, and interacting very freely within the environment, and c) a wide user base drawn from beyond a single realm of one user's close social connections. In some embodiments, the system may provide a privacy plan as a means for a user within a VR to confuse observers with noise and deceptive data. In other embodiments, the system may enable the user to become invisible to other users for some period of time. In yet other embodiments, the system may allow a user to inhabit a private copy of at least a portion of the VW, so that the user may interact with the private copy unseen by others. In some embodiments, the system may provide a private or semi-private area of the VW which some or all other users are unable to enter and/or unable to observe. In some embodiments, the system may provide a user interface in which a privacy tool may be selected and configured for use, or in which multiple privacy tools may be selected for use in combination.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the system provides a set of steps that incorporate graphical user interfaces (GUI's); these steps can be initiated by the user or by the system and result in the injection of extraneous and/or distracting information, the intent of which is to confuse other avatars (i.e., other users). In one embodiment, a user's avatar splits into multiple identical clones, each of which has a scripted behavior designed to confuse observers. Under the cover of this replication the user's actual avatar can either slip out of visual range of observers, or may perform more private/sensitive actions knowing that, even if an observer averages out the data-points of the user and clones, little of interest will be revealed. This, in turn, provides the user with at least a temporary period of increased privacy. Such means may be utilized from time to time, not necessarily on a continuous basis.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Exemplary embodiments may be used to offer a supplemental set of capabilities within VR so as to provide tools to prevent surveillance by other users, avatars and/or bots, and to preserve privacy of a VR user within immersive virtual worlds, such as social worlds, in which participants co-interact in high-fidelity and where users and bots can capture and observe activities within the VR in high-fidelity.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further exemplary embodiments may provide e-commerce anonymization within VR, helping users increase anonymity of actions while shopping in immersive VR stores or malls.

Unfortunately, highly open and free virtual worlds can also enable nefarious usage such as tracking, surveillance and harassment, whose effects may range from annoying to dangerous. The present disclosure provides various tools by which a VR user may preserve privacy and prevent such surveillance by others. In VR worlds, there is a risk of surveillance principally from two main types of entities. First is the fabric of the VR itself. The VR fabric or framework is the computing platform on which the VR runs. It is typically responsible for maintaining world state (e.g., positions of avatars) as well as rendering scenes on a screen buffer (or sending scenes towards a rendering pipeline). The fabric is essentially omniscient. It is not straightforward to evade surveillance by the fabric itself because the virtual existence depends on the logic and rendering engine of the fabric. Second are other avatars, such as avatars <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>d</i>, both human-controlled avatars and software-controlled avatars known as bots. Human-controlled avatars, can generally know only what they perceive through their avatar (or what the fabric allows them to see through other means such as tools like maps, data, etc.). The current disclosure focuses primarily on techniques for avoiding and reducing surveillance by human- and software-controlled avatars.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Exemplary embodiments make use of privacy plans to increase the privacy of users. A privacy plan (which may be referred to hereinafter as a &#x201c;Plan&#x201d;) may include one or more behavior modules (B<b>1</b>, . . . Bn) for concealing activities of the user, by concealing or confusing activities of an avatar of the user from other avatars. Each behavior module B has a role relative to the start of the Plan and to other behaviors (e.g., a sequence). Each module B has at least some action that is executed (e.g., a script in Unity or another programming language) to effect a change in the VR world (e.g., through an API). Each module B may also reference one or more VR entities or may instantiate new VR entities. In some embodiments, behaviors are modularized so that they are stand-alone components and can be linked together. A behavior has an implementation in a syntax that ultimately allows its execution in a manner compatible with the VW's fabric (e.g., as a Unity script, C # code, etc.). Where the implementation of a behavior uses coding logic, the behavior can check for conditions in the state of the world and, based on such conditions, it may terminate the Plan, extend the Plan, or do other things enabled by the syntax of the implementation. Behaviors and Plans may have metadata such as their name, category, ID, priority, sequence number, time deadlines, and other relevant information. Behaviors may have notions of time and place such as start times, end times (relative and absolute) and named places (if available within the VR world). Users may choose Plans by name, type or other category and Plans may be chosen, assembled, or edited via a user interface.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary logical structure <b>200</b> of a Plan <b>201</b>. Metadata <b>202</b> may contain data such as the Plan's name, category, ID, priority, sequence number, time deadlines, and other relevant information. Behavior modules (the machine readable aspects) may be stored in a searchable catalog or database <b>203</b>. Certain behavior modules will have implementations using coding logic, stored in a catalog or database <b>204</b> and described by metadata <b>202</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a Plan is composed of 1 or more Behaviors <b>203</b>. Each Behavior is described by metadata <b>202</b> and has an executable implementation component <b>204</b>. The Behavior comprises arbitrary logic compatible with the VW API's that affects the virtual world. The Behavior may make reference to particular Avatar objects <b>2016</b> or other Objects <b>207</b> in the scene, the scene Camera <b>208</b>, or anything else accessibly via API's. As an example, the effect of instantiating a given Behavior B might be the creation of a new Avatar object, of a new Chair object, and behavior logic that effectively makes the Avatar circle the chair 2 times and then have a seat in it. An entity has multiple options for manifestation, including an avatar <b>206</b>, a generic object <b>207</b>, a virtual camera <b>208</b> or camera view, and other possibilities in catalog <b>209</b>.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Exemplary System Architecture.</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of the architecture of an exemplary embodiment of a system architecture for a VR system <b>300</b> that operates to prevent surveillance and preserve privacy. VR system <b>300</b> includes a VR server <b>301</b> that runs two metaverse instances <b>302</b><i>a </i>(M<b>1</b>) and <b>302</b><i>b </i>(M<b>2</b>). As illustrated, each of the metaverse instances <b>302</b><i>a </i>(M<b>1</b>) and <b>302</b><i>b </i>(M<b>2</b>) has a privacy system. Assigned to each metaverse instance is a privacy manager, <b>303</b><i>a </i>and <b>303</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Exemplary privacy manager can be implemented as software, a method executed on a processor and stored in computer memory, which is a non-transitory computer-readable medium. In the case where VR server <b>301</b> is providing the fabric for VR across connected network <b>304</b>, possibly the internet or a private intranet, it is possible that server <b>301</b> could host multiple virtual realities for user equipment <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<b>305</b><i>c</i>.

Any of M<b>3</b>-M<b>5</b> may be a common metaverse instance, for example, M<b>4</b> and M<b>5</b> (metaverse instances <b>307</b><i>b </i>and <b>307</b><i>c</i>) may share a common metaverse M<b>2</b> (metaverse instance <b>302</b><i>b</i>), either fully or partially. That is, M<b>4</b> may be a partial copy of M<b>2</b>, whereas M<b>5</b> is a full copy of M<b>2</b>. Alternatively, a metaverse instance, for example M<b>3</b> (metaverse instance <b>305</b><i>a</i>) may be a stand-alone instance, independent of any metaverse on server <b>301</b>. As illustrated, each of metaverse instances <b>307</b><i>a</i>-<b>307</b><i>c </i>(M<b>3</b>-M<b>5</b>) has its own privacy manager <b>308</b><i>a</i>-<b>308</b><i>c </i>respectively. In some embodiments, privacy system components may operate together with the fabric computing engine of the virtual reality through an application program interface (API).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In alternative embodiments, a privacy system may be deployed on a third-party server (TPC) and offered as a service over the top of the VR world. In such embodiments, the TPC system may monitor and trigger privacy modes from its remote location to the VR world servers. The TPC may store privacy related preferences and may effectuate heuristics indicating how and when to trigger privacy. The TPC may interworks with the VR Server via network APIs. The user may be provided with the ability to connect directly to the TPC via the web to change preferences. In the case that clones are created to increase the user's privacy on the VR Server, in some embodiments, these clones may run on the TPC in a VR server spawned for just such an occasion.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Baseline Privacy Plans.</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, a set of one or more baseline privacy plans is provided, with each privacy plan including one or more behaviors that conceal activities of the user.

As noted above, in response to engagement of an eccentric clone baseline plan, the fabric may create one or multiple avatars, which have the same or similar appearance to that of the user's avatar. The clones may move about autonomously, so that observers (e.g. other avatars and/or bots) may become confused and may not be able to tell which avatar is under the control of the actual human user.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">In some embodiments, the clones created by the fabric may be a form of a software agent. That is, to observers, these clones may exhibit a degree of some or all of: autonomy, persistence, social ability, and reactivity. In some embodiments, a behavior is tagged with a human-readable name corresponding to its intent. A clone assigned this behavior may also be referred to by this tag. For example, a clone may be referred to as a &#x201c;window-shopper&#x201d; if its behavior module compels it to tend to walk to the nearest store and look at products before leaving and returning home. The underlying nature of behaviors may be declarative (goal-based) or reactive. An agent may use back-chaining to compute the actions it should take in order to achieve the provided goal state of the behavior. There may also be a random element to clone behavior. In some embodiments, default randomized behavior may be assigned to any clone not otherwise receiving a specific assignment. In various embodiments, assigning a behavior to a newly-created clone may be approached by one or more of the following methods:</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">In one method, a series of declarative and adaptive behaviors are added to a database and indexed in such a way as to be searchable by one or more of: name, level of randomness, degree to which there is physical motion in the behavior, degree of interaction in the behavior, etc.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">In another method, when clones are initiated (or perhaps in some advance configuration step which takes place before the clones are initiated) the user may specify which behaviors are preferred for which subset in statements such as: a) &#x201c;assign all clones a behavior that has high randomness and high interaction levels&#x201d;, b) &#x201c;assign half of the clones the behavior named &#x2018;walk around a house&#x2019; and the other half of the clones the behavior named &#x2018;walk in circles&#x201d;. Named behaviors may have additional characteristics not drawn out in the name (e.g., the circles to be traced out might be 10 meters in diameter and/or might have a specific object like a house at its center). Various clone behaviors may be selected from a list of available behaviors, and some clone behaviors may be tuned using parameters (e.g. &#x2018;clone motion&#x2019; or &#x2018;clone-object interaction level&#x2019;, which may be set on a numerical scale such as 1 to 100 with higher numbers expressing a higher propensity of the clone to move about in the world, or a higher propensity for the clone to interact with objects in the world, etc.)</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">Clones may be assigned one or more behaviors that match the intent of the assignor. To this end, tuning parameters such as the ones above may be provided such that the parameters are set relative to the comparable parameter of the actual human user as observed or as historically recorded by the system. For example, a parameter such as &#x2018;clone motion&#x2019; may be set on a scale of negative ten to positive ten, where negative values represent less propensity to move than the actual user of which the clone is a copy, zero represents the same propensity to move as the actual user, and positive values represent a higher propensity to move relative to the actual user. A similar relative scale may be provided for other parameters which may be used to tune the behavior of the clones or a subset of the clones.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">While the clones are operating, the user can elude observation by blending into the crowd of clones, acting in a way indistinguishable to the clones, etc. During this time, the user can also perform actions that will be harder to observe by VR observers. Furthermore, if there are observers surveilling the user then they are likely to have to assume that any of the clones could be the real user. Attempts at observing and surveillance of these avatars by collecting data events will be less effective than before the appearance of the clones since the observer would be deluged with unimportant, evasive data-points that, when averaged, do not reveal interesting information about the user.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">The clone scenario may conclude in response to the last clone finishing its task, in response to a predetermined time period (e.g. a time period set by the user at a clone configuration stage), or in response to the user choosing an option to terminate the EC mode on a user interface. After the conclusion of the clone scenario, no clones are rendered in the DE, only the user's avatar.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref> illustrate an eccentric clone method performed in some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows a VW view <b>400</b> containing a human-controlled avatar <b>401</b> and other avatars <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b</i>.

Avatars <b>401</b>, <b>402</b><i>a</i>, and <b>402</b><i>b </i>may move around within the VW, including visiting house <b>403</b> and pond <b>404</b>. In the scenario depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>, the human user of avatar <b>401</b> wishes to have more privacy by limiting or preventing observation and possible analytics from agents controlling nearby avatars <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b</i>. Knowing (or fearful) that her avatar <b>4014</b> may be under observation, the user triggers an eccentric clone method. The user may set parameters for the eccentric clone method at this time, or such parameters may have been set in advance. The parameters may indicate, for example, that five clones are to be generated. The parameters may also identify behaviors (or corresponding scripts) to be performed by those clones.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, five clones of avatar <b>401</b> (identified as clone avatars <b>405</b><i>a</i>-<b>405</b><i>e</i>) are spawned at substantially the same location as avatar <b>401</b> itself. The clones may be spawned by the fabric, according to UI selections and/or clone configuration settings provided by the user. The clones <b>405</b><i>a</i>-<b>405</b><i>e </i>obfuscate the location of the human-controlled avatar <b>401</b> in the VW. Avatar <b>401</b> and clones <b>405</b><i>a</i>-<b>405</b><i>e </i>may begin to carry out behaviors, with avatar <b>401</b> being controlled by the user and clones <b>405</b><i>a</i>-<b>405</b><i>e </i>being controlled by one or more scripts. As an example, B and B<b>2</b> may head towards the lake L, while the remaining clones may move toward the house H and slowly circle it.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, avatar <b>401</b> and clones <b>405</b><i>a</i>-<b>405</b><i>e </i>begin to separate.

Method <b>500</b> for eccentric clone execution and termination may be performed as follows, starting in box <b>501</b>. A user is presented an option to choose a privacy mode, possibly through a GUI, in box <b>502</b>, and the user's choice is ascertained in box <b>503</b>. If the choice is not &#x201c;EccentricClone&#x201d; then this method terminates in box <b>504</b>, and another privacy option method is employed. If an eccentric clone is indicated, then clone parameters are set in box <b>505</b>. These may include behavior section (via a GUI), in box <b>506</b>, and customization, in box <b>507</b>. Customizations may be handled through a GUI, and may draw option information by accessing a data store <b>508</b>. After parameters are set, the clone may be activated in box <b>509</b>, to carry out the prescribed behaviors. This portion of method <b>500</b> may be implemented for each of a set of multiple clones.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">Options associated with box <b>509</b> include embodying and activating all clones, as shown in box <b>510</b>, and displaying the now-possible option for a user to swap from a primary avatar to one of the clones, in box <b>511</b>. Thus, at some time while a clone is active, the user may choose to embody one of the clones, as described above for the scenario of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b></figref><i>c</i>. A GUI enables the user to select a specific clone from among the various available clones. For example, the GUI may provide a digested list of available clones, or the user may be able to select the clone's avatar directly in the VW. The GUI may provide a display of the clone's metadata such as (but not limited to) the clone's task, location, time period etc. The user chooses a particular clone C, as noted in box <b>512</b>, and a confirmation button may appear allowing this clone to be chosen. If confirmed by the user, control is switched so that the user embodies the chosen clone (Clone C) in box <b>513</b>. As a result, the user perceives the VR through the body of the clone C, as well as having control of the avatar of clone C. Optionally the avatar that the user previously controlled (e.g. the user's original avatar, or a different clone the user previously selected to embody) may be deleted, may be made invisible, or may revert to an autonomous clone form. In the latter case, the avatar may be tasked with the (e.g. previous) task of Clone C. The latter variation comprises a teleportation, or avatar swap.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0064">If the user does not timely confirm the choice, the swap option is terminated, and eventually the clones expire in box <b>514</b>. This can occur because of affirmative deletion, either a subset or all clones, or the expiry of a timer. Clones are then destroyed in box <b>515</b>, ending method <b>500</b> in box <b>504</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0065">In some exemplary embodiments, clones are used that resemble the user's avatar. This may be used as the default approach. Some VR systems allow users to customize their avatars. This means that what is referred to as the &#x201c;user's avatar&#x201d; may be a rendition that may change over time in both appearance and capability, depending on the particular VR system implementation. Furthermore, the rendition of clones need not necessarily resemble exactly the user's avatar, though it is likely that by closely resembling the user's avatar that a maximum amount of confusion will be created in some situations.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0066">In alternative embodiments, Clones may visually vary randomly from each other (e.g., all wearing different colored virtual shirts). Clones may alternatively appear as environmental elements (e.g., not human forms) that obscure the user, such as in human-sized clouds through which very little could be observed.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0067">Exemplary steps for initiation of a clone-based privacy mode or tool may be tailored from method <b>500</b> and proceed as follows.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0000">1. The user makes a determination to improve privacy via a confusion option.<br/>2. A graphical user interface (GUI) is provided to the user, from which the privacy method is chosen and optionally a degree of privacy (e.g., low, medium, high) may be chosen. Optionally the user may be shown the computational impact (e.g., cost) of each method or configuration option. The user chooses parameters of the method from the GUI including one or more of the following:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0068">a. The number N of clones to spawn. In some embodiments, the user may also select the clones' physical arrangement in the VW. As an example, N clones might appear in a random crowd centered around the user's avatar up to a distance (e.g. 5 meters) from the user's avatar.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0069">b. Optionally the appearance of the clones (how other in-game avatars perceive the clone) may be configured. A default selection may be that each clone would appear substantially the same as the user's avatar.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0070">c. Optionally the degree of eccentricity of each clone, e.g. how much the clone differs in a given aspect from the observed user behavior with regards to that aspect, may be set.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0071">d. Optionally a behavior may be set to use for some or all of the clones (e.g. from a library of tasks or behaviors) For example, &#x201c;walk in slow circles around the house&#x201d; or &#x201c;show an interest in trees and butterflies&#x201d; may be chosen from a list of available clone tasks/behaviors.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0072">e. Optionally a time frame may be set after which the EC method will terminate.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0073">f. Optionally the user may choose an option to immediately embody one of the new clones or to remain in her current avatar. In the former case the user's perspective on the VR would immediately shift to reflect embodiment of the chosen clone.<br/>3. The user chooses the method and related settings/configuration as described above, and selects an option to enact it.<br/>4. The system checks if the VR framework is prepared to accept the EC privacy method as configured by the user, and if so it initiates the EC method. If not, it resets or fails with a message to the user.<br/>5. The set of N clones is created and each begins to execute its prescribed behavior.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Instant Mannequin Plan (IM).</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0074">Exemplary embodiments include a method for implementing a mannequin-based privacy option. When mannequin mode is used, the user may temporarily relinquish control of the user's avatar, which may then be automatically controlled by the system in a way that casual observers (e.g. other users or bots) may not realize that the mannequin avatar is no longer controlled by the user. For example, the system may show the user's avatar resting, or sleeping, or performing simple interactions with the VW (e.g. walking, smelling virtual flowers, taking virtual pictures with a virtual camera, waving to other avatars, etc.). The system may record historical observations and/or properties of the user's behavior when the user is controlling the avatar, and may then use these observations and/or properties to drive the control of the mannequin avatar. For example, the system may collect statistics on how the user moves the avatar, how often the user performs certain actions or interactions, what objects the user tends to hold or use, what locations the user tends to visit, etc., and then the system may control the mannequin avatar in a way which produces similar statistics and/or similar actions. In this way, the mannequin avatar may be made to behave more like the human user, and other users or bots may therefore not notice that the avatar is being controlled by the system in mannequin mode.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0075">The user may invoke mannequin mode from a user interface element (e.g. user may select this mode from among multiple privacy options/tools presented in a UI menu or list). In response to invocation of mannequin mode, the user may take on an alternate form so that the user may continue to explore or interact with the VW, perhaps unnoticed by other users or bots, which will be left to observe the user's original avatar which is then in mannequin form. The alternate form may utilize one or more of the other privacy modes described herein. For example, mannequin mode may be initiated, the system may assume control of the user's original avatar, and the user may be put into an alternate invisible form so that the user may continue to explore and/or interact with the VW (invisibly) while other users and bots are left to observe the system-controlled mannequin avatar. As another example, mannequin mode may be initiated, the VR system server may assume automated control of the user's original avatar, and the user may be put into an alternate disguised form which other users and bots may not recognize. Thus the user may temporarily relinquish control of the avatar to automated control, to interact with the VW in the alternate disguised form, while other users and bots are left to observe the system-controlled mannequin avatar. As yet another example, mannequin mode may be initiated, the system may assume control of the user's original avatar, and the user may take on an alternate form which is teleported to a new location (e.g. a location specified by the user). The alternate form may utilize another privacy mode (e.g. it may be invisible or disguised) so that the alternate form which appears in the new location may not be identifiable as the user. In this way, mannequin mode may be used together with one or multiple of the other privacy options/tools in order to preserve the user's privacy.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0076">The user may invoke mannequin mode from a user interface (e.g. a menu or list of privacy options/tools). The user may select additional tools to be used together with mannequin mode, as described above. In some embodiments, the system may detect a location, a historical scenario, or a situation which may require privacy, and in this case the system may in response present a user interface which offers or prompts the user to enter the mannequin mode. In other embodiments, the system may detect a location, a historical scenario, or a situation which may require privacy, and in response the system may automatically invoke mannequin mode and/or another privacy mode in order to preserve the user's privacy. Mannequin mode may be invoked for a set time period (e.g. a time period set by the user), may be invoked until one or more criteria are satisfied, or may be invoked until the user turns off the mannequin mode (e.g. via a UI element). Upon exiting mannequin mode, control of the user's original avatar may be restored to the user, and the alternate avatar form may be discontinued.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Selective Disguise Plan (SD).</heading><p id="p-0071" num="0077">In an exemplary embodiment, the system may provide a disguise privacy option tool. Disguise may cause the user's avatar to appear in a different form than the user's original avatar. Various characteristics of the avatar may be altered to form the disguise. For example, hair length, hair style, hair color, facial hair, height, weight, gender, and clothing may be altered. A user whose original avatar takes the form of a short woman with dark hair may invoke the disguise mode in order to take on the form of an avatar which appears as a tall man with gray hair. Users and bots familiar with the appearance of the user's original (or typical) avatar may not be able to identify the user from the disguised avatar form. Disguise mode may be used in combination with other privacy options/tools (e.g. Teleport) so that users or bots may not directly observe the transformation from original avatar form to the disguised form. Uses of multiple privacy plans in combination may provide synergistic effects to improve privacy together better than the sum of the individual plans. For example, teleporting into a disguised avatar or teleporting into an invisible one may have a synergistic effect, and so may often be used together. Disguising an invisible avatar, however, may not always offer significant advantages over invisibility alone.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0078">Disguise transformations are preferably not observable to other avatars or observers. Otherwise those transformations may not provide the desired level of privacy from an observer who is targeting the avatar and who has the user's avatar in continuous view. Thus, one embodiment of a Selective Disguise plan may transition to the disguised form using the following steps:</p><p id="p-0073" num="0000">1. The system checks whether the surroundings support the ability to blend in nearby, such as the nearby presence of a crowd of avatars or other shelter such as tall grass. If no such cover exists, the system may not continue with the transformation plan.<br/>2. The avatar disappears momentarily from the view of the observers and one or more calls to a private mesh/transform may be made so as to disguise the avatar.<br/>3. The avatar reappears nearby amidst the cover in such a way as observers are unlikely to see the avatar reappear. For example, the fabric may place the user's newly disguised avatar in the center of a crowd, or in a location shielded from view (e.g. by the tall grass or other cover) and which is not currently visible from the vantage point of any other avatars or bots.<br/>4. The user may continue to do what the user was doing in the local area, with little or no interruption. Any observers are likely confused.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0079">The appearance of the disguised form may be configured in various ways depending on the embodiment. In some embodiments, the user may invoke disguised form and in response the system may randomly generate the various appearance characteristics for the disguised avatar. In this case, the disguised avatar may take on a different random appearance each time the disguised form is used. In another embodiment, the user may configure the disguised form in advance using an avatar editing user interface. The avatar editing user interface may allow the user to select various physical characteristics (height, weight, gender, hair, clothing, ethnicity, etc.) in order to design the appearance of the disguised avatar. The editing user interface may, for example, be the same user interface which is used to design original avatars for users. Once a user designs the disguised form of the avatar, the characteristics may be saved to a profile so the same disguised appearance may be used when the user invokes the disguise privacy option tool. A user may create and save multiple disguised avatar forms, in which case the user may select from among these at the time that the disguise privacy option is invoked.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0080">As one example, the system may display a list of privacy options, and the user may select both &#x2018;Teleport&#x2019; and &#x2018;Disguise&#x2019; from the list. The system may display a map of the VW and allow the user to select a destination for the teleport. The system may then display a list of disguise avatar forms previously created/saved by the user, along with an additional &#x2018;random appearance&#x2019; option. The user may select either a previously created disguise, or may select to take on a randomized appearance. When selections are finalized, the system may teleport the user to the new location, where the user's avatar will appear in the selected disguised form.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0081">When in disguised form, the system may display metadata (e.g. user name, user characteristics) intentionally altered to preserve the disguise. For example, a user whose name is Alice may be identified for other users as Alice when using her original avatar form, but the displayed name may be changed to a different name (e.g. <i>Bella</i>) when disguised mode is engaged. A disguised name may be generated randomly, or it may be chosen by the user (e.g. a name for a disguised avatar may be entered by the user when the user edits and saves disguised avatar form for later use).</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Privacy Lockout Plan (PL).</heading><p id="p-0077" num="0082">In a further exemplary embodiment, the system may provide a Lockout privacy tool option. A Privacy Lockout Plan may allow the user to select or define a location or area of the VW in which the user has exclusive access for a period of time. Other users or bots may not be able to enter the locked out location or area in order to observe the user. In some embodiments, other users or bots may not be able to see into the locked out location or area from the outside. For example, a virtual privacy fence may appear around the boundary of the locked out area, and this fence may prevent entry and/or viewing of the area by other users or bots. As another example, a virtual building selected as the lockout area may have locked doors and opaque windows during the lockout period, so that outside users and bots may not enter the virtual building and may not observe its occupants from the outside.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0083">Selection of the area for lockout may be done via a user interface element. In a first embodiment, the system may present a lockout plan (e.g. in a list or menu of privacy options/tools) and upon selection of the lockout plan a circular area surrounding the user at a given distance may be selected automatically as the lockout area. The distance may be selected by the system so that it is large enough to provide space for interaction of the user, yet small enough so that the lockout area does not include the current location of any other users or bots. In a second embodiment, the user may select the lockout Plan (e.g. from a menu or list) and in response the system may present a map of the VR world (or a local subset of the VR world). The user may then select or indicate the area for lockout on the map. The system may restrict the selection of the location to prevent the user from defining a lockout area that would include other users or bots. In a third embodiment, the user may select the lockout plan (e.g. from a menu or list) and in response the system may present a list of places in the VW which are currently available for lockout privacy. For example, the system may determine rooms, stores, buildings, or other areas where no other users or bots currently reside, and may compile a list of such locations. The user may select a location, and may then be teleported there such that the lockout option is applied to the location upon the user's arrival.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0084">The lockout plan may in some cases be invoked for a group of users. The group may be selected by a current user (e.g. selected from that user's &#x2018;friends list&#x2019;), or the group may be multiple users who are currently sharing a session or a VR experience. A user may select a group lockout plan and may, if necessary, specify the other users to include in the group lockout. The lockout area may be then formed so that the users in the group have access to the area and can see and interact with the other group members within the lockout area, but where other users and bots which are not part of the group cannot enter and/or cannot see into the lockout area. In this way, the lockout plan may be used to provide privacy for a group of users.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0085">A group lockout may be combined with the teleport option such that all group members may be teleported to the lockout area at the time the lockout option is invoked. For example, a user may select both Teleport and Group Lockout behaviors from a menu or list of privacy options/tools, may select the group users (if a group has not been defined previously, e.g. for a shared VR session), and may select the area or location for the group lockout. When all parameters are entered, the system may teleport the various group users to the group lockout location and may initiate the lockout so that the group users may interact with each other and with the lockout area unobserved by other users or bots.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0086">The lockout may be terminated at the end of a selected period of time, upon satisfaction of a defined termination criterion, or upon the user turning off the lockout mode (e.g. via a user interface element). After the lockout is terminated, other users and/or bots may again be able to enter the previously locked out location, and may additionally regain the opportunity to observe the locked out location.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Private Copy Plan (PC).</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0087">In a further embodiment, the system may provide a Private Copy privacy tool option. A Private Copy Plan may allow the user to spawn a private copy of at least a portion of the VW, which may then be used privately for a time period. For example, the user may select Private Copy from a menu or list of available privacy options/tools. The system may allow the user to select the location and/or extent of the private copy (e.g. by specifying a location such as a building or store from a list of available locations, or by drawing a bounding box on a map which depicts the nearby area of the VR world). In response to the location for the private copy being specified, the system may create a private copy of the area and may allow the user to explore and interact with the private copy of the area. The private copy may be implemented in a server which presents the VR world to various user clients, or it may be implemented in the client device of the user which requested the private copy. While the private copy is in use, the original VW (including the same VW location or area on which the private copy is based) will continue to exist and run as before, and other users and bots may continue to interact with and observe anything within this part of the original VW. However, such other users and bots will not be able to observe the user of the Private Copy, nor will they see any interactions or alterations made by the user to the Private Copy. From the point of view of other users or bots in the VW, the user will have disappeared at the time the Private Copy mode was entered.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0088">While inhabiting the private copy of the at least a portion of the VW, the user may explore and interact with objects and with the virtual environment without being observed by other users or bots. The user may alter the private copy through various interactions. For example, the user may move virtual objects, may purchase virtual items in a store, may hang a virtual picture or may paint a virtual wall. Because such actions are taken within the private copy, the associated alterations will not initially affect the main shared (public) copy of the VW. Indeed, the same portion of the original VW may in the same time period be altered in other ways, since other users may be interacting separately within the original VW.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0089">The Private Copy mode may be terminated after a set time period, upon satisfaction of some termination criteria, or upon instruction by the user (e.g. selection of an Exit Private Copy function via a user interface). One example termination criterion is that the user may exit the boundaries of the private copy in order to terminate the private copy mode and return to the original (e.g. public) VW. For example, the user may be exploring the VW and may come upon a store which sells lingerie. The user may not want to be observed shopping for and selecting items from the store, so the user may select the Private Copy mode from a menu of privacy plans or behaviors, and may specify the store as the location on which to base the private copy. The system may create a private copy of the store in which the user may shop in privacy. When the user has selected and purchased lingerie items from the store, the user may exit the store to terminate the private copy of the store and to return to the main (public) copy of the larger VW.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0090">Upon terminating the use of a private copy, the system may discard the private copy along with any modifications or alterations the user made to the objects and environment within the private copy. In this case, the memory and resources used to run the private copy are released, and the user's avatar is returned to the main VW, where it may again be visible to other users and bots. Although the Private Copy itself may be discarded, the effects of using the Private Copy may be preserved in the state of the user&#x2014;for example, the user may retain objects which were picked up or purchased within the Private Copy area.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0091">In another embodiment, the system may provide the option of merging into the main VW the modifications and alterations which the user made to the objects and environment within the Private Copy. If the user confirms that such modifications should be merged (e.g. that revealing such modifications to be observable by other users and bots is not a privacy concern to the user), then the system may run a merge algorithm in order to intelligently incorporate the changes from the Private Copy into the corresponding area of the main (public) VW. The merge algorithm may operate using any or all of the following principles.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0000">1. If no other users occupied and/or observed the area of the main VW corresponding to the private copy during the time the private copy was in use, then the system may adopt all changes/alterations made by the user to the private copy.<br/>2. If a user or users did occupy and/or observe the area of the main VW corresponding to the private copy during the time the private copy was in use, then the system may merge each change or alteration based on whether a conflicting change or alteration had been made in the main VW.<br/>3. If an individual change or alteration does not result in a conflict, then the change or alteration made by the user in the private copy may be adopted into the main VW during the merge. For example:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0092">a. If the user in the private copy painted a wall of a house red, and the same wall had not been painted or otherwise altered in the main VW while the private copy was being used, then the red wall may be adopted into the main VW at the time of the merge.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0093">b. If the user in the private copy moved an object from a table into a cabinet in the private copy, and the same object had not been moved in the main VW while the private copy was being used, then the object's new location in the cabinet may be adopted into the main VW at the time of the merge.<br/>4. In case of a detected conflict, changes or alterations made in the main VW may take precedence over changes made in the private copy. For example:</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0094">a. If the user in the private copy painted a wall of the house red, and the same wall had been wallpapered by another user in the main VW while the private copy was being used, then after the merge the wall will remain wallpapered in the main VW.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0095">b. If the user in the private copy moved an object from a table into a cabinet in the private copy, and the same object had been picked up and pocketed by another user in the main VW while the private copy was being used, then after the merge the object would remain in the other user's pocket.<br/>5. In some embodiments, the system may time the merge alterations to minimize observation and resulting shock from other users which may inhabit the corresponding location in the main VW. For example, if the system determines that a wall in the main copy of the VW should be turned red as the result of a private copy merge, the system may monitor the location and wait until the wall is not being observed by other users (e.g. until the location is free of observers) and may then perform the merge action and cause the wall to turn red.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0088" num="0096">In some embodiments, a common private copy plan may be configured for a group of users. The group may be selected by a user (e.g. from a friends list), or it may be a group of users which is already defined for a shared session or a shared VR experience. The user interface to select and configure a private copy of at least a portion of the VW for private use by a group of users may take the same or similar form to the user interface previously defined for configuring a group lockout area.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0097">In some embodiments, a private copy plan may be combined with other plans. For example, a user may select both Private Copy and Teleport plans from a list or menu of plans. The system may allow the user to select a location, area, or portion of the VW on which the private copy will be based. The selected location need not match or be near to the user's current location in the VW. The system may then spawn the private copy of the selected location or area, and may teleport the user (or a group of users) to the private copy which may then be used by the user or group exclusively without being observed by other users and/or bots.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Teleport Plan.</heading><p id="p-0090" num="0098">In some embodiments, the system provides a teleport privacy option/tool. A Teleport plan may transfer the user or the user's avatar (e.g. quickly or instantly) to a new location within the VW. The user may invoke Teleport via a user interface. For example, the user may select Teleport from a list of privacy options tools presented in a VR user interface. Upon user selection of Teleport, the system may display a second user interface element (e.g. a map of the VR world or a list of places in the VR world) in order to allow the user to select a remote destination for the teleport. In some embodiments, the system may allow the user to select a second privacy option tool to be applied immediately after the teleport. For example, the system may allow the user to teleport to a virtual bank within the VW, but appear there in a disguised form. As another example, the system may allow the user to teleport to a crowded bar in a seedy virtual neighborhood, but to appear invisible when emerging from the teleport. As a third example, the system may allow the user to teleport to a virtual store within the VR world, but to spawn a Private Copy of the store for the user's personal use. To this end, the user interface may allow the user to select the Teleport option tool, to specify a destination for the teleport, and to select a second privacy option tool to be applied upon teleportation. Once these are selected, the system may initiate the teleport.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0099">In some embodiments, the system may support group teleportation. In this case, the user may select other users or avatars which should be teleported with the user as a group. For example, the group may be composed of other users who are on a friends list, or the group may be composed of other users with whom the user is currently having a shared session or a shared VR experience. One user may select the parameters for teleportation on behalf of the group, and the group may be teleported as a whole to a new location.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0100">In response to a user or a group of users initiating a teleport, the user's avatar (and in the group case, the additional avatars of the other group members) will disappear from the current location. Any other users or bots which are observing these avatars will see the disappearance, but will not be able to detect the destination location.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Invisibility Plan.</heading><p id="p-0093" num="0101">In some embodiments, the system offers an Invisibility privacy plan. The Invisibility privacy plan may provide the user an ability to be invisible for a period of time. While invisibility mode is engaged, the user will not be seen by any users, and will not be observable by bots. Thus, the user may move within the VW without being identified or observed. The effects of the user's interaction may in some cases be observable, for example if an invisible user moves a virtual object or otherwise alters the environment, the movement of the object or the in-progress alteration may be visible. However, any user or bot observing such effects may not identify the invisible user as the source of the interaction.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0102">A system may invoke invisibility at the request of the user. For example, the user may select Invisibility mode from a UI component (e.g. a menu or list of privacy tools/options). A user may select another UI component in order to turn invisibility off and become again visible to other users and bots. A user may be able to select to be invisible only to bots and to be visible to human users, in the case where the fabric is able to distinguish between human controlled avatars and bots. A user may be able to select to be visible to users who are on a list of users (e.g. a preferred list of users, a list of known users, or a list of friends), but to be invisible to other users not on the list. A user may be able to select to be visible only to a group of users selected by the user (e.g. a few users with whom the current user is sharing an experience). In the latter case, the current user may invoke invisibility on behalf of the group, and in response the system and/or the fabric may make all members of the group invisible to users outside the group, yet visible to users within the group. In this way a user may obtain focused privacy for a group of users who are sharing the VR experience.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0103">In an exemplary embodiment, a user may invoke the Invisibility plan for a limited time, selected or defined by the user at the time invisibility is turned on. A user may invoke the Invisibility mode until a criterion is met, wherein the criterion may be selected or defined by the user. For example, the user may select to turn on Invisibility mode while the user is in a particular area of the VW (e.g. within a bank or a store, or within an area traced by the user on a map of the VR world). In this case, the system may turn off Invisibility automatically in response to the user exiting the location for which invisibility is selected, or in response to the user crossing the boundary which defines the particular area. In some embodiments, Invisibility mode for a user (or for a group) may be automatically offered or turned on by the system in response to the system detecting some criterion which suggests that privacy is needed.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0104">For example, in response to a user (or a group of users sharing an experience) entering a location such as a virtual bank or a virtual store which sells private or controversial items, or in response to the user entering a location or encountering a situation where the user has in the past requested invisibility or some other privacy preserving mode, the system may detect that privacy is required, and the system may in response present a user interface which offers the Invisibility mode (possibly along with additional privacy mode options or tools). The user may then confirm that Invisibility mode should be selected, or may select a different privacy option or tool. Later, in response to the user exiting the location or in response to the system determining that the detected scenario no longer applies, the system may turn off invisibility, or may prompt the user with an option to turn off the Invisibility mode. In this way the system may prompt or remind the user during times when privacy is recommended or is likely to be needed. The invisibility option or tool may be used in combination with other privacy options, as will be detailed further below.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Exemplary User Interfaces.</heading><heading id="h-0017" level="2">User Selects a Single Privacy Mode.</heading><p id="p-0097" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref> illustrate stages in a user interaction with a user interface through which a user selects the Disguise privacy mode/tool from a list of multiple privacy modes/tools.

In an exemplary embodiment, the system may present a user interface which allows the user to select multiple privacy plans to be used in combination or composited together in a manner defined by the user. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, illustrating a scene <b>700</b><i>a </i>from a VW experience the user is presented with privacy plan configuration interface (menu) <b>702</b>, having multiple option elements Clones <b>703</b><i>a</i>, Invisible <b>703</b><i>b</i>, Teleport <b>703</b><i>c</i>, Lockout <b>703</b><i>d</i>, Private Copy <b>703</b><i>e</i>, and Done <b>703</b><i>f</i>. The user may select more than one privacy plan as part of a combination. While the user is selecting Plans, the system may indicate which Plans may be used together, or the system may restrict the users' choices so that only compatible privacy plans may be selected together. For example, the user may select Teleport <b>703</b><i>c</i>, and in response the system may gray out and/or may prevent subsequent selection of other Plans which cannot be used in combination with Teleport <b>703</b><i>c</i>. As illustrated, the user has selected a combination of Teleport <b>703</b><i>c </i>and Private Copy <b>703</b><i>e</i>, which may be used together in combination, in order to be teleported to a selected location in a private copy of the VW. The system may ascertain which privacy plans are compatible, and responsive to the user selecting a first privacy plan, selectively enabling or disabling other selection options in the privacy plan configuration interface, based on compatibility with the first selected privacy plan.

For example, the system may determine that the user is shopping, and that the user is in a sensitive or embarrassing department within the store. The system may consider past history of the user, to determine which privacy modes the user may regularly use. The system may check to see whether any other users or bots are present in the local area.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0116">Based on determining that no users or bots are present in the local area, and/or that the user has selected Lockout in the past, the system may determine that Lockout is an appropriate plan for the user's current shopping scenario.

Because Lockout was previously identified as relevant privacy pan for the trigger conditions, it is presented as a recommendation. This scheme can be used for other privacy plans: defining a set of trigger conditions, monitoring for those conditions to be triggered, and if so, presenting the user with a recommendation to implement a previously defined Plan or set of Plans. Recommendations by a server may be based on trigger conditions either previously defined by the user or based on the system's own criteria, possibly developed through machine learning.

In turn, once specified, the user preferences may allow the system to proactively trigger an appropriate privacy plan. The following are means by which this could be accomplished. In some embodiments, a user may select a particular part of the VW by its identifier (e.g., &#x201c;map <b>3</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;region <b>4</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;structure <b>5</b>&#x201d;, etc.) or by boundaries, etc., and may request that the system be triggered in response to the user avatar being at that place. In some embodiments, the system may be triggered in response to the user nearing the identified place. In some embodiments, the user may specify a trigger using a machine-readable taxonomy of places such as by indicating &#x201c;trigger the system whenever I'm at a STORE that sells WATCHES,&#x201d; where the terms STORE and WATCHES are from the taxonomy. In some embodiments, the user may, at specification time, indicate the level or type of increased privacy that she would like from a set of available options (on a user interface). The user may also specify conditions under which the privacy plan would terminate (e.g., after some time, when reaching some named place, etc.). Therefore, having specified the conditions under which privacy should be increased and the type of privacy desired, the user can put the triggering into the hands of the system.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">Automatic Privacy Mode.</heading><p id="p-0119" num="0127">In some embodiments, a privacy mode may be triggered automatically, e.g. in response to a detected event or events. Certain legal frameworks, such as the European General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) may be used as a basis for determining privacy needs when interacting with avatars in the VW. For example, the GDPR identifies certain categories of types of information which require explicit, rather than merely implied, permission from the data subject. If some avatar in a VW began inquiring of the user's avatar on subjects identified by the GDPR as subject to heightened permission requirements, the system could create trigger a warning to the user or else may automatically initiate a privacy mode such as Disguise.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0128">One exemplary method implements a process of monitoring trigger conditions, responsive to detecting a trigger condition, automatically selecting a privacy plan for the VR user; and then implementing or recommending, to the VR user, the automatically selected privacy plan. The method proceeds as follows:</p><p id="p-0121" num="0000">1. The system makes a determination that it would be advantageous to initiate increased privacy.

Alternatively, the user is provided a recommendation to accept the privacy plan or plans.<br/>5. The user is informed (via GUI or other interface) about the imminent start of the privacy plan (and optionally some of its details such as time period, etc.).<br/>6.

The user interface may present a list of available privacy plans, and the user may select one of the privacy plans in order to customize it. The user may view details such as a plan description, one or more control parameters, behaviors associated with the plan, entities associated with the plan, and/or the like. The user may use the interface to edit one or more parameters associated with the privacy plan. In an advanced interface, the user may modify instructions or code in order to change how the plan operates. The user may modify and/or customize a base plan, and may save the modified plan for later use.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref> illustrate exemplary user interfaces for configuring, editing, and/or extending a privacy plan. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> provides a top-level view user interface <b>1201</b> by which a user may obtain information about an existing Plan and may access configuration and/or editing features. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the user interface may comprise an Info control, an Edit/Extend control, various parameter setting controls, and a control to view artifacts of the Plan. The Info control may allow the user to access a human readable description of the Plan. For example, if the user invokes the Info control for the EccentricClones base plan, the user interface may display a description of the Eccentric Clones plan (e.g. &#x201c;Eccentric Clones spawns multiple autonomous clones of your avatar in order to confuse nearby observers. Use the configuration parameters to configure how these clones behave.&#x201d;) The Edit/Extend control may allow the user to view behaviors and/or entities associated with the Plan, and to access editing functionality for such behaviors and/or entities, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>. The various parameter settings may be editable by the user in order to configure the plan behaviors. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the user may be able to set the number of clones (illustrated as <b>7</b>), a time period for the clones to be active (illustrated as 2 minutes), and a spatial range over which the clones may roam (illustrated as 5 meters).

In an exemplary use case, a user may be in a VW called &#x201c;VRShopper&#x201d; that is filled with virtual malls and shops with products he could look at, try on, and buy. The user may specify preferences for increased privacy as such: &#x201c;When I look at Rolex products, give me increased privacy using a preferred privacy mode/tool (e.g. the eccentric clones method where clones are moderately randomized&#x201d;). Later, when that user is approaching a store registered to serve Rolex products, the system triggers the eccentric clones, each of which spreads out from the current location and mills about other nearby stores (that do not sell Rolex products). Meanwhile, the user's avatar can gain some anonymity by browsing the Rolex store knowing that anyone watching will not be sure where the user's true attention is. For example, someone monitoring the user may be unable to discern whether the user embodies the avatar at the Rolex store or one of the other similar avatars nearby at other stores. Later, the user moves away from the Rolex store and the system gracefully terminates the privacy mode.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">Exemplary System Hardware.</heading><p id="p-0131" num="0137">Note that various hardware elements of one or more of the described embodiments are referred to as &#x201c;modules&#x201d; that carry out (i.e., perform, execute, and the like) various functions that are described herein in connection with the respective modules.
