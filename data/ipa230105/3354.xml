An edge lamp unit including a light guide is proposed as one of the lamp units. For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses such an edge lamp unit. In the edge lamp, one end surface (an edge) of a light-guiding plate, or an edge light guide, is configured as an emission surface. The emission surface is configured to guide light incident on an incident surface provided on the opposite side of the edge light guide from a light source and to emit narrow or linear light pattern from the emission surface. It is possible to provide an aesthetic lamp by using such an edge lamp unit.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the edge lamp unit of Patent Literature 1, a plurality of light sources each of which is assigned to a divided section of the emission surface is arranged along a lengthwise direction of the edge light guide in order to equalize brightness of light emitted from the emission surface. In addition, the edge light guide is provided with a plurality of reflection surfaces each of which corresponds to the respective light sources in order to guide light from each light source to each divided section of the emission surface uniformly.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, as for a vehicle lamp, especially an automobile lamp, a composite lamp in which a plurality of lamps having different functions is housed in the same lamp housing. For example, a lamp in which a low-beam lamp, a high-beam lamp, a clearance lamp, a turn signal lamp, and the like are combined is proposed as a composite head lamp. A lamp in which a tail lamp, a backup lamp, a turn signal lamp, and the like are combined is also proposed as a composite tail lamp.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Shared parts are utilized in such a composite lamp. For example, Patent Literature 2 discloses a composite lamp that includes a first lamp having a reflector and second lamp having a reflector, in which a light source of each lamp is mounted on a common substrate. Similarly, Patent Literature 3 discloses a composite lamp in which a light source is mounted on each of the front and back surfaces of one substrate and a lamp is configured with each light source. According to Patent Literature 2 or 3, the number of substrates on which a light source is mounted can be reduced, which is advantageous in reducing the size and the cost of a lamp.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, as for a vehicle lamp, especially an automobile lamp, a light-guide-type lamp unit using a light guide made of a translucent member as an optical system configured to emit light from a light source in a desired light distribution is used. The light-guide-type lamp unit is used in, for example, an auxiliary lamp and a signal lamp. The light-guide-type lamp unit is also used in a composite lamp in which a plurality of lamp units having different functions is housed in the same lamp housing as one of the lamp units.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Literature 4 discloses a light-guide-type lamp unit (referred to as a rod lamp unit) including a rod light guide that has a rodlike shape and that is provided with a reflecting element configured to emit light in a lengthwise direction of the rod light guide. Patent Literature 1 discloses a light-guide-type lamp unit (referred to as an edge lamp unit) including an edge lamp unit that has a tabular shape and from whose edge (end surface) light is emitted.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Literature 1: JP2019-67521A</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent Literature 2: JP2016-105372A</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Patent Literature 3: JP2018-166090A</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Patent Literature 4: JP2017-103173A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the edge lamp unit of Patent Literature 1, the emission surface of the edge light guide inclines, and the plurality of reflection surfaces is terraced correspondingly along the inclination of the emission surface. Since a step is formed between the reflection surfaces, it is difficult to reflect light uniformly toward the emission surface at a boundary formed by the step. In this case, the light guided to the emission surface is not distributed uniformly, and brightness on the emission surface is unequalized. When the edge lamp unit is turned on in this case, light distribution characteristics and appearance of the lamp deteriorate, which may damage design of the lamp.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A first object of the present disclosure is to provide a vehicle lamp that can prevent unequalized brightness on an emission surface of a light guide as in an edge lamp unit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As a composite lamp in which a plurality of lamps having different functions is housed in the same lamp housing, a composite lamp is proposed in which each of the plurality of lamps to be combined is configured as a lamp unit and the lamp units are housed in a lamp housing. In recent years, a lamp is proposed in which a plurality of lamp units having different optical systems is combined for good design. For example, a reflector-type lamp unit configured to control light distribution by a reflector reflecting light from a light source, a lens-type lamp unit configured to control light distribution by a lens refracting light from a light source, and a light-guide-type lamp unit configured to control light distribution by a light guide guiding light from a light source are combined.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the composite lamps disclosed in Patent Literature 2 and 3, since each lamp to be combined is configured as a lamp unit and each lamp unit is configured as a reflector-type lamp unit having the same optical system, it is easy to use a shared substrate on which light sources are mounted. As for lamp units having different optical systems, such as a reflector-type lamp unit, a lens-type lamp unit, and a light-guide-type lamp unit, however, arrangement of light sources with respect to optical systems, requirements for designing emission directions of light for optical systems, and the like are different. Therefore, it is difficult to use shared parts among lamp units having different optical systems, which makes it difficult to reduce the size and the cost of the composite lamp.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A second object of the present disclosure is to provide a vehicle lamp that can use shared parts even in a composite lamp including a plurality of lamp units having different forms of optical systems.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a composite lamp including a light-guide-type lamp unit, either a rod lamp unit or an edge lamp unit, among which the forms of light guides are different, is selectively used as in Patent Literature 1 and 4. Even in a case where a plurality of light-guide-type lamp units is combined, each lamp unit is configured with either a rod lamp unit or an edge lamp unit. A composite lamp has not been proposed in which a rod lamp unit and an edge lamp unit are combined. Since the appearance does not change much when the lamp unit or the composite lamp is turned on, it is desired to improve the design of the lamp.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A third object of the present disclosure is to provide a vehicle lamp that can improve design of a composite lamp including a light-guide-type lamp unit.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a vehicle lamp includes: a light source; and a light guide configured to guide light from the light source to emit the light, in which the light guide includes: an incident surface on which the light from the light source is incident; an emission surface from which the guided light is emitted outside; and a reflection surface on which the light from the incident surface is internally reflected toward the emission surface, the reflection surface includes a plurality of contiguous reflection surface sections, and each boundary between the plurality of reflection surface sections is provided with a reflection step configured to internally reflect the light divergently or diffusely.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a composite vehicle lamp includes: a lamp unit having: a light source; and an optical system configured to emit light from the light source in a desired light distribution; and a lamp housing configured to house a plurality of the lamp units, in which a first lamp unit of the lamp units is a light-guide-type lamp unit, the vehicle lamp further includes a substrate on which the light source of the first lamp unit and that of a second lamp unit of the lamp units are mounted, the light source of the first lamp unit is mounted on one surface of the substrate, and the light source of the second lamp unit is mounted on a surface of the substrate opposite to the one surface.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a composite vehicle lamp includes: a lamp unit having: a light source; and an optical system configured to emit light from the light source in a desired light distribution; and a lamp housing configured to house a plurality of the lamp units, in which the plurality of the lamp units include: one light-guide-type lamp unit having a light guide of one form; and another light-guide-type lamp unit having a light guide of a form different from the one form, the one light-guide-type lamp unit and the another light-guide-type lamp unit are configured to light up as a lamp having the same function.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the present disclosure, since a reflection step is foamed on each boundary between the reflection surface sections, light projected onto the boundaries is reflected divergently or diffusely and not in a specific direction. Since it is possible to prevent the light reflected on the boundaries from being emitted from a pan of the emission surface, it is possible to prevent unequalized brightness on the emission surface. Accordingly, a vehicle lamp with equalized brightness having desirable light distribution and good design can be provided.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the present disclosure, the first lamp unit out of the plurality of lamp units in the composite lamp is configured as a light-guide-type lamp unit. Since light sources in a light-guide-type lamp unit can be arranged more freely than in reflector-type or lens-type one, the light-guide-type lamp units can be designed more flexibly. Therefore, it is possible to use a shared substrate on which light sources of the first lamp unit and the second lamp unit are mounted with the first lamp unit configured as a light-guide-type lamp unit.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the present disclosure, lamp units having different forms of light guides, such as a rod lamp unit and an edge lamp unit are configured to light up as a lamp having one function. Since a relatively narrow light-emitting surface of the rod lamp unit and a relatively broad light-emitting surface of the edge lamp unit are combined, for example, design effects when the lamp units light up improved as compared with a lamp in which either rod lamp units or edge lamp units are combined.

Preferably, the B-substrate <b>113</b> covers the outer surface of the edge light guide <b>21</b> widely as long as that does not interfere in placement of the edge light guide <b>21</b> in order to improve light-blocking properties to be described later.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The white LEDs <b>20</b> as the third light source L<b>3</b> are mounted on a surface of the B-substrate <b>1</b>B on which the B-substrate <b>1</b>B faces the outer surface of the edge light guide <b>21</b>. In this embodiment, three white LEDs <b>20</b> are placed at a predetermined interval in the vertical direction such that they are slightly shifted in the front-rear direction.

The reflection surface <b>212</b> includes three reflection surface sections arranged in the vertical direction correspondingly to the three white LEDs <b>20</b> as the third light source L<b>3</b>. In this embodiment, since the three white LEDs <b>20</b> are sequentially shifted forward from the top to the bottom, the three reflection surface sections are also sequentially shifted forward from the top to the bottom in a terraced manner corresponding to the three white LEDs <b>20</b>. In the following, the reflection surface <b>212</b> may be referred to as one or all of the reflection surface sections generically.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Since the three reflection surface sections are similar to each other, only one of them will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the edge light guide <b>21</b> in the reflection surface <b>212</b>. A virtual focal point of the inner surface of the edge light guide <b>21</b> as the incident surface <b>211</b> is basically in the vicinity of the corresponding white LED <b>20</b>. The inner surface of the edge light guide <b>21</b> is formed by a part of a paraboloid whose central axis is a virtual line that passes through the virtual focal point and extends in the front-rear direction. Accordingly, light incident on the incident surface <b>211</b> from the white LEDs <b>20</b> is internally reflected by the reflection surface <b>212</b> and is guided in the optical axis direction to the front end surface configured as the emission surface <b>213</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Light satisfying a condition of a critical angle determined based on a refractive index of translucent resin of the edge light guide <b>21</b> out of light projected onto an inner surface of the reflection surface <b>212</b> is totally reflected on the inner surface and is guided to the emission surface <b>213</b>. On the other hand, since light projected onto a rear end portion of the reflection surface <b>212</b> of the edge light guide <b>21</b> is incident on the inner surface at a small angle such that the condition is not satisfied, the light leaks outside the edge light guide <b>212</b> from the reflection surface <b>212</b> as shown by a chain line without total reflection.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Therefore, the reflection surface <b>212</b> that satisfies the condition has a shape of the paraboloid as a single-reflection surface <b>212</b><i>m </i>on which light is reflected once. On the other hand, the reflection surface that does not satisfy the condition is configured as a multiple-reflection surface <b>212</b><i>p. </i><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is a perspective view showing the exterior of the multiple-reflection surface <b>212</b><i>p. </i>The multiple-reflection surface <b>212</b><i>p </i>has mountain (ridge) lines y and valley lines t extending from the virtual focal point to form a fan shape. A cross-sectional view of the multiple-reflection surface <b>212</b><i>p </i>in the circumferential direction is shaped like a triangle wave. The mountain lines y extend along paraboloids, and the valley lines t extend along paraboloids whose parameters are different from that of the mountain lines y. Therefore, slopes r choppily arranged in the fan shape are configured such that the paraboloids incline alternately in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">On the slopes r of the multiple-reflection surface <b>212</b><i>p, </i>surface angles in the circumferential direction with respect to the incident surface <b>211</b> increase. Since an incident angle in the circumferential direction of incident light reaching each slope r increases, the incident light satisfies the condition and is internally reflected (primary internal reflection). The internally reflected light reaching an adjacent or distant slope r is internally reflected (secondary internal reflection) since the condition is satisfied again. Since slopes r incline along the parabola in the optical axis direction, light internally reflected through the primary, secondary, and so forth internal reflection faces approximately in the optical axis direction.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Therefore, in the edge light guide <b>21</b>, some light reaching the incident surface <b>211</b> is guided toward the emission surface <b>213</b> through the primary internal reflection on the single-reflection surface <b>212</b><i>m. </i>The. rest of the light is guided toward the emission surface <b>213</b> through multiple reflections such as the primary and secondary internal reflections on the multiple-reflection surface <b>212</b><i>p. </i>Consequently, it is possible to prevent light from leaking outside the edge light guide <b>21</b> from the reflection surface <b>212</b>, thereby increasing reflection efficiency of light on the reflection surface <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the edge light guide <b>21</b>, light from the white LEDs <b>20</b> corresponding to the three reflection surface sections is internally reflected to the optical axis direction and is emitted from the emission surface <b>213</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is a perspective view schematically showing the emission surface <b>213</b>. Refraction steps <b>215</b> configured to refract light diffusely are formed on a front end of the emission surface <b>213</b>. In this embodiment, a large number of minute spherical steps are arranged as the refraction steps <b>215</b>. Since the refraction steps <b>215</b> are provided, light reflected by one of the three reflection surface sections to the optical axis direction is refracted by the refraction steps <b>215</b> and is emitted diffusely toward a desired wide region ahead of the automobile, as shown in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, in the edge light guide <b>21</b> according to this embodiment, a lateral emission step <b>216</b> protruding inward in the vehicle width direction is provided in a front end side of the inner surface of the edge light guide <b>21</b>, which is along one edge portion of the emission surface <b>213</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>. A horizontal cross section of the lateral emission step <b>216</b> has trapezoidal shape protruding from the inner surface, and a wedge-shaped portion <b>216</b><i>a </i>on a lower base positioned at a front side in the optical axis direction protrudes forward from the emission surface <b>213</b>. The lateral emission step <b>216</b> extends along the emission surface <b>213</b> of the edge light guide <b>21</b> substantially over the entire length in the. vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Accordingly, most light reflected by the reflection surface <b>212</b> faces in the optical axis direction of the edge light guide <b>21</b>, but some of the light inclines from the optical axis direction and is not emitted from the emission surface <b>213</b> suitably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>. When such light is guided to the lateral emission step <b>216</b>, the light is reflected by an upper base of the lateral emission step <b>216</b> and/or front or rear inclined surface thereof and is emitted from the wedge-shaped portion <b>216</b><i>a, </i>which protrudes forward from the emission surface <b>213</b>. In the wedge-shaped portion <b>216</b><i>a, </i>light is reflected by an inner surface of the wedge-shaped portion <b>216</b><i>a </i>and is emitted toward the left side of the left head lamp L-HL in a direction inclined toward the outer side in the vehicle width direction from the optical axis direction of the edge light guide <b>21</b>. In this way, the lateral emission step <b>216</b> is configured to reflect light guided to an edge of the edge light guide <b>21</b> in a thickness direction of the edge light guide <b>21</b> and to emit the light in the thickness direction of the edge light guide <b>21</b>. The emission surface <b>213</b> inclines in the thickness direction of the edge light guide <b>21</b> from one edge of the edge light guide <b>21</b> in which the lateral emission step <b>216</b> is provided to the other edge.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Since light widely emitted from the refraction steps <b>215</b> of the emission surface <b>213</b> and light emitted outwardly in the vehicle width direction from the lateral emission step <b>216</b> are combined, the edge lamp unit EgU can emit light extremely widely.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As described above, the three reflection surface sections are arranged in a terraced manner along the inclination direction of the emission surface <b>213</b>. That is, as schematically shown in a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of the edge light guide <b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, the three reflection surface sections are sequentially shifted forward from the top to the bottom. Therefore, boundary surfaces <b>217</b> extending along the optical axis direction are formed between the reflection surface sections. In other words, the boundary surfaces <b>217</b> extending in a direction intersecting the inclination direction of the reflections surface <b>212</b> are formed. Some light that is not internally reflected in the optical axis direction by each of the reflection surface sections is incident on the boundary surfaces <b>217</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">If the boundary surfaces <b>217</b> were flat, such light is specularly internally reflected on the boundary surfaces <b>217</b> as shown by chain lines. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> shows an example of reflection on the upper boundary surface <b>217</b>. The internally reflected light is guided upward at a desired angle from the optical axis direction and is emitted from the emission surface <b>213</b>. Since the light is superposed on light reflected by each reflection surface <b>212</b> toward the optical axis direction, brightness of the emission surface is high in such a region. On the other hand, the brightness of the emission surface is relatively low outside the region. Such uneven brightness of the emission surface deteriorates the exterior of the lamp when turned on.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the present disclosure, the boundary surfaces <b>217</b> are provided with reflection steps <b>218</b> configured to reflect light diffusely as schematically shown in a perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>.

An example of reflection on the lower boundary surface <b>217</b> is shown by solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>. The light, guided to the emission surface <b>213</b> is superposed on light guided from the reflection surface <b>212</b>. Consequently, light is equalized over a desired region in an upper-lower direction of the emission surface <b>213</b> to avert uneven brightness of the emission surface <b>213</b>, thereby improving the exterior when the edge lamp unit EgU is turned.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Since the boundary surfaces <b>217</b> are provided with the reflection steps <b>218</b>, it is possible to reduce light that passes through the boundary surfaces <b>217</b> and leaks from the edge light guide <b>21</b>, thereby realizing efficient use of light from the white LEDs <b>20</b> (the third light source L<b>3</b>).

Even if light is guided toward the supporting piece <b>214</b>, the light is reflected forward on a bent of the supporting piece <b>214</b> toward the emission surface <b>213</b>.

Consequently, the third light source L<b>3</b> of the edge lamp unit EgU and the fifth light source L<b>5</b> of the side lamp unit SiU can be mounted on the single B-substrate <b>1</b>B.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The side lamp unit SiU configured as a Ions-type lamp unit has an optical system different from an optical system of the edge lamp unit EgU configured as a light-guide-type lamp unit. With this configuration, a light source of the edge lamp unit EgU and a light source of the side lamp unit SiU can be mounted on the single substrate.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">If the B-substrate <b>1</b>B includes drive circuit for the third light source L<b>3</b>, the fifth light source L<b>5</b> can be caused to emit light using this circuit. In this case, a part of the drive circuit for the third light source L<b>3</b> may function as a drive circuit for the fifth light source L<b>5</b>. Since the connector <b>222</b> for connecting the third light source to the lamp ECU <b>5</b> is connected to the B-substrate, the fifth light source L<b>5</b> can be connected to the lamp ECU <b>5</b> using the connector <b>222</b> and a separate connector is not required.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">As for assembly of the head lamp HL, when the edge lamp unit EgU is installed in the lamp housing <b>100</b>, the fifth light source L<b>5</b> of the side lamp unit SiU is installed, too. Since installation of the side lamp unit SiU is completed as only the lens <b>41</b> is installed to the lamp body <b>101</b>, the head lamp HL can be assembled simply and quickly.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The B-substrate <b>1</b>B is supported substantially in parallel along, the outer surface of the edge light guide <b>21</b>. The optical axis of the edge light guide <b>21</b> is in the front-rear direction of the head lamp HL. Therefore, each of the white LEDs <b>20</b> and <b>40</b> of the third light source L<b>3</b> and the fifth light source L<b>5</b> is configured with a chip-type LED flip-chip mounted on the B-substrate <b>1</b>B, a light-emitting surface of each chip-type LED faces inwardly or outwardly in the vehicle width direction. Since light from the fifth light source L<b>5</b> is emitted laterally in the vehicle width direction, the optical step <b>413</b> for forming a light distribution of the turn signal lamp to emit light through the lens <b>41</b> can be easily designed.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Since the B-substrate <b>1</b>B is integrally supported by the edge light guide <b>21</b>, heat when the white LEDs <b>20</b> and <b>40</b> of the third light source L<b>3</b> and the fifth light source L<b>4</b> emits light can escape through the B substrate <b>1</b>B to the lamp body <b>101</b>, which supports the edge light guide <b>21</b>. Consequently, efficient and reliable lighting of the white LEDs <b>20</b> and <b>40</b> can be realized.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The side lamp unit SiU is placed in a bend in the head lamp HL, and the lens <b>41</b> is not present anterior to the emission surface <b>213</b> of the edge light guide <b>21</b>. That is, the lens <b>41</b> is not present in at least front and lateral regions of the emission surface <b>213</b>, which inclines outwardly in the vehicle width direction. Therefore, light emitted from the emission surface <b>213</b> of the edge light guide <b>21</b> toward the front or lateral region is not shielded by the side lamp unit SiU, nor by the lens <b>41</b>. Light emitted from the lateral emission step <b>216</b> of the edge light guide <b>21</b> toward the lateral region is not shielded, and a light distribution of the edge lamp unit EgU is not hindered.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The side lamp unit may be configured as a reflector-type lamp unit. The side lamp unit SiU configured as a reflector-type lamp unit is an example of a lamp unit whose optical system is different from that of the edge lamp unit EgU configured as a light-guide-type lamp unit In this case, a reflector may be placed in the vicinity of the B-substrate <b>1</b>B to reflect light from the fifth light source L<b>5</b> in a desired light distribution. The fifth light source L<b>5</b> may be configured with an LED configured to emit light in a predetermined color. Even if the side lamp unit SiU is configured as a reflector-type lamp unit in this way, the fifth light source L<b>5</b> can be mounted on the B-substrate <b>1</b>B, on which the third light source L<b>3</b> of the edge lamp unit EgU is mounted, too.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The present disclosure is not limited to the embodiments described above, and various modifications can be made. For example, in the low-beam lamp unit and the high-beam lamp unit, the number of the white LEDs as the first light source or the second light source or the configuration of the reflector can be changed as appropriate. The low-beam lamp unit and the high-beam lamp unit may be configured as a lens-, especially, projector-type lamp unit.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the edge lamp unit, the configuration of the edge lamp guide can be changed as appropriate. In particular, the number of the white LEDs as the third light source and the number of the reflecting surface sections, which are provided in the edge light guide correspondingly to the white LEDs, can be changed as appropriate. The auxiliary reflection steps formed on the boundary surface between the adjacent reflecting surface sections is not limited to knurled-structured one as long as they are configured to reflect light divergently or diffusedly.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In the rod lamp unit, the cross-sectional shape and the front shape of the rod light guide can be changed as appropriate. The reflection surface may be configured differently depending on the shape or size of the rod light guide. For example, a light-reflecting film may be provided on the reflection surface.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Although the edge lamp unit and the rod lamp unit are configured as a clearance lamp and a daytime running lamp, respectively, in the embodiment described above, they may be configured as an auxiliary lamp other than a clearance lamp or a daytime running lamp or a signal lamp. Although the side lamp unit is configured as a turn signal lamp, the side lamp unit may be configured as a side marker lamp, a signal lamp other than turn signal lamp or a side marker lamp, or an auxiliary lamp.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The present application is based on: Japanese Patent Application No. 2019-224321, filed on Dec. 12, 2019; Japanese Patent Application No. 2019-224322, filed on Dec. 12, 2019; and Japanese Patent Application No. 2019-224323, filed on Dec. 12, 2019, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-001-9" num="001-9"><claim-text><b>1</b>.-<b>9</b>.
