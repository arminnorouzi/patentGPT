This changes the magnetic field between the rotor <b>2</b> and the stator <b>3</b>, and electric current flows through the windings of the stator <b>3</b>. At this time, the magnet holder <b>2</b><i>d, </i>which is disposed in the outermost position in the radial direction of the rotor <b>2</b>, is close to the permanent magnets <b>2</b><i>c </i>and the stator <b>3</b>, and eddy current may be easily generated therein, so that the temperature of the magnet holder <b>2</b><i>d </i>may become high. For example, in the generator <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, the amount of heat generated in the magnet holder <b>2</b><i>d </i>is about several times the amount of heat (heat loss) generated in the permanent magnets <b>2</b><i>c </i>during driving, and the heat loss in the magnet holder <b>2</b><i>d </i>is greater than that in the permanent magnets <b>2</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the generator <b>1</b>, the cooling oil flowed in from the cooling oil supply portion <b>130</b> flows into the inlet flow passages R<b>1</b> through the flow passages Ra. At this time, since the flow passage diameter of the inlet flow passage R<b>1</b> is decreased at the choke portion <b>2</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, the flow rate of the cooling oil passing through the inlet flow passage R<b>1</b> is limited. The cooling oil overflowed thereby flows into another inlet flow passage R<b>1</b> so that the flow rates of the inlet flow passages R<b>1</b> become substantially equal. Then, a force outward in the radial direction due to the centrifugal force of the rotating rotor <b>2</b> is applied to the cooling oil, and the cooling oil flows through the radial flow passages R<b>2</b> into the groove flow passages R<b>3</b> formed between the permanent magnets <b>2</b><i>c </i>and the magnet holder <b>2</b><i>d. </i>The cooling oil in the groove flow passages R<b>3</b> is extruded in the rotation axis direction and is led toward the outlet flow passages R<b>4</b>. At this time, the cooling oil comes into contact with the permanent magnets <b>2</b><i>c </i>and the magnet holder <b>2</b><i>d </i>having high temperatures in the groove flow passages R<b>3</b> and removes the heat of the permanent magnets <b>2</b><i>c </i>and the magnet holder <b>2</b><i>d </i>by heat transfer. Then, the cooling oil flowed into the outlet flow passages R<b>4</b> and flowed out therefrom flows into the flow passage Rb between the collar <b>140</b> and the inner shaft <b>2</b><i>a. </i>The cooling oil is stored in a space (not shown) provided in the casing <b>110</b> through the flow passages R<b>4</b>. The cooling oil temporarily stored in the space is discharged to the outside by the operation of a pump or the like (not shown). The cooling oil flowing through the flow passages Ra and the flow passage Rb is in an almost atmospheric pressure state and is not easily affected by a pump or the like provided on the upstream side or the downstream side of the generator <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to the present embodiment, in the generator <b>1</b>, the inlet R<b>1</b><i>a </i>of the inlet flow passage R<b>1</b> is provided on the inside in the radial direction of the outlet R<b>4</b><i>a </i>of the outlet flow passage R<b>4</b>, and the groove flow passage R<b>3</b> is provided on the outside in the radial direction of the inlet R<b>1</b><i>a </i>of the inlet flow passage R<b>1</b> and the outlet R<b>4</b><i>a </i>of the outlet flow passage R<b>4</b>. As a result, centrifugal force acts on the cooling oil between the outlet R<b>4</b><i>a </i>and the inlet R<b>1</b><i>a, </i>and the pressure on the inlet side of the cooling flow passage can be further increased than the pressure on the outlet side thereof. Therefore, it is possible to make the cooling oil flow in the cooling flow passage due to the centrifugal force exerted on the rotor <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the present embodiment, the inlet R<b>1</b><i>a </i>of the inlet flow passage R<b>1</b> is provided on the inside in the radial direction of the outlet R<b>4</b><i>a </i>of the outlet flow passage R<b>4</b>. Thereby, the centrifugal force applied to the cooling oil in the inlet flow passage R<b>1</b> due to the rotation of the rotor <b>2</b> can become greater than that applied to the cooling oil in the outlet flow passage R<b>4</b>, and the difference in centrifugal force can create a flow of the cooling oil from the inlet flow passage R<b>1</b> to the outlet flow passage R<b>4</b> through the groove flow passage R<b>3</b>. Since the flow passage Rb extends in the axial direction, it is possible to limit the centrifugal force applied to the cooling oil in the flow passage Rb from affecting the cooling oil in the outlet flow passage R<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">If the cooling oil guided to the vicinity of the outer peripheral surface of the rotor <b>2</b> is discharged at the position, the cooling oil is led outward in the radial direction due to centrifugal force, so that the cooling oil may come into contact with the stator <b>3</b> provided on the outside in the radial direction of the rotor <b>2</b> or may flow into a space between the stator <b>3</b> and the rotor <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present disclosure, the outlet flow passages R<b>4</b> that guide the cooling oil to the inside in the radial direction are provided, and thus the cooling oil that has passed through the groove flow passages R<b>3</b> can be discharged after being returned to the outer peripheral surface of the inner shaft <b>2</b><i>a. </i>Specifically, the bearings <b>120</b> and the sealing members <b>2</b><i>h </i>are disposed on the inside in the radial direction of the magnet holder <b>2</b><i>d </i>provided with the groove flow passages R<b>3</b>. The cooling oil is guided to the inside in the radial direction through the outlet flow passages R<b>4</b> after passing through the groove flow passages R<b>3</b>, whereby the cooling oil passes through the inside of the bearings <b>120</b> and the sealing members <b>2</b><i>h </i>and is discharged to the outside of the generator.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">With the above configuration, it is possible to limit the discharged cooling oil from coming into contact with the stator <b>3</b> or flowing into a space between the stator <b>3</b> and the rotor <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">By providing the sealing members <b>2</b><i>h, </i>it is possible to limit the cooling oil flowing through the cooling flow passage from leaking from a slight gap between the first end-holding ring <b>2</b><i>f </i>and the magnet holder <b>2</b><i>d </i>and from a slight gap between the second end-holding ring <b>2</b><i>g </i>and the magnet holder <b>2</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Hereinbefore, the embodiment of the present disclosure has been described with reference to the drawings, but the present disclosure is not limited to the above embodiment.
