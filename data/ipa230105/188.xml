More particularly, this present invention pertains to improved pre-knotted adjustable neckties.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The unnecessary trouble of tying a necktie knot has presented a problem that many manufacturers and clothing designers have attempted to solve for necktie users. To solve this problem, manufacturers and clothing designers have generally proposed two alternative design methodologies of construction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The first methodology accomplishes the permanent knot; however, in doing so, this methodology may sacrifice aspects of adjustability and functionality which are commonly associated with a traditional necktie, rendering the alternative nature of its design only quasi-functional and readily observable upon close visual inspection. Examples of the &#x201c;permanent knot&#x201d; design may include such designs as a clip-on tie and a zipper-tie. While the foregoing designs accomplish a permanent knot for the necktie, the designs lack core functionality of a traditional necktie. Specifically, the zipper-tie cannot be adjusted without rendering the alternative nature of its design visually observable, whereas the clip-on tie cannot be adjusted whatsoever.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The second methodology includes the incorporation, inclusion, or use of a device, apparatus, or other attachment, the foregoing of which are foreign to the flexible material, or clothing fabric, of the necktie. While this methodology may accomplish certain aspects related to functionality and adjustability, such aspects are only accomplished by virtue of a simulated pre-modeled knot, rendering the alternative nature of the design visually observable upon close inspection. And similar to the first methodology, while the second methodology achieves a knot for the necktie, such knot is impermanent, and only formed through participation and manipulation by the necktie user. Examples of the incorporation, inclusion, or use of a foreign device apparatus, or other attachment are disclosed in the following references: US20140317831A1, US20120185995A1, and U.S. Pat. No. 8,931,116.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Despite manufacturer's and clothing designer's attempts to develop a pre-knotted necktie, which balances functionality and adjustability with the appearance of a conventional necktie, no particular solution has been widely embraced by frequent, or even ordinary, necktie users. Accordingly, there may be long-felt need in the industry of necktie manufacturing and design to eliminate the unnecessary trouble of tying a knot with a panel of flexible material, while simultaneously preserving look, feel, functionality, and adjustability of a traditional necktie.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Previous alternative designs, such as those described in the above, may satisfy the first element. As of yet, however, no such design has satisfied the second element, because no manufacturer or clothing manufacturer has achieved a permanent knot, without compromising some aspect related to look, feel, functionality, or adjustability of a traditional necktie.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, a need exists for an alternative design that provides a legitimate solution to the unnecessary trouble associated with traditional neckties that simultaneously (1) eliminates the unnecessary trouble of tying a knot with a panel of flexible material, and (2) preserves look, feel, functionality, and adjustability of a traditional necktie.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A principle object of the present disclosure is to provide a pre-knotted adjustable necktie. Another object of the disclosure is to provide a method by which to assemble the pre-knotted adjustable necktie.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with the objects of the disclosure, a pre-knotted adjustable necktie may include a panel of flexible material having a proximal blade end portion, a distal tail end portion, and a middle portion positioned between the blade end portion and the tail end portion, Said flexible material may include any natural or artificial fabric or fiber, which is customary for neckties and other articles of clothing. In addition, said middle portion of the pre-knotted adjustable necktie may include a stretchable or elastomeric material, such that the pre-knotted adjustable necktie may be mechanically stretched or deformed, without compromising or sacrificing its original length or shape.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also in accordance with the objects of the disclosure, a pre-knotted adjustable necktie may include a passage incorporated or included through the panel of flexible material at a position in the tail end portion proximate to the middle portion, with the passage having sufficient dimensionality for slidable reception of the tail end. Said passage may have a circular or rectangular shape, and said passage may include a grommet, or other ring or edge strip for slidable reception of the tail end.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also in accordance with the objects of the disclosure, a pre-knotted adjustable necktie may include a coupling member connecting a first location on an edge of the middle portion with a second location on the edge of the middle portion to form a first loop in the middle portion along the edge. Said coupling member may encompass a thread, or other fine piece of fabric or material, which may be sewn between the first location on the edge of the middle portion and the second location of the edge of the middle portion. Said coupling member may also include a thin wire, or other malleable metal or material.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Also in accordance with the objects of the disclosure, the pre-knotted adjustable necktie may include a knot having the tail end portion extending through the first loop to form a second loop, and the blade end portion extending through the first loop to form a third loop, the blade end portions extending downward from the knot. Said first loop may form a teardrop or other geometrical shape approximating a sphere or oval with an angular point or end. Said knot may form a triangular or rectangular shape, or other geometrical configuration customary for the morphology of a knot in a conventional necktie.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Also in accordance with the objects of the disclosure, a neck loop may include the tail end portion extending through the second loop, further extending through the third loop, and passing through the passage, such that the tail end portion may be movable within the third loop and the passage to adjust a length of the neck loop.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Also in accordance with the objects of the disclosure, a graspable anchor may be externally attached to, or internally incorporated within, the tail end portion to enable the tail end portion to extend through the first loop, the second loop, the third loop, and the passage.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Also in accordance with the objects of the disclosure, the pre-knotted adjustable necktie may include a slab of rigid material that is externally attached to, or internally incorporated within, the tail end portion positioned beneath the passage to prevent the tail end portion from returning through the passage and the third loop, thereby breaching the closed and confined nature of the neck loop.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Also in accordance with the objects of the disclosure, the tail end portion may house at least one magnetic plate, and the blade end portion may house at least one magnetic plate.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">There has been outlined, rather broadly, some of the features of the invention so that the detailed description thereof may be better understood. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.
