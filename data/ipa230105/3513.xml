At the same time, a high spatial resolution and a parallel multi-channel measurement via the lens array and the spatially resolved detection device are possible. The single pinhole aperture serves as a multiplexer for spatial filtering of the beam paths of all individual channels of the measuring light beam path assigned to the respective array lenses, which emanates from the object surface. An array filtering via an aperture array, which would require complex adjustment, is not necessary. The multiplexer optics can be designed as a single multiplexer lens. The collimation optics may be designed as a single collimation lens. The measuring light from the light source may be coupled, in particular via a polarizing beam splitter, into a beam path of the measuring light between the chromatic telescope and the spatially resolved detection device. Part of a coupling optics can be a &#x3bb;/4-plate. The latter can be arranged between the coupling in, polarizing beam splitter and the lens array.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0014">A telecentric beam path in the chromatic telescope configured such that a beam path of the measuring light in the chromatic telescope is telecentric reduces the requirements for a positioning of an aperture of the chromatic telescope. Scale errors in the 3D measurement of the object surface can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0015">A detection array configured such that the detection device comprises at least one detection array with detector pixels enables multi-channel measurement. The detection array may be embodied as a CCD array or a CMOS array.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0016">The design of the detection device configured such that the detection device comprises a beam splitter and two mutually independent detection arrays, each of which is arranged downstream of the beam splitter in a partial beam path of the measuring light increases the degrees of freedom of the data acquisition as well as the data evaluation. The partial beam paths of the measuring light may each be guided via a telescope for imaging a detection entrance plane onto the respective detection array. This imaging can be telecentric.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0017">A color gradient filter comprising at least one color gradient filter in one of the two partial beam paths of the detection device enables a data evaluation which is described for a single-channel measurement in the technical article by Kim et al. &#x201c;Chromatic confocal microscopy with a novel wavelength detection method using transmittance,&#x201d; Optics Express, Vol. 21, No. 5, pages 6286 to 6294, 2013 or in KR 10-1368486 A. This evaluation technique can be applied to the pixel-wise channels of the detection device with the detection arrays so that the individual channels can be evaluated in parallel.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0018">An adaptation of the raster spacing configured such that a raster spacing of the array lenses of the lens array is adapted to a raster spacing of the detector pixels of the at least one detection array optimizes a spatial resolution of the confocal measuring apparatus. The adaptation of the raster spacing can be selected such that exactly one detector pixel is assigned to each array lens. Alternatively, the raster spacing adaptation can also be done in such a way that exactly one array lens is assigned a plurality of detector pixels.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0019">A bandpass filter comprising a spectral bandpass filter for limiting a spectral range of the measuring light can be used to limit the spectral range of the measuring light to a spectral range for which the chromatic telescope is designed. A correspondingly selected spectral range may, for example, be in the range between 400 and 600 nm, in particular between 400 and 500 nm. Instead of a bandpass filter, a combination of a spectral highpass filter and a spectral lowpass filter may also be used.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0020">An embodiment of the invention is explained in more detail below with reference to the drawing.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a confocal measuring apparatus for 3D measurement of an object surface;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a light field diagram in which an illumination angle (NA) of measuring light emanating from a measuring point on the object surface is shown as a function of a distance x of a measuring point from an optical axis of the measuring apparatus to illustrate the effect of raster illumination of the object to be measured; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in an illustration similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, shows a further embodiment of a confocal measuring apparatus for 3D measurement of an object surface.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0024">A confocal measuring apparatus <b>1</b> serves for 3D measurement of a surface <b>2</b> of an object <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0025">A light source <b>4</b> of the measuring apparatus <b>1</b> generates measuring light <b>5</b>.

It is thus possible during the spatially resolved measurement with the detection device <b>24</b> to assign the respective measured light signal to exactly one object point according to the spatial resolution of the lens array <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0050">An evaluation of color-dependent intensity ratios of the measurement results of the two detection arrays <b>23</b> and <b>26</b> can be performed for structure determination of the surface <b>2</b> as known, for example, from the technical article by Kim et al. &#x201c;Chromatic confocal microscopy with a novel wavelength detection method using transmittance,&#x201d; Optics Express, Vol. 21, No. 5, pages 6286 to 6294, 2013 or from KR 10-1368486 A. The single-channel evaluation described therein can be performed separately for each pixel of the detection arrays <b>23</b>, <b>26</b> of the detection device <b>24</b>, so that the spatially resolved measurement result of the structure measurement of the surface <b>2</b> can be determined in parallel.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0051">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a further embodiment of a confocal measuring apparatus <b>31</b> is described below, which can be used instead of the measuring apparatus <b>1</b> for 3D measurement of an object surface.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0052">Components and functions as well as measuring methods which have already been explained above in connection with the confocal measuring apparatus <b>1</b> and in particular with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> bear the same reference numerals and will not be discussed in detail again.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0053">In the measuring apparatus <b>31</b>, the measuring light <b>5</b> is coupled into a measuring and detection light beam path via a polarizing beam splitter <b>32</b>, which is arranged in the beam path between the collimation lens <b>11</b> and the lens array <b>12</b>. The measuring light <b>5</b>, polarized for example perpendicular to the drawing plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, impinges on the polarizing beam splitter <b>32</b> from below in the arrangement according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and is initially reflected by it to the right towards the lens array <b>12</b>. For polarization of the measuring light <b>5</b>, a polarizer <b>33</b> for the measuring light <b>5</b> is arranged in the beam path between the light source <b>4</b> and the polarizing beam splitter <b>32</b>. The polarizer <b>33</b> is designed as a linear polarization filter. A 90&#xb0; deflection mirror <b>34</b> is arranged in the beam path between the polarizer <b>33</b> and the polarizing beam splitter. A spectral bandpass filter <b>35</b> is arranged upstream of the polarizer <b>33</b> in the beam path, which limits a spectral range of the measuring light <b>5</b> to a spectral range for which the hyperchromatic objective <b>14</b> of the measuring apparatus <b>31</b> is designed.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0054">An aperture <b>36</b> in the beam path between the polarizing beam splitter <b>32</b> and the lens array <b>12</b> is designed as a field stop for the measuring light <b>5</b> and delimits an illuminated region on the input region of the lens array <b>12</b>. A &#x3bb;/4 plate <b>37</b> is arranged between the polarizing beam splitter <b>32</b> and the aperture <b>36</b> in the beam path of the measuring light <b>5</b>. After a double pass of the &#x3bb;/4-plate <b>37</b>, the measuring light <b>5</b>, originally polarized perpendicular to the drawing plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, is polarized parallel to the drawing plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and thus passes through the polarizing beam splitter <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> from right to left. The subsequent beam path through the collimation lens <b>11</b> then serving as a focusing lens, the pinhole aperture <b>10</b>, the focusing lens <b>8</b> then serving as a collimation lens corresponds to the beam path explained above in connection with the measuring apparatus <b>1</b>. In the detection beam path of the measuring light <b>5</b> following the lens <b>8</b>, the measuring light first passes through a further aperture <b>38</b> which defines a plane <b>39</b> to be imaged which is optically conjugate to an arrangement plane <b>40</b> of the lens array <b>12</b>. The lenses <b>8</b> and <b>11</b> thus image plane <b>39</b> onto plane <b>40</b>, wherein this imaging is telecentric. The imaging between planes <b>39</b> and <b>12</b> through the lenses <b>8</b> and <b>11</b> is telecentric.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0055">The detection beam path of the measuring light <b>5</b> first passes through another focusing lens <b>41</b> after the aperture <b>38</b> and then through a non-polarizing beam splitter <b>42</b>. A measuring light portion <b>5</b>B reflected by the non-polarizing beam splitter first passes through the linear color filter <b>25</b> and then through a collimation lens <b>43</b> before the measuring light partial beam <b>5</b>B impinges on the detector array <b>26</b>. The measuring light partial beam <b>5</b>B transmitted by the non-polarizing beam splitter <b>42</b> first passes through a collimation lens <b>44</b> and then impinges on the detector array <b>23</b>.
