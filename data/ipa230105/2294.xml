The importance of this method stems from the fact that triptane is the hydrocarbon with the greatest capacity to resist compression without ignition and can be used in unleaded aviation gasolines and in the formulation of high-octane automotive gasolines.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gasoline is a fuel for Otto cycle engines, in which the property of resistance to detonation is essential, both in aviation and automotive applications. A need exists in the prior art to obtain components with a high capacity for resisting detonation, which is expressed by octane measurements, especially in engines with air compression prior to mixing with the fuel. The historical trend has been toward higher-octane gasoline and the premium gasoline market, which represents about 20% of the gasoline consumed in the USA (D. Splitter, A. Pawlowski, R. Wagner, &#x201c;A historical analysis of the co-evolution of gasoline octane number and spark-ignition engines,&#x201d; Frontiers Mech. Eng. 1 (2016) 16).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Airplanes with Otto cycle engines operate in a high compression ratio condition with turbocharging or air supercharging, rendering them susceptible to premature detonation. One way to increase the octane rating is to use additives such as tetraethyl lead (TEL). However, due to environmental and health problems resulting from the release of lead in combustion, use thereof is being limited in accordance with ASTM D910-17a, and formulations of unleaded aviation gasoline are being developed. For this, components with a high capacity to withstand compression without detonation, such as triptane (2,2,3-trimethylbutane), are required.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The literature shows that the composition of gasolines with triptane makes it possible to substantially increase the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) with gains in power and efficiency before premature detonation, with unleaded triptane being superior to leaded isooctane under the conditions studied. It is reported that, with aviation gasoline containing the same octane rating of 100 and 60 vol % triptane, it was possible to obtain 2500 hp in an airplane engine, compared to 1500 hp with normal 100-octane aviation gasoline without triptane (C. F. Kettering, &#x201c;Effect of molecular structure of fuels on power and efficiency of internal combustion engines,&#x201d; <i>Ind. Eng. Chem. </i>36 (1944) 1079-1085).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to make this strategy viable, the prior art describes several compositions with triptane. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,485,897 describes a mixture of triptane with cyclopentane to obtain gasoline in which the compound contains at least 25 vol % triptane and 75% cyclopentane.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Given the difficulty in obtaining triptane, gasoline formulations containing less and less triptane have been proposed in the prior art. U.S. Pat. No. 7,897,034 describes a tetraethyl lead-free aviation gasoline formulation containing up to 10% triptane. Similarly, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,833,295, 8,232,437, and 8,536,389 describe gasoline formulations containing at least 5 vol % triptane or 2,2,3-trimethylpentane.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The usefulness of a triptane production method for use in Otto cycle fuel formulations is thus clear from the prior art. As will be apparent from the multiplicity of techniques described below, various attempts have been made to produce the component on a large scale.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The prior art describes a method for producing triptane by reacting pinacolone with methyl magnesium iodide in the Grignard reaction in order to transform the ketone into alcohol, followed by dehydration and hydrogenation (J. P. Wibaut, H. Hoog, S. L. Langedijk, J. Overhoff, J. Smittenberg, &#x201c;A study on the preparation and the physical constants of a number of alkanes and cycloalkanes,&#x201d; <i>Receuil des Travaux Chimiques des Pays</i>-<i>Bas </i>58(4): 329-377, 1939).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the same vein, documents U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,417,119, 2,453,144, and Miller and Lovell (V. Miller, W. Lovell, &#x201c;Methylation of olefins with methyl chloride,&#x201d; <i>Industrial Eng Chem. </i>40 (1948) 1138-1150) describe the production of triptane by means of olefin methylation with methyl chloride in the presence of metal oxide (CaO) in order to capture chlorine. The mentioned production route requires a specific olefin (2,3-dimethyl-2-butene) with one methylation, or it is possible to start from 2-methyl-2-butene with two methylations.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, despite the detailed description of triptane production methods, there are many limiting factors in these documents, including the limited availability of the specific C5= or C6= olefin (trimethylethylene or tetramethylethylene) and the use of chloromethane and CaO, solid, as reagents.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the same sense, similar processes involving halogenation and chlorinated compounds are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,404,927 and 2,404,537, but the use of halogenated compounds is industrially undesirable.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another method that is described in the prior art is the hydrodemethylation of C8 isoparaffin, obtained from the heavy alcoholic fraction, as dictated by U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,422,670, 2,422,671, 2,422,672, 2,422,674, 2,422,675, and Haensel and Ypatieff (V. Haensel, V. Ipatieff, &#x201c;Selective demethylation of paraffin hydrocarbons,&#x201d; <i>Industrial Eng. Chem. </i>39 (1947) 853-857). On account of the exothermicity, consideration has been given to removing heat with water, as the U.S. Pat. No. 2,436,923 teaches, but reformation reactions of the methane that is produced also occur, and the possibility of temperature excursions is not eliminated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Still in relation to the production of triptane, additional methodologies involve the isomerization of streams with seven carbons. However, the equilibrium only favors triptane at low temperatures, preferably below 0&#xb0; C. In these methods, isomerization under low-temperature conditions can be catalyzed with superacids, either homogeneous or heterogeneous, as is taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,583,739 and 7,332,638. Although the aforementioned method presents an alternative for obtaining triptane, the low yield and the issues involved in the recovery and deactivation of catalysts make it unattractive industrially.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an alternative methodology to those described in the prior art, it is desirable to produce triptene via the oligomerization of isobutene with propylene followed by hydrogenation to triptane, as is taught by Ypatieff et al. and Ypatieff and Schaad (V. N. Ipatieff, H. Pines, B. S. Friedman, &#x201c;Reaction of propene with isoolefins in the presence of sulfuric acid,&#x201d; <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>61 (1939) 1825-1826; V. N. Ipatieff, R. E. Schaad, &#x201c;Heptenes and heptanes from propylene and butylenes,&#x201d; <i>Ind. Eng. Chem. </i>37 (1945) 362-364). However, the reaction produces a low yield of only 3% triptene. Even with catalysts other than sulfuric acid, such as phosphoric acid, dimethylpentenes are preferably formed, as is taught in documents U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,651,168, 3,586,729, Klerk (A. de Klerk, &#x201c;Key catalyst types for the efficient refining of Fischer-Tropsch syncrude: alumina and phosphoric acid,&#x201d; <i>Catalysis </i>(23), 2011), and Cao et al. (G. Cao, A. Viola, R. Baratti, M. Morbidelli, L. Sanseverino, M. Cruccu, &#x201c;Lumped kinetic model for propene&#x2014;butene mixtures; oligomerization on a supported phosphoric acid catalyst,&#x201d; <i>Applied Catalysis </i>41 (1988) 301-312).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The alkylation reaction of isobutane with propylene could be a candidate for producing triptane. It is known, however, that in the industrial process of alkylation with HF or H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, the primary products are 2,3- and 2,4-dimethyl-pentanes, as is taught by Eisele and Killpack (P. Eisele, R. Kilipack, <i>ULLMANN'S Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry</i>-<i>Propene</i>. vol. 30, (2013) p. 281), Asinger (Asinger, F., <i>Mono</i>-<i>Olefins: Chemistry and Technology</i>, Pergamon Press, 1968), and Albright (Albright, L. F. et al.; <i>Industrial and Laboratory Alkylations</i>, ACS Symposium Series, A C S, 1977).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Likewise, the use of zeolitic catalysts in the alkylation of isobutane with propylene results in triptane contents of less than or equal to 0.1%, as is taught by Cardona et al. (F. Cardona, N. S. Gnep, G. Szabo, P. Nascimento, &#x201c;Reactions involved in the alkylation of isobutane with 2-butene and with propene on a USHY zeolite,&#x201d; 128 (1995) 243-257). This is due to the fact that the formation of triptane through alkylation of isobutane with propylene is thermodynamically unfavorable, requiring pressures of 200 to 300 bar and temperatures of above 400&#xb0; C. in order to achieve yields in the range of 10% using chlorinated compounds, brominated compounds, or CO<sub>2 </sub>as catalysts, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,407,584.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The subsequently published documents U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,492,984, 3,969,427, 4,059,646, 4,059,647, and 7,642,392 teach the homologation reaction of methanol or dimethyl ether (DME) for the production of triptane in Zn halides and other metals. Likewise, due to the difficulties with routes involving hydrated fused salts (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, ZnI<sub>2</sub>, etc.), a heterogeneous homologation route via acid catalysis was sought, as is described in WO/PCT/2009063177, WO/PCT/2009063178, U.S. Pat. No. 7,825,287, and Ahn et al. (J. H. Ahn, B. Temei, E. Iglesia. &#x201c;Selective homologation routes to 2,2,3-trimethyibutane on solid acids,&#x201d; <i>Angewandte Chemie Int. Ed. </i>48 (2009) 3814-3816).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Attempts have also been made to add larger compounds to the chain, such as (intermediate) iC4, aided by an additional dehydrogenation function in the catalyst, in order to accelerate the methanol (and DME) homologation reaction, as is taught by Farberow et al. (C. A. Farberow, S. Cheah, S. Kim, J. T. Miller, J. R. Gallagher, J. E. Hensley, J. A. Schaidle, D. A. Ruddy, &#x201c;Exploring low-temperature dehydrogenation at ionic Cu sites in beta zeolite to enable alkane recycle in dimethyl ether homologation, <i>ACS Catal. </i>7 (2017) 3662-3667).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, there are still unresolved issues inherent to the use of acid catalysts in homologation, primarily in relation to product degradation and catalyst deactivation, limiting the application of this method to date.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">From this perspective, the alcohol coupling reaction, or Guerbet reaction, used in the present invention is a type of carbon-carbon chain construction that does not have the drawbacks of acid catalysis. Such an alcohol coupling reaction, as is taught by Veibel and Nielsen (Veibel, S.; Nielsen, J. I. (1967), &#x201c;On the mechanism of the Guerbet reaction,&#x201d; <i>Tetrahedron, </i>23(4), 1723-1733), takes place in steps of dehydrogenation of alcohol hydroxyls to carbonyls plus 2 H<sub>2</sub>, generating primary alcohols, aldehydes, and secondary alcohols, ketones. The dehydrogenation products of said alcohols react with one another in aldol condensation, with elimination of water. Then the unsaturated ketone (enone) formed is hydrogenated, resulting in the higher-chain Guerbet alcohol. In a Guerbet reaction catalyst, both dehydrogenating/hydrogenating and basic functions are required in order to achieve aldol condensation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Guerbet alcohols, which result from the coupling of alcohols, are primary or secondary, although most alcohols produced from primary adducts also result in primary alcohols, and the properties conferred by the branched structure of the alcohol enable them to find application in various industries in addition to the use thereof as solvents. In particular, the properties of the alcohol formed are: low toxicity, liquid at extremely low temperatures, low volatility, good lubricant, good oxidative stability, excellent initial color, biodegradability, inter alia, as is taught by OLenick (OLenick, A. J. (2001), &#x201c;Guerbet chemistry,&#x201d; <i>Journal of Surfactants and Detergents, </i>4(3), 311-315).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As mentioned, alcohols from the alcohol coupling reaction, or Guerbet reaction, can be formed by combining alcohols from different chains, as is shown in documents U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,050,788, 3,479,412, 5,493,064, and 7,705,192. Still in relation to the foregoing, diols can also be reacted with one another or with more alcohols, resulting in even larger chain sizes, as is explained by U.S. Pat. No. 7,119,125.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Aldol condensation is a reversible, endothermic, and equilibrium-limited reaction. Under the conditions usually employed in the prior art, it takes place with high selectivity. The presence of a hydrogenating function in the Guerbet catalyst plus excess H<sub>2 </sub>helps the condensation reaction by hydrogenating the enone resulting from the aldol condensation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this scenario, it is worth noting that the Guerbet reactions typically develop at temperatures of greater than 200&#xb0; C., in the range of 200 to 300&#xb0; C., and the operating pressure is up to 200 bar.

Catalysts usually combine the hydrogenating and acidic function, in which the alcohol is dehydrated and subsequently hydrogenated, or the function of the direct hydrodeoxygenation of the alcohols and carbonyls, both in an H<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0068">Still in relation to this feature of the invention, the mixture of triptanol with triptanal resulting from the alcohol coupling reaction described herein is sent to the HDO stage, preferably resulting in triptane. Depending on the catalyst and the hydrodeoxygenation conditions, the formations of triptene or triptane are promoted.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0069">As an alternative to HDO, deoxygenation&#x2014;i.e., the transformation of triptanol and triptanal into triptane and/or triptene&#x2014;can be achieved by two sequential steps: dehydration of the alcohol with an acid catalyst to triptene, and the final hydrogenation step of triptene to triptane in the presence of a hydrogenating catalyst.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0070">A hydrogenation step may be required prior to dehydration in which triptanal is hydrogenated to triptanol for the purpose of dehydration. However, a hydrodeoxygenation catalyst (HDO) is preferably used which is capable of hydrogenation or carbonyl removal and performing hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) by direct route.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0071">With regard to the Guerbet and HDO reactions, the coupling step and the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) can occur in the same reactor or in different reactors. These are preferably carried out in different reactors, with recovery of unreacted methanol, neohexanol, and neohexal in the Guerbet reaction step and recycling thereof to the Guerbet reactor.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0072">During the Guerbet reaction step, the coupling reaction of neohexanol with itself may occur in addition to the reaction with methanol, producing heavy-branched alcohol; this is avoided by using higher proportions of methanol or precursors.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0073">Still in relation to the methanol content per reaction, it is noteworthily higher than the stoichiometric&#x2014;at least 2 mol of methanol per mol of neohexanol.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0074">Furthermore, the methanol/neohexanol ratio is at least 3:1 mol:mol, more preferably in the range of 9:1 mol:mol, the selectivity being greater in the ratio of 12:1 mol of methanol to mol of neohexanol. Higher levels of methanol beyond the 12:1 mol:mol ratio have no beneficial effect, probably due to the dilution of the neohexanol.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0075">Hydrogenolysis of methanol to CO and 2H<sub>2 </sub>also occurs during the Guerbet reaction. Also, a portion of the CO reacts with H<sub>2</sub>O, the reaction product forming CO<sub>2 </sub>and more H<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0076">It was also found that, for the claimed catalysts, methanol can be produced in situ in the Guerbet reaction step from CO and hydrogen, CO<sub>2 </sub>and hydrogen, or a mixture of the two. Mixtures of CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2 </sub>gases can still be combined with methanol in the reactor feed. More preferably, CO and CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2 </sub>effluent gases from the Guerbet reaction step are fed back to the Guerbet reactor.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0077">In addition to methanol, formaldehyde can also be fed to the reactor, since it is the intermediate of the reaction produced by the dehydrogenation of methanol. However, the use of methanol and/or the combination thereof with synthesis gas (CO and H<sub>2</sub>) are preferred, since formaldehyde can polymerize, obstructing access to catalyst sites. Under the claimed conditions of the present invention, the chemical equilibrium calculation indicates that the amount of formaldehyde formed is small, and the absence of formaldehyde in the analysis of the product indicates that it reacts rapidly.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0078">The hydrogenolysis reaction of methanol to CO and H<sub>2 </sub>is endothermic, whereas the synthesis reaction of methanol from CO and H<sub>2 </sub>is exothermic. Therefore, the combination of methanol with synthesis gas (CO and H<sub>2</sub>) in the charge imparts an additional advantage to the method, since it reduces the need to supply heat in order to achieve the reaction conditions, making the temperature profile in the reactor nearly isothermal, thereby promoting the alcohol coupling reaction.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0079">Thus, the Guerbet reaction can be fed either by mixtures of CO and H<sub>2 </sub>or CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2 </sub>or a mixture of the two, or by methanol or a mixture of the gases. The presence of H<sub>2 </sub>has an effect on the methanol synthesis reaction when the feedstock contains CO (synthesis gas). If CO<sub>2 </sub>is used as a reagent, higher levels of H<sub>2 </sub>are required for hydrogenation.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0080">The CO when hydrogenated to methanol requires the consumption of two H<sub>2 </sub>molecules. Otherwise, three H<sub>2 </sub>molecules are required in order for CO<sub>2 </sub>to be hydrogenated to methanol. The alcohol coupling reaction occurs with compounds containing a carbon as reactants, either methanol or mixtures of H<sub>2 </sub>and CO or CO<sub>2 </sub>or even formaldehyde, provided that there are adequate conditions for the formation of methanol and, in turn, formaldehyde.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0081">The methanol synthesis reaction can be carried out in a reactor that is different from the Guerbet reactor prior to mixing with neohexanol. Likewise, methanol synthesis can also occur in situ, parallel to the alcohol coupling reaction.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0082">Catalysts used in the coupling of alcohols have a basic function and a hydrogenating/dehydrogenating function. The reaction is thus carried out at temperatures of greater than 150&#xb0; C., preferably greater than 200&#xb0; C., more preferably greater than 300&#xb0; C. Temperatures of greater than 450&#xb0; C. are unnecessary and lead to increased formation of secondary reactions, although temperatures up to 550&#xb0; C. can be used. The Guerbet reaction thus takes place at temperatures in the range of 150&#xb0; C.-550&#xb0; C., preferably 150&#xb0; C.-450&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0083">It is also noteworthy that the coupling reactions of alcohols develop at pressures of greater than 5 bar, preferably greater than 10 bar, more preferably greater than 20 bar, and less than 100 bar. Pressures of greater than 60 bar lead to smaller gains and are not preferred conditions, although pressures of up to 200 bar can be used. The greater the pressure, the greater the thermodynamic favoring of the alcohol coupling reaction.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0084">Temperature and pressure are correlated, since higher pressures disfavor dehydrogenation, and higher temperatures are necessary in order to maintain the same level of dehydrogenation. Very low pressures result in a need to increase the reaction time, however.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0085">It should therefore be emphasized that the conditions described in this invention are ideal for the coupling of alcohols between neohexanol and methanol, resulting in triptanol and triptanal.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0086">Various forms of contact between the catalyst and the reactants are possible in the present invention. Batch mixed reactors, continuous mixing reactors (CSTR), batch or continuous reactors with homogeneous catalysts or, preferably, continuous reactors with heterogeneous catalysts can be used.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0087">In the present invention, the use of heterogeneous catalysts facilitates the separation of the products from the catalyst. Since the proportions between basic and hydrogenating functions are such that the catalyst deactivation is small, the preferred form of contact between the reactants and the catalyst is through reaction, with the catalyst in a fixed bed with impinged flow. Other continuous reactor setups, such as slurry beds or fluidized beds, are possible, but they do not have advantages over the preferred method of continuous fixed-bed reaction. Furthermore, homogeneous catalysts (basic catalyst) and heterogeneous catalysts (hydrogenation/dehydrogenation catalyst) can be combined.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0088">For a continuous fixed-bed reaction, feed volumes (mixture of neohexanol and methanol) processed per unit time per reactor volume (LHSV) are typically 0.1 to 10 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.

Without limiting the claims to an understanding of the mechanism of action of hydrogen, the hypothesis is that the presence of hydrogen keeps the catalyst partially reduced, promoting the evaporation and hydrogenation of reactive intermediates, such as enone, which could lead to the formation of coke in the catalyst.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0091">Not counting the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) required for the synthesis of methanol, when mixtures of CO and/or CO<sub>2 </sub>are used in the Guerbet reactor with additional H<sub>2</sub>, the molar ratio of H<sub>2 </sub>is between 0 and 10 mol H<sub>2</sub>/mol neohexanol, and preferably between 0 and 5 mol H<sub>2</sub>/mol neohexanol, more preferably 0 to 2 mol H<sub>2</sub>/mol neohexanol. Preferably, hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is not necessary, but it can be used for heating the reactor bed and for activation in order to remove adsorbed CO<sub>2 </sub>under the conditions in which the Guerbet catalyst is prepared.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0092">The Guerbet reaction produces H<sub>2</sub>O as a byproduct. OH<sub>2</sub>O can also react with methanol and CO in a water-gas-shift reaction, resulting in more H<sub>2 </sub>and forming CO<sub>2</sub>, which is the origin thereof in the effluent gas from the Guerbet reaction. Metals with hydrogenating/dehydrogenating capacity are known to catalyze these reactions. As is known in the prior art, various reactions can occur starting from methanol, the primary ones being methanol to dimethyl ether and methanol to formaldehyde, which can, in turn, react to methyl formate, which decomposes to CO<sub>2 </sub>and methane or CO and H<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0093">It is known in the prior art that Copper (Cu) is a catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO and CO<sub>2 </sub>to methanol, primarily if promoted by ZnO. Other active metals for the reaction include Fe, Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ru, among others. It was thus found in the present invention that the claimed Guerbet reaction catalysts also have activity for in situ methanol synthesis.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0094">In addition to 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (neohexanol), 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanone (neohexal) can be used as a reagent. Neohexal is the intermediate of the alcohol coupling reaction obtained from the dehydrogenation of neohexanol. Neohexal can be formed in a separate reactor prior to contact with methanol. Neohexanol can be dehydrogenated under conditions similar to the alcohol coupling reaction, preferably in lower pressure conditions.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0095">In the event that the neohexanol is dehydrogenated prior to the Guerbet reaction, the same catalyst of the Guerbet reaction with a hydrogenating/dehydrogenating function can be used, but a catalyst with lower basicity, more preferably without basicity, is preferably used. Even more preferably, the catalyst has neither acidity (which could form ethers or dehydrate the alcohol to olefin) nor basicity (which could result in Guerbet alcohols as a result of the condensation of two molecules of neohexanol).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0096">In general, when neohexanol is dehydrogenated prior to the coupling reaction, the preferred conditions are reduced pressure and higher temperatures in order to effect the dehydrogenation.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0097">By comparison, when alcohols are used as reagents, higher pressure conditions are preferable for alcohol coupling (Guerbet reaction) and the formation of Guerbet alcohols, this being taught in the method described in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0098">Preferably, unreacted neohexal and neohexanol are separated from the product after the alcohol coupling reaction and recycled together or separately. Distillation is one of the primary ways of separating neohexal and neohexanol from alcohol coupling reaction products. If a previous reactor is used for the neohexanol dehydrogenation step, the unreacted neohexanol is fed to this reactor, and the neohexal is fed directly to the alcohol coupling reactor.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0099">In addition to methanol, it is possible in the alcohol coupling reaction described above to use formaldehyde, which is an intermediate in the reaction that is obtained from the dehydrogenation of methanol. Formaldehyde is obtained industrially from the dehydrogenation of methanol and, more commonly, from the oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0100">The conditions for obtaining formaldehyde typically involve higher temperatures and lower pressures than those employed in the alcohol coupling reaction of the present invention. Furthermore, the consumption of H<sub>2 </sub>produced in the dehydrogenation by reaction with oxygen (oxidative dehydrogenation) usually favors the production of formaldehyde. Under typical conditions of the invention, the expected amount of formaldehyde is thus reduced.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0101">Despite the ease of obtaining formaldehyde, the use of methanol is preferred, since formaldehyde is quite reactive and tends to polymerize in aqueous solutions, forming poly(oxymethylene) glycols.

Preferably, a portion of the gas can be purged and the H<sub>2 </sub>fed in order to maintain the ratio between H<sub>2 </sub>and CO at 2 mol:1 mol. More preferably, there is a recycle compressor for recompressing the product gas and returning it to the reaction. There is also preferably injection of methanol and/or H<sub>2 </sub>and gas purging, if necessary, in order to maintain continuous reactor operating conditions with the desired excess of methanol and/or methanol precursors.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0103">Regarding the catalysts used in the alcohol coupling reaction, it should be noted that they can be selected from among: homogeneous catalysts, salts, hydroxides, and alkoxides, preferably associated with hydrogenating/dehydrogenating catalysis functions, homogeneous or not. Preferably, heterogeneous catalysts are used; more preferably, a metal with hydrogenating/dehydrogenating function is used on a basic support, or on a support containing a basic component.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0104">The basic supports or components can be selected from among oxides, hydroxides, phosphates, carbonates, carbides of elements of group IA and IIA, alkali metals, and/or alkaline earth metals such as K, Na, Ca, Cs, Sr, Ba, and Rb. In addition, a basic component or a mixture of components, such as mixed oxides, are used.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0105">Alternatively, supports such as aluminas, silicas, or zeolites doped with basic components such as K, Ca, or Mg, usually as oxides (K<sub>2</sub>O, CaO), can be used.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0106">Furthermore, with regard to the supports themselves, these can be basic, such as alkaline earth metal oxides, such as MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO, and rare earth oxides such as CeO, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Besides Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, other oxides that lend themselves to the present invention as a support are ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZnO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, MoO<sub>3</sub>, and ThO<sub>2</sub>, which can also be dual-component oxides such as ZnO&#x2014;Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgO&#x2014;TiO<sub>2</sub>. In general, alkali metal ions are used which are supported on alumina, silica, and the abovementioned oxides, primarily alkaline earth metal oxides. The ions are primarily employed as oxides but can be non-oxides such as KF and KCl supported on alumina, and lanthanide imides and nitrides.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0107">Basic zeolites can also be used as basic supports and may have alkaline ions due to ion exchange, such as Na&#x2014;X, Cs&#x2014;X, or they may have added alkali, as in the case of CS<sub>2</sub>O/CS&#x2014;X. Other possibilities are the above-mentioned zeolites exchanged with basic metals, transition metals, rare earths, higher-valence oxides.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0108">Other basic supports are basic clays and clay minerals such as limestone, dolomite, magnesite, chrysolite, sepiolite, olivine, and hydrotalcite.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0109">With regard to hydrotalcites, they are lamellar double hydroxides, where a divalent cation (such as Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga) is combined with a trivalent metal (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, La), plus a compensation anion between the lamellae. Hydrotalcite can also be doped with additional metal. Hydrotalcites can be calcined or non-calcined, resulting in mixed oxides and spinels, depending on the condition.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0110">Another version of the present invention are the hydroxyapatites, used as basic catalysts. Perovskites, beta-aluminas, hydroxides, and metallic carbonates in general can also be used. Other supports are metal or supported nitrides, nitrates, sulfides, sulfates, carbides, phosphates and fluorides; activated and impregnated carbons; anion exchange resins; organic bases supported on microporous or mesoporous metal oxides; in general, solid or supported alkalis and alkaline earth metals or basic organometallics. However, the invention is not limited to the nature of the component that confers the basic function used in the Guerbet catalyst, it being possible to fulfill the same basic function in the reaction with different basic compounds.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0111">On the same topic, another support, alumina, especially gamma-alumina, has become an alternative due to the fact that, despite its unwanted intrinsic acidity, it has a good surface area and pore distribution, in addition to having adequate properties for being doped with alkali metals and/or alkaline earth metals such as K, Na, Ca, Cs, or Rb.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0112">In addition to the basic components used in the catalyst, nitrogen compounds can be used in solution, in the charge, under the reaction conditions. Nitrogen compounds are selected from among but not limited to amines, ammonia, basic nitrogens. The component used is preferably ammonia, or any nitrogenous compound that minimizes the parallel reactions involving the dehydration of alcohols and the formation of ethers. Without limiting the present invention to a hypothesis concerning the inhibition of the dehydration and etherification reactions, it is assumed that nitrogenates and ammonia compete with the reactants for remaining acidic sites, inhibiting the undesired side reactions of dehydration and etherification. Ammonia or nitrogen can be added to the feed, resulting in a nitrogen content of 0 to 5000 ppm.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0113">The hydrogenating/dehydrogenating function of the catalyst used in the alcohol coupling reaction (Guerbet reaction) can be transition metals, specifically from group VB, VIB, VIIIB, IB, such as V, Cr, Mo, W, Fe, Ru, Rh, Re, Co, Ni, Cu, Ag, Sn, Pb, Zn, Mn, Pt, and Pd, alone or in combination. Preferably, the metals are Cu and/or Ni. Metals may or may not be promoted by other metals such as Zn. Metals can be present as oxides, hydroxides, salts, or reduced. The aforementioned metals can still be present as a homogeneous catalyst system, supported or unsupported.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0114">It is also possible to use a mixture of different catalysts, including a basic solid and a hydrogenating catalyst. More preferably, the basic and hydrogenating functions are combined in the same catalyst. The basic function may also be present as a homogeneous or heterogeneous catalyst, and the hydrogenating/dehydrogenating function may likewise be present in a homogeneous or heterogeneous form, it being possible to have a homogeneous basic phase with a supported hydrogenating catalyst or a heterogeneous basic phase and a homogeneous hydrogenating function. However, the preferred catalyst combines the two functions in the same heterogeneous catalyst.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0115">In a particular aspect of the invention, the catalyst is Cu deposited on potassium-doped gamma-alumina. Said catalyst is prepared so as to preferably contain Cu(I) copper species, with more activity for the alcohol coupling reaction than fully reduced copper, Cu(0). Cu(I) can be prepared using precursors such as CuCl<sub>2</sub>, which reduces CuCl when reacted with KOH on the catalyst surface. The preferred method of catalyst preparation is to impregnate ethanolic CuCl<sub>2 </sub>solution in alumina, and after calcination, to impregnate KOH solution, followed by final calcination.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0116">Another related aspect relates to the fact that Cu catalysts in ZnO and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>mixtures are effective, primarily for the hydrogenation of CO (and CO<sub>2</sub>) to methanol. To wit, ZnO combined with K or another basic component potentiates the formation of Cu(I) at the expense of divalent or reduced copper.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0117">In order for the reaction described in this method to operate under optimal conditions, the Cu content in the catalyst is at least 1% by weight, preferably greater than 2% by weight and less than 10% by weight, and preferably in the range of 5% by weight. Likewise, the KOH content in the alumina is from 5% to 30% by weight, preferably greater than 10% by weight, and in a preferred aspect, equal to 20% by weight. Contents of greater than 30% by weight lead to pore occlusion and an exacerbated decrease in the catalyst surface area.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0118">In addition to the preferential use of Cu, another metal can be used together with Cu to potentiate the dehydrogenation and methanol activation reactions, including but not limited to Pd, Pt, Fe.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0119">It should also be noted that the Guerbet reactions are thermodynamically limited. One way to promote an increase in the conversion of neohexanol is to work under conditions which are such that part of the triptanol is converted into triptanal, thereby increasing the conversion of neohexanol. This can be achieved with higher temperatures, more active catalyst, longer residence time of the reactants in the reactor (shorter LHSV), among other procedures that are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0120">Unreacted neohexanol and neohexal can be separated from the reaction products and fed back to the Guerbet reaction step. It is also possible to partially hydrogenate and dehydrate them before separation. Since triptanol is an alcohol with a more branched molecule, it can be more easily dehydrated than neohexanol. Furthermore, it is possible to promote the conversion of triptanol and triptanal to triptene and triptane without substantially converting neohexanol to neohexene and corresponding paraffins, because substantial differences exist between the boiling point of triptane and neohexanol, which facilitates separation.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0121">In addition to triptanol and the dehydrogenation product thereof, triptanal, other byproducts can also be formed in the reaction, such as methyl ether (dimethyl ether), triptanol methyl ester, or neohexanol, and ethers such as triptanol methyl ether or neohexanol, and dehydration products of neohexanol and triptanol.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0122">Part of these byproducts&#x2014;the ethers and esters&#x2014;can be reused through the hydrolysis reaction. The hydrolysis is carried out by reacting ether with water in an acid catalyst, such as an acidic ion exchange resin or acid catalysts that are known in the art. For hydrolysis, it is necessary to feed water to the hydrolysis reactor at least in stoichiometric proportions.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0123">Alternatively, direct recycling of the ethers can be performed, or the remaining ethers can be mixed and reacted with alcohols in the Guerbet reactor. In this particular case, it may be of interest to feed H<sub>2</sub>O to the reaction charge, although the Guerbet reaction itself produces water. Optionally, water can be fed to the Guerbet reactor charge also in order to reduce the etherification and dehydration reactions.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0124">Since, in ideal reaction conditions, an excess of methanol is used in relation to the stoichiometric value, it is important to separate the same for later reuse in the reaction described in the present invention. It should be noted that the presence of methanol in the hydrodeoxygenation step can lead to the hydrogenation thereof to methane, resulting in unnecessary consumption of hydrogen. Methanol can be recovered either through distillation or extraction.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0125">Still in relation to the recovery of methanol, it can be performed using the liquid-liquid extraction method, since triptanol and triptanal are less soluble in water, so the heavy alcohols remain in the organic phase while the methanol passes on to the aqueous phase. Typical amounts of water relative to the organic phase content are 0.1 to 5 times, preferably 0.5 to 2 times the volume of the organic phase, more preferably a 0.1 to 1 ratio of aqueous phase to organic phase by volume. Extraction can occur in only one contact equilibrium stage, or it can preferably occur in a counterstream in more than one separation stage. The water can be added later to the Guerbet reactor, or it can be present in the Guerbet reactor charge.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0126">Methanol can be reallocated in the form of an aqueous solution to the Guerbet reaction, or it can be separated from the water prior to the reaction by distillation. The aqueous methanol solution can also be mixed with dimethyl ether and sent to a hydrolysis reactor to increase methanol recovery, with a decrease in the water content that is consumed in the reaction.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0127">The separation of alcohols and the hydrolysis of ethers can still be combined in order to preferably recycle the unreacted alcohols by using catalytic distillation with acid catalyst in distillation portions.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0128">Preferably, the methanol is removed after the alcohol coupling reaction (Guerbet) and recycled to the initial step of said reaction. The reaction product gas is likewise returned to the initial reaction step. Triptane is thus obtained in two reactors in sequence, the first with the Guerbet reaction, and the second with the conversion of triptanol and triptanal to triptane through the hydrodeoxygenation reaction (HDO).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0129">It is also noteworthy that the hydrodeoxygenation reaction (HDO) can be a combination of dehydration and hydrogenation reactions, in which case the acid function and the hydrogenating function are located in the same catalyst. Alternatively, a direct HDO catalyst is used. For the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) step, the presence of hydrogen is necessary for the conversion of triptanal to triptanol, as well as for the hydrogenation of triptene to triptane.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0130">Without the intermediate removal of excess methanol after the Guerbet reaction, it could be converted either into dimethyl ether (by the acidic function in the catalyst) or hydrogenated to methane, with both reactions also generating water. Likewise, the CO and CO<sub>2 </sub>effluent gases from the first reaction can also be converted to methane in the HDO step.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0131">Thus, the gas containing H<sub>2</sub>, CO, and CO<sub>2 </sub>from the alcohol coupling reaction (Guerbet reaction) is preferably returned to the Guerbet reaction, with H<sub>2 </sub>being added to maintain a desired molar ratio of methanol and methanol precursors. Also, it may be necessary to purge part of the gas to avoid accumulation of inerts (light hydrocarbons, primarily methane) formed in the reaction. The methane and light gases formed in the reaction can be sent to a synthesis gas/methanol production unit.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0132">Although it is possible to use two different catalyst beds in the same reactor, one for the alcohol coupling reaction (Guerbet reaction) and another for the hydrodeoxygenation reaction (HDO), it is preferable to have different reactors for each stage. In a preferred aspect of the present invention, unreacted methanol and product gas are separated after the alcohol coupling step and prior to the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction step.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0133">Still under the claimed conditions of the present invention, the conversion of neohexanol is greater than 75%, more commonly greater than 90%. In these terms, neohexanol and neohexal can be separated through distillation reactions and returned to the alcohol coupling reactor or Guerbet reactor.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0134">In another aspect of the invention, once the mixture of triptanol and triptanal is obtained from the Guerbet reactor, such components can be used for purposes other than the production of triptane and/or triptene, with the obtaining of triptanol and triptanal being one of the embodiments of the present invention. Triptanol can be further dehydrogenated in order to increase the yield of triptanone.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0135">For the subsequent hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction, commercially available catalysts such as hydrotreating catalysts, Mo or W sulfides are commonly used, promoted by Ni or Co, and supported on solids such as alumina, silicas, silica-aluminas, zeolites, hydrotalcites, mixed oxides, spinels, MgO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO, CeO<sub>2</sub>, phosphates, sulfonic resins, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, sulfated Zr, carbon, activated carbon, inter alia.

However, the direct mechanism of hydrodeoxygenation is preferred.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0141">One class of commercially available catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction are the hydrotreating (HDT) catalysts of petroleum fractions. They are generally Mo or W sulfides that are promoted by Co or Ni, preferably Ni, when greater hydrogenation of triptene to triptane is desired.
