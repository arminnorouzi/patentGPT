Pizza ovens come in different configurations such as wood-fired brick ovens, electric ovens and gas ovens such that pizza is cooked on either stone or a flat surface which has been heated by either a wood source, electric source or gas source. Most configurations require the pizza to be manually turned as it cooks due to the stone or regions in the oven not being heated evenly. This results in having to be very attentive to manually rotating the pizza within the oven while cooking the pizza. As a result, many pizza ovens provide automatic movement, such as a rotating cooking surface, within the pizza oven to control the baking process and to minimize the concern of unevenly cooking the pizza in the oven. However, dynamic parts within an oven are more susceptible to breaking-down over time. As such, it would be advantageous for a pizza oven to incorporate structure that minimizes the hot-spots and uneven cooking within a pizza oven without the need of an automatic rotating cooking surface.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is directed to various embodiments of an oven type outdoor cooking system.
