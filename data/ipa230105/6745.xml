These two nodes are typically spaced from a few hundred meters up to several kilometers. Each node comprises link equipment, such as an antenna, a radio for frequency up- and down-conversion, and a modem for digital signal processing, used for transmission and reception of microwave signals over the point-to-point wireless microwave links.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Point-to-point wireless microwave links are sometimes subjected to disturbances. Such disturbances affect the received signal power and quality. This might trigger alarms that are sent to the network operator. When a network operator suspects that the link equipment is not working properly, a common response is to make a site visit (i.e., to send maintenance personnel to inspect the link equipment). Such a site visit sometimes results in the link equipment, or at least part thereof, being shipped back to the manufacturer for maintenance, or even replacement.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been found during inspections that a significant fraction of the link equipment sent back to the manufacturer in fact does not suffer from impaired operation and no faults are found. This indicates that resources, such as time and money, might be saved if network operators are provided with more accurate feedback about their network equipment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In turn, it might be challenging to separate different types of operating conditions which cause the same type of performance degradation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hence, there is still a need for improved identification of the operating conditions of point-to-point wireless microwave links.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of embodiments herein is to provide efficient identification of the operating conditions of point-to-point wireless microwave links.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect there is presented a method for classifying microwave link data of a microwave system comprising a point-to-point wireless microwave link.

In some embodiments, the signal quality measurement values are measured after demodulation. In some embodiments, the signal quality measurement values are given in terms of mean squared error (MSE) or error vector magnitude (EVM). Further, in some aspects a comparison of signal power is made before and after the digital channel filter in the receiver. In particular, in some embodiments, respective received signal values are obtained both before channel filtering and after channel filtering.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In general terms, interference from other microwave sources implies that the operation of a point-to-point wireless microwave link <b>110</b>, <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b </i>is disturbed by unwanted signals with overlap in the spectral domain with the wanted signal from the other link node. Such conditions might be difficult, or even impossible, to recognize by only observing the received power or power attenuation. For example, the received power might be flat over time in the presence of an interferer, and the operating condition of the point-to-point wireless microwave link <b>110</b>, <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>will hence appear as normal. On the other hand, even an interferer that is weak compared to the wanted signal might cause a visible degradation in terms of MSE.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to an embodiment, at least one of the operating conditions in the set of operating conditions thus pertain to the point-to-point wireless microwave link <b>110</b>, <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b </i>being affected by interference. Advantageously this enables detection of interference from other microwave links, as well as detection of interference from other radio transmitters, such as military equipment. The interference is classified to be either in-band, partly in-band, or out-of-band. In the case of the point-to-point wireless microwave link <b>110</b>, <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b </i>being affected by interference, the controller entity <b>200</b> might be enabled to determine whether the interferer is in-band, out-of-band, or in between (i.e., partly in-band), by considering how much the received power has increased compared to during normal conditions, and how much power is removed by channel filtering. Advantageously this enables detection of whether the interference is in-band, out-of-band, or partly in-band. Further details relating thereto will now be disclosed.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">When an interferer is fully in-band, the MSE will increase, and the equalizer response will not indicate any multipath, and the signal power before and after the channel filter will remain the same. Thus, according to an embodiment, the interference is classified to be in-band when the signal quality measurement values are degraded, and when, according to the equalizer tap values, there is no indication of multipath, and when the signal power values remain unchanged by the channel filtering.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the interferer is partly in-band, the MSE will increase, the equalizer response will not indicate any multipath, and a fraction of the additional received power (due to the interferer) will be removed by the channel filter. Thus, according to an embodiment, the interference is classified to be partly in-band when the signal quality measurement values are degraded, and when, according to the equalizer tap values, there is no indication of multipath, and when the signal power values decrease after channel filtering.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">When an interferer is fully out-of-band the MSE will be unchanged, the equalizer response will not indicate any multipath, and the measured signal power will drop after the channel filter.

According to an embodiment, there are at least three operating conditions in the set of operating conditions. One operating condition pertains to normal operation of the point-to-point wireless microwave link <b>110</b>, <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b. </i>At least two operating conditions pertain to performance degraded operation of the point-to-point wireless microwave link <b>110</b>, <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b. </i>Non-limiting illustrative examples of operating conditions and properties thereof are summarized next.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Normal operation: The transmission is not affected by any significant disturbances. The power attenuation, or received power, is essentially flat per each time window. The MSE is lower than (approximately) &#x2212;35 dB, the signal power before and after digital channel filter in the receiver is the same, and the impulse response of the equalizer filter resembles a spike.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Rain: The signal is attenuated because of scattering from precipitation. The power attenuation is increased. The received power decreases if the transmitted power remains constant. If the transmitted power is increased in order to compensate for the increased power attenuation, the received power remains constant if enough transmit power is available to fully compensate for the increase in attenuation, or decreases if the transmitter can only partially compensate for the increase in attenuation. The MSE may be degraded depending on the received power. The signal power before and after channel filtering is the same, and the impulse response of the equalizer filter should resemble a spike.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Intermittent obstruction: Objects in the signal path cause additional attenuation. The power attenuation, or received power, is varying over time. The MSE may be degraded depending on the received power. The signal power before and after channel filtering is the same, and the impulse response of the equalizer filter should resemble a spike.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Multipath propagation: Power fluctuations occur due to interference when signal energy propagates along different paths between the microwave signal transmitter <b>130</b><i>a, </i><b>130</b><i>b </i>and the microwave signal receiver <b>140</b><i>a, </i><b>140</b><i>b. </i>The power attenuation, or received power, is varying over time. The attenuation might be reduced compared to during normal operating conditions, if the signals taking different paths interfere constructively in the microwave signal receiver <b>140</b><i>a</i>, <b>140</b><i>b. </i>The signal power before and after channel filtering is the same. The impulse response of the equalizer filter depends on the multipath conditions but will have a broader response compared to during normal conditions. The MSE might be degraded even if the signal power is sufficient to achieve good performance during normal conditions. If data from both transmission directions is included, it is highly likely that the operating conditions for both transmission directions are the same.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Maintenance: The link is down or at very low power for more than 5 minutes.

The received power is reduced to comparatively very low levels for less than 5 minutes. Conversely, the power attenuation is increased to comparatively very high levels for less than 5 minutes.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Mast sway: The received power fluctuates due to sway of the site <b>150</b><i>a, </i><b>150</b><i>b. </i>The sway could be due to e.g. to wind load or mast bending due to heat. The power attenuation, or received power, is varying over time. The MSE might drop from its normal level depending on the received power. The signal power before and after channel filtering is the same, and the impulse response of the equalizer filter should resemble a spike.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Snow: The received power is reduced due to snow covering the microwave signal transmitter <b>130</b><i>a, </i><b>130</b><i>b </i>and/or the microwave signal receiver <b>140</b><i>a, </i><b>140</b><i>b. </i>The power attenuation, or received power, is varying over time. The MSE might drop from its normal level depending on the received power. The signal power before and after channel filtering is the same, and the impulse response of the equalizer filter should resemble a spike.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Vegetation: The received power is reduced due to season varying vegetation. Such as leaves or other type of foliage falling or snow covering trees or other types of foliage. The MSE might drop from its normal level depending on the received power.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Interference from other microwave links: The receive power should increase or be similar to that of normal operation. Conversely, the power attenuation should decrease or be similar to that of normal operation. The MSE increases from its normal level depending on the power and spectral content of the interfering signal. The signal power before and after channel filtering will be different if the interferer is located out-of-band or partly out-of-band. The equalizer response will resemble a spike. If data from both transmission directions is included, it is highly likely that the operating conditions are different from each other in the different transmission directions.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some aspects, the point-to-point wireless microwave link <b>110</b> has a forward direction and a reverse direction.
