More specifically, the present invention relates to methods and agents for the identification and/or tracking of biological materials using nucleic acid.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The food system has reached unprecedented levels of distribution efficiency and production output. This evolution has afforded great benefits to the public in the form of cost-reduction and variety; however, serious deficiencies remain which expose risk to public health, industry and innovation. Traceability is one of the primary techniques for the effective governance and management of these challenges.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The limitations of current food and beverage traceability systems are primarily exposed through contamination events. When these events occur, it may take months to trace the effected products to their source-of-origin. Clonally propagated products may add additional challenges to source-of-origin identification because they lack genetic variation. Transformed and mixed-item products may also be problematic for source-of-origin identification because they require that existing traceability best practices are followed throughout the supply chain. Shortcomings in the ability to promptly and affordably trace these products poses significant risk to consumer safety; have caused material financial losses for stakeholders; and resulted in profound damage to the reputation of effected industries.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) completed a 10 year-long initiative estimating the global burden of foodborne disease. This initiative found the &#x201c; . . . global burden of foodborne disease . . . was 33 (95% UI 25-46) million DALYs in 2010; 40% of the foodborne disease burden was among children under 5 years of age.&#x201d; (p. 11). DALY stands for disability adjusted life years. It can be thought of as one lost year of healthy life. The estimations made by this study were limited by data gaps. Improved surveillance and laboratory capacity were noted as required for more accurate estimation. Surveillance needs were further identified by the source attribution task force (SATF).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The SATF was among numerous task forces commissioned for this initiative. Their mandate was to estimate the effects of particular attribution points on disease transmission. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (adapted from WHO, 2015, p.101) illustrates major points of attribution. FERG, the reference group for this study, determined that for the purposes of the study, the most simple point-of-attribution is at the end of the transmission chain&#x2014;i.e. human contact. This simplicity is a property of the limitations of existing traceability practices. FERG also notes (p. 100) that for risk management, other points of attribution may be more appropriate&#x2014;e.g. primary production. FERG identifies surveillance for reservoir level attribution as desirable.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Modern techniques for food traceability in the food and beverage supply-chain typically begin with a grower's harvest or within a production facility. Products are often tracked at the case level&#x2014;a case contains many items. Occasionally a physical barcode is applied to each item. A Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) and Global Location Number (GLN) is ideally associated with a case. A Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) may be created for a pallet&#x2014;a collection of cases. These traceability techniques are typically prescribed by a standard, and for fresh food, that is often the GS1 Standard. As pallets make their way through the supply chain, the aforementioned identifiers found on barcodes are used in conjunction with key data elements (KDEs) recorded for critical tracking events (CTEs). A CTE might describe product disposition from a grower to a packer/shipper. There is a commonly used aphorism that suggests each supply-chain stakeholder should be able to trace a product &#x201c;one-step forward and one-step back&#x201d;. Unfortunately, that requirement has proven to be inadequate in many ways.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Once a food item reaches the point-of-sale, it may have been transformed or comingled with other items from disparate producers&#x2014;e.g. fruit salad. Often, as soon as an item separates from its original case, or item-level identifier, it is often impossible to trace the item back to the producer. As seen with the recent romaine outbreak, it took investigators over a month to pinpoint the source of the contamination, because they did not have source-of-origin information (FDA, 2019, p. 1), even though the vast majority of production occurs in the U.S. southwest. As a result, the FDA has urged &#x201c; . . . the entire leafy greens supply chain to adopt traceability best practices and state-of-the-art technology to assure quick, accurate and easy access to key data elements from farm to fork when leafy greens are involved in a potential recall or outbreak.&#x201d; (FDA, 2019, p. 8). The costs associated with this outbreak are still being uncovered. However, other contamination events are well known.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The spinach recall from 2006 was linked to five deaths and approximately 200 life-threatening illnesses in 26 states. It caused approximately $500 million in financial damage (GS1, 2013, p. 3). More generally, &#x201c; . . . government agencies have also expressed concern over the health and financial impact of recent food recalls, as foodborne illnesses impact 48 million people a year and cost the United States $152 billion in healthcare costs every year.&#x201d; (GS1, 2013, p. 2). Whole-chain traceability, which can be understood as seed-to-sale tracking, was found to reduce the total amount of product recalled to 12% of cases for Frontera Produce's cilantro recall. McKinsey found that a 25% improvement in recall precision could save the fresh foods industry $250-$275 million each year (GS1, 2013, p. 10).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Whole-chain traceability has lacked an effective form of item-level identification, and has lacked guarantees about source-of-origin. Existing methods for item-level identification typically rely on physical branding (lasers), Radio Frequency identifier (RFID), and barcoding&#x2014;i.e. external physical identifiers. There are scaling challenges associated with these techniques as well. Each item requires a physical identifier and has cost associated with its production. Additionally, there is risk of erroneous reads and/or malicious tampering risks inherent in their use&#x2014;e.g. stickers fall off or are removed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Food contamination, such as <i>E. coli </i>and/or <i>salmonella </i>contaminations affecting the food supply, are a threat to public health and rapid action to identify and stem source(s) of contamination is highly desirable. There is a long-felt unmet need in the field for reliable, cost-effective, and/or rapid strategies for enhancing the traceability of products in the food supply. Traceability of biological entities and/or biological materials is desirable not only in the agriculture and food industries, but is also sought-after in a wide variety of industries and fields dealing with biological entities and/or biological materials containing or derived therefrom.

It will be appreciated that embodiments and examples are provided for illustrative purposes intended for those skilled in the art, and are not meant to be limiting in any way.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0141">Provided herein are methods and compositions for providing identification and/or traceability of biological materials. In certain embodiments, methods as described herein may make use of a unique identifier sequence (also referred to herein as a DNA unique identifier sequence), which may be exogenously introduced (i.e. inserted/integrated) into the genome of a biological entity, in order to provide for identification and/or traceability of the biological entity and/or biological materials comprising the biological entity and/or biological materials produced from the biological entity and containing genomic DNA therefrom. In certain embodiments, strategies as described herein may benefit from the durability and replicative capacity of nucleic acid such as DNA to provide identification and/or traceability. In certain embodiments, the unique identifier sequence may be from a randomized pool of sequences. In certain embodiments, a database may be maintained linking unique identifier sequences with corresponding identification and/or tracking information.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0142">Also provided herein are oligonucleotide constructs and cassettes comprising one or more unique identifier sequences for use in providing identification and/or traceability of biological materials. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotide constructs and/or cassettes may comprise particular arrangements of primer annealing sequence(s), which may be for amplification of the unique identifier sequence(s), sequencing of the unique identifier sequence(s), or both. In certain embodiments, arrangements of primer annealing sequence(s) may be designed as described herein so as to reduce unintended and/or off-target amplification and/or sequencing events, which may provide for enhanced fidelity and/or reduced errors in identification events, for example.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0143">In certain embodiments, methods and compositions as described herein may be used for providing food traceability, and may allow for quick response and/or food recall in the event of a contamination, for example. Food contamination, such as <i>E. coli </i>and/or <i>salmonella </i>contaminations affecting the food supply, are a threat to public health and rapid action to identify and stem source(s) of contamination is highly desirable. There is a long-felt unmet need in the field for reliable, cost-effective, and/or rapid strategies for enhancing the traceability of products in the food supply. Strategies as described herein may provide for traceability in the food system from source-of-origin to digestion and beyond. Traceability of biological entities and/or biological materials is desirable not only in the agriculture and food industries, but is also sought-after in a wide variety of industries and fields dealing with biological entities and/or biological materials containing or derived therefrom. Accordingly, in addition to food safety, applications in food/seed security, IP tracking, certification (e.g. seed association, Kosher, Halal, etc. . . . ), GMO identification and/or characterization, and/or risk reduction for trade financing are also contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0144">In certain embodiments, food products or ingredients (such as, for example, fruits and vegetables, or other such foodstuffs containing cells) may comprise unique identifier sequence(s) as described herein as part of the genome in at least some cells thereof to provide for identification and/or traceability. In other embodiments, unique identifier sequence(s) as described herein may be part of the genome of one or more biological entities or biological materials comprising cells, and the biological entities or biological materials may be added to, mixed with, or otherwise associated with one or more products for which identification and/or tracking is desired. By way of example, in certain embodiments food-safe yeast cells containing one or more unique identifier sequences as described herein as part of one or more stably introduced artificial chromosome(s) may be added to or mixed with one or more food products or food ingredients to provide for identification and/or traceability thereof.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0145">Methods for Identification and/or Providing Traceability</p><p id="p-0101" num="0146">In certain embodiments, methods for identification and/or providing traceability of a biological material or biological entity are provided herein. Such methods may utilize a unique identifier sequence to achieve such identification and/or traceability. Typically, a biological entity of interest, such as an agriculture crop (for example, spinach), may be genetically modified to incorporate a unique sequence identifier in its genome. By way of non-limiting and illustrative example, a cell of a spinach plant may be genetically modified to incorporate a cassette, comprising a unique identifier sequence flanked by one or more primer annealing sequences for later amplification and/or sequencing of the unique identifier sequence, into the genome of the spinach cell at an intergenic or other innocuous site of the genome. The sequence of the unique identifier sequence may be known, or may be from a randomized pool and subsequently determined following integration, and may be input and recorded in a database or registry. The cell may then be used to grow/propagate one or more spinach crops, and relevant identification and/or tracking information for the spinach crops (such as source-of-origin, batch/lot information, grower/produced, location, date, vendor, and/or any other supply chain information of interest) may be recorded in the database or registry in association with the corresponding unique identifier sequence. The database entry may, optionally, be updated as supply chain events progress (i.e. harvesting, shipping to a vendor, sale, etc. . . . ). The spinach crop may be used to produce a biological material, such as a bag of spinach or a salad for sale at a grocery store. In the event or suspicion of a contamination or food-borne illness, a sample of a suspect spinach or salad may be obtained, genomic DNA obtained therefrom, and the genomic DNA may be analyzed to determine whether or not a unique identifier sequence is present (i.e. whether or not the spinach is a spinach tracked by the present system) and, if so, the unique identifier sequence may be sequenced to determine the nucleotide sequence, and this nucleotide sequence may be used to provide a query of the database or registry so as to retrieve the relevant database entry providing the identification and/or tracking information so as to facilitate recall of the contaminated spinach or salad. As will be understood, the above spinach example is provided for illustrative purposes, and methods as described herein may be used to provide for a wide variety of identification and/or traceability options for a wide variety of biological entities and/or biological materials in a wide variety of applications.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0147">In an embodiment, there is provided herein a method for identifying a biological material, said method comprising:<ul id="ul0033" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0033-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0034" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0034-0001" num="0148">receiving or providing a sample comprising genomic DNA from the biological material;</li>        <li id="ul0034-0002" num="0149">amplifying at least one DNA unique identifier sequence within the genomic DNA from the biological material and sequencing the DNA unique identifier sequence; and</li>        <li id="ul0034-0003" num="0150">searching for the DNA unique identifier sequence in a database and retrieving a database entry corresponding with the DNA unique identifier sequence, the database entry providing identification and/or tracking information for the biological material.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0103" num="0151">A flow chart depicting an embodiment of such a method is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0152">As will be understood, the biological material may comprise generally any suitable biological material of interest. The biological material may comprise or consist of a material comprising or consisting of a biological entity, or may comprise or consist of a material made or derived from a biological entity, or any other suitable material of interest which comprises genomic nucleic acid (i.e. genomic DNA) from a biological entity. In certain embodiments, the biological material may comprise or consist of a plant-based material, a fungus-based material, an animal-based material, a virus-based material, or a bacterial-based material. By way of example, in certain embodiments a biological material may comprise or consist of a food or beverage comprising or consisting of or made from a plant or other biological entity, where the food or beverage comprises genomic DNA from the biological entity. In certain embodiments, the biological material may comprise or consist of lettuce, spinach, or other leafy green, or a food product comprising or consisting of or made therefrom, for example.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0153">In certain embodiments of the methods described herein, a sample comprising genomic nucleic acid (i.e. genomic DNA where the biological entity has a DNA-based genome) from a biological material of interest (for example, a biological material for which identification is desired) may be received or provided. The sample may be received or provided in purified or partially purified form such that the genomic DNA may be readily used, or may be provided substantially as-is (i.e. as a sample of the food product) or as another crude or precursor form, which may be subjected to one or more processing or purification steps such that the genomic DNA contained therein may be readily used in subsequent steps. In certain embodiments, it is contemplated that any suitable standard technique for genomic nucleic acid purification and/or isolation may be used for sample preparation.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0154">In certain embodiments, and by way of example, one or more steps of nucleic acid (e.g. genome) isolation, purification, and/or extraction may be performed as part of sample preparation for subsequent steps. DNA isolation or extraction may include, for example, one or more steps for obtaining DNA from a sample. In certain embodiments, DNA isolation or extraction may include breaking open (e.g. lysing) the cells (for example, by physical step(s), sonication, or chemical treatment); removing membrane using a detergent; optionally, removing proteins with a protease; and precipitating DNA using alcohol (such as ethanol (cold) or isopropanol). A DNA pellet may thus be obtained by centrifugation. In certain embodiments, DNAse enzymes may be hindered by using a chelating agent as will be recognized by the skilled person. In certain embodiments, cellular and histone proteins may be removed using protease, or precipitating with sodium or ammonium acetate, or by phenol-chloroform extraction prior to DNA precipitation. The skilled person having regard to the teachings herein will recognize that a wide variety of techniques will be available for sample preparation and/or for isolating, purification, and/or extracting genomic nucleic acid, where desirable.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0155">In certain embodiments of the methods as described herein, a unique identifier sequence (referred to herein as a DNA unique identifier sequence, DUID, for convenience, although it will be understood that in certain examples, such as where the biological entity has an RNA-based genome, the unique identifier sequence may be RNA rather than DNA) inserted or integrated within the genome of the biological entity/biological material may, optionally, be amplified.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0156">In certain embodiments, integration within the genome may include integration within a native chromosome. In certain embodiments, integration within the genome may include stably introducing an artificial chromosome into the genome, the artificial chromosome having centromeric sequence and being heritable along with the native genomic material. Example 2 below describes an example using artificial chromosomes in yeast, for example.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0157">Such amplification may be performed using generally any suitable amplification technique known to the person of skill in the art having regard to the teachings herein, such as by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In certain embodiments, as described in further detail herein, the unique identifier sequence to be amplified may be accompanied in the genome by primer annealing sequences for amplification and/or sequencing. In certain embodiments, primer annealing sequences may be selected and arranged so as to allow for amplification by nested PCR to reduce likelihood of unintended or off-target amplification, as described in further detail herein.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0158">In certain embodiments, a PCR-based approach may be used for amplification. PCR amplification may involve forward and reverse primers, where the primers may be complementary (or substantially complementary) to regions 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; to the ends of the nucleic acid sequence of interest to be amplified. Forward and reverse primers to specific primer annealing sequences may be produced by any suitable approach known to the skilled person. Examples of such approaches may be found, for example, in Dieffenbach C W, Dveksler G S. 1995. PCR primer: a laboratory manual, New York, N.Y.: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; New England Biolabs Inc., 2007-08 Catalog &#x26; Technical Reference, herein incorporated by reference. In certain embodiments, for reading bio-information, PCR primers may comprise a plurality of sets of forward and reverse primers that may operate independently from one another. In certain embodiments, identity of some primers may be provided or distributed while access to others may be controlled, such that different parties may be able to readily access different regions and/or nucleic acid sequence information as desired.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0159">In certain embodiments of the methods as described herein, a unique identifier sequence, such as a DNA unique identifier sequence (DUID), may comprise any suitable nucleic acid sequence which has been exogenously introduced into the genome of a biological entity for the purposes of identification. Generally, a unique identifier sequence may be either DNA or RNA such that it matches the genome type (DNA or RNA) of the biological entity. As will be understood, the genome of many biological entities, such as plants for example, is double-stranded, and so the unique identifier sequence will typically be found in the genome in double-stranded form. Thus, it will be understood that in certain embodiments, references herein to the unique identifier sequence (such as when describing sequencing of the identifier sequence, for example) may be understood as referencing either strand of the double-stranded construct, or both, as desired or appropriate.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0160">In certain embodiments, the unique identifier sequence may be incorporated into a cassette or other such construct containing one or more functional elements in addition to the unique identifier sequence. In certain embodiments, the cassette may comprise the unique identifier sequence flanked by one or more primer annealing sequences for PCR amplification of the DNA unique identifier sequence, sequencing of the DNA unique identifier sequence, or both. As will be understood, a primer annealing sequence may refer to a pre-determined sequence or region of nucleic acid having a known nucleotide sequence such that one or more primers may be designed or selected for annealing to such primer annealing sequence so as to prime polymerization by a polymerase, for example. Typically, the primer annealing sequences will be selected such that they are unique within the genome of the biological entity of interest so as to reduce or eliminate unintended or off-target amplification. In certain embodiments, the unique identifier sequence may be a known pre-determined sequence selected for a particular application, or may be a random sequence derived from a randomized pool of nucleic acid sequences which may subsequently be determined and recorded in a database as described in detail herein, for example. In certain embodiments, the unique identifier sequence, or the cassette comprising the unique identifier sequence, may have a size of up to about 1500 nt in length; up to about 1000 nt in length; about 200 nt to about 600 nt in length; about 200 nt to about 400 nt in length; or about 400 nt to about 600 nt in length; or any size or subrange spanning between any two of these sizes. As will be understood, longer unique identifier sequences may allow for more unique sequences within a pool, and may allow for reduced risk of duplication. Further, in embodiments where encoding or encrypting of identification information within the unique identifier sequence is desired, longer lengths may allow for relatively more information to be stored and/or more elaborate encryption or encoding schemes to be used, for example. That said, by maintaining a reasonable length such as those referred to herein, a more reliable and/or rapid amplification and/or sequencing may be performed, and/or costs may be relatively reduced.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0161">In certain embodiments, the unique identifier sequence may comprise a sequence of up to about 1500 nt in length; up to about 1000 nt in length; about 200 nt to about 600 nt in length; about 200 nt to about 400 nt in length; or about 400 nt to about 600 nt in length. In certain embodiments, the unique identifier sequence may be relatively short, such as for example about 20 bp in length. As will be understood, in certain embodiments size of the unique identifier sequence may be selected to suit the particular implementation and the desired parameters thereof. In certain embodiments, the unique identifier sequence may have a size of about 20 nt to about 1500 nt, or any size therebetween or any subrange contained therein.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0162">In certain embodiments, the unique identifier sequence may be obtained from a pool at random and may, optionally, be screened for acceptability (e.g. screened for uniqueness, screened to avoid undesirable sequence motifs), or may be rationally designed (e.g. designed for uniqueness, designed to avoid undesirable sequence motifs), for example.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0163">In certain embodiments, the DNA unique identifier sequence may be flanked by one or more primer annealing sequences for PCR amplification of the DNA unique identifier sequence, sequencing of the DNA unique identifier sequence, or both.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0164">In certain embodiments, it is contemplated that the unique identifier sequence may be provided in a cassette or otherwise introduced or inserted into the genomic nucleic acid such that it is flanked by one or more primer annealing sequences for PCR amplification of the DNA unique identifier sequence, sequencing of the DNA unique identifier sequence, or both. Examples of suitable cassettes and configurations are described in further detail herein. In certain embodiments, the cassette may be incorporated into a plasmid, vector, or other such carrier suitable for use in inserting/incorporating/integrating the cassette into the genome of a biological entity.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0165">As will be understood, any suitable genetic modification technique known to the person of skill in the art having regard to the teachings herein may be used for introducing/inserting/incorporating/integrating the unique identifier sequence, or cassette/vector comprising the unique identifier sequence, into the genome of the biological entity. As will also be understood, the genetic modification technique may be selected based on the unique identifier sequence or cassette/vector being used, and based on the particular biological entity being modified. Techniques for genome modification of a wide variety of biological entities, including plants, animals, fungus, bacteria, and viruses, are well-known and may be readily adapted for exogenously introducing a unique identifier sequence as described herein.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0166">By way of example, the skilled person having regard to the teachings herein will be aware of vectors for incorporating DNA into an organism, which may be designed according to known principles of molecular biology. Such vectors may, for example, be designed to stably introduce a DNA sequence of interest into the genome of an organism. In certain embodiments, vectors may be of viral origin or derived therefrom, for example. Where the organism is a plant, it is contemplated that, for example, <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated incorporation of DNA of interest may be used for introduction into the plant. The skilled person having regard to the teachings herein will be aware of several other transformation methods, such as ballistic or particle gun methods, among others, which may be adapted as desired or as suitable based on the particular application of interest. In certain embodiments, a gene delivery system may be used based on genetic engineering principles such that sequence of interest may be introduced or inserted into the genome of the host organism. By way of example, in an embodiment, a transposon system may be used for insertion into the genome of a host, which may be a microorganism, animal cell, or plant cell, for example (Insect Molecular Biology (2007), 16(1), 37-47, Plant Physiology Preview. 2007, DOI: 10.1104/pp. 107.111427, the American Society of Plant Biologists; research on production of lactoferrin from transformed silkworms and functionality thereof, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 2005). In certain embodiments, any suitable method in the field of molecular biology and/or genetic engineering may be used which is able to insert one or more DNA fragments or components of interest into a genome of a host (see, for example, Transgenic Plants Methods and Protocols., Methods in Molecular Biology 2019, Editors: Kumar, Sandeep, Barone, Pierluigi, Smith, Michelle, ISBN 978-1-4939-8778-8, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0167">In certain embodiments, where identification of a biological material or biological entity comprising a unique identifier sequence is desired, the sequence of the unique identifier sequence may be determined by sequencing. As will be understood, the unique identifier sequence may be sequenced by generally any suitable sequencing technique known to the person of skill in the art having regard to the teachings herein. In certain embodiments, the sequencing may be assisted by the inclusion or use of a sequencing primer annealing sequence associated with the unique identifier sequence within the genomic nucleic acid. Examples of such sequencing primer anneal sequence, which may be incorporated into a cassette comprising the unique identifier sequence, for example, are described in detail herein.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0168">In certain embodiments, sequencing may be performed using any suitable sequencing technique known to the person of skill in the art having regard to the teachings herein, which may be selected based on the particular application and/or configuration being used. In certain embodiments, sequencing may be performed by any suitable sequencing method for determining the order of nucleotide bases in a molecule of DNA (or RNA).

Cassettes may vary, for example, in terms of elements present, in terms of size, and in terms of amplification efficiency. Depending on whether primer pairs are present (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>(A)</figref>-(C)), total cassette size may change. For example, as individual primer pairs are eliminated, total cassette size may be reduced (for example, by about 40 bp in certain embodiments). As will be understood, in certain embodiments amplification efficiency for the UID may decrease as a result of primer pair elimination. For example, for a dual primer design, any permutation of the primers may be used for amplification, giving 4 possible variations rather than one as would be found for a single primer pair design. As will also by understood, in certain embodiments, reducing cassette size may provide for a reduction in the potential for unintended effects, for example. In certain embodiments, an optional CAS 9 PAM site may be used to permit for efficient CRISPR-based editing of the UID sequence amongst transformed organism progeny, for example. In certain embodiments in which all primers are eliminated from the cassette design, it is contemplated that a CAS 9 PAM may, optionally, be provided, where the CAS 9 PAM site may, in certain embodiments, permit the standalone cassette to be constructed entirely of host genome DNA, such as when using a DNA digestion/ligation technique, for example. In certain embodiments, the UID sequence may be variable in length. It is contemplated that in certain embodiments, even short UID sequences may be safely used, particularly where a validation step is performed that includes a check for any collisions amongst existing UIDs in the registry and the newly inserted UID, for example.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0250">In still another embodiment of the cassettes described herein, the primer annealing sequences may not be naturally occurring in the genome of a target biological entity.

This example utilizes the durability and replicative capacity of DNA sequences to safely encode unique identifiers within the nuclear genome of an organism.

In particular, the DUID system may have the capacity to:<ul id="ul0065" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0065-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0066" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0066-0001" num="0274">1.

DUID systems as described herein, in addition to providing traceability, may turn traditional thinking about point of attribution on its head&#x2014;bottom-up instead of top-down. Such approaches, as described herein, may be particularly desirable given increases in supply-chain consolidation becoming the norm. DUID systems as described herein may provide for virtually guaranteed source-of-origin traceability from generally anywhere throughout the supply-chain, within a about day if desired. Systems may benefit from the replicative and stable cellular properties of an organism, and as a result, marginal costs may approach zero as progeny are created. The financial cost and risk of tampering and/or fraud for traditional tracking systems is quite high, and the legal implications of malicious activity may be significant. DUID systems as described herein may be edited in interesting ways such that a population's progeny maintains portions of the original identifier, for example. The DUID may also be utilized by health care professionals who may want to test human excreta in order to identify recently consumed food, for example.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0282">It is contemplated that aforementioned population-level identification may, optionally, include additional reference to legal agreements. By way of example, it is contemplated that IP owners of a product may purposefully link propagating material to, for example, a particular grower and/or region. Population-level genetic identification in conjunction with traditional whole-chain traceability techniques may enable remarkable levels of control over the movement of product. Consider, for example, a spinach plant variety that has been genetically engineered to be resistant to various pests. Using a DUID system, there may be significantly reduced costs in detection. In addition to cost reduction, the DUID system may play a role as a registry to provide a centralized point of contact for IP tracking, for example.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0283">Many organisms are regulated. For example, a plant variety may be a precursor to a narcotic. Such organisms may, in certain embodiments, benefit from being inextricably associated with an approved legal entity, for example. Accordingly, it is contemplated that such instances may benefit from strategies as described herein.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0284">In an example, consider regulation of cannabis in Canada. The production and distribution of cannabis plants and their propagating material is regulated. It is contemplated that in certain embodiments, licensed cannabis producers may include a DUID into their products, for example, which may be used to assist with regulation. In certain embodiments, such DUID may be helpful for regulation by identifying and/or tracking cannabis, even in complex instances where cannabis is mixed with something else (i.e. in edible products, for example).</p><p id="p-0186" num="0285">In another example, consider a spinach growers association. Membership to the association may be required in order to grow and sell spinach in certain examples. In certain embodiments, it is contemplated that such propagating materials may have been derived from a DUID-ready plant. Random audits may then be done at the retail level to ensure all spinach being sold is accredited, for example.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0286">DUID System:</p><p id="p-0188" num="0287">The DUID system may encompass, for example, product identification, DUID validation, DUID reads, and the subsequent tracking of populations of products.

Business services may encompass critical processes and tasks, which may ultimately produce an event. These services may be designed to be stateless in that they do not require any particular prior state exist in order for it to be triggered. They may dictate that certain events have occurred in order to complete successfully. In any case, a business service may utilize a system, but most typically includes some human involvement. By way of example, in certain embodiments it should be requested or triggered by an actor. Business services may also be named similarly to the event that they produce&#x2014;e.g. Validation (business service)&#x2192;Validated (event).</p><p id="p-0200" num="0319">Systems: by way of example, once the read (Event) has been logged to the registry (system), a stream processor (system) may read the newly created read (event) from the registry and may broadcast it to authenticated/authorized listeners (system). One of the listeners may update a notifications dashboard used by the product's brand owner (actor). Systems on the other hand may be only interacted with by other systems, or otherwise, a client operated by a human. In other words, systems may typically be digital systems. An example of a system within the DUID platform may be an API. The API may expose an interface to authorized actors that operate outside of the platform boundaries. Another example of a system may be the DUID Registry (i.e. database), which may function as the persistent data store for all DUID data. The registry may not be directly exposed to external actors.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0320">Events: By way of example, a read (Business Service) may be requested by a consumer safety officer (Actor) from the FDA (Actor). After authorization/authentication, the business service may result in a successful read (Event). Events may refer to the outcome of business services and systems.

The physical output of this business service may be a DNA sequence-based cassette, which may be used by the producer during organism transformation. There may be two scenarios that may play out within this activity.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0330">First, it is contemplated that if there is an existing cassette, a standard CRISPR and/or related technique may be used to modify portions of the existing identifier. For example, if the existing identifier has been mapped to a geographic region, a few bases may be edited at the end of the sequence. This edit may be mapped to more specific information&#x2014;e.g. expected transformed state after processing. An identified event may be triggered once this is complete.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0331">If there is no existing cassette, it may be created. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> for details about such a process. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a cassette may be produced using a pool of oligonucleotides of randomized sequence. Randomized pools of oligonucleotides may be commercially obtained, or synthesized as desired. They may be assembled via enzymatic polymerization or ligation, for example. Random oligonucleotide fragments may be purified, for example by column separation, to isolate fragments of approximately the same or similar size (for example, about 300 nt-400 nt in size in the depicted example), and may be inserted into the cassettes. A pool of cassettes containing a vast variety of different unique identifier sequences (i.e. about 10<sup>7 </sup>in some examples) may be produced. The cassette may comprise primer annealing sequences (i.e. primer sites) and at least one sequencing primer annealing sequence (i.e. sequencing site), in a suitable arrangement so as to allow for amplification and/or sequencing of the DUID, such as the configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Primer and sequencing sites may be validated against the host genome to verify that there is no native amplification. Cassettes with different primers may be employed for different organisms or for different genomes, if desired. The cassette may comprise restriction enzyme array sites, and may be provided in the form of an insertion cassette carrier plasmid, for example. In certain embodiments, the cassette may be about 500 bp in length, and may be provided within a plasmid or carrier vector of about 1200 bp in size, for example.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0332">Once the cassette is completed, an identified event may be triggered, and the cassette may be sent to a customer. The customer will typically be a producer, such as a grower in the agriculture industry. The producer may use suitable transformation and regeneration techniques to regenerate an organism of interest now comprising a cassette inserted into the genome. They may then generate a validation package containing at least a sample of genomic DNA from the transformed biological entity, which may be then sent back.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0333">Validation:</p><p id="p-0216" num="0334">After receiving the validation package, authenticating the requester and checking for authorization, the validation process may begin. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> outlines an example of a process for validation.

Although, supply chain stakeholders may have the option of integrating the DUID into their existing processes. If they choose not to, the existence of the DUID may provide&#x2014;at least&#x2014;source-of-origin traceability. In certain embodiments, it is contemplated that the DUID may be integrated into existing barcodes. Note that in certain embodiments, the unique identifier (UID) portion of the DUID may be essentially a string of characters characterized by its nucleotides (A, T, G, C). In certain embodiments, if an explicit read is not required, they may independently track that DUID-ready organism using their own data capture technologies (for example, barcoding). This may result in an unconfirmed tracked event.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0361">If a read event is required, the stakeholder in question may submit a request to the read business service. There may be two types of requests in this example. One may be mandatory and the other may be voluntary. The contents of the read package may depend on the type. For example, if the read request is mandatory, there may be specific requirements to be met in order to satisfy stakeholder requirements&#x2014;e.g. organic material samples from particular dates.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0362">Read:</p><p id="p-0236" num="0363">The read business service is shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. As with the other business services, authorization may be immediately checked for. Often, the read package may contain various types of organic material. Depending on that material, purification and/or amplification may be done. If the primers are detected, the sequencing (and in some cases UID decoding steps) may begin. If the primer is not detected, log the results and fail.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0364">Once the UID has been sequenced and/or decoded, an attempt may be made to find all relevant data within the DUID registry. It is conceivable that in certain instances a DUID may not be found in the registry, in which case a post-mortem review may be conducted. This review may attempt to find the cause of error. On the other hand, if the DUID is found, the results may be logged and a read event may be created.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0365">It is also possible that in certain embodiments an approved integration partner&#x2014;e.g. the FDA&#x2014;may make a request to the read business service.

These techniques involve the use of both laboratory yeast strains and industrial yeast strains. The methods herein validate utility and efficacy for DUID integration into a genome for the activities of traceability. These molecular biology laboratory methods include:</p><p id="p-0251" num="0378">1. the in silico design of DUIDs, DUID vectors and DUID primers.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0379">2. the method for stable genomic integration through yeast centromere plasmids (YCp).</p><p id="p-0253" num="0380">3. the method for stable genomic integration through insertion into native yeast chromosomes.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0381">4. the method DUID integration validation.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0382">5. the method for DUID signal detection and signal detection limits.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0383">It is contemplated that these methods are applicable to wide range of research and industrial yeast strains including prototrophic strains. The YCp approach allows for genome integration through cellular and nuclear management of the DUIDs constructs as independent chromosomes, through spindle association of the centromeric sequences built into the vector backbone. For insertion into native yeast chromosomes, four genomic sites were selected for minimal interference with the usual coding capacity and expression of genes within the genome. These sites included sub-telomeric regions that are generally regarded as heterochromatic where genes are typically silenced, and a euchromatic region with low coding capacity to act as a positive control. The insertion into native yeast chromosomes approach focuses on: 1) Co-transformation of a plasmid carrying antibiotic resistance for selection of transformants along with a linear fragment containing the DUID flanked by homologous regions flanking the selected target sites; and 2) CRISPR-based methods that target in integration site using specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) and specific homology repair templates (HRTs) that serve as templates for the Cas9-digested target PAM sites.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0384">Construct and Vectors Design and Development:</p><p id="p-0258" num="0385">DUID Construct Design</p><p id="p-0259" num="0386"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows maps of two 370 pb DUID constructs. A) DUID construct design for PCR and qPCR amplification. Construct is 370 pb. This DUID construct contains 2 forward primers and two reverse primers. There are two identifiers (ID1 and ID2). ID1 is ideal for PCR amplification. ID2 is ideal for qPCR amplification. B) A DUID construct design for loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and PCR. This map includes primers for both PCR and LAMP. Aside from traditional amplification design decisions, note the features in pink, which are optional CAS PAM sites that allow for editing and detection of the DUID construct sequences using CRISPR-based systems. Such a PAM site may allow for editing of a DUID construct that has been integrated.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0387"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> depicts an ID to Registry mapping example as described herein. Note that this Figure depicts a simplified example, and it is contemplated that the whole DUID sequences would typically not be as short as those depicted in the table.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0388">In the present example, there will not be more than one alignment of an ID sequence within the database. In this example the ID sequences are always unique to a single DUID construct, but a single DUID construct may have multiple ID sequences. However, an ID sequence may have one or more sections within it that is homologous to other DUID sequences. It is contemplated that there may be sequences within a DUID construct that may be used across DUID constructs; however, the IDs themselves should be unique, and by extension, the DUIDs will also be unique. This design decision to have homologous sections within ID sequences across any number of DUIDs may allow to version the DUIDs in a number of ways.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0389">Homologous ID Section Example&#x2014;One Homologous Section Across Three DUIDs:<ul id="ul0095" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0095-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0096" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0096-0001" num="0390">There are a few reasons having homologous sequences across multiple identifiers may be desirable. In some cases, the identifier may have a homologous sequence for the purpose of providing a version associated with that identifier. The ability to version identifiers may allow users to reference an associated protocol that will inform how they may interact with the DUID. For example, a particular version of a DUID identifier may contain a public key within in the context of cryptography, which may inform subsequent interactions with the DUID in some meaningful way. In other cases, the homologous sequence may reference the system or entity that initially created the identifier, for example.

This protocol described below is based on standard transformation procedures where the cells are made competent by treatment with LiOAc solution after which cells are incubated with DNA molecules (plasmid and repair template) and carrier DNA (salmon sperm DNA) prior to a heat shock to take up the DNA. Following recuperation, the cells are plated on hygromycin to select against all non-transformed cells. Plating on YPD without hygromycin showed the growth of cells following the transformation procedure; e.g. the procedure itself did not kill the cells. Transforming the CRISPR plasmid without the HRT, should kill the cells as the DSB will not repair; this will confirm the successful function of the CRISPR plasmid meaning Cas9 is expressed and the gRNAs target Cas9 to the genome. Transforming the CRISPR plasmid along with the HRT should repair the DSB and support cell growth.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0427">The plasmid pCC-036_Chr<b>6</b>_2/Chr6_HRT and pCC-036_Euch_1/Euch-HRT were the respective combinations of DNA molecules transformed into yeast strains S288c, Vermont and French Saison.

For the euchromatic target integration site on Chr2, primers Euch_Seq F/R were used, and for the Chr6 subtelomeric heterochromatic target integration site, primers Chr6_Seq F/R were used. These primers yielded a &#x2dc;600 bp DNA fragment from gDNA without any insertion at the integration site. With integration, this fragment size will increase to &#x2dc;970 bp. The controls included reactions without any gDNA template, and gDNA isolated from untransformed strains (like S288c/BY4743). PCR reactions were resolved with gel electrophoresis using GeneRuler 100 bp Plus molecular weight marker to confirm the size of the generate DNA fragments.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0454">Once integrants were confirmed, the correct integration was validated with PCR primers of which bind the genome outside the integrating fragment and another that binds within the transformed fragment. These primers yield a DNA fragment if the integration occurred at the correct target site and no DNA fragment if integration did not occur.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0455">DNA fragments generated by both

num="0458">We performed WGS on the parent and integrants to confirm insertion copy number and to identify the presence of any off-target integration events. We will combine short-read (Illumina) and long-read (PacBio) sequencing data to assemble the full genomes of both the parent and transformed strains. The combination of these two approaches will provide an overall genome structure of the integrant and hence identify if multiple insertions occurred or if there were any off-target integration events. The whole genomes of integrant(s) and parent strain(s) will be sequenced by Genome Qu&#xe9;bec (Montreal, Canada) as previously described (Preiss et al., 2018). In brief, DNA will be isolated and used as templates for library constructions for Illumina and PacBio applications. Sequencing reads will be quality-analysed with FastQC (version 0.11.5) (Andrews, 2010) and trimmed and filtered with Trimmomatic (version 0.36) (Bolger, Lohse, &#x26; Usadel, 2014). Reads will be aligned to a <i>S. cerevisiae </i>S288c (R64-2-1) reference genome using SpeedSeq (0.1.0) (Chiang et al., 2015). Quality of alignments will be assessed with QualiMap (2.2.1) (Garcia-Alcalde et al., 2012). Variant analysis will be performed on aligned reads using FreeBayes (1.1.0-46-g8d2b3a01) (Garrison &#x26; Marth, 2012). Variants in all strains will be called simultaneously (multi-sample). Prior to variant analysis, alignments will be filtered to a minimum MAPQ of 50 with SAMtools (1.2) (Li et al., 2009). Annotation and effect prediction of the variants will be performed with SnpEff (1.2) (Cingolani et al., 2012). Copy number variations of chromosomes and genes will be estimated based on coverage with Control-FREEC (11.0) (Boeva et al., 2012). Statistically significant copy number variations will be identified using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (p&#x3c;0.05).
