One cause that hinders optimization of the performance of a program is instability of the performance of this cache memory.

The compulsory miss is a cache miss that occurs at the time of the first access to a cache line, and is easily avoidable by a hardware prefetch function (or a software prefetch function). The capacity miss is a cache miss that occurs as a result of the number of lines desired to be cached exceeding a cache capacity, and is easily avoidable by blocking or the like in which part of data is kept in a cache memory as much as possible limitedly for a certain section of a program.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">On the other hand, the conflict miss results from a structure and a scheme of a cache memory, and it is not easy to understand the cause of the conflict miss.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A simple example of the conflict miss will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a reference example of storage of each array in a cache. It is assumed that one-dimensional arrays A, B, C, and D are used in a processing block (core loop) of a certain program. Each array is page-aligned, and accesses to elements, with the same index, of the respective arrays are accesses to the same cache line. For example, it is assumed that heads such as A(1) of the respective arrays are aligned to correspond to (0, *). In the case where a cache is configured such that the number of ways is four and the line width is 2 words, each array is stored in the cache without any conflict as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Addition of an array E to this processing block induces a cache miss and the performance of the program degrades. The arrays that use the line (0, *) are {A(1), A(2)}, {B(1), B(2)}, {C(1), C(2)}, {D(1), D(2)}, and {E(1), E(2)}. A unit surrounded by { } corresponds to a cache line.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the case where an access is made in an order of A(1), B(1), C(1), D(1), E(1), A(2), . . . in the processing block, the access up to D(1) proceeds without any problem since (0, *) is four-way. When E(1) is accessed, the line (0, 0) in which A(1) is stored is written back to the main storage memory, and {E(1), E(2)} is stored in that portion. In a subsequent access to A(2), the access is made to the main storage memory since the line for {A(1), A(2)} is not present in the cache. At this time, the line (0, 1) in which {B(1), B(2)} is stored is written back to the main storage memory, and {A(1), A(2)} is stored in the line (0, 1).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this manner, a cache-line conflict occurs at all times, and a chain of cache misses occurs. The occurrence of such a chain of cache misses is referred to as cache thrashing. A major cause of cache thrashing is, for example, low associativity (of the number of ways) of a cache viewed from hardware.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the case where the array E is not page-aligned and E(1) is stored in (1, *) of the cache, no cache conflict occurs even if similar accesses are made.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As described above, the conflict miss results from the structure of the cache memory, the cache algorithm scheme, and the page alignment of data.

The present disclosure is not limited by these embodiments. The individual embodiments may be appropriately combined with each other within the scope without any contradiction.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">To stabilize the performance of a cache memory, an expert analyzes an adjustable dimension of data and determines the adjustable dimension of data. The adjustable dimension of data in this case refers to a length of data, and corresponds to, for example, the number of rows of a matrix declared when a two-dimensional array is prepared in the case where FORTRAN is used as a programming language of a target program. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a reference example of analysis of an adjustable dimension of data.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the case where the computation performance in the entire (or part of) target program is markedly lower than the theoretical computation performance of a processor, a programmer investigates and identifies a cause of the computation performance degradation and makes a modification for removing that cause of the computation performance degradation in the program to improve the computation performance of the program. One candidate for the cause of the computation performance degradation is instability of the performance of a cache memory.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">By using a dedicated tool, a programmer first checks an occurrence state of instability of the performance of the cache memory. By using a timing counter or the like of the processor, the dedicated tool is capable of acquiring the number of cache misses or a cache miss rate during execution of a program. However, since the acquirable value is a cumulative value or an average value at a certain interval during execution of the program, it is difficult to identify a block, in the program, where a cache miss has occurred.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As illustrated in a left diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, an expert of a cache memory estimates a corresponding block, in the program, where a cache miss has occurred and extracts source code of the corresponding block or inserts a reset instruction for the timing counter, thereby identifying the corresponding block. As illustrated in a right diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the expert extracts an adjustable dimension of data to be used in the identified corresponding block, and determines, through analysis and examination, the adjustable dimension of data for suppressing the conflict miss due to a cache-line conflict.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described above, the expert is able to determine the adjustable dimension of data for suppressing the conflict miss. For example, the performance of the cache memory may be stabilized when a given program is executed. However, such a method based on analysis and examination takes an enormous amount of time to determine the adjustable dimension of data for suppressing a conflict miss. Accordingly, an information processing apparatus that efficiently determines an adjustable dimension of data for suppressing a conflict miss will be described below.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a functional configuration of an information processing apparatus according to an embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an information processing apparatus <b>1</b> includes a control unit <b>10</b> and a storage unit <b>20</b>.

The storage unit <b>20</b> includes characteristic information <b>21</b> and suppression condition information <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The characteristic information <b>21</b> is characteristic information of computation performance corresponding to each adjustable dimension in a microprocessor in which a cache memory is mounted. The adjustable dimension is, for example, from 2 to a maximum value (LMAX). A section of the adjustable dimension for which the computation performance is less than or equal to a predetermined threshold indicates a section in which a conflict miss has presumably occurred in the cache memory. The predetermined threshold corresponds to a threshold PT-B for determining the occurrence of performance degradation described later. LMAX is calculated from a cache capacity of the cache memory mounted in the microprocessor in an execution environment. The characteristic information <b>21</b> is acquired by the characteristic acquisition unit <b>11</b> described later. An example of the characteristic information <b>21</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of characteristic information according to the embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the characteristic information <b>21</b> is information in which an adjustable dimension (L) and computation performance (PDATA) are associated with each other. The adjustable dimension (L) refers to a data length, and is from 2 to LMAX. LMAX is a value of a quotient obtained by dividing a capacity of a cache memory by a size of a data type. As an example, in the case where the capacity of the cache memory is 64 kilobytes (KB), the data type is a double-precision floating-point type, and the size of the data type is 8 bytes, LMAX is equal to 8192(=64&#xd7;1024 bytes/8 bytes). The computation performance (PDATA) refers to a performance value obtained in the case where the adjustable dimension is given and a program for performing computation by sequentially accessing continuous addresses in a certain size (the size of the data type) is executed. An example of such a program is a matrix product computation function. In the embodiment, description will be given on the assumption that such a program is a matrix product computation function.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A relationship between the adjustable dimension L and the matrix product computation function is as follows. For example, a matrix product C of a two-dimensional matrices A and B is represented by A&#xd7;B. In the case where the matrix A has m rows and p columns and the matrix B has p rows and n columns, the matrix product C has m rows and n columns. This m is the adjustable dimension in the case where FORTRAN is used as the programming language of a target program. The characteristic information <b>21</b> of the computation performance corresponding to the adjustable dimension is determined by using the program, one example of which is the matrix product computation function, because of a reason below. For example, instability of the performance of the cache memory depends on the structure of the cache memory mounted in the microprocessor that executes this program, the cache algorithm scheme, the page alignment of data, and the locality of reference of data, and a characteristic of the instability of the performance of the cache memory is acquired as a relationship with the adjustable dimension. If the computation performance corresponding to the adjustable dimension is less than or equal to the predetermined threshold, it may be determined that a conflict miss has occurred in the cache memory.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating the characteristic information according to the embodiment as a graph.

In such a graph, an X-axis represents the adjustable dimension (L) of data and a Y-axis represents the computation performance (PDATA). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, there is a section in which the computation performance associated with the adjustable dimension of data decreases. Such a section is a section indicated by a broken line. In such a section, the computation performance decreases because of the occurrence of a conflict miss in the cache memory.
