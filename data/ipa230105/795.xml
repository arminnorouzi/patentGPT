Diagnostically, CH exists in two forms: an episodic (eCH) and a chronic variant (cCH), distinguished by the duration of attack free periods (Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (HIS) (2018). The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3<sup>rd </sup>Edition. Cephalagia 38: 1-211). The attacks of severe or very severe pain is orbital, supraorbital or temporal, lasting for 15 to 180 minutes and occurring from once every other day to eight times a day (Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (HIS) (2018). The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3<sup>rd </sup>Edition. Cephalagia 38: 1-211). The social impact of CH is considerable (Jensen et al. (2007) &#x201c;Burden of cluster headache&#x201d;, Cephalagia 27: 531-41) and it is associated with sizable direct and indirect economic consequences (Gaul et al. Treatment costs and indirect costs of cluster headache. A health economic analysis&#x2014;2011, doi:10.1177/0333105411425866). CH has a low prevalence with a 2-6 times higher average incidence rate for men compared to females (Ekbom et al. (2002) &#x201c;Age at onset and sex ratio in cluster headache: observations over three decades&#x201d;, Cephalalgia 22: 94-100). However, the ratio might be lower due to misdiagnosis of CH in women compared to men Lund et al. (2017) &#x201c;Chronobilology differs between men and women with cluster headache, clinical phenotypes does not&#x201d;, Neurology 88: 1069-1076). The lifetime prevalence of CH based on a meta-analysis showed a mean prevalence of 124 per 100,000 with a ratio between eCH to cCH of 6 Fischera et al. (2008) &#x201c;The incidence and prevalence of cluster headache: a meta-analysis of population-based study&#x201d;, Cephalalgia 28: 614-618). According to the Horton headache society in Denmark about 7000 patients suffers from CH in Denmark alone. The treatments to abort CH are unspecific and limited, not always effective and hampered by side effects. Some of the patients suffer from refractory CH and have no benefit of the current treatments (exact prevalence is not known). Chronic CH is defined according to a consensus statement on clinical definition from European Headache Federation Mitsikostas et al. (2014) &#x201c;Refractory chronic cluster headache: a consensus statement on clinical definition from the European Headache Federation&#x201d;, J. Headache and Pain 15:079). According to these guidelines, the diagnostic criteria for cCH, besides the general criteria for CH are: attacks occurring without a remission period, or with remissions lasting less than 3 months, for at least one year.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The most common drugs with known effectiveness to abort CH are triptans such as sumatriptan (subcutaneous or intranasal) or zolmitriptan (intranasal) and high-flow rate oxygen, and treatments to prevent CH are verapamil, lithium and prednisolone/dexamethasone, all dosed as tablets (Matharu (2010) &#x201c;Cluster headache&#x201d;, Clinical Evidence, 2010:02, 1212). However, not all CH patients respond to or tolerate available acute and preventive treatments, determining their CH to be refractory (Mitsikostas et al. (2014) &#x201c;Refractory chronic cluster headache: a consensus statement on clinical definition from the European Headache Federation). These refractory patients are desperate to obtain some pain relief. A number of different drug compounds e.g. LSD with unknown effectiveness are used (Matharu M, Cluster headache, Clinical Evidence 2010:02, 1212). A new alternative to drug treatment in CCH is neurostimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion to relief the pain. This requires a surgery to insert a neurostimulator as a mean of external self-stimulation of the nerve center by a remote controller (Schoenen et al. (2013) &#x201c;Stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) for cluster headache treatment. Patheway CH-1: A randomized, sham-controlled study&#x201d; m Cephalalgia, 33:816-30) and have shown positive results in some highly selected patients.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ketamine (R,S-2-chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino)-cyclohexanone), in particular the hydrochloride salt thereof, is a well-known human and veterinary anesthetic agent. Ketamine has an extremely varied set of pharmacologic actions depending on the dosage that is used. It has been in legitimate clinical use since 1963. Ketamine in its base form is highly lipophilic and easily passes the blood-brain barrier. The S-form is at least two times more potent than the R-form (Niesters et al. (2013) &#x201c;Ketamine for chronic pain: riskes and benefits&#x201d;, Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2013, 77:2, 357-367). The terminal plasma half-life is 2-3 hours and the main metabolite is norketamine, which is claimed to have limited pharmacological effect (Niesters et al. (2013) &#x201c;Ketamine for chronic pain: riskes and benefits&#x201d;, Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2013, 77:2, 357-367). When it is administered as an appropriate pharmacologic agent, it is a safe anesthetic agent in human and veterinary use (Sleigh et al. (2014) &#x201c;Ketamine-more mechanisms of action than just NMDA blockade&#x201d;, Trends in anesthesia and critical care 4:76-81). The dosing for anesthetic purpose is 6.5-13.5 mg/kg of body weight. At sub-anesthetic doses (&#x3c;1 mg/kg), ketamine is an uncompetitive antagonist at ionotropic NMDA-type glutamate receptors, binding to a site on the receptor while it is open. Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission throughout the mammalian brain. Based on their pharmacology, there are three main classes of glutamate-activated channels: &#x3b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), kainate receptors, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR). Among ion-gated receptor subtypes (iGluRs), NMDAR are exceptional in their high unitary conductance, high Ca2+ permeability, and remarkably slow gating kinetics. The neuropharmacological actions of ketamine is highly complex and not fully revealed (Niesters et al. 2013 &#x201c;Ketamine for chronic pain: risks and benefits&#x201d;, Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol 77: 357-367 and Nielsen et al. (2014) &#x201c;Intranaseal sufentanil/ketamine analgesia in children&#x201d;, Pediatric Anesthesia 24:170-180).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Intranasal administration of ketamine in sub-anesthetic dosing has been investigated in a number of clinical studies primarily in treatment of procedural pain in children (Nielsen et al. (2014) &#x201c;Intranaseal sufentanil/ketamine analgesia in children&#x201d;, Pediatric Anesthesia 24:170-180 and Bergmann (1999) &#x201c;Ketamine: Review of its pharmacology and its use in pediatric anesthesia&#x201d;, Abesgt, Prog, 46:10-20), in clinical practices or abortion of traumatic pain in adults (Shimonovich et al. (2016) &#x201c;Intranasel ketamine for acute traumatic pain in emergency department: a prospective, randomized clinical trial of efficacy and safety&#x201d;, BMC Emergency Medicine, 16:43) and for treatment of major depressive disorder) Lapidus et al. (2014) &#x201c;A randomized controlled trial of intranasal ketamine in major depressive disorder&#x201d;, Biol. Psychiatry, 15:76970-976). In March 2019, the FDA approved a product of ketamine-S as intranasal spray for treating severe depression under clinical monitoring (NDA 211243; proprietary name SPRAVATO; esketamine hydrochloride) (FDA Briefing Document. Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee (PDAC) and Drug Safety and risk Management (DSaRM), Feb. 12, 2019). Ketamine nasal spray provides a rapid onset of analgesia in treatment of pediatric procedural pain management in low dose regiment (0.5 mg/kg) (Nielsen et al. (2014) &#x201c;Intranaseal sufentanil/ketamine analgesia in children&#x201d;, Pediatric Anesthesia 24:170-180). In two studies, the absolute bioavailability of intranasal delivery of ketamine has been estimated to 36% (Nielsen et al. (2014) &#x201c;Intranasal sufenatanil/ketamine analgesia in children&#x201d;, Pediatric Anesthesia 24, 2014, 170-180) or 45% (Shimonovich et al. (2016) &#x201c;Intranasal ketamine for acute traumatic pain in emergency department: a prospective, randomized clinical trial of efficacy and safety&#x201d;, BMC Emergency Medicine, 2016, 16:43). The side effects were minimal with only slight sedation (Nielsen et al. (2014) &#x201c;Intranaseal sufentanil/ketamine analgesia in children&#x201d;, Pediatric Anesthesia 24:170-180). Peak plasma concentrations were obtained within 10-15 min (Nielsen et al. (2014) &#x201c;Intranaseal sufentanil/ketamine analgesia in children&#x201d;, Pediatric Anesthesia 24:170-180). Ketamine nasal spray dosed 1.0 mg/kg was compared to morphine administration as IV or IM and was shown to be equal efficient in pain treatment (Shimonovich et al. (2016) &#x201c;Intranasal ketamine for acute traumatic pain in emergency department: a prospective, randomized clinical trial of efficacy and safety&#x201d;, BMC Emergency Medicine, 2016, 16:43). The time to onset was approx. 15 min and the side effects were mainly dizziness. No patients complained of hallucinations or out of-body experience (Shimonovich et al. (2016) &#x201c;Intranasal ketamine for acute traumatic pain in emergency department: a prospective, randomized clinical trial of efficacy and safety&#x201d;, BMC Emergency Medicine, 2016, 16:43). In another study, 50 mg ketamine was dosed by intranasal spray for treatment of severe depression as 5 times 100 &#x3bc;L over 20 minutes (Lapidus et al. (2014) &#x201c;A Randomized controlled tril of intranasal ketamine in major depressive disorder&#x201d;, Biol. Psychiatry, 15:76970-976). No serious adverse effects occurred during the study. The treatment with nasal spray resulted in rapid improvement of the depressive symptoms and limited adverse effects (Lapidus et al. (2014) &#x201c;A Randomized controlled tril of intranasal ketamine in major depressive disorder&#x201d;, Biol. Psychiatry, 2014 December 15:76(12), 970-976).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Ketamine is categorized as a controlled drug in the U.S. and EU due to its potential recreational misuse. Ketamine can be abused in high doses and causes psychological dependence but no physical withdrawal state is observed after cessation of long-term abuse. It can produce state of dissociated experiences out of body state and hallucinations (Sleigh, J. et al. (2014) &#x201c;Ketamine-more mechanisms of action than just NMDA blockade. Trends in anesthesia and critical care&#x201d; 4: 76-81). However, the risk of using ketamine in low doses for treatment of e.g. severe pain and/or major depressive conditions should be balanced by the obtained positive effects (Krusz, J. C. IV ketamine in the clinic to treat Cluster Headache, poster abstract, American Academy of Neurology, published in: Supplement to Neurology: 72, #11, p. A 89-90, March 2009).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Intravenous treatment (IV) with ketamine has been used clinically, under very safe conditions by a very limited number of clinicians, to treat migraines, Cluster headache and other rare pain disorders including mixed headache and neuropathic pain clinical syndromes: (J. C. Krusz, IV ketamine in the clinic to treat Cluster Headache, poster abstract, American Academy of Neurology, published in: Supplement to Neurology: 72, #11, p. A89-90, March 2009; Krusz, J C, Cagle, J, V B Scott-Krusz, Ketamine for treating multiple types of headaches. Poster, 14<sup>th </sup>Congress International Headache Society, in: Cephalalgia 29, Supplement 1, p. 163, October 2009; J C Krusz, J Cagle, IV Ketamine: Rapid Treatment for All TAC Subtypes in the Clinic, Abstract Poster #72, 15<sup>th </sup>Congress of the International Headache Society, Berlin, Germany, June 2011; J C Krusz, J Cagle, IM ketamine for intractable headaches and migraines, poster abstract, American Headache Society Annual Meeting, Los Angeles, Calif., June 2012; and J C Krusz, Ketamine IV&#x2014;for CRPS, TN/TMD and other neuropathic pain in the outpatient clinic, poster #524, 4<sup>th </sup>International Congress on Neuropathic Pain, Toronto, Ontario, May 2013). According to JC Krusz, the drug administration by IV (usually 500-1000 mL of normal saline in a bag) is running for treatment of e.g. migraine or Cluster headache in a period of hours. Dosage is calculated on the basis of body weight and initial treatment is started at approximately 0.2-0.25 mg/kg of body weight. The dose used is far below what is administered for anesthesia (6.5-13.5 mg/kg of body weight). However, IV administration is not convenient for self-administration and can only be administered safely to patients under clinical conditions (supervision). Further, IV administration is often associated with side effects. JC Krusz has reported that patients (approximately 43% of all IV treated patients) complained of spaciness, fearfulness, jitteriness or lack of personal control. Some patients (3.2%) experienced nausea at some point during the IV treatment. US 2014/0275278 discloses use of ketamine (S-ketamine) nasal spray for self-administering treatment of severe depression. US 1996/5543434 discloses (R,S)-ketamine for treatment of general pain.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is a continuing need for providing a dosage form of ketamine in an amount effective for the treatment of patients suffering from Cluster headache with fewer or no side effects than the known treatments, and for providing a dosage form useful for safe self-administration for the convenience of the patients.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It has surprisingly and unexpectedly been found that patients suffering from Cluster headache (CH), either chronic CH (cCH) or episodic CH (eCH), advantageously may be treated with intranasal ketamine, that is by nasal systemic drug delivery of a composition, comprising ketamine.

The cCH patients were be dosed with an intranasal spray containing 172.5 mg ketamine hydrochloride corresponding to 150 mg ketamine per ml in an aqueous solution. The individual dosing includes 15 mg ketamine as ketamine hydrochloride salt in sprayed volume of 100 &#x3bc;L into one nose nostril by supervision of a nurse.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The treatment was initiated at T=0 (T0) under a CH attack when the headache pain exceeds NRS=6 on an NRS pain scale. The first intranasal dose of 15 mg was given at T=0 and at time intervals of 6 minutes. At 15 minutes after 3 doses (45 mg) it was evaluated whether the patient was sufficiently pain relieved (e.g. NRS &#x3c;4) or wanted to receive rescue medications instead or, if pain was not sufficiently relieved, wanted to continue until 5 doses (75 mg) were received at time point T=24. The final evaluation of the treatment was performed at T=30. During the study the primary response was the NRS score. Associated parameters as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation were monitored as well as potential adverse effects. The NRS scale refers to Numeric Rating Scale of pain (0=no pain; 1-3=mild pain; 4-6=moderate pain; 7-9=severe pain; 10=worst pain imaginable).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Intranasal Dosing</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The PK-model of ketamine follows a two-compartment model (central volume (plasma) compartment and peripheral compartments).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Ketamine was absorbed in this case from the intranasal cavity into the central volume (plasma) where it distributes and redistributes to deeper peripheral compartments. The elimination follows oxidation primarily via the CYP3A4 enzyme system in the liver to norketamine and further into other metabolites, all of which are pharmacologically inactive. The rate constants were taken from BMC Emergency Medicine, 2016, 16:43 including estimation of the first order absorption rate constant from the intranasal reservoir. The following first order rate constants were applied to the model as k<sub>a</sub>=5.73 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, k<sub>12</sub>=8.84 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, k<sub>21</sub>=1.62 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and k<sub>10</sub>=1.55 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The terminal elimination half-life is approx. 2 hours (&#x3b2;-phase). The resulting plasma profile derived from numerical cumulation in the simulation program Stella&#xae; 8.0 by input of 6 consecutive intranasal dosing of 15 mg with time interval of 6 minutes results in the plasma profile shown according to study design. It is assumed that the person has a body weight of 70 kg and a central distribution volume of 24 L. The concentration in plasma of ketamine on the y-axis was given as mg in the central distribution volume. A total of 15 mg ketamine is dosed 5 times corresponding to 75 mg. The bioavailability was approx. 50%. It means a maximum exposure of a 0.5 mg/kg of body weight which was significantly below the dosing for anesthesia (min 6.5 mg/kg of body weight).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Statistical Analysis</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Formal calculation of required study size requires knowledge of standard deviation in response (NRS score) for treatment of CCH with intranasal ketamine. Since these data are not available the sample size is determined based on what is normally seen in similar POC pilot studies, which is n=20. The mean pain intensity at peak (NRS-score) and pain at T15 and T30 (NRS-score) is compared using the paired t-test.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Experimental Procedures, Patients</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The patients enrolled for the trial complied with the diagnostic criteria of chronic CH as defined in the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3<sup>rd </sup>Edition.

The cluster headaches tended to flare up in the springtime lasting up to three months at a time with about 4 to 6 episodes per day. This prevented him from working. In the outpatient clinic he received IV treatment with ketamine, which resulted in the complete cessation of the cluster headaches in three days of dedicated IV treatment (with resolution of allodynia on the right side as well). He was very pleased and elected to try intranasal ketamine at the first onset of the next cluster headache episode. 15 mg per nasal spray were used, as described above. He had no side effects to the ketamine (like dysphoria or out-of-body side effects). He reported feeling better after 2-3 sprays and feeling calm as well. Sometimes, he had to repeat the dosing in the AM or the next day.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0067">Case 2: A 55 years old woman had cluster headaches episodically, along with three to four per week migraines, along with chronic neck pain and trigeminal neuralgia (TN) on the right side. The cluster headaches started at age 27, with tearing, allodynia and facial numbness. Sometimes the migraine would evolve into a cluster episode that came on during her sleep and was seasonal as well, lasting about 2 months on average. She was not a smoker and there was no family history of cluster headache. There was a family history of migraines, though. She was treated very successfully for the migraines, right TN and neck pain with Botox treatments, every 3-5 months, supplemented by other prophylaxis neuropathically-active medications, but no opiates. The Botox treatment did not affect the cluster headaches, except where they evolved from the migraines, and only to a slight extent [15-20%]. Multiple acute and prophylaxis therapies were attempted to resolve the cluster headache episodes to no significant avail. IV ketamine was tried on one occasion in a four day series of treatments during a cluster headache episode and shut off the ongoing process from 5 episodes per day to only one cluster headache in the next week and resolving with extra oral oxcarbazepine dosage of 600 mg. Nasal spray ketamine was then compounded at 10 mg per 0.1 cc spray with the suggestion that she spray one nostril, the right one, every 10-15 minutes to give the medical time to absorb from the nasal mucosa and to repeat the process until at least 75% relief was obtained. She was very happy with this approach as it gave her control of her hardest to treat symptom. She also noticed that the cluster headache episodes were beginning to get less frequent over about a year and her migraines and TN also definitely got better and Botox intervals were longer overtime.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0068">Case 3: A 34 years old male, who worked in the construction industry began having episodic cluster headache episodes at age 22. There was a migraine and cluster headache history in the family as well. The cluster headache was season-specific, occurring mostly in the early summer of each or every other year. They were very disabling and often awoke this gentleman from a sound sleep for several weeks. He had been given many oral medications, including opiates, for suppression of his symptoms without any real benefit and many side effects. When visiting the outpatient clinic, he was treated with IV lidocaine, IV Depacon and IV Magnesium sulfate with only partial success in shutting the episode down. He was offered IV treatment with ketamine during the beginning of one of his episodes, and it proved to work more effectively and to shorten the duration of the cluster episode by greater than two-thirds [6-7 weeks to one week-10 days]. On this result, he received compounded nasal spray ketamine [7.5 mg per 0.1 cc spray], and was instructed to use this at bedtime, with additional sprays in one nostril, the affected side of the cluster headache, every 10 minutes until significant relief was obtained to at least 75%. He was also instructed to use the same approach during the day when the cluster headache returned. He used nasal spray ketamine for several years and his overall pattern became easier to treat successfully. The episodes grew further apart and he has only had one short cluster</p><p id="p-0066" num="0069">For the cases 1-3: On a 0 to 10 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) patients were above 65% from initial baseline from the use of the ketamine spray. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as &#x2018;no pain at all&#x2019; and &#x2018;pain as bad as it could be&#x2019;. The patient was asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between &#x2018;no pain at all&#x2019; and the mark then defines the subject's pain. Efficacy, as well as safety and tolerability, of sub-anesthetic low dose IV ketamine were seen consistently. Increased dysphoria or nausea was not noted. No out-off body experiences, or hallucinations were observed.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0070">In conclusion, intranasal ketamine is a legitimate pharmacologic treatment and is safe and effective for cluster headache rescue. It adds another new dimension to treatment of out-of-control cluster headaches in an outpatient setting with no monitoring. Intranasal ketamine represents an extremely viable and specific pharmacologic agent with a very specific mechanism of action on blockade of NMDA-type and perhaps other subtypes of the same glutamate receptor family and truly represents a new treatment option.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
