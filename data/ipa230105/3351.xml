Chinese patent application number 202110735320.1 is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a field of projection lamps, and in particular to a starry sky projection lamp.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">At present, projection devices have long been constrained in form, and the function of projection devices is relatively simple. With the development of society, people have higher and higher requirements for art and the beautification of the surrounding living environment. However, due to the fast pace of life and full schedule of modern people, people do not have much time to enjoy the beautiful starry sky of nature in the wild. Due to factors such as weather and living environment, people have fewer opportunities to watch the starry sky, or even the galaxy in the starry sky, and it is not convenient. In order to meet people's requirements, some projection lamps for projecting a starry sky have also appeared on the market. Projection technology is used to project the cosmic starry sky and other patterns on the roof or wall of the home, and the bright starry sky can be seen through the projection projected by projection lamps.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The existing projection lamps have the following shortcomings:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">1. The existing projection lamps project stationary starry sky images, which cannot simulate the movement of actual stars and nebula.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. The existing projection method of the projection lamps is to realize the projection pattern by hollowing out the lampshade, and it is impossible to simulate the real nebula.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">3. A projection direction of the existing projection lamps cannot be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">4. The existing projection lamps include a fixed optical sheet, a rotating optical, and a lens, which has a complicated structure and a high cost.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure provides a lamp for projecting a nebula and a starry sky, and the lamp can achieve two functions of projecting the nebula and projecting the starry sky without a fixed optical sheet.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to solve the technical problem, a first technical solution of the present disclosure is as follows.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A lamp for projecting a nebula and a starry sky comprises a housing, a light source assembly, a laser assembly, a rotating assembly, a control board, a base seat, and a power source port. The light source assembly and the laser assembly are disposed in the housing and penetrate through the housing, and the rotating assembly and the control board are disposed in the housing. The rotating assembly is configured to drive a rotating optical sheet of the light source assembly and a diffraction sheet to rotate, and the base seat is fixedly disposed in the housing. The power source port is disposed on the control board and penetrates through the housing, and the light source assembly comprises a light source board, a light reflecting cup, the rotating optical sheet, and a lens assembly. The light source board is fixedly disposed in the housing, and the light source board, the light reflecting cup, the rotating optical sheet, and the lens assembly are successively disposed along a path in which light rays emitted by the light source board move. The rotating optical sheet is rotatably connected to the rotating assembly, and the lens assembly is fixedly disposed on the housing. A first side of a lens of the lens assembly facing the rotating optical sheet has a convex surface, and a second side of the lens of the lens assembly facing away from the rotating optical sheet has a frosted surface having an array of protrusions. The light reflecting cup is configured to reduce a lighting angle of the light rays emitted by the light source board so as to enable the light rays emitted by the light source board to be projected onto the rotating optical sheet to scatter the light rays emitted by the light source board. The light rays scattered by the rotating optical sheet are configured to be projected onto a projection plane to form a projection of the nebula through the lens assembly after being scattered by the frosted surface of the lens assembly, and the rotating assembly is configured to drive the rotating optical sheet to rotate so as to make the projection of the nebula flow.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment, the housing comprises an upper housing and a lower housing, and the upper housing and the lower housing are connected to each other to define a chamber.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a preferred embodiment, the rotating optical sheet is frosted glass.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a preferred embodiment, the laser assembly comprises a laser emitter and a heat sink, and the laser emitter is disposed in a through channel of the heat sink.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a preferred embodiment, the rotating assembly comprises a motor, a transmission gear, a light source rotating gear, and a laser rotating gear, and the motor is fixedly disposed in the housing and comprises an output shaft operatively coupled to the transmission gear. The transmission gear is operatively coupled to each of the light source rotating gear and the laser rotating gear, and the rotating optical sheet is operatively coupled to the light source rotating gear. The laser rotating gear comprises a hollow protruding column extending outward along an axis of the laser rotating gear, and the diffraction sheet is disposed on a distal end of the hollow protruding column. A laser beam emitted by the laser emitter is configured to pass through the hollow protruding column and the diffraction sheet so as to form a moving projection of stars.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, the base seat comprises two supporting columns for supporting the hollow protruding column, and each of the two supporting columns comprises an arc groove matched with an outer wall of the hollow protruding column.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a preferred embodiment, the control board comprises a wireless communication module configured to be connected to a remote controller.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a preferred embodiment, the lens assembly is fastened between the upper housing and the lower housing.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a preferred embodiment, the lens assembly comprises a lens lower lid, a lens upper lid, a plastic sheet, and the lens. The lens is fixedly disposed between the lens lower lid and the lens upper lid, and the plastic sheet is fixedly disposed on the lens upper lid in a hot melt manner.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a preferred embodiment, the base seat comprises a plurality of slots for fixing the light source board and the fixed optical sheet.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Compared with the existing techniques, the technical solution has the following advantages.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">1. The lamp in the present disclosure comprises the motor, and the motor drives the light source rotating gear and the laser rotating gear to rotate to enable the rotating optical sheet and the diffraction sheet to rotate in the housing so as to actually simulate rotating images of the nebula and the starry sky.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">2. The lamp in the present disclosure comprises the laser assembly, and the laser assembly cooperates with the diffraction sheet to form the projection of stars. The light rays emitted by the light source board successively pass through the rotating optical sheet and the lens assembly to be projected to form the projection of the nebula, so that the projection of the nebula has a stronger sense of reality. The projection of the nebula is better than a projection projected by a lamp with a piercing lampshade, and the projection of the nebula can move periodically, so that the projection of the nebula is more similar to a real nebula. The light rays can be scattered due to the lens having the frosted surface, so that the fixed optical sheet can be omitted to simplify a structure of the lamp and reduce a cost of the lamp.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">3. The lamp in the present disclosure has a smaller size, and when the lamp is placed on a desk or other supporting object, a projection direction of the lamp is easy to adjust, which has fewer limitations.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">4. The lamp in the present disclosure can be remotely controlled by a remote controller, and the remote controller can separately control turning ON and OFF of the light source board and the laser emitter so as to project at least one of the projection of stars or the projection of the nebula.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a lamp of a preferred embodiment in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of the lamp with an upper housing removed of a preferred embodiment in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an exploded view of the lamp of a preferred embodiment in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a lens assembly of a preferred embodiment in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a light source assembly of a preferred embodiment in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a laser assembly of a preferred embodiment in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a rotating assembly of a preferred embodiment in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a second side of a lens facing away from a rotating optical sheet of a preferred embodiment in the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present disclosure will be further described below in combination with the accompanying drawings and embodiments.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The following will clearly and completely describe the technical solutions in the embodiments of the present disclosure with reference to the accompanying drawings.
