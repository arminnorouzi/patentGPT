conserved in various prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, has formed the subject of numerous studies designed to investigate their structural and functional characteristics (Bartorelli et al. J. Tumor and Marker Oncology, 1994, 9, 37; Lambrecht J A et al., J. Biol. Chem., 285, 34401-34407; Lambrecht J A et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2012, 287, 3454-3461; Mistiniene E et al, Bioconjugate Chem. 2003, 14, 1243-1252; Dhawan L et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 2012, 32, 3768-3775; Flynn J M et al., Mol. Microbiol., 2013, 89(4)751-759; Ernst D C et al., J. Bacteriology, 2014, 196 (18), 3335-3342; Niehaus T D et al., BMC Genomics, 2015, 16, 382). Said family includes RiD (reactive intermediate/imine deaminase) proteins. WO 9602567 describes the antitumoral activity of a goat liver extract with perchloric acid (called UK 101) containing protein UK 114. Said protein has a molecular weight of 14.2 kDa and the sequence of 137 amino acids reported in Ceciliani F. et al., FEBS Letters, 1996, 393, 147-150. The native protein UK 114, isolated from the liver of various mammal species, and/or proteins cross-reacting with it, are only present in the cytoplasm of normal cells, whereas they are also present on the cell membrane of malignant tumour cells (Bartorelli A, et al., Int J Oncol. 1996 March; 8(3):543-8.; Bussolati G, et al., Int J Oncol. 1997 April; 10(4):779-85), especially adenocarcinoma, in a percentage exceeding 80%. The expression of UK 114 goat protein in recombinant <i>E. coli </i>was described in WO 0063368 and Colombo I et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1998, 1442, 49-59. More recently, EP 3554639 described a multimeric, in particular trimeric, recombinant form of UK 114 which exhibits increased immunogenic properties useful in the treatment of tumours.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It has now been found that Rid/UK114 salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) proteins, when injected into animals or humans, induce the production of antibodies cytotoxic to tumour cells to an unexpectedly greater extent than found to date with goat (<i>Capra hircus</i>) proteins of the same family.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The subject of the invention is therefore UK 114 salmon proteins for use in the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of malignant tumours, and in particular for the immunisation of individuals treated for tumours, adjuvant treatment, and vaccination of individuals at risk of onset or recurrence of malignant tumours.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Rid/UK114 salmon proteins are also useful for passive immunisation with monoclonal antibodies of individuals suffering from or treated for tumours, adjuvant treatment, and treatment of individuals at risk of onset or recurrence of malignant tumours.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The sequence of Rid/UK114 salmon proteins is known.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The amino acid sequences are reported below.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Amino&#x2003;acid&#x2003;sequence&#x2003;SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;1&#x2003;(UK&#x2003;114&#x2003;RidA-A):</entry></row><row><entry>GSHMSSIIRKIINTSKAPAAIGPYSQAVVVDRTMYVSGQLGMDPASGQLV</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>EGGVQAQTKQALVNMGEILKEAGCGYDSVVKTTVLLADMNDFASVNDVYK</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>TFFSSSFPARAAYQVAALPRGGLVEIEAVAVLGPLTEVS</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>Amino&#x2003;acid&#x2003;sequence&#x2003;SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;2&#x2003;(UK&#x2003;114&#x2003;RidA-B):</entry></row><row><entry>GSHMAAVQKLFPYTPRAPIRQGIYSQAVVVDRTMYISGQLGLDVASGKLV</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>EGGVQAQARQALVNMGEILKAAGCGYDNVVKTTVLLADMNDFVNVNDVYK</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>TFFSKNFPARAAYQVVALPRGGLVEIEAVAVLGPISES.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">Form A (UKA) is a homotrimer with a molecular weight of 43.5 kDa.

The doses for therapeutic, prophylactic and vaccinal applications can range from 1 to 50 mg per administration. A typical vaccination protocol involves 4 administrations, one every fortnight. 20/30 days after the last dose, a booster dose 4 times higher is given. The immunotherapy is monitored with laboratory tests to evaluate the antibody count and cytotoxicity. The treatment can continue until a satisfactory clinical result is achieved (reduction or disappearance of the tumour mass), with boosters given at intervals, depending on the antibody count monitored with laboratory tests, to prevent overimmunisation leading to the risk of immune tolerance. As an alternative to protein administration, the corresponding DNA can be injected by the DNA vaccination technique.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">The protein can also be used to prepare monoclonal antibodies which are useful for intramuscular or intravenous passive immunotherapy, and passive seroprophylaxis of immunodepressed patients and/or those who fail to respond to specific immunotherapy.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">For example, human monoclonal antibodies can be obtained by fusing a human-mouse myeloma K6H6/B5 with lymphocytes transformed with Epstein-Barr virus from patients pre-treated with the protein. IgM-secreting clones which are cytotoxic to tumour cells in the presence of complement are preferred. Alternatively, humanised murine IgM monoclonal antibodies or human IgM-secreting monoclonal antibodies produced in transgenic animals can be used.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">The invention is described in detail in the examples set out below.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Example 1.

The transformed cells are cultured in a suitable medium (LB+antibiotics), and protein expression is induced with IPTG for 4 hours at 37&#xb0; C. This induction time and the temperature of 37&#xb0; C. are ideal for the production of RidA-A and RidA-B proteins, as already demonstrated for UK114 goat protein. Electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel containing SDS (SDS-PAGE), and staining of the proteins with Coomassie Blue, are conducted to verify the expression of the proteins of interest. The clones tested express the recombinant proteins His-tag-RidA-A or His-tag-RidA-B at a high level, and said proteins are present in the soluble fraction of the cell extract. His-tag-RidA-A or His-tag-RidA-B can be purified by exploiting the affinity of the polyhistidine-tag for nickel resin. The soluble fraction obtained from cells collected 4 hours after induction at 37&#xb0; C. is incubated with the resin to allow the His-tag of the recombinant protein of interest to bind to the nickel conjugated with the resin. The flow-through (everything not bonded to the resin) is then collected, and after various washes the protein is eluted with a high concentration of imidazole which competes with histidine for the nickel bond. The sample, obtained by pooling the eluates with a significant concentration of His-tag-RidA-Ar or His-tag-RidA-B protein, is dialysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The sample is then incubated with thrombin, a serine protease which specifically recognises the cleavage site at the N-terminal end between the protein sequence and the His-tag sequence, allowing the tag to be removed. The RidA-A or RidA-B proteins are then purified by Size Exclusion Chromatography using a Superdex 75 column, Ge Healthcare, coupled to FPLC (running buffer: saline solution). After checking the fractions eluted by gel filtration on SDS PAGE, the fractions containing the RidA-A or RidA-B proteins are pooled, and the concentration thereof is assayed by UV spectrum and BCA assay.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Example 2.

In all cases, while goat protein is inactive or poorly active, salmon proteins A and B induce activation of the innate immune cells (monocytes, &#x201c;ncMo&#x201d; monocytes and NK cells) and the other cell types (dendritic cells) also involved in different stages of the adaptive immune response.

Each animal was injected subcutaneously at three different points. 10 days after the fourth immunisation, blood samples were taken from the central ear vein of the rabbits and the caudal vein of the mice. The immune response was tested by WB and immunofluorescence flow cytometry on tumour cells, and the hyperimmune sera were tested for their ability to induce cytotoxicity on various tumour cell and normal cell lines.
