a second elastic wave resonator including a second IDT electrode and a second dielectric film. A Rayleigh wave travels along at least one surface of the elastic wave device. A thickness of the first dielectric film differs from a thickness of the second dielectric film. A propagation direction of an elastic wave in the first elastic wave resonator coincides with a propagation direction of an elastic wave in the second elastic wave resonator.
