Compared with long-term evolution (LTE), the 5G new radio (NR) technology have a much wider spectrum, for example, including millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands. With the development of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) and/or multiple-beam systems, the 5G NR may provide a much faster speed and much shorter latency. The 5G NR may include a development of an integrated access backhaul (IAB) implementation. The IAB implementation may include one or more IAB-donors and multiple connecting IAB-nodes. The IAB implementation may communicate between one or more IAB-donors and one or more IAB-nodes via wireless backhaul and relay links. The IAB implementation may provide a flexible NR cell configuration and increase cell density without increasing the density of IAB-donors.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">An IAB system may include one or more IAB-donors and one or more IAB-nodes, which collectively provide wireless connection service to one or more user equipment (UEs) (e.g., smartphones). The IAB-donors and IAB-nodes may be wireless network base stations including a NG radio access network (NG-RAN) base station, which may include a nodeB (NB, e.g., a gNB) in a mobile telecommunications context. The IAB-donor may provide access backhaul to one or more connecting child IAB-nodes, and may connect to a core network via a wired communication. In one implementation, the core network may include a 5G core network (5GC). In another implementation, the wired communication may include a fiber transport communication. The IAB-node may include wireless access link and wireless backhaul link. The wireless access link may be used for communication between a UE and the IAB-node. The wireless backhaul link may be used for communication between the IAB-node and the IAB-donor, and/or communications between one IAB-node with another IAB-node. Thus, the IAB-node does not need a wired communication network for data backhaul. In some implementations, the IAB-node does not include a wired communication network for data backhaul, so that IAB-node are more flexible and easier to implement, mitigating the burden of implementing wired communication network. The access link and backhaul link may use transmission bands with same frequency (known as in-band relay), or use transmission bands with different frequency (known as out-band relay).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the IAB-donor <b>130</b> may provide access backhaul <b>140</b> to one or more connecting child IAB-nodes (<b>152</b> and <b>154</b>).
