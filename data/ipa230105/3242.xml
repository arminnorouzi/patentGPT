Certain segments of the population, such as the poor or elderly, may be especially susceptible to the increased cost and decreased availability of housing. As a result, many people are either living in substandard housing or are forced to commute long distances to work at their jobs.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the issues exacerbating this housing crisis is the amount of time and resources that are necessary to construct a single family home or a multi-unit dwelling. Such constructions times can take anywhere from several weeks to several months or more, and may require teams of workers and contractors to construct a home or dwelling at a construction site.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to time constraints, current building practices rely upon a division of labor and responsibilities to incorporate technology into the home or dwelling unit. As such, a primary contractor may be responsible for erecting the structural components that are used to modify walls or other structural components to incorporate various types of technologies and capabilities, including networking, communications, and sensing capabilities, into the structure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Modular structures may be used to decrease construction time for various types of dwelling units. At least portions of such modular units may pre-fabricated at a facility located away from the construction site, and shipped to the construction site to be quickly and efficiently incorporated into the modular structure. Because such portions may be pre-fabricated to be included within multiple types of modular structures, the cost of such fabrication may be kept relatively low. One example of a known modular structure is described in PCT Application No. PCT/US2019/030465, filed May 2, 2019, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a known modular structure <b>100</b> has a subfloor <b>102</b> that may be tilted to slope downwardly towards an interior portion <b>104</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b>. The modular structure <b>100</b> may have a length <b>106</b>, a width <b>108</b>, and a height <b>110</b>. In some implementations, the modular structure <b>100</b> may also include a frame <b>112</b> and a floor <b>114</b>. The frame <b>112</b> may be comprised of metal (e.g., steel), a composite material (e.g., oriented strand board, fiber reinforced polymers), or other materials. The frame <b>112</b> may extend through one or more of the length <b>106</b>, the width <b>108</b>, and/or the height <b>110</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b>, and may delineate an interior portion <b>122</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b> from an exterior <b>124</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b>. All or substantially all of the materials employed in the modular structure <b>100</b> may be fireproof or fire resistant (e.g., glass fiber reinforced sheetrock, steel, mineral wool) and/or may have a fire retardant coating or covering thereon.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The frame <b>112</b> may include one or more structural frame members <b>118</b>. Each of the structural members of the frame <b>112</b> may extend along one or more of the length <b>106</b>, width <b>108</b>, and/or height <b>110</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b>. The structural members may be used to outline a shape for the modular structure <b>100</b>. For example, the structural members may include a set of vertical structural frame members <b>118</b><i>a</i>, a set of lower horizontal structural frame members <b>118</b><i>b</i>, and a set of upper horizontal structural frame members <b>118</b><i>c </i>that may be used to outline a three dimensional shape, such as a cuboid. As such, the set of lower horizontal structural frame members <b>118</b><i>b </i>may include a first pair of opposing lower horizontal structural frame members <b>118</b><i>b </i>that extend along the length <b>106</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b>, and a second pair of opposing lower horizontal structural frame members <b>118</b><i>b </i>that extend along the width <b>108</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The set of upper horizontal structural frame members <b>118</b><i>c </i>in such an implementation may include a first pair of opposing upper horizontal structural frame members <b>118</b><i>c </i>that extend along the length <b>106</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b>, and a second pair of opposing upper horizontal structural frame members <b>118</b><i>c </i>that extend along the width <b>108</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b>. The vertical structural frame members <b>118</b><i>a </i>in such an implementation may extend between the lower horizontal structure frame members <b>118</b><i>b </i>and the upper horizontal structural frame members <b>118</b><i>c</i>. In such an implementation, the set of lower horizontal members <b>118</b><i>b </i>may form a perimeter <b>120</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b>.

Such criteria may reflect the environment and/or usage of the modular structure <b>100</b>. For example, the dimensions of the modular structure <b>100</b> may be the same or substantially similar to the dimensions of one or more types of intermodal container (e.g., 20-foot containers or 40-foot containers) to facilitate transport via various modes of transportation (e.g., ships, trains, trucks) to a location. In such an implementation, the modular structure <b>100</b> may include other features or components that reflect the environment and/or usage of the modular structure <b>100</b>. For example, in implementations in which the modular structure <b>100</b> has the same or substantially similar dimensions to a type of intermodal container, the modular structure <b>100</b> may include one or more couplers (e.g., twist lock fittings) at appropriate locations such that the modular structure <b>100</b> may be selectively, releaseably, physically coupled and secured to other intermodal containers for transport.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some implementations, the modular structure <b>100</b> may include a floor <b>114</b> that extends across some or all of the length <b>106</b> and/or the width <b>108</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b> proximate a bottom portion <b>128</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b>. The floor may be physically coupled to the frame <b>112</b> using one or more physical couplers (e.g., bolts, screws, nails, staples, adhesives). The floor <b>114</b> may include an upper surface <b>130</b> that faces toward the interior portion <b>122</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b> and an opposing lower surface <b>132</b> that faces toward the exterior <b>124</b> of the modular structure. The upper surface <b>130</b> may be separated from the opposing lower surface <b>132</b> by a thickness <b>134</b> of the floor <b>114</b> in which one or both of the upper surface <b>130</b> and the lower surface <b>132</b> may be substantially parallel to a horizontal plane. As such, the upper surface <b>130</b> may be used to support items located within the interior portion <b>122</b> of the modular structure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some implementations, the floor <b>114</b> may be supported by one or more support members that may extend across length <b>106</b> and/or the width <b>108</b> of the modular structure. For example, in some implementations, one or more metal beams may extend across the width <b>108</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b> along the bottom portion <b>128</b> of the modular structure <b>100</b>. The lower surface <b>132</b> of the floor <b>114</b> may thereby rest on top of such support members.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The modular structure <b>100</b> may include one or more sealing systems <b>148</b> that may be used to create a waterproof seal and/or an air-tight seal within the modular structure <b>100</b> or between components thereof.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A number of structural frame members <b>118</b> may be physically coupled together using a connector <b>150</b>, as shown in the call out in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Each connector <b>150</b> may include a first leg <b>152</b> and a second leg <b>154</b> in which the first leg <b>152</b> and the second leg <b>154</b> are arranged at an angle to each other. The angle formed by the first leg <b>152</b> and the second leg <b>154</b> may be based, at least in part, on the shape of the modular structure <b>100</b>. In implementations in which the modular structure <b>100</b> forms a cuboid, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first leg <b>152</b> and the second leg <b>154</b> may be arranged at a ninety degree angle with respect to each other.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Each of the first leg <b>152</b> and the second leg <b>154</b> may have a respective cavity <b>156</b> (one shown) with an opening <b>158</b> that faces away from the connector <b>150</b>. The opening <b>158</b> and/or the cavity <b>156</b> may be shaped and dimensioned to receive one of the structural frame members <b>118</b> in the modular structure <b>100</b>. In some implementations, the opening <b>158</b> and/or cavity <b>156</b> may have dimensions that are only slightly larger than the outside dimensions of the structural frame member <b>118</b>. As such the structural frame member <b>118</b> may form a close fitting or tight physical coupling with the opening <b>158</b> and/or cavity <b>156</b>. In some implementations, one or more of the structural frame members <b>118</b> and the connector <b>150</b> may include a hollow cavity. In such implementations, such hollow cavities may be used to run one or more wires, cables, and/or optical fibers, as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some implementations, the connector <b>150</b> may have corresponding sidewall apertures <b>160</b> on opposing sidewalls of either or both of the first leg <b>152</b> and/or the second leg <b>154</b> (one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Each pair of opposing sidewall apertures <b>160</b> may align with a corresponding frame member aperture <b>162</b> when the structural frame member <b>118</b> is inserted into the cavity <b>156</b>. The frame member aperture <b>162</b> may extend through the structural frame member <b>118</b> such that the structural frame member <b>118</b> may be selectively, releaseably, physically secured to the connector <b>150</b> by, for example, inserting a pin <b>164</b> through the opposing sidewall apertures <b>160</b> and the frame member aperture <b>162</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The connector <b>150</b> may include a post <b>166</b> that may be oriented in a vertical direction to be physically coupled to one of the vertical structural frame members <b>118</b><i>a</i>.

As such, the post <b>166</b> and the vertical structure frame member <b>118</b><i>a </i>may be selectively, releasably physically secured to the connector <b>150</b> via the post <b>166</b>.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Multiple modular structures may be coupled together (e.g., vertically, horizontally, or both) to construct a larger building (e.g., a multi-unit dwelling or a commercial building). Methods of construction employing the use of modular structures present challenges regarding access to portions of those modular structures. For example, coupling one modular structure vertically with another modular structure may result in limited access to upper surfaces of the lower modular structure and lower surfaces of the upper modular structure as the upper and lower surfaces face each other in close proximity thereby limiting space for tools to engage components on those upper and lower surfaces.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Additionally, dependent on the region in which the building is constructed, hazards (e.g., environment hazards) may result in failure of structural components of the building. It may be desirable to control one or more facets (e.g., location, specific component, etc.) of such potential failures. Such control may prevent certain failure modes (e.g., total collapse), and may further facilitate repairs conducted after a failure event occurs.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">More generally, a connector that connects structural members within a structural block (e.g., hollow structural section beams and columns), and that also connects adjacent structural blocks (e.g., first and second hollow structural section columns) may result in a more stable modular structure, as well as reduced costs due to a reduction in parts and labor used in the production of such modular structures.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to one aspect of the disclosure, a connector includes a first joint, a second joint member, and a fastener. The first joint member includes a first tubular outer wall and a first outer cavity, the first outer cavity at least partially enclosed within the first tubular outer wall. The first joint member further includes a first tubular inner wall and a first inner cavity, the first inner wall positioned within the first outer cavity, and the first inner cavity at least partially enclosed within the first tubular inner wall such that at least a portion of a first inner surface of the first tubular outer wall faces at least a portion of a first outer surface of the first tubular inner wall. The first tubular inner wall forms a first opening and a second opening of the first inner cavity, the first opening spaced from the second opening along an axis that extends in a first direction.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The second joint member includes a second tubular outer wall and a second outer cavity, the second outer cavity at least partially enclosed within the second tubular outer wall. The second joint member further includes a second tubular inner wall and a second inner cavity, the second tubular inner wall positioned within the second outer cavity, and the second inner cavity at least partially enclosed within the second tubular inner wall such that at least a portion of a second inner surface of the second tubular outer wall faces at least a portion of a second outer surface of the second tubular inner wall. The second tubular inner wall forms a first opening and a second opening of the second inner cavity, the first opening spaced from the second opening along the axis. The fastener extends through the first opening of the first inner cavity, the second opening of the first inner cavity, the first opening of the second inner cavity, and the second opening of the second inner cavity to position the first joint member relative to the second joint member.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another aspect of the disclosure, a connector includes a joint member having a tubular outer wall and an outer cavity, the outer cavity at least partially enclosed within the tubular outer wall.

The structural frame <b>12</b> may include a plurality of structural members <b>14</b>. As shown, the plurality of structural members <b>14</b> may include vertical structural members <b>16</b> (also referred to herein as columns) and horizontal structural members <b>18</b> (also referred to herein as beams). According to one aspect of the disclosure, at least some of the plurality of structural members <b>14</b> may be tubular members (e.g. hollow structural sections).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">One or more of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> may be arranged such that the vertical structural members <b>16</b> are elongate along a first direction D<b>1</b>, for example a vertical direction (e.g., the direction perpendicular to the surface upon which the structural frame <b>12</b> rests). One or more of the horizontal structural members <b>18</b> may include lateral structural members <b>20</b> and longitudinal structural members <b>22</b>. The lateral structural members <b>20</b> may be elongate along a second direction D<b>2</b>, which may be perpendicular to the first direction D<b>1</b>. The longitudinal structural members <b>22</b> may be elongate along a third direction D<b>3</b>, which may be perpendicular to at least one of, for example both, the first direction D<b>1</b> and the second direction D<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The plurality of structural members <b>14</b> within the structural frame <b>12</b> may be different lengths. For example, the length of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> as measured along the first direction D<b>1</b> may be different than the length of one or both of the lateral structural members <b>20</b> as measured along the second direction D<b>2</b> and the longitudinal structural members <b>22</b> as measured along the third direction D<b>3</b>. According to another embodiment, the length of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> as measured along the first direction D<b>1</b> may be the same as the length of one or both of the lateral structural members <b>20</b> as measured along the second direction D<b>2</b> and the longitudinal structural members <b>22</b> as measured along the third direction D<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to one embodiment, each of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> within the structural frame <b>12</b> may be the same length so as to establish a constant height of the structural frame <b>12</b>. Similarly, each of the lateral structural members <b>20</b> within the structural frame <b>12</b> may be the same length so as to establish a constant width of the structural frame <b>12</b>.

Similarly, one or more of the lateral structural members <b>20</b> may be a different length compared to others of the lateral structural members <b>20</b> within the structural frame <b>12</b> to establish a varying width of the structural frame <b>12</b>. Similarly, one or more of the longitudinal structural members <b>22</b> may be a different length compared to others of the longitudinal structural members <b>22</b> within the structural frame <b>12</b> to establish a varying depth of the structural frame <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The structural blocks <b>12</b> may be described as including a number, for example 2 or more, moment frames <b>24</b>. Each of the moment frames <b>24</b> may include two or more moment connections. According to one embodiment, a moment connection is a joint that allows the transfer of bending moment forces between two members, such as a column and a beam. Members of the moment frame <b>24</b> are rigidly connected, for example by welding or a connector, so as to resist bending moments and shear forces applied to the modular structure <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The moment frames <b>24</b>, as shown, may include two of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> each coupled to two of the horizontal structural members <b>18</b> by a moment connection. Thus, according to one embodiment, the moment frame <b>24</b> may include four moment connections. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the moment frame <b>24</b> may include other numbers of members and moment connections. For example, the moment frame <b>24</b> may be in the form of a goalpost having two of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> and one of the horizontal structural members <b>18</b> and two moment connections joining the horizontal structural member <b>18</b> to both of the vertical structural members <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to one embodiment, the structural frame <b>12</b> may include a series of moment frames <b>24</b> that each include a pair of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> and a pair of the lateral structural members <b>20</b> connecting the pair of the vertical structural members <b>16</b>. Adjacent ones of the series of moment frames <b>24</b> may be connected by a plurality, for example four, of the longitudinal structural members <b>22</b>. According to one embodiment, the longitudinal structural members <b>22</b> connecting adjacent ones of the moment frames <b>24</b> may be non-rigidly connected, for example by friction fit or protrusion and recess, to the adjacent moment frames <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown, the moment frame <b>24</b> may be in the form of a closed shape, such as a square tube <b>26</b>, that includes two vertical structural members <b>16</b>, and two horizontal structural members <b>18</b>, for example two lateral structural members <b>20</b>, each coupled to both of the two vertical structural members <b>16</b>. According to one embodiment the modular structure <b>10</b> may include a plurality of the moment frames <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The structural frame <b>12</b> may include one or more connectors <b>30</b> that attach and secure one of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> to at least one of the horizontal structural members <b>18</b>. According to one embodiment, some of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> may be joined to an adjacent horizontal structural members <b>18</b> with one of the connectors, while others of the adjacent horizontal structural members <b>18</b> may be joined by another method (e.g., directly welding the two members). According to another embodiment, one or more of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> may be joined to all of the adjacent horizontal structural members <b>18</b> with respective ones of the connectors <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, a plurality of the structural blocks <b>12</b> may be positioned and secured relative to one another to assemble a modular structure <b>10</b>.

For example, a base plate <b>11</b> (e.g., a metal base plate) may be present at the location, and the first structural frame <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be secured (e.g., welded) to it. According to one embodiment, one or more of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> (e.g., the bottom of all eight of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> shown), may be welded to the metal base plate or otherwise secured to the ground.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A second structural frame <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be secured adjacent to the first structural frame <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The second structural frame <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be secured (e.g., welded) to the metal base plate as the first structural frame <b>12</b><i>a</i>. According to one embodiment, one or more of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> (e.g., the bottom of up to six of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> shown), may be welded to the metal base plate or otherwise secured to the ground. Note that the two middle vertical structural members <b>16</b> that face the first structural frame <b>12</b><i>a </i>may not be accessible to secure to the metal base plate (e.g., if a floor, such as the floor <b>114</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is already installed that covers the bottom of the vertical structural members <b>16</b>).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The second structural frame <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be secured directly to the first structural frame <b>12</b><i>a</i>. According to one embodiment, a top of at least one pair of the vertical structural members <b>16</b> of the first structural frame <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the second structural frame <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be secured (e.g., welded) to one another. For example, the adjacent vertical structural members <b>16</b> that make up the four pairs of vertical structural members <b>16</b> may be welded together.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A third structural frame <b>12</b><i>c </i>may be secured on top of the first structural frame <b>12</b><i>a</i>.
