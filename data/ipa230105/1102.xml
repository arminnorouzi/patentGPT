A syringe functions as a pump and typically comprises a piston that is moveable within a barrel to expel fluid stored in the barrel out of an outlet of the barrel. The outlet of the barrel may communicate with a needle, such as a hypodermic needle. To prevent needle-stick injury during storage and transport of the syringe it is common to provide a rigid needle shield that is releasably mounted on the syringe to cover the needle prior to use.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Syringes may be provided with identification markings containing information such as the type of fluid (e.g. medicament) in the syringe, brand name(s), manufacturer details, lot and or batch numbers, marketing authorisation details, or product licence details. In clinical trial settings, syringes may be provided with identification markings containing other information such as trial number, lot number, group number, or similar to allow blinded studies to be carried out. In a &#x2018;blinded&#x2019; study it is important to ensure that the patient (also known as the trial participant) and also the user of the syringe (e.g. a doctor, nurse, or potentially the patient themselves) do not know the full details of what is being administered. In one example, it may be important to ensure that a patient and a user of the syringe are unaware whether a syringe contains an active medicament or a placebo. This may include obscuring any identification markings provided on the rigid needle shield.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">EP3524300 describes a blinding cap for covering a rigid needle shield that is covering a needle of a syringe and includes an elongated body extending between a proximal end and an opposing distal end, the body at least partially bounding a chamber. An annular sleeve can project from the proximal end of the body and at least partially bound a channel. A first flange radially inwardly projects from the body into the chamber, the first flange at least partially bounding an opening that provides communication between the chamber and the channel. The elongated body is comprised of first and second cap portions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In light of this background there is still a need to provide improvements in the blinding of parts of syringes, especially when such syringes are to be used in clinical trials where it is important that the user and or patient cannot readily identify the contents of the syringe. For example, there is a need to provide blinding caps that are more robust while being easier to assemble with the syringe.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a blinding cap for covering a rigid needle shield that is releasably mounted on a syringe, the blinding cap comprising a first part and a second part joined together by a hinge;<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">the first part comprising:        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0008">a first elongate bowl-shaped body defining a first recess;</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0009">a first flange portion located at a proximal end;</li>            <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0010">a first rim extending at least partially around an open mouth of the first elongate bowl-shaped body;</li>            <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0011">a raised lip extending at least partially along the first rim;</li>            <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0012">one or more fins that project inwardly from the first elongate bowl-shaped body; and</li>            <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0013">a first locking member;</li>            <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0014">the second part comprising:</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">a second elongate bowl-shaped body defining a second recess;        <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0016">a second flange portion located at a proximal end;</li>            <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0017">a second rim extending at least partially around an open mouth of the second elongate bowl-shaped body;</li>            <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0018">a recess extending at least partially along the second rim;</li>            <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0019">one or more fins that project inwardly from the second elongate bowl-shaped body; and</li>            <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0020">a second locking member;</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0021">wherein the blinding cap is configured such that the first part and the second part can be brought into engagement around the rigid needle shield by flexure of the hinge such that:</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0022">i) the raised lip of the first part is engaged in the recess of the second part;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0023">ii) the first locking member and the second locking member engage one another to lock the first part and the second part together;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0024">iii) the first recess and second recess together define a cavity for receiving the rigid needle shield of the syringe;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0025">iv) the first flange portion and the second flange portion are juxtaposed to form an inwardly-projecting flange that is configured to be disposed between an end surface of the rigid needle shield and a barrel of the syringe; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0026">v) the one or more fins of the first part and the second part are configured to engage the rigid needle shield.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0027">Advantageously, the blinding cap of the present disclosure provides for easy manual-handling of the blinding cap during blinding of a syringe.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0028">Advantageously, the engagement of the raised lip in the recess may function not only to improve the robustness of the closed blinding cap but also to increase the security of the blinding cap by blinding any crack that might be present between the first rim and the second rim.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0029">The one or more fins of the first part and the second part may together define a narrower bore within the cavity for engaging the rigid needle shield.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0030">The one or more fins of the first part and the second part may comprise a first portion defining an end stop for an end face of the rigid needle shield and/or a second portion defining a side stop for a side face of the rigid needle shield and/or a corner portion defining a corner stop for a corner of the rigid needle shield.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0031">The one or more fins of the first part and the second part may comprise one or more flexible fins or one or more rigid fins.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0032">Advantageously, the one or more fins of the first part and the second part may act together to grip or restrain movement of at least a portion of the rigid needle shield to limit or prevent rattling or movement of the rigid needle shield within the blinding cap.

The blinding cap <b>1</b> is intended to be combined with a syringe <b>100</b>, shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, to form a syringe assembly <b>200</b>, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The blinding cap <b>1</b> functions to cover a rigid needle shield <b>103</b> that is releasably mounted on a barrel <b>101</b> of the syringe <b>100</b> to shield a needle <b>102</b> of the syringe <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0097">The blinding cap <b>1</b> comprises a first collar section <b>2</b> and a second collar section <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The blinding cap <b>1</b> further comprises a sleeve section <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Preferably, the blinding cap <b>1</b> is formed of only these three parts.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0098">The first collar section <b>2</b>, the second collar section <b>3</b> and the sleeve section <b>4</b> are initially separate from one another, i.e. they are separate components which are assembled together to form the blinding cap <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0099">On assembly, the first collar section <b>2</b> and the second collar section <b>3</b> are engagable against each other to form a collar unit <b>10</b> for encircling the rigid needle shield <b>103</b> of the syringe <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b></figref>. The collar unit <b>10</b> is insertable into the sleeve section <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0100">The collar unit <b>10</b> comprises a first part of a securement and the sleeve section <b>4</b> comprises a second part of the securement. On receipt of the collar unit <b>10</b> within the sleeve section <b>4</b>, the first part and the second part of the securement engage one another to securely retain the collar unit <b>10</b> within the sleeve section <b>4</b>. The securement may comprise one or more sets of co-operating formations.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0101">The collar unit <b>10</b> further comprises an inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b>, as shown in broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, that is configured to be disposed between an end surface <b>104</b> of the rigid needle shield and the barrel <b>101</b> of the syringe <b>100</b>, which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. An axial gap <b>105</b> may be provided between the end surface <b>104</b> and a distal end <b>106</b> of the barrel <b>101</b> to accommodate the inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0102">The collar unit <b>10</b> and the sleeve section <b>4</b> act in combination to hinder observation of the rigid needle shield <b>103</b> and also for assisting in removal of the rigid needle shield <b>103</b> from the syringe <b>100</b> as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first collar section <b>2</b> and the second collar section <b>3</b> may each comprise a single unitary part. They may each be a moulded part. They may each be formed of a rigid plastics material. They may each be opaque. The first collar section <b>2</b> and the second collar section <b>3</b> may each comprise a half shell, namely a first half shell and a second half shell. The first collar section <b>2</b> and the second collar section <b>3</b> may be identical to each other.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0104">The first collar section <b>2</b> may comprise a head <b>21</b> and a body <b>22</b>.

Each of the heads <b>21</b>, <b>31</b> may comprise one or more alignment locators for aligning the first collar section <b>2</b> and the second collar section <b>3</b> with each other to maintain the shape of the collar unit <b>10</b> prior to insertion of the collar unit <b>10</b> into the sleeve section <b>4</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the alignment locators comprise a projection <b>28</b>, <b>38</b> and a recess <b>29</b>, <b>39</b> that are co-operatively shaped and sized such that the projection <b>28</b> of the head <b>21</b> may be received in the recess <b>39</b> of the head <b>31</b> and the projection <b>38</b> of the head <b>31</b> may be received in the recess <b>29</b> of the head <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0106">Each of the bodies <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> may comprise an elongate extension. Each elongate extension may take a generally semi-annular shape, for example a semi-cylindrical shape. Each of the bodies <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> may have a longitudinal length that is greater than a longitudinal length of the rigid needle shield <b>103</b>. Each of the bodies <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> may comprise one or more longitudinal slits <b>23</b>, <b>33</b> that extend longitudinally along at least a part of the length of the bodies <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> from a distal end <b>25</b>, <b>35</b> of the bodies <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> to thereby define two or more flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> in each of the bodies <b>22</b>, <b>32</b>.

In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, each body <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> comprises three flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> and two longitudinal slits <b>23</b>, <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0107">One or more or, but preferably all of, the flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> may be provided with an outwardly-projecting lip <b>40</b> at or near their distal ends as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Each lip <b>40</b> may comprise a ramped surface <b>41</b> which is directed distally and a perpendicular face <b>42</b> located at a proximal end of the ramped surface <b>41</b>. The first part of the securement may comprise or consist of the lips <b>40</b> and the associated flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0108">A first portion <b>9</b><i>a </i>of the inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b> may be provided on the first collar section <b>2</b> and a second portion <b>9</b><i>b </i>of the inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b> may be provided on the second collar section <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0109">The head <b>21</b> of the first collar section <b>2</b> and the head <b>31</b> of the second collar section <b>3</b> when engaged next to each other may together form a head section <b>11</b> of the collar unit <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The head section <b>11</b> may be annular in shape, for example a cylindrical shape. The head section <b>11</b> of the collar unit <b>10</b> may define a bore <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, for engaging and or accommodating the distal end <b>106</b> of the barrel <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0110">The body <b>22</b> of the first collar section <b>2</b> and the body <b>32</b> of the second collar section <b>3</b> when engaged next to each other may together form a body section <b>12</b> of the collar unit <b>10</b>. The body section <b>12</b> may have a longitudinal length that is greater than a longitudinal length of the rigid needle shield <b>103</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the body section <b>12</b> may have an internal diameter that is greater than an external diameter of the rigid needle shield <b>103</b>. The first portion <b>9</b><i>a </i>and the second portion <b>9</b><i>b </i>when engaged next to each other may together form an annular inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0111">The inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b> may be located at a proximal end <b>13</b> of the collar unit <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b> may be located towards the proximal end <b>13</b> but with the bore <b>14</b> of the head section <b>11</b> extending proximally from the location of the inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b> to the proximal end <b>13</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b> may define, at its centre, a proximal opening <b>15</b> at or towards the proximal end <b>13</b> of the collar unit <b>10</b>. The collar unit <b>10</b> may comprise a distal opening <b>16</b> at a distal end <b>17</b> of the collar unit <b>10</b>. Once assembled, the distal end <b>17</b> of the collar unit <b>10</b> may comprise the plurality of flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> of the first collar section <b>2</b> and the second collar section <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0112">The sleeve section <b>4</b> may comprise a closed-ended tube as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The closed-end of the tube may be rounded. The sleeve section <b>4</b> may comprise a single unitary part. The sleeve section <b>4</b> may be a moulded part. The sleeve section <b>4</b> may be formed of a rigid plastics material. The sleeve section <b>4</b> is preferably opaque.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0113">The sleeve section <b>4</b> may comprise a bore <b>43</b> for receiving the collar unit <b>10</b> that has an open first end <b>44</b> through which the collar unit <b>10</b> is received and a closed second end <b>45</b> opposite the open first end <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0114">As shown in broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the sleeve section <b>4</b> may comprise one or more recesses <b>46</b> for receiving the outwardly-projecting lips <b>40</b> of the flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, one annular recess <b>46</b> is provided which extends around an inner face <b>47</b> of the bore <b>43</b> of the sleeve section <b>4</b>. The second part of the securement may comprise or consist of the one or more recesses <b>46</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0115">In use, to assemble the blinding cap <b>1</b> and form the syringe assembly <b>200</b>, the first collar section <b>2</b> and the second collar section <b>3</b> are brought together about the syringe <b>100</b>. In this step the rigid needle shield <b>103</b> is accommodated in the body section <b>12</b> of the collar unit <b>10</b> in between the bodies <b>22</b>, <b>32</b>. The inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b> of the collar unit <b>10</b> is formed by the coming together of the first flange portion <b>9</b><i>a </i>and the second flange portion <b>9</b><i>b </i>so as to be located in the axial gap <b>105</b> between the end surface <b>104</b> of the rigid needle shield <b>103</b> and the distal end <b>106</b> of the barrel <b>101</b>. The one or more projections <b>28</b> are received in the one or more recesses <b>29</b> to aid temporary alignment and retention of the first collar section <b>2</b> and the second collar section <b>3</b> on and about the rigid needle shield <b>103</b>. The distal end <b>106</b> of the barrel <b>101</b> is received in the bore <b>14</b> of the head section <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0116">Next, the body section <b>12</b> of the collar unit <b>10</b> may be inserted into the sleeve section <b>4</b>. In this step the body section <b>12</b> passes through the open first end <b>44</b> into the bore <b>43</b>. The distal end <b>17</b> of the collar unit <b>10</b> may be configured to deform to accommodate insertion of the collar unit <b>10</b> into the sleeve section <b>4</b>. For example, the flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> may flex inwardly due to engagement of the ramped surfaces <b>41</b> of the lips <b>40</b> engaging on a rim of the open first end <b>44</b>. Inward flexure of the flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> may be accommodated by a radial spacing between an internal face of the flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> and an external face of the rigid needle shield <b>103</b>. Additionally or alternatively, inward flexure of the flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> may be accommodated by a longitudinal spacing between a distal end of the flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> and a distal end of the rigid needle shield <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0117">The collar unit <b>10</b> (and syringe <b>100</b>) are slid into the bore <b>43</b> until the lips <b>40</b> reach the annular recess <b>46</b> at which point the flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> resiliently flex back outwardly so as to engage the lips <b>40</b> in the annular recess <b>46</b>. Preferably, at the same point of insertion the head section <b>11</b> is brought into contact against the proximal end of the sleeve section <b>4</b> without entering the bore <b>43</b> of the sleeve section <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. Preferably an external diameter of the head section <b>11</b> may be the same as the external diameter of the proximal end of the sleeve section <b>4</b>. The inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b> may be located longitudinally at an interface between the head section <b>11</b> and the body section <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0118">Removal of the collar unit <b>10</b> from the sleeve section <b>4</b> is resisted by engagement of the perpendicular face <b>42</b> of the lips <b>40</b> against a proximal edge of the annular recess <b>46</b>. Thus, the securement acts as a non-reversible means for connecting the collar unit <b>10</b> and the sleeve section <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0119">The lips <b>40</b> and the flexible tongues <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> are preferably fully received within the sleeve section <b>4</b> once the first part and the second part of the securement engage one another as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. This effectively hinders attempts to tamper with the blinding cap <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0120">Once the collar unit <b>10</b> is securely retained in the sleeve section <b>2</b> the rigid needle shield <b>103</b> is preferably fully enveloped by the blinding cap <b>1</b> except for the proximal opening <b>15</b> at or towards the proximal end <b>13</b> of the collar unit <b>10</b> defined by the inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b>. However, the proximal opening <b>15</b> is obscured by the presence of the distal end <b>106</b> of the barrel <b>101</b>. Thus, a complete and effective blinding of the rigid needle shield <b>103</b> may be achieved.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0121">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the blinding cap <b>1</b> may have a smooth exterior surface. For example, the blinding cap <b>1</b> may comprise a cylindrical side wall <b>300</b> which may include the side walls of the sleeve section <b>4</b> and the collar unit <b>10</b> and a rounded distal end <b>301</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> so that it is free of abrupt discontinuities.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0122">The syringe assembly <b>200</b> may be stored in packaging, for example a flow wrap packaging.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0123">To use the syringe <b>100</b>, a user will first need to remove the rigid needle shield <b>103</b>. To do this the user may simply pull on the blinding cap <b>1</b>. The blinding cap <b>1</b> pulls off the syringe <b>100</b> and carries with it the rigid needle shield <b>103</b> due to engagement of the inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b> behind the proximal face <b>104</b> of the rigid needle shield <b>103</b>. Thus, the needle <b>102</b> of the syringe <b>100</b> is exposed for injection. The rigid needle shield <b>103</b> stays retained within the blinding cap <b>1</b> even after removal of the blinding cap from the remainder of the syringe <b>100</b> and therefore remains effectively blinded.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>15</b></figref> show a second embodiment of blinding cap <b>1</b>&#x2032; according to the present disclosure.

For example, the present disclosure extends to a method of assembling a syringe assembly <b>200</b>, <b>200</b>&#x2032; from a plurality of separate components that comprise a first collar section <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>&#x2032;, a second collar section <b>3</b>, <b>3</b>&#x2032;, a sleeve section <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; and a syringe <b>100</b> that itself comprises a barrel <b>101</b> and a rigid needle shield <b>103</b>. The method comprises first encircling the rigid needle shield <b>103</b> of the syringe <b>100</b> by engaging the first collar section <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>&#x2032;and the second collar section <b>3</b>, <b>3</b>&#x2032; together to form a collar unit <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; that encircles the rigid needle shield <b>103</b>. The collar unit <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; comprises an inwardly-projecting flange <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>&#x2032; that is disposed between an end surface of the rigid needle shield <b>103</b> and the barrel <b>101</b> of the syringe <b>100</b>. Subsequently the collar unit <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; and the encircled rigid needle shield <b>103</b> is inserted into the sleeve section <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032;. Insertion of the collar unit <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; into the sleeve section <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; results in a first part of a securement, provided on the collar unit <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032;, and a second part of the securement, provided on the sleeve section <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032;, securely engaging one another to securely retain the collar unit <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; within the sleeve section <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0148">Advantageously, the blinding cap of the present disclosure may provide greater security in that it is generally more difficult to tamper with or separate the first collar section and second collar section from each other due to the presence of the sleeve section. Thus, the first collar section and second collar section cannot readily be opened once the blinding cap has been assembled.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0149">In addition, the blinding cap may be easier to assemble onto the syringe than prior art devices. In particular, the first collar section and the second collar section may be aligned with each other to encircle the rigid needle shield in a straightforward manner. The securing of the collar sections together may be achieved subsequently by their insertion into the sleeve section. Therefore, the steps of aligning the collar sections and securing the collar sections together are achieved sequentially which may lead to a simpler method of assembly.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0150">In addition, the sleeve section beneficially serves the dual functions of securing the first collar section and the second collar section together and of blinding at least a portion of the rigid needle shield, for example a distal portion of the rigid needle shield.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0151">Advantageously, the combination of the sleeve section and the collar unit may ensure full blinding of the rigid needle shield since line-of-sight through the proximal opening will, in use, be prevented by the presence of the barrel of the syringe which will abut or be in close proximity with the inwardly-projecting flange.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0152">Advantageously, the alignment locators may ease the temporary relative alignment of the first collar section and the second collar section until they can be inserted into the sleeve section.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0153">Advantageously, tampering with the securement is made more difficult by arranging the first part of the securement fully within the sleeve section once assembly of the blinding cap has been completed. In addition, the second part of the securement may be provided on an internal surface of the sleeve section, for example on an internal surface of the bore of the sleeve section. Thus, advantageously, neither part of the securement may be accessible from an exterior of the blinding cap once assembled.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0154">Advantageously, in this manner a very secure assembly of the blinding cap may be achieved since the collar unit is engaged with the sleeve section around the full or substantially the full circumference of the blinding cap, rather than being secured simply along one or two longitudinal seams.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0155">Advantageously, the head section may function to receive and obscure from sight an end of the syringe barrel.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0156">Advantageously, by configuring the blinding cap to have a smooth exterior surface the syringe assembly may be easier to package, in particular in a flow-wrap package.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0157">Advantageously, the plurality of fins may act to grip the rigid needle shield to limit or prevent rattling or movement of the rigid needle shield within the blinding cap.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> to <b>18</b></figref> show a third embodiment of blinding cap <b>1001</b> according to the present disclosure.
