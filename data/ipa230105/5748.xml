level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Demands made to a leading-edge semiconductor device for a size reduction, a higher speed/higher performance, and power saving have increasingly been accelerated and, in the semiconductor device, various new materials have been increasingly used. For example, according to a widely-accepted theory, electromigration of Cu (copper) wiring and a high resistivity of W (tungsten) wiring form barriers to further miniaturization of semiconductor wiring, and a transition metal such as Co (cobalt) or Ru (ruthenium) has also become a candidate for a next-generation wiring material. To use a conductor film containing such a transition metal element as the next-generation semiconductor micro wiring, ultra-high-precision processing on a nanometer level (film deposition and etching) is indispensable.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Literature 1 discloses a dry etching method using an etching gas to which &#x3b2;-diketone and an oxidizing gas such as NO, N<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>2</sub>, or O<sub>3 </sub>are added for a deposited metal film formed of a metal element capable of forming a complex with &#x3b2;-diketone. To suppress fluctuations in etching speed, a technique disclosed in Patent Literature 1 proposes to set a content of water included in the etching gas to 30 mass ppm or less based on &#x3b2;-diketone. Patent Literature 2 discloses a dry etching method using an etching gas to which &#x3b2;-diketone, an oxidizing gas serving as a first additive gas, and H<sub>2</sub>O or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>serving as a second additive gas are added. To achieve a higher etching speed, a technique disclosed in Patent Literature 2 proposes to appropriately adjust an amount of &#x3b2;-diketone and an amount of the second additive gas in the etching gas.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In Nonpatent Literature 1, it is proposed that, after a surface of a transition metal film (Co film) is transformed to an oxide film, a &#x3b2;-diketone gas such as hexafluoroacetylacetone is caused to act on the oxide film to thereby etch the transition metal film.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literatures</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2018-110230</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2018-110229</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Nonpatent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">Nonpatent Literature 1: Jing Zhao, Mahsa Konh, Andrew Teplyakov &#x201c;Surface Chemistry of thermal dry etching of cobalt thin films using hexafluoroacetylacetone&#x201d; Applied Surface Science 455 (2018), pp. 438-445</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0008">The existing techniques described above have not given sufficient consideration to a point as described below, and therefore a problem has occurred.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0009">Specifically, with the technique disclosed in Patent Literature 1, fluctuations in etching speed when the etching processing is started and ended are suppressed, and the etching speed can be stabilized. Meanwhile, with the technique disclosed in Patent Literature 2, it is possible to increase the etching speed and achieve a high throughput. However, in each of Patent Literature 1 and Patent Literature 2, no consideration has been given to unevenness of a surface being etched which increases as the etching processing proceeds to result in increased roughness.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0010">Such increased roughness of the surface being etched resulting from the etching processing is described in Nonpatent Literature 1. The present nonpatent literature describes a reaction mechanism while etching of a transition-metal-containing film proceeds in detail and clearly states that a main phenomenon while the etching proceeds is decomposition of &#x3b2;-diketone gas molecules at the surface of an etched material, and the etching is merely a secondary reaction. The present nonpatent literature also states that, due to a decomposition reaction of the &#x3b2;-diketone gas molecules, the etched surface after the etching processing is roughened.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">Even when the etching speed is successfully increased or the fluctuations in etching speed are successfully suppressed by thus applying the technique of Patent Literature 1 or Patent Literature 2, since only insufficient consideration has been given to the roughened etched surface after the etching processing, a problem of a deteriorated yield of the processing has occurred.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">An object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor fabricating method with an improved yield.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0013">The object described above is attained by a semiconductor fabricating method that etches a film to be processed containing a transition metal on an upper surface of a semiconductor wafer placed in a processing chamber in a container by supplying a gas for complexing the transition metal into the processing chamber, the semiconductor fabricating method etching the film by performing: a first step of adsorbing, to the film, the gas while supplying the complexing gas, then increasing a temperature of the wafer to form an organic metal complex on a surface of the film, and volatilizing and desorbing the organic metal complex; and a second step of adsorbing, to the surface of the film, the complexing gas at a low temperature, while supplying the gas, then stopping the supply of the complexing gas, and stepwise increasing the temperature of the wafer to volatilize and desorb the organic metal complex formed on the surface of the film.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0014">By implementing high-precision and high-speed etching while inhibiting a surface of a transition metal film from being roughened and inhibiting a magnitude of unevenness from being increased, a yield of etching processing is improved.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0010" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view schematically illustrating an outline of a configuration of a semiconductor fabricating device according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a flow of an operation of etching processing by the semiconductor fabricating device according to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a time chart illustrating an example of the flow of the operation of the etching processing by the semiconductor fabricating device according to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which is along a flow of some of process steps in the flow chart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a time chart illustrating another example of the flow of the operation of the etching processing by the semiconductor fabricating device according to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which is along a flow of others of the process steps in the flow chart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0011" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0019">The present inventors have re-examined a reaction mechanism, while etching of a film containing a transition metal proceeds from various viewpoints, found that, when an organic metal complex is generated through a reaction between a film being etched and a &#x3b2;-diketone gas, there is a stability difference between an organic metal complex obtained in a case where the organic metal complex is generated at a high temperature and an organic metal complex obtained in a case where the organic metal complex is generated at a temperature in a low to intermediate temperature range, and arrived at the present invention. The organic metal complexes have different degradabilities depending on temperatures when the organic metal complexes were generated because the organic metal complex generated in a specified temperature region is grown in an oriented manner into the form of a compact film to have a stabilized film composition, and thus, in a specified temperature region, an organic metal complex forming reaction exhibits reaction saturation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0020">Meanwhile, under higher-temperature conditions, the organic metal complex forming reaction proceeds at a high speed, and accordingly organic metal complex molecules are irregularly stacked before being orientationally aligned. Therefore, it is assumed that a film formed at a high temperature has degraded stability compared to a film-like orientational organic metal complex layer generated in a lower to intermediate temperature range. In other words, while an outermost molecular layer of a film compactly formed in the low to intermediate temperature range has a function like that of a protective film, such a function of a film irregularly formed in a high temperature range is lower.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0021">An embodiment of the present invention described below includes a configuration which is a semiconductor fabricating device or a semiconductor fabricating method in which a specimen such as a semiconductor wafer to be processed having a film containing a transition metal or the like is held on a stage in a processing chamber disposed in a container and evacuated by an exhaust device, and a complexing gas is supplied into the processing chamber to process the film on an upper surface of the wafer. During the processing, the configuration maintains a temperature of the wafer at a plurality of values, and also adjusts the supply of the complexing gas in association with the temperature.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0022">The embodiment of the present invention also includes a configuration which is a semiconductor fabricating device or a semiconductor fabricating method in which a specimen on a substrate such as a semiconductor wafer having a film containing a transition metal is placed in a processing chamber in a vacuum container, and the film containing the transition metal on an upper surface of the specimen is processed to form a circuit structure.

When the second temperature exceeds 190&#xb0; C., it is highly possible that the surface of the film brought into the chemically adsorbed state does not remain in the state, and is further transformed to the organic metal complex.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0103">When the processing conditions included in the information acquired by the control unit <b>40</b> include a large amount of etching to be performed on the film to be subjected to the processing performed on the wafer <b>2</b>, e.g., when the cobalt oxide film corresponding to a thickness exceeding the threshold of 3 nm is to be removed by etching, the infrared heating using the IR lamp <b>62</b> is further continued to increase the substrate temperature to the fourth temperature, while the supply of the complexing gas such as acetylacetone is maintained (Step S<b>105</b>B). The fourth temperature is set to a level lower than the temperature at which the thermal decomposition of the volatile organic metal complex generated through the reaction between the material of the surface of the film to be processed containing the transition metal and the complexing gas occurs and equal to or higher than the temperature at which sublimation or volatilization thereof begins. In the process B in the present embodiment, at least during the period after the temperature of the wafer <b>2</b> is increased to the fourth temperature in Step S<b>105</b>B until the supply of the complexing gas is stopped in Step S<b>106</b>B, the temperature of the wafer <b>2</b> is maintained at a temperature equal to or higher than the fourth temperature. In accordance with such a flow, the surface of the film containing the transition metal on the upper surface of the wafer <b>2</b> is etched substantially continuously in the process B.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0104">When the amount of etching to be performed is small, e.g., in the case of processing when the cobalt oxide film corresponding to only a thickness of 0.3 nm is to be removed, the following sequence of process steps are performed. Specifically, the supply of the complexing gas such as acetylacetone is stopped to internally exhaust the processing chamber <b>1</b> and discharge particles affecting the processing therein (Step S<b>105</b>A). Then, the wafer <b>2</b> is heated using the IR lamp <b>62</b> to the third temperature (Step S<b>106</b>A). Since the temperature of the film containing the transition metal is increased to the third temperature which is maintained for a predetermined period, the chemisorbed layer generated on the surface of the film is transformed to the organic metal complex.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0105">The third temperature in the present embodiment is set to a level in a range higher than the second temperature and lower than the temperature at which the organic metal complex molecules begin to volatilize. In the case of etching processing performed on the cobalt oxide layer on the surface of the cobalt film by using a gas containing acetylacetone as a main component as the complexing gas, since the temperature at which the organic metal complex molecules begin to volatilize is about 190&#xb0; C., it will be understood that the third temperature preferably has a value between 160&#xb0; C. and 190&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0106">After the irradiation of the wafer <b>2</b> with the IR light from the IR lamp <b>62</b> is continued and the wafer <b>2</b> is maintained at the second temperature set in step S<b>106</b>A for a predetermined period, the intensity of the IR light from the IR lamp <b>62</b>, with which the wafer <b>2</b> is irradiated, is further increased in Step S<b>107</b>A to increase the temperature of the wafer <b>2</b> to the fourth temperature. As a result of maintaining the temperature of the wafer <b>2</b> at the fourth temperature, the organic metal complex in about one to several layers resulting from the transformation of the chemisorbed layer is volatilized to be removed.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0107">At a time at which the organic metal complex is removed and the film containing the transition metal and lying immediately therebelow or a layer made of a silicon compound or the like and located under the transition metal containing film is exposed, the reaction is ended. Note that, in the case of processing using the cobalt oxide film formed on the surface of the cobalt film as the transition metal containing film and using the gas mixture containing acetylacetone as the main component as the complexing gas, the preferred fourth temperature has a value within a range of 200&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C. This is because, when the fourth temperature is lower than 200&#xb0; C., sublimation/volatilization does not begin while, when the fourth temperature is over 300&#xb0; C., it is highly possible that the organic metal complex decomposes.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0108">Note that the complexing gas used in the present embodiment is an organic compound capable of forming at least bi- or higher-dentate coordination bonds with a transition metal atom, i.e., multidentate ligand molecules. Preferred examples thereof include diketones, ketoesters (each including two C&#x2550;O bonds), and ketoimines (each including a C&#x2550;O bond and a C&#x2550;N bond). Specific examples thereof include acetylacetone, trifluoroacetylacetone, trifluorophenyl butadione, hexafluoroacetylacetone, dipivaloyl methane, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, trifluorofuryl butadione, dimethylheptafluoro octanedione, and the like.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0109">As required, it may also be possible to use the complexing gas in which a complex stabilizing gas is mixed. The complex stabilizing gas is an organic compound having two or more elements each having an unshared electron pair in a molecular structure thereof, such as oxygen atoms, nitrogen atoms, or sulfur atoms, and preferably having five or more atoms other than hydrogen atoms and fluorine atoms, which is preferably ethers.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0110">Ethers are appropriate as the complex stabilizing gas in terms of having no chemical reaction with the complexing gas shown above. Specific material names of some of such materials include a straight-chain ether such as dimethoxyethane, diethyleneglycol dimethylether, or propyleneglycol dimethylether, a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, 12-crown-4, or diaza-12-crown-4, adiponitrile, succinonitrile, and the like.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0111">The study conducted by the present inventors has revealed that, when hexafluoroacetylacetone (liquid diketone compound) serving as the complexing gas and diethyleneglycol dimethylether (liquid straight-chain ether compound) serving as the complex stabilizing gas are used as the processing gas, a reaction between the processing gas and each of a metal such as a silicon dioxide film (SiO<sub>2</sub>), silicon (Si), stainless steel (SUS), copper (Cu), or tungsten (W), a nitride film such as a titanium nitride film (TiN) or a silicon nitride film (SiN), and a metal fluoride such as yttrium fluoride (YF<sub>3</sub>) does not occur or occurs only in a sufficiently smaller amount, while the processing gas exhibits a high reactivity with a metal oxide (metal oxide containing a rare earth element) containing a group <b>3</b>A metal such as lanthanum (La) or yttrium (Y).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0112">As described above, in the plasma processing device <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, the film to be processed containing the transition metal and formed in advance on the wafer <b>2</b> can be processed with high accuracy and with a high throughput.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0113">In particular, by performing processing based on an amount of processing determined in advance while switching between a processing cycle including a step of stopping a supply of a processing gas depending on a required step, sequentially and stepwise increasing a temperature of the target film being processed up to a predetermined value, and etching the film to be processed on the wafer <b>2</b>, while preventing an increase in roughness of the surface thereof and a processing cycle including a step of increasing the temperature of the film to a high level, while supplying the processing gas, and performing substantially continuous etching, the film is processed at a high etching speed. Meanwhile, a deviation of a post-processing shape from an intended shape is prevented. By such a semiconductor fabricating device or a semiconductor fabricating method, a high processing yield is achieved.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p-0114" num="0114">The present invention can be used in process steps of forming a pattern on a semiconductor substrate in a field of semiconductor device fabrication.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">LIST OF REFERENCE SIGNS</heading><p id="p-0115" num="0000"><ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0115"><b>1</b> Processing Chamber</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0116"><b>2</b> Wafer</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0117"><b>3</b> Discharge Region</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0118"><b>4</b> Stage</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0119"><b>5</b> Shower Plate</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0120"><b>6</b> Top Panel</li>        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0121"><b>10</b> Plasma</li>        <li id="ul0004-0008" num="0122"><b>11</b> Base Chamber</li>        <li id="ul0004-0009" num="0123"><b>12</b> Quartz Chamber</li>        <li id="ul0004-0010" num="0124"><b>14</b> Pressure Adjusting Means</li>        <li id="ul0004-0011" num="0125"><b>15</b> Exhaust Means</li>        <li id="ul0004-0012" num="0126"><b>16</b> Vacuum Exhaust Pipe</li>        <li id="ul0004-0013" num="0127"><b>17</b> Gas Dispersion Plate</li>        <li id="ul0004-0014" num="0128"><b>20</b> RF Power Source</li>        <li id="ul0004-0015" num="0129"><b>22</b> Matching Box</li>        <li id="ul0004-0016" num="0130"><b>25</b> RF Cut Filter</li>        <li id="ul0004-0017" num="0131"><b>30</b> Electrostatic Adsorption Electrode</li>        <li id="ul0004-0018" num="0132"><b>31</b> DC Power Source</li>        <li id="ul0004-0019" num="0133"><b>34</b> ICP Coil</li>        <li id="ul0004-0020" num="0134"><b>38</b> Chiller</li>        <li id="ul0004-0021" num="0135"><b>39</b> Refrigerant Flow Path</li>        <li id="ul0004-0022" num="0136"><b>40</b> Control Unit</li>        <li id="ul0004-0023" num="0137"><b>41</b> Arithmetic Unit</li>        <li id="ul0004-0024" num="0138"><b>44</b> Liquid Chemical</li>        <li id="ul0004-0025" num="0139"><b>45</b> Tank</li>        <li id="ul0004-0026" num="0140"><b>46</b> Heater</li>        <li id="ul0004-0027" num="0141"><b>47</b> Complexing Gas Supplier</li>        <li id="ul0004-0028" num="0142"><b>50</b> Mass Flow Controller</li>        <li id="ul0004-0029" num="0143"><b>51</b> Mass Flow Controller Control Unit</li>        <li id="ul0004-0030" num="0144"><b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> Valves</li>        <li id="ul0004-0031" num="0145"><b>60</b> Container</li>        <li id="ul0004-0032" num="0146"><b>62</b> IR Lamp</li>        <li id="ul0004-0033" num="0147"><b>63</b> Reflection Plate</li>        <li id="ul0004-0034" num="0148"><b>64</b> IR Lamp Power Source</li>        <li id="ul0004-0035" num="0149"><b>70</b> Thermocouple</li>        <li id="ul0004-0036" num="0150"><b>71</b> Thermocouple Thermometer</li>        <li id="ul0004-0037" num="0151"><b>74</b> IR Light Transmission Window</li>        <li id="ul0004-0038" num="0152"><b>75</b> Gas Flow Path</li>        <li id="ul0004-0039" num="0153"><b>78</b> Slit Plate</li>        <li id="ul0004-0040" num="0154"><b>81</b> O-Ring</li>        <li id="ul0004-0041" num="0155"><b>92</b> Optical Fiber</li>        <li id="ul0004-0042" num="0156"><b>93</b> External IR Light Source</li>        <li id="ul0004-0043" num="0157"><b>94</b> Optical Path Switch</li>        <li id="ul0004-0044" num="0158"><b>95</b> Light Splitter</li>        <li id="ul0004-0045" num="0159"><b>96</b> Spectroscope</li>        <li id="ul0004-0046" num="0160"><b>97</b> Detector</li>        <li id="ul0004-0047" num="0161"><b>98</b> Optical Multiplexer</li>        <li id="ul0004-0048" num="0162"><b>100</b> Plasma Processing Device</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
