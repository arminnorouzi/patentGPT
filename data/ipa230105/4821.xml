The routes between signal attributes represent relationships (e.g., hierarchical relationships) between the signal attributes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a diagram of a graph associated with a first input signal when or after the first input signal is sensed by a signal sensor. In some embodiments, the graph of the first input signal may be dynamically created by merging the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> with information associated with signal attributes of the first input signal stored in a memory or sensed by the signal sensor.

The authentication for responding to a communication described herein may be, in turn, optimized based on the relative value of a given input signal. In some embodiments, a method may be provided for authenticating an input signal. The method may begin with performing an initial data capture of signal attributes for input signals.

In some embodiments, a panel of input signals may also be referred to as a set of input signals.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The present disclosure provides a system (e.g., the AI digital signal processing system) that enables interaction with computing devices associated with input signals according to the channels employed by the computing devices to interact with the system. As used herein, a channel is defined by type and/or characteristics of an electronic data connection by which the system interacts with computing devices, whether to enroll the input signals associated with the computing devices, transmit offers to the computing devices (e.g., in one or more panels), generate and transmit communications to computing devices, and/or authenticate the input signals. One example of such a channel is a web site domain by which a computing devices interacts with the system. Another example of such a channel is a web application by which a computing device interacts with the system. A further example of such a channel is a mobile channel defined by a mobile service and/or characteristics of a mobile computing device to interact with the system. Examples of mobile device characteristics may include mobile device type, mobile device location, user preferences, and/or mobile application employed to interact with the system.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Based on the channel employed by a computing device, the system may select a language, a template, themes and skins, and a brand to be used in presenting content to the computing device and requesting information from the computing device. The content to be presented and the information to be requested from the computing device may also be selected based on the channel employed by the computing device. In some embodiments, the content to be presented and the information to be requested from the computing device may also be based on the location of the computing device.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In some embodiments, a multi-channel content management method may be carried out by an AI digital signal processing system (e.g., comprising a digital signal processor) described herein. The method may begin by accessing communication qualifiers for interacting with computing devices associated with one or more input signals according to one or more channels employed by the one or more computing devices. For example, the method may include selecting a language (e.g., natural language, computing language, etc.) to use in communicating with the computing device based on a channel employed by the computing device. Additionally, the method may include selecting a template for interacting with the computing device based on the channel employed by the computing device. Also, the method may include selecting a theme and/or skin for interacting with the computing device based on the channel employed by the computing device. Further, the method may include selecting a brand for interacting with the computing device associated with the input signal based on the channel employed by the computing device. Even further, the method may include selecting content for presentation on the computing device based on the channel employed by the computing device. Yet further, the method may include selecting information to be requested from the computing device based on the channel employed by the computing device.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some embodiments, the system may register an input signal according to the channel employed by the computing device associated with the input signal. During the process of registration, the system may employ the languages, templates, themes and skins, brands, content, and information to be requested that was selected earlier in the method. As part of the registration process, the system may assign an identification attribute to the input signal, and obtain information regarding demographics and/or preferences of a user associated with the input signal. Additionally, the method may include recording qualifiers for empaneling the input signals by storing this information in memory in association with the identification attributes of the input signals. In some embodiments, the method may further comprise recording qualifiers for transmitting offers (e.g., authentication offers) and authenticating the input signals in association with the identification attributes associated with the input signals.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In some embodiments, the system may interact with the computing devices according to communication qualifiers for interacting with the computing devices. In some embodiments, the method may include interpreting or determining the communication qualifiers for interacting with the computing devices according to the one or more channels employed by the computing devices. This method may involve determining one or more locations associated with the one or more channels and/or the one or more computing devices, and determining the communication qualifiers based on the locations. In some embodiments, the method may additionally include modifying an offer (e.g., an authentication offer) previously communicated to the computing devices to comply with the communication qualifiers. This process may involve modifying the offer to comply with the location of the computing device and/or the location and/or type of channel. In some embodiments, the method may further comprise transmitting the modified offer to the computing device. During the tendering of offers, the method may include selecting languages, templates, themes and skins, brands, and content based on the channels employed by the computing devices, and employing the selected languages, templates, themes and skins, brands, and content during the tendering of the offers. Further, the method may include authenticating the input signals associated with the computing devices according to authentication qualifiers. During the authenticating process, the method may include selecting languages, templates, themes and skins, brands, and content based on the channels employed by the computing devices, and employing the selected languages, templates, themes and skins, brands, and content during the authenticating process. Alternatively or additionally, the method may include transmitting or collecting resources (e.g., financial or monetary resources or assets) for the input signals in accordance with the location of the computing device and/or the channel.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In some embodiments, another multi-channel content management method may be carried out by the system described herein. The system may access empaneling qualifiers for input signals. It is envisioned that each input signal panel may have a set of qualifiers for the input signals. An exemplary qualifier for a user associated with an input signal may be a demographics qualifier. In some embodiments, the system may access qualifiers and authenticate input signals according to channels employed by the computing devices associated with the input signals. For example, the method may include accessing qualifiers stored in memory. Example qualifiers may include location-based qualifiers, channel-based qualifiers, user preferences, etc.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some embodiments, the system may enroll the input signals according to channels employed by the computing devices. The system may enroll the input signals according to the channels employed by the computing devices. For example, the system may assign identification attributes, obtain input signal information, and record any information as previously described. Additionally, the method may include recording relationships, such as pointers, between the identification attributes and data objects corresponding to qualifiers (any qualifiers described herein) for the channels respectively employed by the computing devices. It is further envisioned that, in some implementations, the method may include determining input signal panels for which the input signals qualify, and recording relationships, such as pointers, between the identification attributes and the input signal panels.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The method may further comprise empaneling the input signals based on empaneling qualifiers. For example, the method may include determining input signal panels for which the input signal qualifies, and placing the input signal on one or more of the input signal panels. Alternatively, in implementations in which the eligibility of input signals to serve on panels has already been recorded, the method may include selecting a particular input signal panel or subset of panels for which the input signal is eligible, and recording the corresponding relationships in memory in association with identification attributes associated with the input signals.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The method may further comprise receiving changes to one or more of the qualifiers (e.g., stored in memory). For example, changes may be made to qualifiers in one or more of the qualifier categories, such as location-based categories, channel-based categories, input signal preferences, etc. Alternatively or additionally, changes may be made to the qualifiers required by a particular input signal panel, and/or new input signal panels may be added that have criteria of their own.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some embodiments, the system may make a determination whether the changes to qualifiers impact the empanelment of the input signals. The method may include determining that changes were made to criteria of input signal panels, and/or that new input signal panels were added. If it is determined that changes were made that impact the empanelment, then processing may proceed to re-empaneling the input signals. However, if it is determined that changes were not made that impact the empanelment, then processing may proceed to tendering or transmitting authentication offers to computing devices associated with the input signals and authenticating the input signals according to the channels employed by the computing devices associated with the input signals.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some embodiments, the input signals may be re-empaneled. For example, if changes were made to qualifiers of an existing input signal panel, then the method may include determining whether each input signal assigned to that input signal panel is still eligible to be on the input signal panel, and removing ineligible input signals from the input signal panel. These input signals may then be assigned to serve on other input signal panels for which they are eligible. Eligibility of other input signals to serve on the input signal panel may also be assessed, and new input signals may be assigned to the input signal panel. Alternatively or additionally, if a new input signal panel was added, then eligibility of input signals to qualify for that input signal panel may be determined, and one or more of the eligible input signals may be assigned to the input signal panel. Input signals assigned to the new input signal panel may be removed from one or more other input signal panels, and the other input signal panels may then be reevaluated, if needed.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments, the system may transmit authentication offers to computing devices associated with the input signals and authenticate the input signals according to the channels employed by the computing devices associated with the input signals. For example, the system may employ identification attributes to reference the qualifiers stored in memory and have relationships recorded in association with the identification attributes. As a result, the system may select languages, templates, themes and skins, brands, and content based on the channels employed by the computing devices, and employ the selected languages, templates, themes and skins, brands, and content during the transmission or presentation of the authentication offers and the authentication of the input signals. Alternatively or additionally, the method may include transmission or receipt of resources in accordance with location-based qualifiers associated with the channel employed by the computing device associated with the input signal. In some embodiments, the various methods described herein may be used to determine more signal attributes or more information associated with signal attributes for the input signals described herein.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The present disclosure provides several important technical advantages that will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims.
