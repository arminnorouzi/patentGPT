These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include fourth generation (4G) systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, or LTE-A Pro systems, and fifth generation (5G) systems which may be referred to as New Radio (NR) systems. These systems may employ technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), or discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include one or more base stations or one or more network access nodes, each simultaneously supporting communication for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The described techniques relate to improved methods, systems, devices, and apparatuses that support generation and transmission of measurement reports based on sensing capabilities. Generally, the described techniques provide for a first user equipment (UE) to indicate, to a base station, sensing capability information associated with one or more other UEs. For example, the base station may request for the first UE to indicate the sensor capability information associated with UEs other than the first UE. Additionally, the first UE may receive, from each of the one or more other UEs, an indication of the sensing capability information associated with the corresponding one or more other UEs (e.g., via basic safety messages (BSMs)). In response to receiving the request for the sensing capability information from the base station, the first UE may transmit an indication of the sensing capability information associated with one or more other UEs. Additionally, the base station may request sensing measurement reports from a subset of the one or more other UEs based on the indicated sensing capability information. For example, the base station may transmit, to each of the subset of UEs, a request for the respective UE to generate a sensing measurement report. The base station may then receive the respective sensing measurement reports in response to transmitting the request.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A method for wireless communication at a first user equipment (UE) is described.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some wireless communications systems, user equipments (UEs) may rely on sensor sharing to enable a UE to maintain a situational awareness (e.g., to sense nearby objects such us buildings, trees, other UEs, pedestrians). For example, a first UE may rely on sensor information from one or more sensors (e.g., lidar, radar, camera) at the first UE in addition to sensor information received from other UEs for situational awareness. In some cases, relying on a large quantity of sensors (e.g., at the first UE and at the other UEs) for situational awareness may result in high power consumption at the first UE and the other UEs. Additionally, relying on a subset of sensors may result in a decrease of situational awareness. For example, the first UE may be more likely to experience unreliable communications with a base station or be unaware of nearby objects in cases where the first UE relies on a subset of sensors for situational awareness (e.g., when the first UE does not receive sensor information from other UEs).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some cases, however, a base station may selectively receive sensor sharing data from UEs based on sensor capability information associated with a first UE and each of the UEs to support effective sensor sharing while decreasing power consumption at one or more of the UEs. For example, the base station may transmit a request for the first UE to indicate the sensor capability information (e.g., an indication of one or more sensors associated with the corresponding UE, an orientation of the corresponding UE, a field of view associated with the corresponding UE) associated with UEs other than the first UE. Additionally, the first UE may receive, from each of the one or more other UEs, an indication of the sensing capability information associated with the corresponding one or more other UEs (e.g., via basic safety messages (BSMs)). In response to receiving the request for the sensing capability information from the base station, the first UE may transmit an indication of the sensing capability information associated with one or more other UEs.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The base station may request sensing measurement reports from a subset of the one or more other UEs based on the indicated sensing capability information. That is, based on a mobility of the first UE or a location of the first UE, the base station may request sensor data for sensor sharing from the subset of UEs (e.g., that have sensor capability information that may provide valuable data for situational awareness at the first UE). For example, the base station may transmit, to each of the subset of UEs, a request for the respective UE to generate a sensing measurement report. The base station may then receive the respective sensing measurement reports in response to transmitting the request. Here, one or more of the other UEs may refrain from transmitting sensor measurement reports to the base station (e.g., in cases that the base station does not request a sensor measurement report from the UE), thus resulting in a decreased power consumption. In this way, the first UE may still receive data associated with sensor sharing in cases where high situational awareness is useful (e.g., in higher mobility, in crowded locations) and may additionally conserve power in cases where less situational awareness is appropriate (e.g., in lower mobility, in less crowded locations).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Aspects of the disclosure are initially described in the context of wireless communications systems. Aspects of the disclosure are further illustrated by and described with reference to a process flow, apparatus diagrams, system diagrams, and flowcharts that relate to generation and transmission of measurement reports based on sensing capabilities.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communications system <b>100</b> that supports generation and transmission of measurement reports based on sensing capabilities in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include one or more base stations <b>105</b>, one or more UEs <b>115</b>, and a core network <b>130</b>. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, an LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) network, an LTE-A Pro network, or a New Radio (NR) network. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support enhanced broadband communications, ultra-reliable (e.g., mission critical) communications, low latency communications, communications with low-cost and low-complexity devices, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The base stations <b>105</b> may be dispersed throughout a geographic area to form the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and may be devices in different forms or having different capabilities. The base stations <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may wirelessly communicate via one or more communication links <b>125</b>. Each base station <b>105</b> may provide a coverage area <b>110</b> over which the UEs <b>115</b> and the base station <b>105</b> may establish one or more communication links <b>125</b>. The coverage area <b>110</b> may be an example of a geographic area over which a base station <b>105</b> and a UE <b>115</b> may support the communication of signals according to one or more radio access technologies.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The UEs <b>115</b> may be dispersed throughout a coverage area <b>110</b> of the wireless communications system <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>115</b> may be stationary, or mobile, or both at different times. The UEs <b>115</b> may be devices in different forms or having different capabilities. Some example UEs <b>115</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The UEs <b>115</b> described herein may be able to communicate with various types of devices, such as other UEs <b>115</b>, the base stations <b>105</b>, or network equipment (e.g., core network nodes, relay devices, integrated access and backhaul (IAB) nodes, or other network equipment), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with the core network <b>130</b>, or with one another, or both. For example, the base stations <b>105</b> may interface with the core network <b>130</b> through one or more backhaul links <b>120</b> (e.g., via an S1, N2, N3, or other interface). The base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with one another over the backhaul links <b>120</b> (e.g., via an X2, Xn, or other interface) either directly (e.g., directly between base stations <b>105</b>), or indirectly (e.g., via core network <b>130</b>), or both. In some examples, the backhaul links <b>120</b> may be or include one or more wireless links.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">One or more of the base stations <b>105</b> described herein may include or may be referred to by a person having ordinary skill in the art as a base transceiver station, a radio base station, an access point, a radio transceiver, a NodeB, an eNodeB (eNB), a next-generation NodeB or a giga-NodeB (either of which may be referred to as a gNB), a Home NodeB, a Home eNodeB, or other suitable terminology.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A UE <b>115</b> may include or may be referred to as a mobile device, a wireless device, a remote device, a handheld device, or a subscriber device, or some other suitable terminology, where the &#x201c;device&#x201d; may also be referred to as a unit, a station, a terminal, or a client, among other examples. A UE <b>115</b> may also include or may be referred to as a personal electronic device such as a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or a personal computer. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may include or be referred to as a wireless local loop (WLL) station, an Internet of Things (IoT) device, an Internet of Everything (IoE) device, or a machine type communications (MTC) device, among other examples, which may be implemented in various objects such as appliances, or vehicles, meters, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The UEs <b>115</b> described herein may be able to communicate with various types of devices, such as other UEs <b>115</b> that may sometimes act as relays as well as the base stations <b>105</b> and the network equipment including macro eNBs or gNBs, small cell eNBs or gNBs, or relay base stations, among other examples, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b> may wirelessly communicate with one another via one or more communication links <b>125</b> over one or more carriers. The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; may refer to a set of radio frequency spectrum resources having a defined physical layer structure for supporting the communication links <b>125</b>. For example, a carrier used for a communication link <b>125</b> may include a portion of a radio frequency spectrum band (e.g., a bandwidth part (BWP)) that is operated according to one or more physical layer channels for a given radio access technology (e.g., LTE, LTE-A, LTE-A Pro, NR). Each physical layer channel may carry acquisition signaling (e.g., synchronization signals, system information), control signaling that coordinates operation for the carrier, user data, or other signaling. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support communication with a UE <b>115</b> using carrier aggregation or multi-carrier operation. A UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple downlink component carriers and one or more uplink component carriers according to a carrier aggregation configuration. Carrier aggregation may be used with both frequency division duplexing (FDD) and time division duplexing (TDD) component carriers.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Signal waveforms transmitted over a carrier may be made up of multiple subcarriers (e.g., using multi-carrier modulation (MCM) techniques such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-S-OFDM)). In a system employing MCM techniques, a resource element may consist of one symbol period (e.g., a duration of one modulation symbol) and one subcarrier, where the symbol period and subcarrier spacing are inversely related. The number of bits carried by each resource element may depend on the modulation scheme (e.g., the order of the modulation scheme, the coding rate of the modulation scheme, or both). Thus, the more resource elements that a UE <b>115</b> receives and the higher the order of the modulation scheme, the higher the data rate may be for the UE <b>115</b>. A wireless communications resource may refer to a combination of a radio frequency spectrum resource, a time resource, and a spatial resource (e.g., spatial layers or beams), and the use of multiple spatial layers may further increase the data rate or data integrity for communications with a UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The time intervals for the base stations <b>105</b> or the UEs <b>115</b> may be expressed in multiples of a basic time unit which may, for example, refer to a sampling period of T<sub>s</sub>=1/(&#x394;f<sub>max</sub>&#xb7;N<sub>f</sub>) seconds, where &#x394;f<sub>max </sub>may represent the maximum supported subcarrier spacing, and N<sub>f </sub>may represent the maximum supported discrete Fourier transform (DFT) size. Time intervals of a communications resource may be organized according to radio frames each having a specified duration (e.g., 10 milliseconds (ms)). Each radio frame may be identified by a system frame number (SFN) (e.g., ranging from 0 to 1023).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Each frame may include multiple consecutively numbered subframes or slots, and each subframe or slot may have the same duration. In some examples, a frame may be divided (e.g., in the time domain) into subframes, and each subframe may be further divided into a number of slots. Alternatively, each frame may include a variable number of slots, and the number of slots may depend on subcarrier spacing. Each slot may include a number of symbol periods (e.g., depending on the length of the cyclic prefix prepended to each symbol period). In some wireless communications systems <b>100</b>, a slot may further be divided into multiple mini-slots containing one or more symbols. Excluding the cyclic prefix, each symbol period may contain one or more (e.g., N<sub>f</sub>) sampling periods. The duration of a symbol period may depend on the subcarrier spacing or frequency band of operation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A subframe, a slot, a mini-slot, or a symbol may be the smallest scheduling unit (e.g., in the time domain) of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and may be referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). In some examples, the TTI duration (e.g., the number of symbol periods in a TTI) may be variable. Additionally or alternatively, the smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be dynamically selected (e.g., in bursts of shortened TTIs (sTTIs)).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Physical channels may be multiplexed on a carrier according to various techniques. A physical control channel and a physical data channel may be multiplexed on a downlink carrier, for example, using one or more of time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) techniques, or hybrid TDM-FDM techniques. A control region (e.g., a control resource set (CORESET)) for a physical control channel may be defined by a number of symbol periods and may extend across the system bandwidth or a subset of the system bandwidth of the carrier. One or more control regions (e.g., CORESETs) may be configured for a set of the UEs <b>115</b>. For example, one or more of the UEs <b>115</b> may monitor or search control regions for control information according to one or more search space sets, and each search space set may include one or multiple control channel candidates in one or more aggregation levels arranged in a cascaded manner. An aggregation level for a control channel candidate may refer to a number of control channel resources (e.g., control channel elements (CCEs)) associated with encoded information for a control information format having a given payload size. Search space sets may include common search space sets configured for sending control information to multiple UEs <b>115</b> and UE-specific search space sets for sending control information to a specific UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> may be movable and therefore provide communication coverage for a moving geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. In some examples, different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may overlap, but the different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> may be supported by the same base station <b>105</b>. In other examples, the overlapping geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may be supported by different base stations <b>105</b>. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include, for example, a heterogeneous network in which different types of the base stations <b>105</b> provide coverage for various geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> using the same or different radio access technologies.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable communications or low-latency communications, or various combinations thereof. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) or mission critical communications. The UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to support ultra-reliable, low-latency, or critical functions (e.g., mission critical functions). Ultra-reliable communications may include private communication or group communication and may be supported by one or more mission critical services such as mission critical push-to-talk (MCPTT), mission critical video (MCVideo), or mission critical data (MCData). Support for mission critical functions may include prioritization of services, and mission critical services may be used for public safety or general commercial applications. The terms ultra-reliable, low-latency, mission critical, and ultra-reliable low-latency may be used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may also be able to communicate directly with other UEs <b>115</b> over a device-to-device (D2D) communication link <b>135</b> (e.g., using a peer-to-peer (P2P) or D2D protocol). One or more UEs <b>115</b> utilizing D2D communications may be within the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b>. Other UEs <b>115</b> in such a group may be outside the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b> or be otherwise unable to receive transmissions from a base station <b>105</b>. In some examples, groups of the UEs <b>115</b> communicating via D2D communications may utilize a one-to-many (1:M) system in which each UE <b>115</b> transmits to every other UE <b>115</b> in the group. In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> facilitates the scheduling of resources for D2D communications. In other cases, D2D communications are carried out between the UEs <b>115</b> without the involvement of a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some systems, the D2D communication link <b>135</b> may be an example of a communication channel, such as a sidelink communication channel, between vehicles (e.g., UEs <b>115</b>). In some examples, vehicles may communicate using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, or some combination of these. A vehicle may signal information related to traffic conditions, signal scheduling, weather, safety, emergencies, sensor measurement reports, or any other information relevant to a V2X system. In some examples, vehicles in a V2X system may communicate with roadside infrastructure, such as roadside units, or with the network via one or more network nodes (e.g., base stations <b>105</b>) using vehicle-to-network (V2N) communications, or with both.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The core network <b>130</b> may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. The core network <b>130</b> may be an evolved packet core (EPC) or 5G core (5GC), which may include at least one control plane entity that manages access and mobility (e.g., a mobility management entity (MME), an access and mobility management function (AMF)) and at least one user plane entity that routes packets or interconnects to external networks (e.g., a serving gateway (S-GW), a Packet Data Network (PDN) gateway (P-GW), or a user plane function (UPF)). The control plane entity may manage non-access stratum (NAS) functions such as mobility, authentication, and bearer management for the UEs <b>115</b> served by the base stations <b>105</b> associated with the core network <b>130</b>. User IP packets may be transferred through the user plane entity, which may provide IP address allocation as well as other functions. The user plane entity may be connected to IP services <b>150</b> for one or more network operators. The IP services <b>150</b> may include access to the Internet, Intranet(s), an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), or a Packet-Switched Streaming Service.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Some of the network devices, such as a base station <b>105</b>, may include subcomponents such as an access network entity <b>140</b>, which may be an example of an access node controller (ANC). Each access network entity <b>140</b> may communicate with the UEs <b>115</b> through one or more other access network transmission entities <b>145</b>, which may be referred to as radio heads, smart radio heads, or transmission/reception points (TRPs). Each access network transmission entity <b>145</b> may include one or more antenna panels. In some configurations, various functions of each access network entity <b>140</b> or base station <b>105</b> may be distributed across various network devices (e.g., radio heads and ANCs) or consolidated into a single network device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may operate using one or more frequency bands, typically in the range of 300 megahertz (MHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz). Generally, the region from 300 MHz to 3 GHz is known as the ultra-high frequency (UHF) region or decimeter band because the wavelengths range from approximately one decimeter to one meter in length. The UHF waves may be blocked or redirected by buildings and environmental features, but the waves may penetrate structures sufficiently for a macro cell to provide service to the UEs <b>115</b> located indoors. The transmission of UHF waves may be associated with smaller antennas and shorter ranges (e.g., less than 100 kilometers) compared to transmission using the smaller frequencies and longer waves of the high frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHF) portion of the spectrum below 300 MHz.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize both licensed and unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may employ License Assisted Access (LAA), LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) radio access technology, or NR technology in an unlicensed band such as the 5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. When operating in unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands, devices such as the base stations <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may employ carrier sensing for collision detection and avoidance. In some examples, operations in unlicensed bands may be based on a carrier aggregation configuration in conjunction with component carriers operating in a licensed band (e.g., LAA). Operations in unlicensed spectrum may include downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, P2P transmissions, or D2D transmissions, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be equipped with multiple antennas, which may be used to employ techniques such as transmit diversity, receive diversity, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, or beamforming. The antennas of a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be located within one or more antenna arrays or antenna panels, which may support MIMO operations or transmit or receive beamforming. For example, one or more base station antennas or antenna arrays may be co-located at an antenna assembly, such as an antenna tower. In some examples, antennas or antenna arrays associated with a base station <b>105</b> may be located in diverse geographic locations. A base station <b>105</b> may have an antenna array with a number of rows and columns of antenna ports that the base station <b>105</b> may use to support beamforming of communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Likewise, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more antenna arrays that may support various MIMO or beamforming operations. Additionally or alternatively, an antenna panel may support radio frequency beamforming for a signal transmitted via an antenna port.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Beamforming, which may also be referred to as spatial filtering, directional transmission, or directional reception, is a signal processing technique that may be used at a transmitting device or a receiving device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b>) to shape or steer an antenna beam (e.g., a transmit beam, a receive beam) along a spatial path between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Beamforming may be achieved by combining the signals communicated via antenna elements of an antenna array such that some signals propagating at particular orientations with respect to an antenna array experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. The adjustment of signals communicated via the antenna elements may include a transmitting device or a receiving device applying amplitude offsets, phase offsets, or both to signals carried via the antenna elements associated with the device. The adjustments associated with each of the antenna elements may be defined by a beamforming weight set associated with a particular orientation (e.g., with respect to the antenna array of the transmitting device or receiving device, or with respect to some other orientation).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may use beam sweeping techniques as part of beam forming operations. For example, a base station <b>105</b> may use multiple antennas or antenna arrays (e.g., antenna panels) to conduct beamforming operations for directional communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Some signals (e.g., synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals) may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> multiple times in different directions. For example, the base station <b>105</b> may transmit a signal according to different beamforming weight sets associated with different directions of transmission. Transmissions in different beam directions may be used to identify (e.g., by a transmitting device, such as a base station <b>105</b>, or by a receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>) a beam direction for later transmission or reception by the base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Some signals, such as data signals associated with a particular receiving device, may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> in a single beam direction (e.g., a direction associated with the receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>). In some examples, the beam direction associated with transmissions along a single beam direction may be determined based on a signal that was transmitted in one or more beam directions. For example, a UE <b>115</b> may receive one or more of the signals transmitted by the base station <b>105</b> in different directions and may report to the base station <b>105</b> an indication of the signal that the UE <b>115</b> received with a highest signal quality or an otherwise acceptable signal quality.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some examples, transmissions by a device (e.g., by a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b>) may be performed using multiple beam directions, and the device may use a combination of digital precoding or radio frequency beamforming to generate a combined beam for transmission (e.g., from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>). The UE <b>115</b> may report feedback that indicates precoding weights for one or more beam directions, and the feedback may correspond to a configured number of beams across a system bandwidth or one or more sub-bands. The base station <b>105</b> may transmit a reference signal (e.g., a cell-specific reference signal (CRS), a channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS)), which may be precoded or unprecoded. The UE <b>115</b> may provide feedback for beam selection, which may be a precoding matrix indicator (PMI) or codebook-based feedback (e.g., a multi-panel type codebook, a linear combination type codebook, a port selection type codebook). Although these techniques are described with reference to signals transmitted in one or more directions by a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b> may employ similar techniques for transmitting signals multiple times in different directions (e.g., for identifying a beam direction for subsequent transmission or reception by the UE <b>115</b>) or for transmitting a signal in a single direction (e.g., for transmitting data to a receiving device).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>) may try multiple receive configurations (e.g., directional listening) when receiving various signals from the base station <b>105</b>, such as synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals. For example, a receiving device may try multiple receive directions by receiving via different antenna subarrays, by processing received signals according to different antenna subarrays, by receiving according to different receive beamforming weight sets (e.g., different directional listening weight sets) applied to signals received at multiple antenna elements of an antenna array, or by processing received signals according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at multiple antenna elements of an antenna array, any of which may be referred to as &#x201c;listening&#x201d; according to different receive configurations or receive directions. In some examples, a receiving device may use a single receive configuration to receive along a single beam direction (e.g., when receiving a data signal). The single receive configuration may be aligned in a beam direction determined based on listening according to different receive configuration directions (e.g., a beam direction determined to have a highest signal strength, highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or otherwise acceptable signal quality based on listening according to multiple beam directions).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some wireless communications systems <b>100</b>, UEs <b>115</b> may rely on sensor sharing to enable a UE <b>115</b> to maintain a situational awareness (e.g., to sense nearby objects such us buildings, trees, other UEs <b>115</b>, pedestrians).

For instance, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may request autoencoded combined features from the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>based on combined radar and lidar measurements and may independently request features based on the camera at the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>(e.g., based on a field of view, based on a heading of the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e</i>).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some cases, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may indicate one or more architectural parameters for a recurrent neural network (RNN) to the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>via the measurement configuration <b>330</b>. For example, the architectural parameters may include the RNN type, where the RNN type corresponds to a gated recurrent unit (GRU), a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit), an application type (e.g., many-to-one, vs. many-to-many), a variant (directional vs. bi directional), a loss function, a number of layers of the RNN, activation functions used in the different RNN layers, the initialization weight parameters, drop out parameters, parameters for various gates (e.g., update, relevance, forget, and output gates), or a combination thereof. In one example, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may indicate, via the measurement configuration <b>330</b>, architectural parameters for a convolutional neural network such as the convolutional filter size, the number of filters, the stride size (e.g., used for different layers), batch normalization (e.g., used for fast learning), and a pooling configuration to use for reducing the size of encoded images (e.g., maximum pool, average pool).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The deep learning parameters and associated pretrained weights may be preconfigured and selected based on various environmental characteristics. For example, the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>may select one or more deep learning parameter sets based on the time of day to enhance face and object detection capability. That is, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may configure the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>with a first convolution filter (e.g., convolution filter-1) which may be used during the day, and a second convolution filter (e.g., convolution filter-2) which may be used during the dusk. The information relating to the various convolution filters may be preconfigured in the application layer of the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e</i>. In one example, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may provide the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>with a sensing initiation paging, and based on the time of the day and the other preconfigured parameters, the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>may provide sensing results back to the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>in a measurement report <b>335</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some cases, the page <b>325</b> message transmitted by the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may be characterized as a sensing initiation paging type (e.g., type-1 or type-2) that may indicate to the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>which preconfigured deep learning parameter set to use. For example, if the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>transmits the page <b>325</b> as a sensing initiation paging type-1, the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>may use a first preconfigured deep learning set (e.g., set-1). Additionally, if the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>transmits the page <b>325</b> as a sensing initiation paging type-2, the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>may use a second preconfigured deep learning set (e.g., set-2). In some cases, the sensing initiation paging type and corresponding deep learning parameter set may be based on the speed of the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d</i>. For example, if the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>has high mobility such that the speed of the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>is above a first configured threshold, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may request sensing information from a first set of sensing capable UEs <b>115</b> and may request the first set of UEs <b>115</b> to use the deep learning parameter set 1. If, however, the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>has a mobility such that the speed of the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>is above the first configured threshold but below a second configured threshold, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may request sensing information from a second set of sensing capable UEs <b>115</b> and may request the second set of UEs <b>115</b> to use the deep learning parameter set-2.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some cases, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may initiate a deep learning set at the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>based on the geographical zone of the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d</i>. For example, if the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>is in a first geographical zone (e.g., a busy intersection), the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may request a first deep learning parameter set for the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>to use for sensing measurements. In some examples, the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may request the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>to include more or less UEs <b>115</b> in the capability report <b>320</b> based on the geographical zone. For example, if the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>is in the first geographical zone (e.g., a busy intersection), the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may request the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>to include more UEs <b>115</b> in the capability report <b>320</b> to achieve a finer clarity of the environment surrounding the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>as to more accurately predict a beam blockage.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some cases, the number of sensing capable UEs <b>115</b> the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>requests sensing information from and the type of sensing information requested (e.g., raw information vs. meta information, high resolution vs. low resolution images, point clouds, etc.) may be based on the speed of the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d</i>. In cases where the UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>is moving with a variant speed (e.g., a speed that changes on a relative time scale configured by the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b</i>), the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may request a greater number of sensing capable UEs <b>115</b> to transmit a measurement report <b>335</b>. The base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may also request, from the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d</i>, finer information regarding the sensing capability of each sensing capable UE <b>115</b> indicated in the capability report <b>320</b>. The base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may request additional (e.g., finer) information from sensing capable UEs <b>115</b> based on a likelihood of a beam blockage increasing when the UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>is experiencing higher mobility.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Based on the received measurement configuration <b>330</b> message, the one or more UEs <b>115</b> may transmit a measurement report <b>335</b> to the base station <b>105</b>-<i>b</i>.
