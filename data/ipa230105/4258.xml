However, existing cards support only limited control combinations in applications, and especially do not support controls that are frequently used or have deeper control entries. In addition, the existing cards often appear in fixed positions of electronic devices with monotonous and fixed display manners. It is difficult to implement secondary combinations and sharing. Therefore, how to flexibly implement card sharing is an urgent problem to be resolved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This application provides a card sharing method, an electronic device, and a communications system, to implement sharing of some card modules of a card or an entire card between application programs on a same device, and also implement sharing of some card modules of a card or an entire card across devices.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect, this application provides a card sharing method, including: displaying an interface of a first application in response to a first operation of a user, where a first card is displayed on the interface of the first application, the first card includes a first card module and a second card module, and interface resources of the first card are provided by a second application; sending a second message to a third application in response to a second operation of the user, where the second operation is associated with the first card module, and the second message includes an identifier of the first card module; and displaying an interface of the third application, where the first card module is displayed on the interface of the third application, and interface resources of the first card module are provided by a fourth application.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">By using the card sharing method provided in the first aspect, a card can be split into a plurality of card modules and the card modules can be recombined. In this way, sharing of some card modules of the card or the entire card is implemented not only between application programs on a same device but also across devices. Therefore, by using the card modules of the card or the entire card, service content expected by the user can be conveniently and quickly provided for the user based on the user's wishes, especially key information that is in the service content and that is frequently used or requires cumbersome operations, which satisfies sharing requirements in different scenarios and helps improve user experience.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a possible design, the first card further includes a third card module, the third card module is also displayed on the interface of the third application, and interface resources of the third card module are provided by the fourth application. Therefore, in this application, the card may be set with a property of being recombinable, or with a property of being non-recombinable. For example, a card module used to indicate service content of a card, key information of a card, or the like is set to be a non-recombinable card module. Therefore, the first application process may determine, in response to the second operation of the user, that the second card module and the third card module need to be displayed on the interface of the third application; or the third application may determine, based on the identifier of the first card module in the second message, that the second card module and the third card module need to be displayed on the interface of the third application, thereby facilitating implementation of card sharing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a possible design, the first application, the second application, and the third application are different application programs on a first device; the first application process is corresponding to the first application; a second application process is corresponding to the second application; a third application process is corresponding to the third application; a fourth application process is corresponding to the fourth application; the second application and the fourth application are a same application program; and the second application process and the fourth application process are a same application program process. Therefore, the card sharing method in this application is applicable to scenarios of use between different application programs on a same device, helping provide the user with a variety of display channels of cards. A card may be presented the same or differently for each display channel, so that the user can obtain expected service content in a timely manner.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a possible design, the first application and the second application are different application programs on a first device; the third application and the fourth application are different application programs on a second device; the first device is different from the second device; the first application process is corresponding to the first application; a second application process is corresponding to the second application; a third application process is corresponding to the third application; and a fourth application process is corresponding to the fourth application. Therefore, the card sharing method in this application is applicable to scenarios of card sharing across devices, helping provide different users with display channels of cards. In addition, different devices provide their own resource support for cards, which reduces dependence between different devices, and implements decoupling between different devices.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a possible design, the first application and the second application are different application programs on a first device; the third application is a different application program on a second device; the first device is different from the second device; the first application process is corresponding to the first application; a second application process is corresponding to the second application; a third application process is corresponding to the third application; a fourth application process is corresponding to the fourth application; the second application and the fourth application are a same application program; and the second application process and the fourth application process are a same application program process. Therefore, the card sharing method in this application is applicable to scenarios of card sharing across devices, helping provide different users with display channels of cards. In addition, resource support is provided by one device for UI display of cards on different devices, which ensures that cards can be continuously displayed on different devices.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a possible design, the method includes: sending a first message to the second application process; receiving a first drawing result from the second application process, where the first drawing result is obtained by rendering and drawing by the second application process based on the interface resources of the first card, the interface resources of the first card are obtained by invoking by the second application process from a resource package set based on the first message, and the resource package set includes the interface resources of the first card module, the second card module, and the third card module that are of the first card, and interface resources of a fourth card module and a fifth card module that are of a second card; and displaying the first card on the interface of the first application based on the first drawing result. Therefore, at least one card can be embedded into any application program on an electronic device, so that service content is displayed to the user in a card form, and abundant UI display channels are available for cards, which can satisfy different user requirements.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a possible design, the first message includes an identifier of the first card. Therefore, on a basis that the first card and the first card module and the second card module that are of the first card are determined by the second application process, the amount of data transmission between the first application process and the second application process is reduced.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a possible design, the first message includes an identifier of the first card, the identifier of the first card module, and an identifier of the second card module. Therefore, the second application process is able to correctly determine the first card module and the second card module that are of the first card, and invoke the interface resources of the first card module and the second card module of the first card in a timely manner, to implement rendering and drawing of the first card. In this way, the first application can quickly display the first card.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a possible design, the first message further includes a first address; and the first drawing result sent to the first address is received from the second application process, which provides a possible implementation for providing the first drawing result. In addition, through address sharing, not only updating of the first drawing result can be implemented, but also card sharing can be stopped to revoke a service.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a possible design, the method further includes: when the first device has a resource package set, sending a first message to the second application process. When the first device does not have any resource package set, the second application process is unable to invoke the interface resources of the first card from the resource package set. Therefore, the method helps reduce unnecessary operations performed by the first device, thereby reducing power consumption of the first device, and also allows the first device to download a resource package set in a timely manner for quickly implementing card sharing.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a possible design, the method includes: sending a third message to the fourth application process; receiving a second drawing result from the fourth application process, where the second drawing result is obtained by rendering and drawing by the fourth application process based on the interface resources of the first card module, the interface resources of the first card module are obtained by invoking by the fourth application process from the resource package set based on the third message, and the resource package set includes the interface resources of the first card module, the second card module, and the third card module that are of the first card, and the interface resources of the fourth card module and the fifth card module that are of the second card; and displaying the first card module on the interface of the third application based on the second drawing result. Therefore, a card may be shared to different application programs on a same device or to different devices, satisfying sharing requirements in different scenarios.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a possible design, the third message includes the identifier of the first card and the identifier of the first card module. Therefore, the fourth application process is able to correctly determine the first card and the first card module, and invoke the interface resources of the first card module of the first card in a timely manner, to implement rendering and drawing of the first card module. In this way, the third application can quickly display the first card module.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a possible design, the third message further includes a second address; and the second drawing result sent to the second address is received from the fourth application process, which provides a possible implementation for providing the second drawing result. In addition, through address sharing, not only updating of the second drawing result can be implemented, but also card sharing can be stopped to revoke a service.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a possible design, the method further includes: when it is determined that the third application process is capable of displaying a card, sending the third message to the fourth application process. Therefore, when the third application process is incapable of displaying a card, the third application process is unable to send the third message to the fourth application process. Therefore, the method helps reduce unnecessary operations performed by a device on which the third application process is located, thereby reducing power consumption of the device on which the third application process is located, and allows the device on which the third application process is located to notify the user in a timely manner that the first application is unable to share a card to the third application.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a possible design, the resource package set further includes interface resources of a fifth application. Therefore, resource support is provided for implementing interface display of the fifth application.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a possible design, the interface of the first application includes a first region and a second region; and the first card is located in the first region, a first application page is located in the second region, and interface resources of the first application page are provided by the first application. Therefore, the interface of the first application is enriched, so that the first application can not only display one or more cards, but also display the first application page.
