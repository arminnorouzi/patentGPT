Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">One embodiment of the present disclosure relates to a vehicle radar apparatus and a method of controlling the same, and more particularly, to a radar apparatus and method for detecting height information of a target using a vertically offset multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) antenna and a phase shift transmission signal.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, a driver assistance system (DAS) or an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) is widely used, and for that, it is necessary to acquire accurate target information.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to implement such a DAS or ADAS function, a plurality of vehicle sensors are used, and a vehicle radar apparatus is one of the vehicle sensors.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, among the vehicle sensors, a camera sensor has an advantage in that the camera sensor can acquire accurate target information but has a disadvantage in that the use of the camera sensor is limited at night or in a climatic environment such as fog.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, a vehicle radar sensor is widely used as a vehicle sensor in that the radar sensor is relatively free from restriction due to nighttime or a climatic environment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A radar apparatus mounted on a vehicle or the like transmits a radar signal, which is an electromagnetic wave having a certain frequency, receives a signal reflected from an object, and then processes the received signal, thereby performing a function of extracting position or velocity information of the object.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A vehicle radar includes one or more transmitting antennas and one or more receiving antennas and acquires target information such as lateral direction information (azimuth angle) and a distance of a target from a composite signal of a transmission signal and a reception signal reflected from the target.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, in the case of a vehicle radar, there is a disadvantage in that vertical information such as a height and an elevation angle of a target cannot be accurately detected compared with a camera sensor or a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In particular, since height information of a target is important information when the driving of an own vehicle is controlled, there is a need to accurately detect the height information of the target through a radar apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0005"

phase shift value (a<sub>max</sub>) which is a phase shift value having the greatest reception power among the N phase shift values and determining a height (h) of the target based on the determined discrete phase shift value (a<sub>max</sub>).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The transceiver of the radar apparatus may divide the transmission signal having the N phase shift values by time index or sequence to transmit the phase shift transmission signal.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The N phase shift values of the phase shift transmission signal may be 0&#xb0;, (360/N)&#xb0;,
