Compared to organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), micro light-emitting diodes (micro LED, mLED/&#x3bc;LED) have the advantages of higher efficiency, longer life, and relatively stable materials that are not as easily affected by the environment. Therefore, displays that use micro LEDs fabricated in arrays have gradually gained attention in the market.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the miniaturization of micro LEDs, the area of the electrodes in each micro LED structure also shrinks, and the distance between the two electrodes is shortened. When multiple micro LED structures are subjected to a mass transfer process and bonded to the display back plate of a display device, phenomena such as short-circuiting of electrodes or bonding failure are prone to occur. This leads to dark spots in the micro LED display device, which lowers the overall yield.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the micro LED display device, each micro LED structure is (electrically) connected to the display back plate by two bonding structures. In the micro LED display device according to the embodiments of the present disclosure, the bonding structures are in direct contact with the extensions of the two electrodes of the micro LED structure. Due to the long distance between the extensions of the electrodes, the two bonding structures are prevented from contacting with each other. That is, short-circuiting of electrodes is unlikely to occur. In addition, during the bonding process, the epitaxial structure in the micro LED structure is not liable to be damaged, thereby reducing the probability of dark spots, and effectively improving the overall yield of the micro LED device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some embodiments of the present disclosure include a micro LED display device.

The micro LED display device further includes a first bonding structure and a second bonding structure disposed between the display back plate and the micro LED structure. The micro LED structure includes an epitaxial structure. The micro LED structure also includes a first electrode and a second electrode electrically connected to the epitaxial structure and disposed on the side of the epitaxial structure closest to the display back plate. The first electrode has an extension portion, the second electrode has an extension portion, and the orthogonal projection of the extension portion of the first electrode on the display back plate and the orthogonal projection of the extension portion of the second electrode on the display back plate both exceed the orthogonal projection of the epitaxial structure on the display back plate. The first bonding structure is in direct contact with the extension portion of the first electrode and the first connecting electrode, and the second bonding structure is in direct contact with the extension portion of the second electrode and the second connecting electrode. Neither the orthogonal projection of the first bonding structure nor the orthogonal projection of the second bonding structure on the display back plate overlaps the orthogonal projection of the bottom surface of the epitaxial structure on the display back plate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some embodiments of the present disclosure include a micro LED display device.
