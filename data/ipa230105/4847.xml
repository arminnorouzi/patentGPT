In contrast to a digital computer, which stores and manipulates information in the form of bits (e.g., a &#x201c;1&#x201d; or &#x201c;0&#x201d;), quantum computing systems can manipulate information using qubits. A qubit can refer to a quantum device that enables the superposition of multiple states (e.g., data in both the &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d; state) and/or to the superposition of data, itself, in the multiple states. In accordance with conventional terminology, the superposition of a &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d; state in a quantum system may be represented, e.g., as &#x3b1;|0&#x3e;+&#x3b2;|1&#x3e;. The &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d; states of a digital computer are analogous to the |0&#x3e; and |1&#x3e;basis states, respectively of a qubit.

By limiting the chip containing the qubits to high quality (low loss) materials, the qubits are substantially isolated from lossy material and qubit decoherence can be reduced. By moving the control wiring off the chip that contains the qubits, the qubit layout and wiring constraints may be relaxed. To further relax the layout constraints, the qubit readout elements also may be moved to the same chip on which the wiring and lossy materials are formed. To limit interference between superconducting qubits on a first chip from control elements and wiring on a second chip, the control elements and wiring may be covered by a shielding layer and a dielectric layer. To maintain qubit readout element coherence, the qubit readout element may be provided without a dielectric layer or shielding layer. Additionally, in some implementations, the devices and methods allow an increase in superconducting qubit density and/or qubit coupling through 3D integration. Moreover, the fabrication steps for the superconducting qubits and the wiring/control elements are separated by putting the superconducting qubits on a first chip and the wiring/control elements on a second, separate chip. Furthermore, in some implementations, the devices and methods allow 3D integration to be achieved while reducing losses associated with processing methods and materials. In particular, by patterning qubit readout resonator structures during final steps of the fabrication process, the edges and corners of qubit readout resonator structures which are sensitive to processing (e.g., roughening) are of higher quality, resulting in improved device quality factors.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

Superconducting quantum computing is a promising implementation of quantum computing technology in which quantum computing circuit elements are formed, in part, from superconductor materials. Superconducting quantum computers are typically multilevel systems, in which only the first two levels are used as the computational basis. In certain implementations, quantum circuit elements (e.g., quantum computing circuit elements), such as superconducting qubits, are operated at very low temperatures so that superconductivity can be achieved and so that thermal fluctuations do not cause transitions between energy levels. Additionally, it may be preferable that the quantum computing circuit elements are operated with low energy loss and dissipation (e.g., the quantum computing circuit elements exhibit a high quality factor, Q). Low energy loss and dissipation may help to avoid, e.g., quantum decoherence.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In certain types of quantum computing processors, such as quantum annealers, the superconducting qubits of the quantum processor are operatively coupled together in a controllable manner such that the quantum state of each superconducting qubit affects the corresponding quantum states of the other superconducting qubits to which it is coupled. Depending on the processor design, the chosen architecture may limit the density and total number of superconducting qubits available for coupling, and thus limit the ability of the processor to perform complex problems requiring large numbers of superconducting qubits. Furthermore, in certain quantum computing designs, the superconducting qubits may suffer energy loss and decoherence due to interactions with two level systems. For instance, in quantum computers that use superconducting qubits formed from superconductor materials, the presence of lossy non-superconducting materials from, e.g., deposited dielectrics, classical circuit elements with which the quantum computers communicate, and from the connections between the classical circuit elements and the quantum circuit elements, can lead to increased decoherence.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">To increase superconducting qubit density and expand the number of superconducting qubits available for coupling in a quantum processor, such as a quantum annealer having superconducting quantum circuit elements, the processor and associated circuit elements can be constructed using 3D integration. That is, instead of fabricating the quantum circuit elements of the processor within a single plane of a chip that extends along one and/or two dimensions (e.g., x- and/or y-directions), the quantum circuit elements can also be formed in multiple chips that are coupled together along a third dimension (e.g., z-direction). An approach for achieving 3D integration is to couple the chips using bump bonding, in which the chips are joined to one another by, e.g., superconductor bump bonds, to form a stacked device (e.g., a stacked quantum computing device). In some implementations, bump bonds may be used to electrically couple together components from different chips within the stack in addition to physical coupling of the chips. Alternatively, bump bonds solely may be used to provide physical coupling of different chips. By using superconductor bump bonds for coupling, it is possible to achieve a reduction in the energy loss and decoherence that can otherwise occur with lossy non-superconductor materials.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, in some implementations, the lossy materials and qubit control wiring may be formed on one or more chips within the stack that are separate from the chip or chips containing the qubits. By limiting the chip(s) containing the qubits to high quality (low loss) materials, the qubits are substantially isolated from lossy material and qubit decoherence can be reduced. Furthermore, by moving the control wiring off the chip(s) containing the qubits, the qubit layout and wiring constraints may be relaxed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">To further relax the layout constraints, the qubit readout elements also may be moved to the same chip on which the wiring and lossy materials are formed. However, readout resonators should maintain a modest level of coherence. A readout resonator, although strongly coupled to the environment with a low coupling quality factor Qc, will damp the qubit if the intrinsic quality factor Qi is too low. Additionally, to avoid crosstalk between qubits on one chip and the wiring on another chip, the wiring should not be exposed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present disclosure relates to devices and methods for integrating circuit elements in a stacked quantum computing device. A first chip in the stacked quantum computing device includes superconducting qubits formed from high quality, coherent materials (low loss materials) and is bonded to a second chip that contains one or more wiring layers, as well as qubit control and qubit readout elements, integrated with lossy dielectrics. By moving the wiring, readout and control elements to a second chip, the qubit layout constraints on the first chip (as well as the wiring layout constraints on the second chip) can be relaxed. Furthermore, moving the lossy dielectric material to the second chip allows the qubits on the first chip to maintain high coherence (e.g., Q of about 1,000,000 or more). The qubit readout elements on the second chip may be formed without lossy dielectric on their surface, such that the readout elements maintain moderate coherence (e.g., Qi of about 200,000 or more). Furthermore, a shielding layer may be formed on the second chip to shield superconducting qubits on the first chip from the wiring on the second chip, to reduce crosstalk. Moreover, the devices disclosed herein may be fabricated using processes that reduce residue and damage to the readout element, allowing the readout element to maintain moderate coherence.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic illustrating a side view of an example of a stacked quantum computing device <b>100</b>.
