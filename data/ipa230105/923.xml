The human SAN is poorly understood due to limited primary tissue access and lack of robust in vitro derivation methods. There is a need for methods to isolate cells with SAN characteristics, or to generate cells from stem cells that exhibit SAN characteristics so that effects of various therapeutics on SAN function can be investigated.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Previous efforts have focused on in vivo direct conversion or an NKX2.5 negative selection approach to obtain nodal like cells. However, due to lack of a purification method, the studies were limited in characterization and validation of nodal identity for the cells at cellular and molecular levels (Kapoor et al., <i>Nat Biotechnol </i>31, 54-62 (2013); Protze et al., <i>Nat Biotechnol </i>35, 56-68 (2017), and therefore use of such cells for drug discovery is limited.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure provides compositions and methods for generating cells with sinoatrial node (SAN) characteristics from pluripotent cells, such as human pluripotent stem cells. The method is based on a strategy using a dual SHOX2:GFP; MYH6:mCherry knock-in reporter line to generate and purify human pluripotent stem cell-derived SAN cells (hPSC-SAN), displaying molecular and electrophysiological characteristics of bona-fide nodal cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The method was developed by using the steps comprising i) providing a population of pluripotent stem cells, such as human pluripotent cells, ii) introducing into the cells, a reporter for SHOX2 expression, iii) incubating the cells in a medium comprising retinoic acid, an EGFR/FGFR inhibitor, Wnt inhibitor, and optionally, a STAT3 inhibitor, iv) optionally, further incubating the cells in a medium further comprising HDAC inhibitor, and v) sorting for cells that are positive for the reporter for SHOX2. This process generates SAN-like cells. These cells (SAN-like cells) display SA node like biochemical and electrophysiological characteristics. In an embodiment, the method uses media further comprising Activin Receptor inhibitor. The cells may be used for implantation or for screening (such as in a high throughput screening) to identify agents that can affect the functioning of SAN cells.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment, SAN-like cells may be generated by incubating PSCs (such as hPSCs) with a medium comprising a GSK inhibitor, and one or more members of the TGF-&#x3b2; superfamily of proteins (member of TGF-&#x3b2; SFP), for a sufficient period of time to generate pre-cardiac mesoderm cells. The pre-cardiac mesoderm cells are incubated in a medium comprising retinoic acid signaling activator, Wnt inhibitor, Activin receptor (ALK) inhibitor, member of TGF-&#x3b2; SFP and/or EGFR inhibitor, and optionally, STAT3 inhibitor, for a period of time sufficient to generate pacemaker progenitor cells. The pacemaker progenitor cells are then incubated in a medium comprising a GSK inhibitor, and EGFR inhibitor and optionally, a HDAC inhibitor for a sufficient period of time to generate SA-node like cells. In an embodiment, the pacemaker progenitor cells are first incubated for a period of time in a medium comprising GSK inhibitor and a EGFR inhibitor, and after about 3-7 days, the medium may additionally comprise a HDAC inhibitor. After this, the cells can then be continued in culture in a serum-free, growth factor fee medium and by day 30 (total time in culture) exhibit pacemaker markers and electrophysiological properties.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment, the SAN-like cells generated by the present methods can be used to evaluate cell type specific toxicity upon treatment with therapeutics for various diseased conditions. For example, cancer treatments cause cardiovascular toxicities including arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy. Doxorubicin (DOXO) remains a key component of regimens to treat a wide spectrum of solid tumors and leukemia. DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy ranges from 10-20% and sub-clinical systolic dysfunction is estimated at 40% of treated patients. The SAN-like cells generated by the present methods can be used to evaluate therapeutic candidates for their cardiac toxicity effects, and also to evaluate candidate agents that could mitigate cardiac toxicity associated with therapeutics like anthracyclines, including doxorubicin.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, using this technique, we discovered 3 new genetic loci associated with increased sensitivity to DOXO-induced hPSC-SAN death. Genetic variants in these loci were associated with significantly higher early arrhythmia risk in patients receiving DOXO, confirmed by an unbiased PheWAS analysis. The in vitro DOXO assay enables an unbiased drug screening platform and identification of candidate therapeutic that can partially block DOXO-mediated cardiac toxicity.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Treatment does not have to lead to complete cure, although it may. For example, treatment does not have to lead to complete mitigation of drug-induced cardiac toxicity.

The sinoatrial node (SAN) is the primary pacemaker of the heart. The human SAN is poorly understood due to limited primary tissue access and lack of robust in vitro derivation methods. This disclosure provides an efficient method to generate purified human pluripotent stem cell-derived SAN cells (hPSC-SAN). In an embodiment, the method comprises using a reporter for SHOX2 expression, (e.g., dual SHOX2:GFP; MYH6:mCherry knock-in reporter line). The method generates pluripotent stem cell-derived SAN cells displaying molecular and electrophysiological characteristics of SAN cells. These cells can be used for screening of agents that affect SAN cell functioning. For example, therapeutic agents may be screened for side effects on cardiac toxicity, or agents may be identified that can be used as protectants against therapeutic drugs that cause cardiac toxicity. As an example, agents may be identified that can protect against anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present method provides an improvement over previous methods. Protze et al. (2017, Nat Biotechnol 35, 56-68) used an NKX2.5-GFP reporter as a negative marker to enrich SAN-like cells, which is far from ideal. Since NKX2.5 is a transcription factor, and not a surface marker, investigators would need to generate such a reporter for any hPSC line they use for differentiation. Also, since it uses negative selection to eliminate non-SAN-like cells (primarily cardiomyocytes) it has limited capacity to expand the desired cell type, rather than eliminate the wrong cell type, which seriously limits capacity to scale. Another method by Schweizer et al. (2017, Stem Cell Res Ther 8, 229) derived pacemaker cells by co-culturing hESC-derived cells with a visceral endoderm-like cell line END-2, which severely limits any application for transplantation or cell therapy purposes. The present method used a dual reporter in pluripotent cells (such as hESC line) to screen for conditions promoting pacemaker differentiation, and to enrich and expand the desired SAN-like population, and established a highly efficient, chemically defined condition to derive functional pacemaker cells. In an embodiment, the dual reporter system SHOX2:eGFP; MYH6:mCherry was used. While the reporter is used for positive output quantification, it is not needed once the protocol is established because it is not a positive selection feature.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The cells used may be human embryonic stem cells or human induced pluripotent stem cells, which are herein together referred to as human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). The human pluripotent stem cells may be derived from any suitable cell type, including lung, fibroblasts (e.g. skin fibroblasts), keratinocytes, blood progenitor cells, bone marrow cells, hepatocytes, gastric epithelial cells, pancreatic cells, neural stem cells, B lymphocytes, ES derived somatic cells, and embryonic fibroblasts.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;pluripotent stem cell&#x201d; (also referred to as &#x201c;PSC&#x201d;) as used herein refers to a cell having an ability to differentiate into any type of cell of an adult (pluripotency) and also having self-renewal capacity which is an ability to maintain the pluripotency during cell division. &#x201c;PSCs&#x201d; include Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs), which are derived from inner cell mass of blastocysts or morulae, including cells that have been serially passaged as cell lines. Embryonic stem cells, regardless of their source or the particular method used to produce them, can be identified based on their ability to differentiate into cells of all three germ layers, expression of at least Oct4 and alkaline phosphatase, and ability to produce teratomas when transplanted into immunodeficient animals. The term PSCs also includes induced PSCs (iPSCs), which are cells converted from somatic cells by a variety of methods, such as a transient overexpression of a set of transcription factors. A PSC may be a cell of any species with no limitation, and preferably a mammalian cell. It may be a rodent or primate cell. For example, it may be a monkey, mouse or a human pluripotent stem cell. The term &#x201c;human pluripotent stem cells&#x201d; or hPSCs includes human embryonic stem cells and human induced PSCs.

Any type of human somatic cells (e.g. skin fibroblasts or cells from a biological fluid) can be reprogrammed to iPSC using lentivirus (Maherali et al. <i>Cell Stem Cell </i>3, 340-345 (2008)) or plasmids (Okita et al. <i>Nat. Methods </i>8, 409-412 (2011)). For example, human dermal fibroblasts can be infected for a suitable period of time (such as 16 hr) with lentiviruses to express the following: hOct4, hSox4, hKlf4, hNanog, and c-Myc, at specific times. Infected cells can be plated on feeder cells in suitable culture media, and transgenes can be induced. Clones with hESC morphology generally appear after about 3 weeks.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present disclosure describes a new and efficient strategy to derive and purify SAN-like cells from hPSCs. The ability to generate human SAN-like cells in vitro can facilitate study of genetic and iatrogenic arrhythmias and may allow scaled production and transplantation as biological pacemakers. Our reporter strategy enabled direct visualization and standardized in vitro assays for developmental studies, purification and drug discovery. Using the reporter strategy allowed the development of a method that generated a unique population of SAN-like cells.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The term &#x201c;sinoatrial node-like cells&#x201d; or &#x201c;SAN-like cells&#x201d; as used herein refers to cardiomyocytes or cardiac cells that express sinoatrial nodal (SAN) cell specific markers TBX18, TBX3, SHOX2 and ISL1 and which are capable of displaying pacemaker activity (e.g., display &#x201c;funny current&#x201d;). The SAN cells are the only cells in the heart that can initiate beating, and they alone display a &#x201c;funny current&#x201d;, which is a mixed sodium-potassium current that activates upon hyperpolarization at voltages in the diastolic range (normally from &#x2212;60/&#x2212;70 mV to &#x2212;40 mV). The funny current flows through an HCN4-dependent channel. The SAN-like cells express much lower levels of cardiac working muscle markers such as myosins and troponins.

Recently, murine embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines that were engineered for conditional expression of GATA4, GATA5 or GATA6, to efficiently generate diverse cardiac cell populations including, nodal, atrial and ventricular cells<sup>4</sup>. Among these cell lines, GATA5 induction resulted in the highest expression levels of TTS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>).

In addition, an FGF inhibitor was used to augment the expression of ISL1, a known regulator of the nodal program in early mouse development. Indeed, the full combination (condition 8) of 5 &#x3bc;M EGF inhibitor (Tyrphostin AG490), 0.1 &#x3bc;M STAT3 inhibitor (cucurbitacin), 5 &#x3bc;M FGFR inhibitor (SU5402), and 1 &#x3bc;M RA significantly increased human TTS expression levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a, b</i></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>e, f</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0091">To quantify and purify SAN-like cells using this directed differentiation protocol, a dual knock-in SHOX2:GFP; MYH6:mCherry reporter line was created using CRISPR/Cas-based gene-targeting techniques (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref>).

ESC-derived cardiomyocytes show poor connectivity with ESC-derived AN<sup>12</sup>. We probed the functionality of in vitro-derived hPSC-SAN cells by assessing connectivity with AN (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c, d</i></figref>). For connectivity studies, an optogenetic reporter line was used to facilitate light-induced control of neural activity. AN were derived from a hESC line expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP)-tagged channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) under control of the human synapsin promoter. Co-culture of day 25 hPSC-SAN cells with these AN resulted in physical connection between SAN-like cells and AN, as shown by increased expression of synapsin, and junctional morphology indicated by electron microscopy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>d</i></figref>). Furthermore, the co-culture platform resulted in increased maturation of AN as shown by increased adrenaline levels in supernatant compared to AN co-cultured with hESC-derived ventricular-like cardiomyocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>e</i></figref>). Light-activated contractions in SAN-like cells further validated the connectivity.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0095">One key functional property of a nodal cell is its characteristic action potential with fast spontaneous firing rates and slow maximum upstroke velocities (&#x3c;30 V/s). SHOX2:GFP<sup>+</sup> cells generated from the differentiation protocol at day 30 were sorted and patch-clamping experiments showed 8 out of 10 demonstrated the characteristic electrophysiologic phenotype of nodal cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>f</i></figref>). Functional hPSC-SAN cells should provide a platform to test rhythm-modifying drugs. Ivabradine, a specific HCN4 channel modulator, has been shown to slow SAN activity. Directed differentiation was used to generate hESC-SAN or hESC-derived ventricular myocytes (hESC-V) and a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-flux assay was used to record the baseline calcium activity of each cell type. The cells were then treated with 1 &#x3bc;M ivabradine and recordings taken after 5 min. While no significant difference was observed in cardiomyocyte cultures, a significant reduction was observed in contractions and calcium activity in the hESC-SAN cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>g</i></figref>). Therefore, based on multiple criteria, including gene expression profiles, AN connectivity, electrophysiological characteristics, and drug sensitivity, the hESC-SAN cells recapitulate expected features of human pacemaker cells.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0096">The hPSC-SAN cells were analyzed in a single-cell RNAseq experiment to explore heterogeneity of the cell population and identify lineage-restricted transcriptome features. For this purpose SHOX2:GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the hPSC-SAN population were sorted from the pacemaker differentiation culture while MYH6:mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted following cardiomyocyte directed differentiation to generate a ventricular-like population (hESC-V). After pooled sequencing, tSNE plots (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>) clustered cells with similar gene expression patterns. Cluster analysis using global gene expression values classified the cells into three groups including high-SHOX2, mixed-SHOX2 and no-SHOX2. Since cardiac markers are not highly expressed in the mixed-SHOX2 population, these cells might represent non-cardiac SHOX2<sup>+</sup> cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>). We therefore focused on high-SHOX2 and no-SHOX2 cells for further analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c</i></figref>) confirmed that high-SHOX2 and no-SHOX2 cells are two distinct populations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0097">High-SHOX2 cells were significantly enriched in transcripts encoding structural proteins TPM1, TNNT2, MYL7, MYH6, MYL6, ACTA2, DSTN, ACTC1, NEXN, NEBL, MYH11 and MYLK (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d</i></figref>). The role in SAN physiology for some of these proteins including MYLK, MYH11 and ACTA2 is unknown, although they were also reported to be present in the murine SA node<sup>10</sup>. Notable structural protein genes expressed in the no-SHOX2 cell population encode TTN, TPM1, TNNT2, MYL7, MYH6 and ACTC1. The presence of IRX4 transcripts in the no-SHOX2 cells (and absence in the high-SHOX2 cells) confirms the ventricular identity of the former (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d</i></figref>). The high-SHOX2 cell population was relatively homogenous in expression of transcripts for the key ion channel HCN4 and transcriptional regulator ISL1, while no-SHOX2 cells showed heterogeneity in the expression levels of these two genes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>e</i></figref>). PITX2c, a gene responsible for suppression of the SA program in atrial cells, was expressed in the no-SHOX2 and not in the high-SHOX2 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>f</i></figref>). The high-SHOX2 cell population had lower but detectable NKX2.5 expression levels, and was also associated with relatively higher levels of HEY1 and ID2 transcripts, compatible with an SA nodal identity rather than an AV node. Consistent with previous studies, CACNA1D and SCN5A channels, which are necessary for the peacemaking activity of the nodal cells, were relatively enriched in high-SHOX2 cells. Among contacting isoforms, CNTN4 transcripts were relatively more abundant in the high-SHOX2 cell population, compared to dispersed expression levels of CNTN1.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0098">The high-SHOX2 population showed relatively homogenous expression of HCN4, ISL1, TBX5 and TBX3 genes compared to TBX18 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>g</i></figref>). Previous murine developmental studies suggested that the TBX18 expression pattern might determine the identity of different parts of the SA node, including head or tail. The single cell sequencing data indicates that the in vitro generated hPSC-SAN cells recapitulate a spectrum of TBX18 expression patterns, and therefore may represent multiple segments of the SA node. Another key transcriptional regulator identified in high-SHOX2 cells was NR2F2 (COUPTFII), known to be important for the development of cardiac cells with caudal identity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>h</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0099">With an effective protocol to derive human SAN-like cells, we next established a platform to model sensitivity of pacemaker cells to drug toxicity. Some of the most common forms of arrhythmias are iatrogenic and occur as a consequence of chemotherapy treatment, requiring a permanent pacemaker replacement in severe cases. We focused on doxorubicin (DOXO) because it has well known adverse effects on the heart, thereby limiting its application for management of breast cancer and other tumors. Importantly, individual patients display different levels of sensitivity to this drug, indicating a contribution of genetic variation to this toxicity. This can be tested by modeling drug toxicity in human pacemaker cells derived from various genetic backgrounds (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a</i></figref>). SHOX2:GFP<sup>+</sup> hPSC-SAN cells or SHOX2:GFP<sup>&#x2212;</sup>; MHC6:mCherry<sup>+</sup> cardiomyocytes were differentiated to day 35, treated with different doses of DOXO for 3 days, and monitored for the percentage of cleaved caspase3<sup>+</sup> cells. A drug dose was discovered (0.16 &#x3bc;M) at which the pacemaker-like cells showed significant cytotoxicity, while the cardiomyocytes displayed no significant increase in cell death (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>b</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0100">To identify genetic variation that associates with the sensitivity of pacemaker cells to DOXO-induced toxicity, we performed an unbiased screen using a library of hPSC-SAN cells differentiated from 48 distinct iPSC lines. Cells differentiated for 35 days were treated with 0.16 &#x3bc;M DOXO for 3 days. Due to the lack of a robust antibody to SHOX2, an antibody recognizing ISL1 that is co-expressed with SHOX2:GFP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>), was used to identify hPSC-SAN cells that co-stain for cleaved caspase-3, as an assay for cytotoxicity. The hPSC-SAN cells derived from all of the lines showed at least some increase in the percentage of cleaved caspase3<sup>+</sup>-ISL1<sup>&#x2212;</sup> cells following treatment with DOXO. We identified 14 &#x201c;high-sensitive&#x201d; iPSC lines that generate hPSC-SAN cells displaying DOXO-induced apoptosis rates greater than 4-fold compared to DMSO-treated cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>). To test if this platform can be applied toward in vitro pharmacogenomics, the iPSC clones were sequenced at several genomic regions harboring known SNPs associated with increased DOXO-mediated cardiotoxicity, including rs1056892, rs2229774 and rs885004 (in or near the genes CBR3, RARG and SLC28A3, respectively). 10 out of the 14 high-sensitive iPSC lines harbored one of these 3 SNPs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c</i></figref>). All 4 of the lines carrying the risk allele of rs1056892 generated hPSC-SAN cells with more than 4-fold increased toxicity. This is consistent with findings that CBR3 is expressed in heart tissue and functions for drug metabolism.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0101">The remaining lines, including several high-sensitive lines, had no known risk alleles associated with DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we sought to identify novel genetic variants associated with chemo-toxicity of SAN tissue. Genomic DNA from each of the iPSC lines was hybridized to Illumina arrays to genotype SNPs across the human genome. The SNP data was then analyzed for associations with cell toxicity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>). A total of 65 genetic variants showing suggestive associations (p&#x3c;10<sup>5</sup>) with pacemaker toxicity were selected for further analysis, to determine whether the in vitro platform can successfully identify genetic variants that predict outcome in human patients. For this purpose, we studied a cohort of 384 patients who underwent chemotherapy. 52 of the patients presented with early-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and 16 required placement of artificial permanent pacemakers (ppm). SNPs from three candidate loci identified in the in vitro hPSC-SAN-toxicity study were nominally associated (p&#x3c;0.025; 0.05/2 phenotypes) with AF (1 locus, rs9559211, LIG4) and ppm (2 loci, rs7314566, ANO2 and rs17267852, NRXN1). (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>e</i></figref>). Interestingly, the function of LIG4 is tied to DNA Topoisomerase II (TOPII), which is a direct target of anthracyclines. Cells deficient in LIG4 and patients with mutations in LIG4 are hyper-sensitive to TOPII targeting drugs. Using unbiased phenome-wide scanning (PheWAS) in an electronic health record (EHR) cohort, we identified associations (p&#x3c;0.05) between variants in genes from candidate loci and either neoplasm-related adverse effects or symptoms related to conduction system pathology (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>f</i></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0102">These findings demonstrate that hPSC-SAN cells can be used to model DOXO-induced cytotoxicity and discover novel genetic variants that are associated with arrhythmia phenotypes. With this validated platform, we carried out a small molecule screen to identify compounds capable of rescuing the toxicity effects observed with DOXO-treatment of hPSC-SAN cells. 1472 compounds were tested consisting of FDA-approved drugs and natural products. Hit targets were selected based on a reduced percent ratio of GFP<sup>+</sup> cleaved caspase-3<sup>+</sup>/GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>a</i></figref>). The compounds that decreased the cell death rate by more than two-fold of the standard deviation below the average of DMSO-treated samples were selected as primary hits. Physcion, a naturally occurring anthraquinone and an aldehyde reductase inhibitor, was further validated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b</i></figref>). Aldehyde reductases have been shown to convert DOXO into alcohol metabolites in the cardiomyocyte cytoplasm that results in significant cardiac toxicity. Physcion was effective at a dose of 10-20 &#x3bc;M. To determine whether this drug can protect the high-sensitive iPSC line derivatives, three of the most sensitive iPSC lines were differentiated to SAN-like cells and treated with DOXO in the presence or absence of 10 &#x3bc;M Physcion.

The two aqueous suspensions&#x2014;the single-cell suspension and the barcoded primer beads suspended in a lysis buffer, were loaded into 3 mL plastic syringes (BD) respectively. Droplet generation oil (BioRad) was loaded into a 10 mL plastic syringe (BD).

High-throughput genotyping of 906,600 SNPs was performed on Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Santa Clara, Calif., USA) at Core Facility of Albert Einstein College of Medicine following the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., USA). Genotyping was performed using the default parameters in the Birdseed v2 algorithm of Genotyping Console (GTC) 4.2 software (Affymetrix). As a quality control for the genotyping, Contrast QC values were calculated as implemented in the GTC 4.2, and samples used passed the recommended values. Genome annotations applied in data analysis referred to the human reference assembly GRCh37/hg19 as provided by the Affymetrix annotation file. In this study, SNPs with low minor allele frequencies (&#x3c;0.05), low call rates (&#x3c;95%), and inconsistent genotype frequencies with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P&#x3c;1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>) were excluded. In addition, allosome SNPs were not analyzed. After quality control, a total of 691,822 common SNPs were included in the association analysis. An iterative procedure was used to simultaneously estimate principal components (PCs) reflecting population structure. Linear regression was applied to examine associations of SNPs and phenotypes under an additive model adjusted for sex and two principal components. Analyses were performed using R (version 3.3.2 R Foundation).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0117">Association with anthracycline-association arrhythmia phenotypes in humans. Variants identified in cell-based screens were tested for association in a human cohort of subjects (N=384) treated with anthracyline-based chemotherapy. The cohort was developed from BioVU, the Vanderbilt University biobank linking DNA samples (and any related genotype data) extracted from blood leftover after routine clinical care at Vanderbilt University Medical Center to a de-identified version of the electronic health record (EHR) intended to support research. Details of the cohort as well as the development and implementation of BioVU have been described (PMID: 28542097, 18500243). Subjects with atrial fibrillation (AF) or pacemaker implantation after chemotherapy initiation were identified using key word searches and automated queries of billing and procedure codes. Subjects were genotyped in the Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics (VANTAGE) Core using the Illumina Omni 1-Quad platform using standard quality control filters at the sample and variant level. Genotypes were imputed to 1000 Genomes Phase 1 version 3 (Apr. 19, 2012) using reference panels from all 1000 Genomes populations. Variants were tested for association with AF and pacemaker implantation separately using multiple logistic regression, implemented in PLINK, adjusted for age, race, gender. As this was a hypothesis-generating &#x201c;replication&#x201d; from our cell-based &#x201c;discovery&#x201d; analyses, we chose a significant threshold of 0.025 (0.05/2 phenotypes).</p><p id="p-0122" num="0118">PheWAS analysis. To assess whether genes from identified loci have broader phenotypic relevance (i.e., outside patients treated with chemotherapy) we conducted phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) in subjects with available genotype data [25,539 on the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip v.1.0 (&#x2018;exome chip&#x2019;) and 13,331 on the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array (MEGA) platform] generated as part of ongoing research efforts. All subjects were of European decent and subject overlap between the two platforms was modest (2,729). The PheWAS method utilized a validated medical phenome of hierarchically grouped International Classification of Disease (ICD-9) billing codes into &#x2dc;1,800 phenotypes (&#x2018;phecodes&#x2019;), each with defined control groups. Logistic regression was used to serially test for association between genetic variants in candidate genes and each phecode phenotype. All analyses were adjusted for age and gender. As these were exploratory analyses, we chose a liberal threshold of 0.05 for evidence of nominal association with each phenotype.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0119">Chemical screen. The high-throughput chemical screening was performed by Prestwick FDA approved and natural products libraries. The 30 day old hES-SAN cells derived from the dual-reporter line were replated into matrigel coated 384-well plates. The DOXO was added at final concentration as 0.16 &#x3bc;M. At the same time, individual compound from chemical library was added at final concentration as 10 &#x3bc;M and maintained for 3 days. The plates were fixed and stained with primary antibodies against GFP and Caspase-3. The compounds that decreased the cell death rate by more than two-fold of the standard deviation below the average of DMSO-treated samples were selected as primary hits. For validation, the cells treated with varying doses of the hit compound and a dose curve was generated. Finally, the sensitive iPS lines were treated with 10 &#x3bc;M physcion and DOXO to validate the efficacy on different cell lines and stained with ISL1 and Caspase-3 for scoring.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0120">Data availability statements.

pacemaker cell death has yet to be reported as a cardiotoxic side effect of Doxorubicin. To corroborate this in vitro discovery, we assayed Doxorubicin toxicity in vivo in mice. C57BL/6 mice were treated with 20 mg/kg Doxorubicin by intraperitoneal injection. 9 days post injection, the mice were euthanized and whole heart imaging of mouse heart revealed cell death localized to the HCN4+ SAN cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). Consistent with putative SAN dysfunction, hearts of mice treated with Doxorubicin exhibited irregular contractions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>).

Thus, we used an ex vivo model to document the direct effect of Doxorubicin and Physcion on the murine SAN. Whole, intact atrial explants were incubated with 1 &#x3bc;M doxorubicin or 1 uM doxorubicin+20 &#x3bc;M Physcion for 3 hrs. Consistent with our in vivo doxorubicin treatment studies, control explants lacked cell death and had rhythmic contractions; while doxorubicin-treated explants exhibited localized SAN cell death and irregular contractility (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). Strikingly, physcion blocks doxorubicin-induced SAN cell death and arrhythmic contractility of explants (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>).
