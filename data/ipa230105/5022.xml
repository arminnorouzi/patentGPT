In some cases, however, an entity could send too many electronic communications to customers and abuse the use of customers' contact information or permission to send communications. For example, sending too many electronic communications within a certain period of time can reduce the customers' experience and cause one or more customers to opt-out of an online marketing campaign. Research indicates excessive frequency of electronic communications is the number one reason customers opt-out of campaigns. It is difficult, however, for marketers to determine an optimal contact frequency for recipients in a marketing campaign that will achieve goals of the campaign while avoiding excess opt-outs.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In online marketing campaigns, such as electronic communications campaigns, marketers want to increase brand awareness or convert customers while maintaining opt-outs at an acceptable level for the campaign, for example. Accordingly, embodiments described herein are directed to performing multi-objective electronic communications frequency optimizations. At a high level, an entity or individual, such as a marketer, can set objectives or goals for an electronic communications campaign. For instance, a company can track a list of customers or potential customers who have agreed to receive electronic communications from the company (e.g., when purchasing a product by selecting an option to receive informative or promotional emails from the company). The company can develop an electronic communications campaign with an offer or advertisement to be distributed to the customers in an email or a series of emails over a time period, or in text messages or other electronic communications. The emails can feature a new product or sale price, for example. A marketer working for the company can select certain goals for the electronic communications campaign, such as at least a 10% open rate, or at least a 10% click rate on link(s) within the electronic communications. In embodiments, a marketer can also select a desired or tolerated range of opt-out percentages, such as an opt-out rate below 20%, for the electronic communications campaign. According to aspects of embodiments described herein, marketers can achieve their campaign goals without causing too high of a rate of opt-outs, so that the company does not lose permission to contact too many of its customers, for example for future electronic communications campaigns. In embodiments, frequency optimization is based on maximizing campaign goals, such as opened electronic communications, and limited by an opt-out count according to an opt-out probability. A two-step model for opt-out probability can be used as part of the frequency optimization. The output or result of frequency optimization can be a frequency capping value (for example, x). This frequency capping value, x, can be for a certain period of time, such as thirty days. In embodiments, a frequency optimization is performed at a group level and on an individual basis, based on overall campaign goals and an overall tolerated opt-out range.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description.

Electronic marketing communications can be sent to recipients who agreed to receive electronic communications from a company. Recipients, however, tend to opt-out if the frequency of electronic communications is too high. As such, it is important for entities to meet campaign goals without causing excessive opt-outs, such as people selecting to cancel or unsubscribe from communications. As electronic communications campaigns have different objectives and different customers, it is difficult for a campaign manager to generate a delivery strategy for electronic communications to achieve goals of the campaign including an acceptable opt-out rate. Research indicates nearly one-half of opt-outs from electronic communications campaigns are based on excessive frequency of messages to recipients.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Conventional technologies can include fixed batch deliveries for electronic communications campaigns, with messages sent on a fixed day, at a fixed time, and/or with fixed content (such as the same content for all potential customers). These conventional technologies are not adaptable or flexible for various customers. As one example, certain customers may tend to open email messages in the morning, e.g., approximately 7:00 AM, while other customers may open email messages more often in the evening. Some customers may be less likely to open a campaign email if it was received, for example, over ten hours ago, perhaps because additional emails have accumulated. This individual behavior cannot be considered using fixed technologies. Additionally, some customers may have different interest levels in a certain product, for example due to demographics such as an age group or due to recent purchases. Thus, conventional technologies with fixed content and deliveries can be ineffective with respect to individual customers.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Conventional technologies with fixed content and deliveries can also be ineffective in the context of individuals with varying levels of tolerance for receiving campaign email messages. Although some conventional batch technologies may select to deliver emails on holidays or other occasions, or to avoid certain days or occasions, the days and times are often random and are implemented for all email recipients, with the same content for all recipients. But individual customers may have different levels of tolerance for email messages (e.g., how many messages they are willing to receive prior to an opt-out). This tolerance level may depend on the type of email message (e.g., brand awareness versus a conversion email), or the newness of a customer to an electronic communication campaign or to a brand experience. In some cases, the tolerance level may depend on the users' interactions with email or other messages. For example, a customer may tolerate five promotional emails a week if they are not opened, but only two a week if they are being opened. Conventional technologies such as batch deliveries do not account for these differences.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Some conventional technologies may try to apply empirical or rule-based approaches, to address the short-comings described above, but these conventional technologies can require time-consuming, human input. For example, these conventional technologies can require using groups for split, or A/B, testing, and they require observations and results summarized into rules by human beings. For example, a rule could indicate that if a customer has a higher open-email rate, then a marketer may send more emails to the customer. These conventional technologies can require a significant amount of human input, without being able to automatically optimize electronic communication frequency, and these technologies can require considerable time and resources, including failed or less-effective test groups. Rule-based technologies can include conflicting rules and/or ambiguous rules that cannot be automatically applied, for example requiring marketers to still determine precise values for delivery frequency, delivery time, etc. They cannot optimize the frequency of email messages without requiring manual determinations based on conflicting or ambiguous rules.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Other conventional technologies may try to address issues relating to various individual recipients, such as frequency optimizing at an individual level, but these conventional technologies may also require substantial human input. For example, these technologies may only seek to avoid individual customer opt-outs, at the individual level, not a campaign level. A human marketer may still be required for frequency optimizing at an individual level, because a campaign's objectives are not addressed nor automatically balanced with one or more opt-outs or an opt-out rate. These conventional technologies with only individual-level frequency considerations are not configured to increase brand awareness or convert customers while maintaining opt-outs at an acceptable level for a campaign. Additionally, conventional technologies operating at the individual level, with no frequency calculations performed on groups or clusters, do not account for or consider overall electronic communication campaign goals including opt-out rates.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly, embodiments described herein provide solutions that improve electronic communications campaign technologies, for example by automatically balancing one or more objectives of an electronic communications campaign against an overall opt-out rate for the campaign. In some cases, data from one or more models (for example relating to an open probability for electronic communications, or to an opt-out probability) is used by a frequency optimizer, along with campaign objectives and an opt-out rate tolerance. The frequency optimizer can generate individual contact frequencies for individual email recipients. In embodiments, an estimated campaign-level engagement and/or opt-out rate is also generated. Embodiments described herein can avoid unnecessary or counterproductive communications while achieving overall campaign goals. In implementations, a process can be used to construct an opt-out probability, including preprocessing, which can improve the computational efficiency of systems implementing embodiments described herein. In operation, generally, aspects of the present disclosure cluster electronic communications recipients into different groups based on their past responses and activities. Thereafter, a contact frequency for electronic communications is optimized for each of the different groups, thereby avoiding time and other resources of an optimizer directly working on each of millions of recipients without any grouping of clustering of recipients for efficiency or reduced resources. Additionally, embodiments automatically self-update with the latest recipients' responses to improve electronic communications schedules based on the updates, and embodiments can automatically generate or implement new schedules.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Operating Environment</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a general operating environment <b>100</b> is shown, in accordance with one or more embodiments for generating or managing an electronic communications campaign.

In one example, communications-frequency manager <b>108</b> is distributed across more than computing devices such as servers.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A communications-frequency manager <b>108</b>, in embodiments, analyzes data from client devices (e.g., client device <b>102</b><i>a</i>) and a marketer system <b>120</b> to optimize electronic communication campaigns. For example, communications-frequency manager <b>108</b> analyzes behavior associated with a client communications component <b>104</b> (such as emails opened or not), and it analyzes data from marketer system <b>120</b>, in order to implement electronic communication campaign goals and to achieve customer opt-outs within a tolerated range. In embodiments, a marketer or other entity can use aspects of the communications-frequency manager <b>108</b>, either directly or remotely, to implement an electronic communication campaign. For example, a marketer system <b>120</b> can comprise an electronic communication campaign program or interface, available to a marketer for inputting certain data or granting access to data, such as email campaign data and goals and in communication with communications-frequency manager <b>108</b>. The marketer can use the communications-frequency manager <b>108</b> to implement or improve the electronic communications campaign data, for example to receive an output of electronic communications frequencies that are optimized for the campaign.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A processing system of the communications-frequency manager <b>108</b> may execute computer-program instructions based on determinations or probabilities received from the modules <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and other applications of the computing device (not shown) to provide a range of functionality to the communications-frequency manager <b>108</b>, and a variety of data and program files related to electronic communication campaigns or marketing can also be included (e.g., accessible at data store <b>116</b>), examples of which include emails, multimedia files, data files, web pages, user profile and/or preference data, and so forth.

In embodiments, recipients are each users of client devices, such as client devices <b>102</b><i>a, </i><b>102</b><i>b, </i><b>102</b><i>c. </i>An electronic communication campaign dataset, for example, could include information from a marketer system <b>120</b> and/or from one or more client devices <b>102</b><i>a, </i><b>102</b><i>b, </i><b>102</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As explained with respect to various embodiments below, a communications-frequency manager <b>108</b> can analyze data from one or more client devices, such as behavior associated with a client communications component <b>104</b>, and from one more marketer systems such as marketer system <b>120</b>, for example in order to implement an electronic communication campaign in accordance with embodiments herein. For example, information from a client communications component <b>104</b> can be received by a communications-frequency manager <b>108</b>, including information regarding emails that a customer has opened, when a user has selected a link (clicked) or otherwise interacted with an electronic communication, and/or when a user of a client device <b>102</b><i>a </i>has opted-out from an electronic communication campaign, for example by requesting to unsubscribe from one or more electronic communications from an entity. In some cases, aspects of a marketer system <b>120</b> can be included as part of a communications-frequency manager <b>108</b> included on or distributed among one or more other devices.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In embodiments of an electronic communication-frequency management system, one or more computing devices (such as communications-frequency manager <b>108</b>, discussed below) automatically generates contact frequency for each individual customer in a campaign, based on the individual customer's historical responses, product affinity, the goal of the campaign, and/or an opt-out rate tolerant level. As discussed in more detail below, embodiments can generate a monthly electronic communications frequency for customers based on historical behavior, and in some cases can automatically perform an electronic communication campaign based on information from a marketer system. In some cases, an optimal sending frequency for a campaign is provided for use in a campaign or automatically implemented as part of a campaign, in order to balance a desired increase in customer engagement and other benefits of an electronic communication campaign, without losing an unacceptable amount of customers through an opt-out process.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, communications-frequency manager <b>108</b> can include a model module <b>112</b>. Model module <b>112</b> can include one or more machine-learning models to predict individual recipient-level engagement and opt-out probabilities, for example. In embodiments, the one or more models associated with model module <b>112</b> can include the models shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, such as a communications open probability model <b>214</b>, and an opt-out probability model <b>222</b>. Depending on the campaign goals and the historical customer information available, embodiments can use various models. For example, an email-click probability model <b>218</b> can be used where a campaign goal relates to an overall click rate or click amount desired, for example the overall rate or number of recipients who selected a link within a campaign electronic communication, as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a frequency optimizer module <b>114</b> is included as part of communications-frequency manager <b>108</b>. A frequency optimizer module <b>114</b> can perform optimizations to provide outputs such as email-frequencies for individual recipients. In one example, frequency optimizer module <b>114</b> can comprise or include a frequency optimizer <b>210</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. A frequency optimizer module <b>114</b>, or the other modules of the communications-frequency manager <b>108</b>, can access information from data store <b>116</b>, such as data received from a marketer system <b>120</b> or client device <b>102</b><i>a </i>over network <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The exemplary operating environment <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is one illustration of a system capable of implementing embodiments described herein, to optimize the frequency of emails sent to customers as part of an electronic communication campaign (such as emails received by client devices <b>102</b><i>a, </i><b>102</b><i>b, </i><b>102</b><i>c</i>), for example. Such implementations enable marketers to meet overall electronic communication campaign goals while managing customer opt-outs, such as selections to &#x201c;unsubscribe&#x201d; and no longer receive emails from a campaign or future campaigns.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">When a marketer or other entity decides to implement an online electronic communication campaign, such as an email marketing campaign, the marketer can include goals for the campaign. For example, one goal can be maximizing a &#x201c;communication open&#x201d; rate, which indicates the number of campaign communications opened by recipients. Another goal can be the number of links within the communication that are used or selected by users. These exemplary goals can be used in combination or as alternatives. For example, a marketer can focus on a &#x201c;communications open&#x201d; rate and desire to balance a campaign-wide &#x201c;email open&#x201d; rate against an acceptable campaign-wide opt-out rate.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some cases, goals include brand awareness, which may include communications with little or no pressure to act by the users. Goals can include conversion of customers, such as new or current customers making a purchase or taking another action. In some cases, goals can include keeping customers informed or reminded of products or services, and, for example, maintaining a low opt-out rate. Or, in other cases, goals can include causing the most purchases or clicks per campaign while tolerating a relatively higher opt-out rate. For example, a marketer using marketer system <b>120</b>, or another entity, can input one or more goals for an electronic communication campaign into a campaign data module <b>122</b>, so that the email-frequency manager <b>110</b> can access campaign goal information. A company may desire to implement goals to keep customer informed most of the time or during periods without product releases or pushes for higher sales. In some cases, during a product release or a period where the company wants increased sales or revenue, the main goals of an electronic communication campaign may change, for example the company may be willing to tolerate a higher opt-out rate during these periods in exchange for higher rates of emails opened or links selected.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In embodiments, one or more campaign goals are provided to marketers via an interface at a client device, such as client device <b>102</b><i>b. </i>A marketer can select one or more goals using the interface, or customize the rates or values associated with one or more goals, using the client device <b>102</b><i>b. </i>Client device <b>102</b><i>b </i>can transmit the campaign goal selections from a marketer to a marketer system <b>120</b> over network <b>106</b>. In some cases, email-frequency manager <b>110</b> retrieves campaign goal information from marketer system <b>120</b> and stores the most-recent or accurate campaign goal information in data store <b>116</b> for later use.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A marketer can set certain campaign goals, including an acceptable overall opt-out rate for an electronic communication campaign. Aspects of embodiments described herein can use historical data regarding potential customers or other users to determine how an electronic communication campaign is likely to be received and acted upon by recipients of the electronic communications. For example, various potential customers, such as users of client devices <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b, </i><b>102</b><i>c, </i>can have a different affinity for a certain product or brand. As one example, newer customers who just signed up for electronic communications or recently bought a product or related product may respond negatively to too many electronic communications too soon, because the communications may feel abrupt or overwhelming instead of affirming or informative. On the other hand, a newer customer (or any customer) may be identified by a system as actively interacting with campaign communications, such as by opening emails and/or by selecting links or other options within communications. Certain customers can be identified as frequently using a product, such as a streaming service or a delivery service, which can be considered as part of generating an electronic communication campaign for one or more customers.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In embodiments, individual recipients of 0 such as users of client devices <b>102</b><i>a, </i><b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c, </i>can be determined to respond differently to higher-frequency electronic communication campaigns, with respect to their relationship with an entity and/or their affinity for email communications (i.e., high engagement). For example, a potential customer may remain engaged, by continuing to open electronic communications and/or click on links within electronic communications, even if the campaign communications are received every day, for example. Other potential customers may be moderately engaged when communications are received once a week, but be less engaged and demonstrate a lower rate of opened emails above a threshold frequency, such as every other day. In embodiments, the likely actions of individual recipients can be considered as part of an overall campaign with an overall opt-out limit as one of its goals.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Embodiments described herein can provide a system for meeting campaign goals, such as maximizing a total email &#x201c;open&#x201d; count, meaning a total amount of emails from an email marketing campaign that were opened by users of one or more client devices <b>102</b><i>a, </i><b>102</b><i>b, </i><b>102</b><i>c, </i>or maximizing a total click count or a total conversion rate (e.g., associated purchases), etc. In some cases, the maximized rates may relate to one or more users (for example what amount of users of client devices <b>102</b><i>a, </i><b>102</b><i>b, </i><b>102</b><i>c </i>opened an email or clicked a link within an email). In other cases, one or more rates to be maximized is on a campaign level, such as a campaign-level open rate, meaning how many communications were opened of multiple communications sent as part of a campaign (even if multiple communications were opened by the same user, in some cases), or a campaign-level click rate, etc. A goal of a campaign opt-out rate can be a range, such as an opt-out level below 20%, or between 10-20%, for example. In embodiments, the frequency of communications sent to users is optimized so that an electronic communication campaign can achieve campaign goals while maintaining a desired opt-out level.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Communications Frequency Optimization System</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary system <b>200</b> depicting aspects of embodiments suitable for use in implementations of the present disclosure, for example, an email-frequency optimization system architecture. The exemplary system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of a multi-objective electronic communications frequency management system, such as communications-frequency manager <b>108</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a frequency optimizer <b>210</b> receives input, such as marketer input <b>212</b>. In embodiments, marketer input <b>212</b> includes one or more campaign goals or objectives, such an &#x201c;Communications total open count maximization&#x201d; (Objective 1); and &#x201c;Communications total click count maximization&#x201d; (Objective 2, in this example). Additionally, marketer input can include &#x201c;Communications total conversion maximization&#x201d; (Objective 3); &#x201c;Weighted Open Count, Click Count and Conversion maximization&#x201d; (Objective 4); &#x201c;Communications open rate maximization (for awareness)&#x201d; (Objective 5); and/or &#x201c;Communications click rate maximization (for site conversion)&#x201d; (Objective 6). Some or all of these objectives, or other goals, can be input from a marketer system (e.g. marketer system <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) or provided from one or more marketer sources or data storage, and additional goals, or differently-named versions of these goals, can be used in embodiments.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A marketer can provide other various inputs for use by the system <b>200</b>. For example, a marketer can provide, as marketer input <b>212</b>, parameters for opt-out rates by users. As one example, marketer input <b>212</b> can include an opt-out rate tolerance for an electronic communication campaign. The opt-out rate tolerance can indicate an amount or percent of customers or potential customers the marketer is willing to accept as likely or expected to opt-out of receiving email notifications from an entity as part of an electronic communication campaign. For example, a marketer may select to only tolerate an opt-out rate below a percentage, such as 5% or 10%, which the system can consider along with the objectives of the electronic communication campaign. In some cases, an opt-out rate tolerance ratio, can be used to determine the expected opt-out rate for the campaign, by multiplying the opt-out tolerance ratio against a current opt-out rate to determine an expected opt-out rate for a campaign, for example. In other words, an expected opt-out rate can equal a current opt-out rate times the opt-out rate tolerance ratio.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Various machine-learning models can be used to predict aspects of an electronic communication campaign, which can be used by a frequency optimizer <b>210</b>. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, models include machine-learning models used to predict recipient-level engagement and opt-out probabilities. The models in this example include a communications open probability model <b>214</b>, a communications click probability model <b>216</b>, a conversion probability model <b>218</b>, a site conversion probability model <b>220</b>, and an opt-out probability model <b>222</b>. In certain cases, one or more models can be used, including data from machine-learning models or dynamically-updated models. One or more models use customers' historical email engagement activities, website engagement activities, and/or product purchase or usage activities, for example, to predict various probabilities.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A communication open probability model <b>214</b> can be used to predict the likelihood a communication, for example an email as part of an electronic communication campaign, will be opened by the recipient, in embodiments. The communication open probability model <b>214</b> can receive inputs regarding user behavior, such as prior actions in response to prior communication by users. In some cases, the communication open probability model <b>214</b> can receive input regarding prior actions by users to different types of emails, or to emails received at certain times of day, or to emails received above a certain frequency level, for example. The communication open probability model <b>214</b> can be used when one of the marketer's objectives relates to the total amount or percentage of campaign emails that will be opened by email recipients.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A communications click probability model <b>216</b> can be used to predict the likelihood that a user will make a selection of one or more items within a campaign communication, such as selecting or clicking on a link within a campaign email. For example, a marketer can set as an objective a certain amount or percentage of communications within a campaign that will lead to a recipient clicking on at least one link contained in the campaign communication. A link within a campaign communication can be a hyperlink to a company's website or a link to a webpage with an option to purchase a product, for example. In one example, a campaign email can include a unique offer to one or more users, such as a special sale price on an item or service. The offer can be presented as a link, which users can select, that will enable users to purchase the item or service at a discounted rate. In this example, the link may not be generally available to the public or searchable, and the link may only be provided in campaign emails. In embodiments, a link can be presented in a campaign email as an image or icon that can be selected. The communication click probability model <b>216</b> can receive inputs regarding prior user actions in response to emails, and other information about the electronic communication campaign and/or recipients, in embodiments.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A conversion probability model <b>218</b> can also be used by the system <b>200</b>. In embodiments, the conversion probability model <b>218</b> provides a prediction of the likelihood that an email in an electronic communication campaign will result in a purchase from a company or other target actions, such as signing up for a service. For example, a conversion can include a purchase by a user based on one or more links provided in a campaign email, which a user can select to reach a check-out page. A conversion could comprise a user joining a group via a link in a campaign email, in embodiments. In some cases, a conversion may not happen directly from a link within a campaign email. Instead, a conversion could be a purchase or other action taken with respect to an entity, such as a seller, within a window after receiving a campaign email. For example, a conversion probability model <b>218</b> could consider a conversion to include purchases made from an entity's website within one day of receiving a campaign email to be a conversion.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">One or more outputs from the machine-learning models can be input to the frequency optimizer <b>210</b>, as shown in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. A frequency optimizer <b>210</b> can be the core of a system for generating or implementing electronic communication campaign technologies, for example to optimize each individual's frequency of email receipts or contacts, while enabling one or more objectives of a campaign and while keeping an opt-out rate under a predetermined opt-out rate tolerance, as described in more detail below. In embodiments, a system <b>200</b> can implement a group level frequency optimization aspect <b>316</b>, discussed below, prior to out-putting optimized electronic communications frequencies for individuals.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In embodiments, a system <b>200</b> can provide frequency-optimizer output <b>224</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which can include, for example, an individual customer contact frequency, which can be on a daily basis, a weekly basis, or an amount of contacts per month, or another increment, such as points of time or intervals at which to contact an individual with one or more electronic communications. The frequency-optimizer output <b>224</b> can also include an estimated campaign-level engagement rate and/or opt-out rate. A campaign-level engagement rate can indicate a rate of interaction with campaign emails overall, for the entire campaign, such as an overall communications open rate or click rate, for example, for the entire campaign. A campaign-level opt-out rate can be the overall amount or percent of users included in an electronic communication campaign (as communication recipients) that select to unsubscribe or terminate the receipt of campaign emails or any emails from an entity, for example by withdrawing permission for the company to contact the recipient via email. In embodiments, a frequency optimizer <b>210</b> outputs, as frequency-optimizer output <b>224</b>, an optimal objective curve for a range of opt-out rate tolerance, which is discussed in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, below.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an exemplary diagram <b>300</b> depicting aspects of embodiments is shown, namely a frequency optimizer <b>310</b> (which can correspond to frequency optimizer <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Frequency optimizer <b>310</b> can implement one or more Equations to automatically make frequency optimization and delivery decisions for each individual (such as users of client devices <b>102</b><i>a, </i><b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>), based on current models, such as open, click, conversion, and/or opt-out models. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary framework or workflow of a frequency optimizer <b>310</b>. A customer historical data/feature extraction aspect <b>312</b> is shown as part of frequency optimizer <b>310</b>. A customer historical data/feature extraction aspect <b>312</b> can be a process to extract individual customers' historical responses to emails, such as campaign emails. The historical responses can include responses to receiving emails such as opening or not opening the emails. In one example, the historical responses can indicate if various users are more likely to open emails at certain times of day, such as in the morning or evening, for example. The historical responses can also indicate the amount or ratio of emails opened by each user, in embodiments.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some cases, historical responses can show activity regarding any selections of links within prior emails, or replies to emails or other actions taken in response. In some embodiments, historical responses show whether users have purchased products or services in response to one or more emails, for example by selecting a link to navigate to a company's webpage and then completing a purchase using the website, or registering for a service using the website. In some cases, historical responses include data regarding users opting out of an electronic communication campaign, for example by selecting to unsubscribe from emails associated with a company.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The historical responses can be associated with demographic data about the users and other information (for example about the emails in the electronic communication campaign, such as content and timing). In some cases, the historical responses represent responses by prior users that can be used to predict future electronic communication campaign outcomes. In some cases, the prior users include some of the current users being targeted by the electronic communication campaign, because system <b>200</b> may have access to historical responses from some or all of the current recipients of campaign emails. In other cases, the historical responses represent responses from prior or other users who are not included in a set of current users, but can be used for predicting behavior of the current users, based on demonstrating similar behaviors to certain current users.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The customer historical data/feature extraction aspect <b>312</b> can be used by a customer group clustering aspect <b>314</b> to divide customers into segments or groups. In embodiments, the division or clustering of customers into groups enables a system <b>200</b> to analyze at a group level, which can be more efficient and require less resources than performing the analyses for each individual user. In other words, embodiments of system <b>200</b> include aspects that operate at a higher, group level, instead of repeating certain analyses for every user. This can result in significantly reduced required computations. The reduced amount of computation can provide a faster solution and use less computing resources than conventional technologies.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, the customer group clustering aspect <b>314</b>, or segmentation aspect, can reduce computation complexity, so aspects of the frequency optimizer <b>310</b> can work on different customer groups instead of individual customers. In some cases, to segment customers into different groups, a clustering algorithm is applied, e.g., K-means clustering based on customers' features, for example. By performing group-level optimization to customer groups (as discussed below, by a group level frequency optimization aspect <b>316</b>), systems such as system <b>200</b> can reduce the resources, such as power and time, needed for the system <b>200</b> to determine aspects of an electronic communication campaign, such as a frequency optimization. Frequency optimizer <b>310</b> can collect campaign-level and individual-level recipients' responses to a delivery, such as a batch delivery, after a period of time, for example. In embodiments, frequency optimizer <b>310</b> can update the models based on the latest response(s) (such as performing model calibration), and generate a new frequency optimization and delivery decision for a future time.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In embodiments, a content-aware frequency capping model <b>315</b> is implemented as part of frequency optimization, as discussed in more detail below. As an example, the content-aware frequency capping model <b>315</b> can be used to provide limits on the frequency of emails based on the content of the emails, discussed below. In embodiments, the content of the emails can be based on whether the email subject line or the email body is determined to relate to advertisements or not. For example, a frequency cap can be provided by a content-aware frequency capping model based on responses to emails with a non-advertisement-type subject line but an advertisement-type email body. In some cases, users may have lower tolerance levels for emails that do not appear to relate to advertisements before they are opened, but, when they are opened, the body of the email relates to an advertisement. Customers may respond by opting out sooner and/or at a higher level if certain companies are perceived as trying to mislead them. If an entity sends an email with a subject line relating to a recent purchase (&#x201c;RE: Your Order Number 123&#x201d;), but the body of the email is an advertisement for another product to be used with the recent purchase, a user may be more likely to opt-out than if the emails in an electronic communication campaign have subject lines that are consistent with the bodies of the emails, with respect to advertisements. The information from the content-aware frequency capping model <b>315</b> can be used by the frequency optimizer <b>310</b> to perform a group level frequency optimization <b>316</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, model outputs such as scores and/or marketer input <b>322</b> can be used by a frequency optimizer <b>310</b> with respect to a group level frequency optimization aspect <b>316</b>. In embodiments, the parameters of an electronic communication campaign such as its goals and other data are set by a marketer and applied by a system, such as system <b>200</b>, at a group level, as shown in the more detailed frequency optimizer <b>310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Embodiments can also apply scores or other outputs from models regarding probabilities (such as email-open or email-click), which are relevant to one or more campaign goals, at the group level. Thus a group level frequency optimization aspect <b>316</b> can consider or apply scores from one or more models (e.g., communications open probability model <b>214</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and one or more Objectives from marketers, or other information regarding an electronic communication campaign or customers, at a group level, saving computational time and energy.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The group level frequency optimization aspect <b>316</b> can be used to apply one or more email-campaign objectives to a group or cluster of customers. The objectives can relate to the overall number of emails opened or the overall number of emails where a link is selected or clicked on by recipients, for example. In embodiments, the email-campaign objectives may include any or all of Objectives 1 through 6, above, for example. As explained above, the group level frequency optimization aspect <b>316</b> can perform analyses on customer segments or clusters relating to achieving campaign goals, without having to perform the calculations for each individual customer. One or more of the equations described below can be used by frequency optimizer <b>310</b> at the group level, to determine electronic communications frequencies for groups that achieve goals, such as the highest number of opened or clicked-on emails possible.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As one example, Obj<sub>1 </sub>(Objective 1) above may be applied at the group level.

For example, a marketer may desire to achieve all three aspects of Objective <b>4</b> with an electronic communication campaign, therefore the equation considers all three. Instead of maximizing for only an email-open count or only an email-click count, all three can be considered together as part of Objective 4. In embodiments, a marketer is able to weigh each aspect, for example by assigning a 0.25 or 25% weight to two aspects and a 0.5 or 50% weight to a third aspect. In this example, the aspect a conversion count or amount could be given twice as much weight, using a weighted factor, than the aspects of an email-open count and an email-click count.

In embodiments, an individual frequency generation aspect <b>320</b> determines or provides individual contact frequencies per recipient, which can be used to set an electronic communications frequency schedule for one or more individual recipients as part of an electronic communication campaign.

In some cases, the individual frequency generation aspect <b>320</b> can generate a new individual contact frequency for one or more individuals for a new electronic communication campaign, by generating a new version of a prior contact frequency for one or more individuals.

The probability shown in Equation 8 can be expanded as shown in the following example, in embodiments, to consider the probabilities of opt-outs based on multiple emails sent:</p><p id="p-0084" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(optout|freq cap <i>x</i><sub>i</sub>)=p<sub>i</sub>(optout|send 1 email)+(1&#x2212;<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0085" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>p<sub>i</sub>(optout|send 1 email))*<i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(optout|send 2nd email))+(1&#x2212;<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0086" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(optout|send 1 email))*(1&#x2212;<i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(optout|send 2nd email))*<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0087" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(optout|send 3rd email))+ . . . +<i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(optout|send <i>x</i><sub>i</sub>&#x2212;<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0088" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>th email)) &#x3a0;<sub>m=1</sub><sup>x</sup><sup><sub2>i</sub2></sup><sup>&#x2212;1</sup>(1&#x2212;<i>p</i><sub>i</sub>(optout|send <i>m</i>&#x2212;th email))&#x2003;&#x2003;(Equation 9)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0089" num="0075">The expanded equation shown in Equation 9, above, can be approximated as shown below, in Equation 10. In general, an opt-out rate can be small, in some cases smaller than 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or 1e-3, so an equation such as Equation 9, discussed above, can be approximated by the following summation, in embodiments:</p><p id="p-0090" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3a3;<sub>m=1</sub><sup>x</sup><sup><sub2>i</sub2></sup><i>p</i>(optout|send <i>m</i>&#x2212;th email)&#x2003;&#x2003;(Equation 10)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0091" num="0076">In embodiments, approaches can include constructing the following term: p<sub>i</sub>(optout|send m&#x2212;th email), for example using historical email response actions. In embodiments, aspects such as Equations herein have properties, such as being convex and/or non-decreasing and/or smooth as a function, as discussed in more detail below. For example, it is proposed that frequency optimization, in accordance with embodiments herein, is a convex optimization problem. Convex optimizations can comprise minimizing convex functions over convex sets, for example, and may involve admitted polynomial-time algorithms.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0077">As one example, a convex optimization can be generally defined as:</p><p id="p-0093" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>min f<sub>0</sub>(x)&#x2003;&#x2003;(Equation 11)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0094" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>s.t. f</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>x</i>)&#x2264;<i>b</i><sub>i</sub><i>, i=</i>1, 2 , . . . , <i>m </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0095" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>where<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0096" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>f<sub>0</sub>, f<sub>1</sub>, . . . , f<sub>m</sub>: R<sup>n</sup>&#x2192;R<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0097" num="0000">are convex functions.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0078">In some cases, convex optimization problems (as opposed to non-convex) have advantages, such as the existence of a guaranteed, global optimal solution and relatively low computational resource requirements, because a local search algorithm is able to converge to a global optimal solution, in embodiments. Use of convex optimization(s) as described herein, with a global optimal solution, can improve the resources and/or computation requirements and improve the operation of a computing system. In contrast, nonconvex optimizations can be considered at least NP-hard (or nondeterministic polynomial time) problems, for example as intrinsically more complex and/or with no efficient solution algorithm. Therefore, to ensure that a problem, in the context of embodiments of an improved frequency optimization technology, is convex with respect to x, the constraint in Equation 8, for example, must to be convex. According to the property of convex functions, convexity of p<sub>i</sub>(optout|send m&#x2212;th email) implies or leads to the convexity of the summation in Equation 10 (and the left part in Equation 8), discussed above.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0079">In some cases, a function for an opt-out probability can be simplified as non-decreasing and/or smooth functions, for example to reduce computational complexity. In other words, to provide reduced complexity, functions can be simplified to be non-decreasing and/or smooth functions with respect to x, for example. This can be based on an observation that email recipients, such users of client devices <b>102</b><i>a, </i>etc., in an electronic communication campaign, are more likely to opt-out when they receive more and more email messages in a fixed period of time, for example. In embodiments, a sigmoid function for an opt-out probability can be applied, for example:</p><p id="p-0100" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00007" num="00007"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mi>p</mi>       <mo>&#x2061;</mo>       <mo>(</mo>       <mover accent="true">        <mi>x</mi>        <mi>&#x2dc;</mi>       </mover>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>      <mo>=</mo>      <mfrac>       <mn>1</mn>       <mrow>        <mn>1</mn>        <mo>+</mo>        <msup>         <mi>e</mi>         <mrow>          <mrow>           <mo>-</mo>           <msup>            <mi>W</mi>            <mi>T</mi>           </msup>          </mrow>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mover>           <mi>x</mi>           <mo>~</mo>          </mover>         </mrow>        </msup>       </mrow>      </mfrac>     </mrow>     <mo>,</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>Equation</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>    </mtext>      <mn>12</mn>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0101" num="0080">In this example, {tilde over (x)}&#x2208;R<sup>n </sup>can be a vector including a frequency cap x as a first component, along with other aspects.

To allow higher complexity for some aspects or features, a more complicated machine-learning model can be applied first, generally referred to as a 1st-step model. The 1st-step model can analyze past email responses (such as opening or clicking emails, or unsubscribing), for example, and output an opt-out probability. A 2nd-step model can be applied on of, or after, the 1st-step model. In some cases, the 2nd-step model may result in a nonlinear decision boundary. In order to reach a definite result without undue resources or calculations, the 2nd-step model can include a non-decreasing smooth function for frequency capping. For example, a decision boundary for a logistic regression may have a linear value represented by W<sup>T</sup>{tilde over (x)}. In embodiments, the 2nd-step model can provide a value or boundary that can be used to cap or limit the electronic communications frequencies provided by an optimization, such as by frequency optimizer <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0084">For example, a frequency optimizer may determine to increase emails in a campaign by 50% for a first group of recipients. When this increase is applied to an individual, based on their past schedule(s), a certain electronic communications frequency will result. For example, if two emails were sent last week to the individual, the frequency optimizer may increase this to three per week, based on the 50% increase. In some cases, the process described above may determine the user is likely to opt-out at a frequency above two emails per week. Thus a cap of two emails per week can be applied to the individual, in this example.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0085">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an exemplary graphical depiction <b>400</b> is shown, which illustrates a curve showing optimal email send counts (such as the total number of emails sent) as they relate to unsubscribe or opt-out rates for a set of users, such as campaign email recipients.

In such cases, embodiments can implement frequency capping that is content-aware, or at least based in part on the content of the campaign emails. For example, if emails have a subject line indicating an advertisement, recipients may be less likely to open emails or more likely to opt-out. In one example, if an email has a non-advertisement-type subject line but the body of the email is an advertisement, recipients may be more likely to unsubscribe.

The first illustrative function relates to an email-title-relevance score (or &#x201c;TR&#x201d;):</p><p id="p-0129" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>TR(t<sub>m</sub>, s<sub>m</sub>, R<sub>K</sub>, t_type<sub>m</sub>)&#x2003;&#x2003;(Equation 14)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0130" num="0105">In this function, m corresponds to the m-th email (or m<sup>th</sup>) in a series, while t<sub>m </sub>corresponds to the email subject line of the m-th email to recipients in a group, K. The term s<sub>m </sub>corresponds to an email sender and R<sub>K </sub>corresponds to the recipients in the group, K. The term t_type<sub>m </sub>in refers to the type of email title to the group.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0106">The second illustrative function relates to an email-body-relevance score (or &#x201c;BR&#x201d;):</p><p id="p-0132" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>BR(b<sub>m</sub>, R<sub>K</sub>, b_type<sub>m</sub>)&#x2003;&#x2003;(Equation 15)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0133" num="0107">In this function, b<sub>m </sub>corresponds to an email body to recipients in a group, K. The term R<sub>K </sub>corresponds to the recipients in the group, K. The term b_type<sub>m </sub>refers to the email body type to the group.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0108">In electronic communication campaigns, such as email marketing campaigns or other marketing campaigns with email aspects, emails to customers can be categorized as certain types of emails. For example, emails can be determined to be one of the following types: newsletters, lead nurturing, promotion, milestone, and survey email types. In some cases more or less categories can be used. Customers, including potential customers, can perceive pressure relating to the types of emails, and may be motivated to unsubscribe or opt-out from an electronic communication campaign at different levels or amounts of emails, depending on the type of emails, in some cases. For example, a user may unsubscribe at a lower frequency of emails to that user, if a higher percentage of the emails are promotion-type emails compared to newsletter-type emails.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0109">To use email information, the email subject line (&#x201c;title&#x201d;) and/or the email body can be determined to be of an advertising type or a non-advertising type, for instance. In one example, emails to a user may include promotional content in both the subject line and body, and thus may be determined to have an advertisement-type title and body, and these types may cause one or more customers to opt-out at a lower frequency of emails than emails with non-advertisement type titles and/or bodies. In embodiments, a communications open-rate may decline with a higher rate of communications with an advertisement-type title and/or body. In an example, Objective 1 (Obj<sub>1</sub>) can be extended or used in a more general scenario as shown below:</p><p id="p-0136" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00008" num="00008"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <munder>      <mi>max</mi>      <mi>X</mi>     </munder>     <mrow>      <msubsup>       <mo>&#x2211;</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>k</mi>        <mo>=</mo>        <mn>1</mn>       </mrow>       <mi>n</mi>      </msubsup>      <mrow>       <msubsup>        <mo>&#x2211;</mo>        <mrow>         <mi>m</mi>         <mo>=</mo>         <mn>1</mn>        </mrow>        <mi>x</mi>       </msubsup>       <mtext>    </mtext>       <mrow>        <mi fontstyle="normal">Open</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mtext>    </mtext>        <mrow>         <mo>(</mo>         <mrow>          <mi>TR</mi>          <mo>&#x2061;</mo>          <mo>(</mo>          <mrow>           <msub>            <mi>t</mi>            <mi>m</mi>           </msub>           <mo>,</mo>           <mtext>&#x205f;</mtext>           <msub>            <mi>s</mi>            <mi>m</mi>           </msub>           <mo>,</mo>           <mtext>&#x205f;</mtext>           <msub>            <mi>R</mi>            <mi>K</mi>           </msub>           <mo>,</mo>           <mtext>&#x205f;</mtext>           <msub>            <mrow>             <mi fontstyle="normal">t</mi>             <mo>&#x2062;</mo>             <mo>_</mo>             <mo>&#x2062;</mo>             <mi fontstyle="normal">type</mi>            </mrow>            <mi>m</mi>           </msub>          </mrow>          <mo>)</mo>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mo>*</mo>        <msub>         <mi>N</mi>         <mi>k</mi>        </msub>       </mrow>      </mrow>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>Equation</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>    </mtext>      <mn>16</mn>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0137" num="0110">In the function shown at Equation 16, x indicates the desired frequency capping in the model, as discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0111">In embodiments, a fatigue rate can be present, for example where emails have a non-advertisement-type title but an advertisement-type bode.

The training of BR and TR models can occur, for example, at the content-aware frequency capping model <b>315</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, after a customer-group clustering is performed, e.g., at <b>314</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Once the machine-learning models are trained or sufficiently trained, for example after a threshold amount of training or an error rate under a threshold amount, they can be used as known functions during frequency optimization, for example by a system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0115">The content-aware frequency capping model <b>315</b> can use content data relating to electronic communications, such as emails, to optimize the campaign goals such as a total count of opened electronic communications (e.g., Obj<sub>1</sub>). In some cases, where electronic messages through an application or text are used, content data can also be used by content-aware frequency capping model <b>315</b>. For example, the textual description of a hyperlink in an electronic communication could correspond to an email subject line, and the content at the hyperlink's destination can correspond to the body of an email. In other words, if a link does not indicate an advertisement, but selecting the link leads a user to an advertisement, the user's likelihood of opting out may be higher, even at lower levels of messages sent.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0116">In some cases, content-aware frequency capping model <b>315</b> can be used in place of, or as, the group-level frequency optimization <b>316</b>. In other cases, content-aware frequency capping model <b>315</b> can supplement or improve the the group-level frequency optimization <b>316</b>. In some embodiments, content data relating to electronic messages may not be available, for example if electronic messages have not been provided or composed yet. In this case, use of the content-aware frequency capping model <b>315</b> may not be an option, but the group-level frequency optimization <b>316</b> can still be used.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Simulation Results</heading><p id="p-0147" num="0117">Based on a simulation, an optimized total open count and an optimized total open rate was determined. For example, an optimal curve of open count maximization can be determined (as discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) and an optimal curve of open rate maximization (as discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), both under the constraint of an opt-out rate, for example. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, an exemplary graphical depiction <b>900</b> of an optimal curve of open count maximization is shown. For example, a population unsubscribe or opt-out rate is shown along an x-axis <b>910</b>, while a total open count is shown along a y-axis, with a curve <b>914</b> indicating an optimal curve of open count maximization. As shown at actual value <b>916</b>, a total open count of 1.3M was found, at a population unsubscribe rate below 25%, for example. Other values may be determined or used, based on a desired opt-out rate, for example, or based on other data, such as individual recipients' historical or recent responses, or the types or timing of email messages. In this example, an optimized total open count is 2.5M, much higher than the actual value of 1.3M, at the opt-out (or un-subscription) rate of 24%. By implementing embodiments of a frequency optimizer, such as frequency optimizer <b>310</b> described herein, the total open count for an electronic communications campaign is almost doubled, in this example.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0118">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, an exemplary graph <b>1000</b> of an optimal curve of open rate maximization is shown. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a population unsubscribe rate is along the x-axis <b>1010</b>, while the total open rate is shown along the y-axis <b>1012</b>. Curve <b>1014</b> reflects an optimal curve of open rate maximization, in an example. Additionally, an actual value <b>1016</b> of 29.64% total open rate is shown, with a population unsubscribe or opt-out rate below 25%, for example. In other words, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, embodiments using a frequency optimizer <b>310</b>, can provide an optimized open rate is around 55.08%, compared to the current or actual open rate of 29.64%, with an overall, population opt-out rate of 24%, demonstrating the improved frequency optimization technologies disclosed in embodiments of this disclosure. The simulation results illustrate, for example, the improved electronic communication campaign technologies provided in the present disclosure, with improves results with respect to campaign goal(s), within a target opt-out range.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0119">Having described an overview of embodiments of the present invention, an exemplary operating environment in which embodiments of the present invention may be implemented is described below in order to provide a general context for various embodiments of the present invention.
