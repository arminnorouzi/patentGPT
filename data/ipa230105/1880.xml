control information may include a first control information to control the braking of the vehicle, and the controller may be configured to generate the first control information for the braking of the vehicle, in response to the collision risk being equal to or greater than a second value and being lesser than a first value, and a reciprocal number of the time to collision exceeding a first threshold time.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The controller may be configured to generate the control information, in response to the collision risk being equal to or greater than the second value and

a front vehicle camera, and to detect the relative position and the relative velocity to the surrounding object using a radio detection and ranging (radar) or a light detection and ranging (Lidar).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another general aspect, here is provided a vehicle including a collision warner configured to acquire information on a surrounding object and information on a vehicle, and to generate collision predicting information for the surrounding object, based on the information on the surrounding object and the information on the vehicle, a classifier configured to acquire classifying information for the surrounding object, and a vehicle controller configured to control braking of the vehicle, or to provide, based on the classifying information or the collision predicting information, a buffer element to an outside of the vehicle while controlling the braking of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The classifying information may include information to classify the surrounding object as one of a child or an adult.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The classifier may be configured to acquire the classifying information, based on a height of the surrounding object or a body type of the surrounding object.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The information on the surrounding object may include a relative position to the surrounding object and a relative velocity to the surrounding object, and wherein the vehicle information may include a size of the vehicle and an angular velocity of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The collision
