Further, an object of this invention is to provide a stage capable of uniformly heating (or cooling) a substrate.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solutions to the Problems</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The problem described above can be solved by a stage including not only a heating unit that heats a mounting surface of the stage but also a cooling unit. Additionally, the problem described above can be solved by filling a gap of a groove that houses the heating unit or the cooling unit with a heat-conductive medium.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first aspect of the present invention relates to a stage installed inside a chamber for heating and cooling an object.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An example of the chamber includes a vacuum chamber. Examples of the object include a semiconductor integrated circuit, a flat display panel, and a solar photovoltaic power generation panel or substrates in the middle of manufacturing them. A stage <b>1</b> includes a stage body <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, a heating unit <b>7</b>, and a cooling unit <b>8</b>. The stage body <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> has a mounting surface on which an object is mounted. The heating unit <b>7</b> is for heating the mounting surface. The cooling unit <b>8</b> is for cooling the mounting surface. The cooling unit <b>8</b> may cool the object mounted on the mounting surface and may be used to heat the object at a temperature lower than the heating unit <b>7</b>. The heating unit <b>7</b> and the cooling unit <b>8</b>, for example, may be installed so as to swirl such that the stage can be uniformly heated or cooled. For example, to circulate a fluid from the lower side at the center of the stage to the inside of the heating unit <b>7</b> and the cooling unit <b>8</b>, the heating unit <b>7</b> and the cooling unit <b>8</b> are preferably designed so as to move around the stage.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a preferred aspect of this stage, the stage body <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> further includes a first groove <b>10</b> and a second groove <b>10</b>. Into the first groove <b>10</b>, the heating unit <b>7</b> is inserted. Into the second groove <b>10</b>, the cooling unit <b>8</b> is inserted. The first groove <b>10</b> and the second groove <b>10</b> are preferably disposed inside the stage bodies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>. In this case, the first groove <b>10</b> and the second groove <b>10</b> may have a tunnel (hole) shape housing the heating unit <b>7</b> and the cooling unit <b>8</b>. The first groove <b>10</b> and the second groove <b>10</b> only need to have a size of ensuring housing certain parts of the heating unit <b>7</b> and the cooling unit <b>8</b>. The preferred stage <b>1</b> includes a heat-conductive medium <b>13</b> in a gap between the first groove and the heating unit and a gap between the second groove and the cooling unit. The heat-conductive medium <b>13</b> is preferably filled in the gaps described above.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred aspect of this stage, the heat-conductive medium <b>13</b> is a silver, a grease, a metallic fiber, or a gas. The heat-conductive medium <b>13</b> may be a noble gas. The noble gas may be a helium gas having a pressure of 0.1 atmospheres or more to 100 atmospheres or less (1 atmosphere or more to 100 atmospheres or less, 0.1 atmospheres or more to 10 atmospheres or less, or 2 atmospheres or more to 10 atmospheres or less). The silver is preferably a silver paste. An example of the grease includes a silicon grease. When the stage is used for heating, especially a process of CVD and Etch, a corrosive gas is used. Accordingly, as a material of the stage, an aluminum having high resistance against the corrosive gas is often used. However, since the aluminum decreases in strength at high temperature, increasing the pressure of the noble gas bulges the stage like a balloon microscopically, increases a distance between the end part and the substrate, and causes a problem in temperature uniformity of the substrate. Therefore, a heating process of CVD or Etch generates a region that ensures meeting both of heat performance and temperature uniformity by controlling the pressure of the noble gas to 0.1 atmospheres to 0.5 atmospheres, which is close to vacuum.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A second aspect of the present invention relates to a vacuum device that includes any of the stages described above as a susceptor. The vacuum device is used to manufacture, for example, a semiconductor integrated circuit, a flat display panel, or a solar cell panel. The vacuum device usually includes a chamber and a vacuum pump to evacuate the chamber. The vacuum device may include an introduction portion to introduce various samples into the chamber. The vacuum device may include a sensor and a measurement device for various measurements as necessary. An example of the chamber includes a process chamber to manufacture an object. Examples of the flat display panel include an organic EL display, a plasma display, and a liquid crystal display.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A third aspect of the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a semiconductor integrated circuit, a flat display panel, or a solar cell panel using the vacuum device described above. The method for manufacturing semiconductor integrated circuit is publicly known as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent No. 3956697, Japanese Patent No. 3519589, and Japanese Patent No. 3064993. The method for manufacturing flat display panel is publicly known as disclosed in, for example, Japanese 4604752. The method for manufacturing solar cell panel is publicly known as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent No. 6555964, Japanese Patent No. 6498053, and Japanese Patent No. 5386044.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With this invention, not only the heating unit that heats the mounting surface of the stage but also the cooling unit is provided, and therefore the mounting surface of the stage can be heated and cooled. Additionally, with a preferred example of this invention, the heat-conductive medium is provided in the gap of the groove housing the heating unit or the cooling unit, and therefore the mounting surface can be uniformly heated (and cooled).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0008" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(A)</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a situation of installation of a stage.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(B)</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a state of a process of CVD and Etch when the stage is used for heating.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of a structure of the stage.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of a cross-sectional surface of the stage.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of the cross-sectional surface of the stage.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of use of a heat-conductive medium.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of using a fluid as the heat-conductive medium.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> includes conceptual diagrams illustrating an example of the stage having grooves in both of an upper surface table and a lower surface</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> includes design drawings of an aluminum plate including a flow passage.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> includes drawings illustrating a state of the stage on which thermocouples are mounted.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> includes graphs substituted for drawings illustrating temperature changes at respective parts of the stage.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0009" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The following describes configurations to embody the present invention using the drawings. The present invention is not limited to the configurations described below, but includes those appropriately modified from the configurations below by a person skilled in the art within an obvious range.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(A)</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a situation of installation of a stage. A stage <b>1</b> is usually installed to an inside of a process chamber <b>2</b> to manage a temperature of a substrate <b>3</b>. The process chamber <b>2</b> is shut off from external air and is maintained at a desired degree of vacuum. The process chamber <b>2</b> may be filled with a process gas <b>4</b> to maintain a pressure. Depending on a process chamber of a different type, for example, any chamber including a physical vapor deposition (PVD) chamber, a sputtering chamber, an ion metal implantation (IMP) chamber, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chamber, an atomic layer deposition (ALD) chamber, a plasma etching chamber, and an annealing chamber, the pressure of the process gas <b>4</b> differs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(B)</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a state of a process of CVD and Etch when the stage is used for heating. A usual susceptor is manufactured in the air, and therefore a tensile strength and a creep strength decrease in a high temperature region, and the usual susceptor bulges in a balloon shape microscopically. Especially, to heat the substrate to a Celsius 400 degrees, warpage of the stage becomes several mm in some cases, and a problem occurs in temperature uniformity.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of a structure of the stage. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the stage <b>1</b>, a heating unit <b>7</b> and a cooling unit <b>8</b> are sandwiched between the upper surface table <b>5</b> and the lower surface table <b>6</b> having a mounting surface on which an object is usually mounted. A table support <b>9</b> is mounted on the lower surface table <b>6</b>, and the heating unit <b>7</b> and the cooling unit <b>8</b> communicate with the outside of the process chamber <b>2</b> through the inside of the table support <b>9</b>. The temperature of the stage <b>1</b> is, for example, around from a room temperature to a Celsius 500 degrees, and when the temperature is low, a liquid can be flowed through the cooling unit (an example of a pipe is illustrated) <b>8</b> without using the heating unit <b>7</b>. In a case where the temperature is high, only the heating unit <b>7</b> can be used without using the cooling unit <b>8</b>. Examples of the material of the stage <b>1</b> include a metal, a quartz, Pyrex (registered trademark): heat-resistant glass, and a carbon fiber. Examples of the metal include an aluminum, a copper, and a stainless steel. Examples of the heating unit <b>7</b> possibly include a resistance heater, a combination of a heating fluid and a pipe, and a heat pump housed in a groove. Examples of the cooling unit <b>8</b> possibly include a combination of a cooling fluid and a pipe and a heat pump housed in a groove. The grooves to house the heating unit <b>7</b> and the cooling unit <b>8</b> may be disposed in the respective upper surface table <b>5</b> and lower surface table <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of a cross-sectional surface of the stage. Usually, grooves <b>10</b> to improve contact efficiency are installed in the upper surface table <b>5</b>, and the heating unit <b>7</b> and the cooling unit <b>8</b> housed in the grooves are sandwiched by the lower surface table <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of the cross-sectional surface of the stage. To enhance the contact efficiency of the upper surface table <b>5</b> and the heating unit <b>7</b> or the cooling unit <b>8</b>, the stage has a crimped structure using plastic deformation. A part of the heating unit <b>7</b>, the cooling unit <b>8</b>, and the upper surface table <b>5</b> are plastically deformed to improve the contact efficiency with the upper surface table <b>5</b> and the lower surface table <b>6</b>. The plastic deformation of the upper surface table <b>5</b> is denoted by a part <b>11</b>. There may be a case where the heating unit <b>7</b> and the cooling unit <b>8</b> are plastically deformed during crimping and the part is denoted by a part <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of use of the heat-conductive medium. Even the structure crimped using plastic deformation to enhance contact efficiency has a minute gap microscopically, and a true contacted area is, for example, only several percent. Therefore, the use of the heat-conductive medium <b>13</b> is effective. The heat-conductive medium <b>13</b> is possibly a solid, such as a carbon fiber, a grease-like matter, a liquid-like silver, and a gas, such as hydrogen and helium. With the grease-like matter, the liquid, and the gas, sealing can be provided to avoid outflow.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of using a fluid as the heat-conductive medium. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when the heat-conductive medium <b>13</b> is a fluid, such as the grease-like matter, the liquid, and the gas, the gap is preferably sealed such that the gap is filled with the heat-conductive medium <b>13</b> so as not to cause a leakage. For simplification, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates only the heating unit <b>7</b> in the left half, and illustrates only the cooling unit <b>8</b> in the right half. A sealing plate <b>14</b> is mounted on an end portion of the table support <b>9</b>, and the heating unit <b>7</b> and the cooling unit <b>8</b> are completely sealed by a sealing portion <b>15</b>. Sealing the heat-conductive medium <b>13</b> shuts off the heat-conductive medium <b>13</b> from the atmosphere, thus reducing outflow. In the case of the heat-conductive medium <b>13</b> being a gas, press-fitting the gas to the gap allows dramatically increasing heat transfer efficiency.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> includes conceptual diagrams illustrating an example of the stage having grooves in both of the upper surface table and the lower surface table constituting the stage body. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the grooves to house the heating unit <b>7</b> and the cooling unit <b>8</b> may be disposed in the respective upper surface table <b>5</b> and lower surface table <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The stage can be manufactured, for example, as follows. Machining is performed on two rectangular (for example, a square shape) aluminum plates having a thickness of from 30 to 100 mm and a length per side of from 1500 to 4000 mm to form grooves (flow passages). The material of the stage body is not limited to aluminum and only needs to be a metal. Pipes having an outer shape of from &#x3c6;5 to &#x3c6;20 made of stainless steel are inserted into the grooves (the flow passages) thus obtained. After the pipes are inserted into the grooves, the two aluminum plates are brought together, and friction stir welding (FSW welding) is performed on the outer peripheries. When the two aluminum plates are joined together, a gap is formed between the groove of the aluminum plate and the pipe made of stainless steel. Leaving the gap degrades heat transfer efficiency. Therefore, a heat-conductive medium is preferably inserted between the groove of the aluminum plate and the pipe made of stainless steel to improve heat transfer efficiency. For example, before installation of the heating unit and the cooling unit, such as the pipes, in the grooves, a fluid as the heat-conductive medium may be applied over the grooves or the grooves may be internally filled with a gas for sealing after FSW welding. Thus, the stage can be manufactured.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">WORKING EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Experimental Example 1</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Manufacturing Susceptor for Temperature Control of Glass Substrate</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The susceptor is used for temperature control of the glass substrate.

The vertical axis plots the temperature, and the horizontal axis plots the elapsed time. It was found that thermal resistances of the silicon grease and the silver paste were about &#xbd; in comparison to the case of without the heat-conductive medium and the heat transfer efficiency was improved. Additionally, since the thermal resistance of the helium gas is the lowest and becomes less than &#xbd;, improvement in heat transfer efficiency is estimated.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Since this invention relates to the stage also used as the susceptor used, for example, inside a vacuum chamber, this invention can be used in the semiconductor fabrication industry, the panel production industry, and the production industry of solar power generation panel.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF REFERENCE SIGNS</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><b>1</b> . . . stage</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><b>2</b> . . . process chamber</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><b>3</b> . . . substrate</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><b>4</b> . . . process gas</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><b>5</b> . . . upper surface table</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><b>6</b> . . . lower surface table</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><b>7</b> . . . heating unit</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><b>8</b> . . . cooling unit</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><b>9</b> . . . table support</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><b>10</b> . . . groove</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><b>11</b> . . . plastically deformed part</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><b>12</b> . . . plastically deformed part</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><b>13</b> . . . heat-conductive medium</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><b>14</b> . . . sealing plate</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><b>15</b> . . . sealing portion</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
