This timeline function allows for communication messages, such as one's own tweets or those of people who are connected over a Web service such as an SNS, to flow chronologically.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The method of display for the timeline function is for new communication messages to appear in order from the top, with older messages flowing sequentially downwards and then off the screen, disappearing from view.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, apart from a user's communication messages, a fixed advertising frame or fixed announcement frame is established for objects such as game announcements, advertisements, and the like.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a fixed advertising frame and fixed announcement frame are established apart from a user's communication messages, as described above, to display objects such as game announcements, advertisements, and the like, a problem occurs in that user retention is reduced.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a conventional method for establishing a fixed advertising frame and fixed announcement frame, a problem also exists in that visibility worsens due to the characteristics of the user interface, in particular on a mobile phone such as a smart phone or a feature phone, and the CVR for business ends up being reduced. In this context, CVR is a ratio indicating the fraction, among the number of times a website is accessed (page views) or among unique users, that leads to a conversion (the end result that can be achieved from the website, such as a merchandise purchase or request for a brochure).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure have been conceived in light of these circumstances and provides a method for displaying objects in a timeline area of a Web service, an object display device, and an information recording medium having recorded thereon a program for implementing the method that do not reduce user retention and that can increase the CVR.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A first aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for displaying an object in a timeline area, comprising the steps of: an object display device that manages a timeline of communication messages for a user of a Web service determining whether the user has taken an action within a predetermined time period on the timeline area of the Web service;

referring, for the query that has been received, to information on a date and time of an action by the user pertaining to the query and providing a response as to whether the user has taken an action within the predetermined time period;
