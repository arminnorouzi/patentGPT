id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">An introduced autonomous aerial vehicle can include multiple cameras for capturing images of a surrounding physical environment that are utilized for motion planning by an autonomous navigation system. In some embodiments, the cameras can be integrated into one or more rotor assemblies that house powered rotors to free up space within the body of the aerial vehicle. In an example embodiment, an aerial vehicle includes multiple upward-facing cameras and multiple downward-facing cameras with overlapping fields of view to enable stereoscopic computer vision in a plurality of directions around the aerial vehicle. Similar camera arrangements can also be implemented in fixed-wing aerial vehicles.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="145.12mm"

Implementation of an Autonomous Aerial Vehicle</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show example implementations of autonomous aerial vehicles that can be configured according to the introduced technique. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows an example implementation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) <b>100</b> in the form of a rotor-based aircraft such as a &#x201c;quadcopter.&#x201d; The example UAV <b>100</b> includes propulsion and control actuators <b>110</b> (e.g., powered rotors and/or aerodynamic control surfaces) for maintaining controlled flight, various sensors for automated navigation and flight control <b>112</b>, and one or more image capture devices <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> for capturing images of the surrounding physical environment while in flight. &#x201c;Images,&#x201d; in this context, include both still images and captured video. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, UAV <b>100</b> may also include other sensors (e.g., for capturing audio) and systems for communicating with other devices (e.g., a mobile device <b>104</b>) via a wireless communication channel <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the image capture devices <b>114</b> and/or <b>115</b> are depicted capturing images of an object <b>102</b> in the physical environment that happens to be a person. In some cases, the image capture devices <b>114</b>/<b>115</b> may be configured to capture images for display to users (e.g., as an aerial video platform) and/or, as described above, may also be configured for capturing images for use in autonomous navigation. In other words, the UAV <b>100</b> may autonomously (i.e., without direct human control) navigate the physical environment, for example, by processing images captured by any one or more image capture devices <b>114</b>/<b>115</b>. While in autonomous flight, UAV <b>100</b> can also capture images using any one or more image capture devices that can be displayed in real time and/or recorded for later display at other devices (e.g., mobile device <b>104</b>).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows an example configuration of a UAV <b>100</b> with multiple image capture devices configured for different purposes. In the example configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the UAV <b>100</b> includes multiple image capture devices <b>114</b> arranged about a perimeter of the UAV <b>100</b>. The image capture devices <b>114</b> may be configured to capture images for use by a visual navigation system in guiding autonomous flight by the UAV <b>100</b> and/or a tracking system for tracking other objects in the physical environment (e.g., as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Specifically, the example configuration of UAV <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> includes an array of multiple stereoscopic image capture devices <b>114</b> placed around a perimeter of the UAV <b>100</b> so as to provide stereoscopic image capture up to a full 360 degrees around the UAV <b>100</b>. However, as will be described, certain embodiments of the introduced technique include alternative arrangements of image capture devices. Accordingly, the arrangement of image capture devices <b>114</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is not to be construed as limiting.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition to the array of image capture devices <b>114</b>, the UAV <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> also includes another image capture device <b>115</b> configured to capture images that are to be displayed but not necessarily used for autonomous navigation. In some embodiments, the image capture device <b>115</b> may be similar to the image capture devices <b>114</b> except in how captured images are utilized. However, in other embodiments, the image capture devices <b>115</b> and <b>114</b> may be configured differently to suit their respective roles.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In many cases, it is generally preferable to capture images that are intended to be viewed at as high a resolution as possible given hardware and software constraints. On the other hand, if used for visual navigation and/or object tracking, lower resolution images may be preferable in certain contexts to reduce processing load and provide more robust motion planning capabilities. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the image capture device <b>115</b> may be configured to capture relatively high resolution (e.g., above 3840&#xd7;2160) color images, while the image capture devices <b>114</b> may be configured to capture relatively low resolution (e.g., below 320&#xd7;240) grayscale images. Again, these configurations are examples provided to illustrate how image capture devices <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> may differ depending on their respective roles and constraints of the system. Other implementations may configure such image capture devices differently.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The UAV <b>100</b> can be configured to track one or more objects such as a human subject <b>102</b> through the physical environment based on images received via the image capture devices <b>114</b> and/or <b>115</b>. Further, the UAV <b>100</b> can be configured to track image capture of such objects, for example, for filming purposes. In some embodiments, the image capture device <b>115</b> is coupled to the body of the UAV <b>100</b> via an adjustable mechanism that allows for one or more degrees of freedom of motion relative to a body of the UAV <b>100</b>. The UAV <b>100</b> may be configured to automatically adjust an orientation of the image capture device <b>115</b> so as to track image capture of an object (e.g., human subject <b>102</b>) as both the UAV <b>100</b> and object are in motion through the physical environment. In some embodiments, this adjustable mechanism may include a mechanical gimbal mechanism that rotates an attached image capture device about one or more axes. In some embodiments, the gimbal mechanism may be configured as a hybrid mechanical-digital gimbal system coupling the image capture device <b>115</b> to the body of the UAV <b>100</b>. In a hybrid mechanical-digital gimbal system, orientation of the image capture device <b>115</b> about one or more axes may be adjusted by mechanical means, while orientation about other axes may be adjusted by digital means. For example, a mechanical gimbal mechanism may handle adjustments in the pitch of the image capture device <b>115</b>, while adjustments in the roll and yaw are accomplished digitally by transforming (e.g., rotating, panning, etc.) the captured images so as to effectively provide at least three degrees of freedom in the motion of the image capture device <b>115</b> relative to the UAV <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, an autonomous aerial vehicle may instead be configured as a fixed-wing aircraft, for example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.

For example, the tracking system <b>140</b> may communicate a navigation objective to the motion planner <b>130</b> to maintain a particular separation distance to a tracked object that is in motion.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, the tracking system <b>140</b>, operating separately or in conjunction with the motion planner <b>130</b>, is further configured to generate control commands configured to cause one or more stabilization/tracking devices <b>152</b> to adjust an orientation of any image capture devices <b>114</b>/<b>115</b> relative to the body of the UAV <b>100</b> based on the tracking of one or more objects. Such stabilization/tracking devices <b>152</b> may include a mechanical gimbal or a hybrid digital-mechanical gimbal, as previously described. For example, while tracking an object in motion relative to the UAV <b>100</b>, the tracking system <b>140</b> may generate control commands configured to adjust an orientation of an image capture device <b>115</b> so as to keep the tracked object centered in the field of view (FOV) of the image capture device <b>115</b> while the UAV <b>100</b> is in motion. Similarly, the tracking system <b>140</b> may generate commands or output data to a digital image processor (e.g., that is part of a hybrid digital-mechanical gimbal) to transform images captured by the image capture device <b>115</b> to keep the tracked object centered in the FOV of the image capture device <b>115</b> while the UAV <b>100</b> is in motion.

For example, certain built-in objectives, such as obstacle avoidance and vehicle dynamic limits, can be combined with other input objectives (e.g., a landing objective) as part of a trajectory generation process. In some embodiments, the trajectory generation process can include gradient-based optimization, gradient-free optimization, sampling, end-to-end learning, or any combination thereof. The output of this trajectory generation process can be a planned trajectory over some time horizon (e.g., 10 seconds) that is configured to be interpreted and utilized by a flight controller <b>160</b> to generate control commands (usable by control actuators <b>110</b>) that cause the UAV <b>100</b> to maneuver according to the planned trajectory. A motion planner <b>130</b> may continually perform the trajectory generation process as new perception inputs (e.g., images or other sensor data) and objective inputs are received. Accordingly, the planned trajectory may be continually updated over some time horizon, thereby enabling the UAV <b>100</b> to dynamically and autonomously respond to changing conditions.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a block diagram that illustrates an example system for objective-based motion planning. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a motion planner <b>130</b> (e.g., as discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may generate and continually update a planned trajectory <b>320</b> based on a trajectory generation process involving one or more objectives (e.g., as previously described) and/or more perception inputs <b>306</b>. The perception inputs <b>306</b> may include images received from one or more image capture devices <b>114</b>/<b>115</b>, results of processing such images (e.g., disparity images, depth values, semantic data, etc.), sensor data from one or more other sensors <b>112</b> on board the UAV <b>100</b> or associated with other computing devices (e.g., mobile device <b>104</b>) in communication with the UAV <b>100</b>, and/or data generated by, or otherwise transmitted from, other systems on board the UAV <b>100</b>. The one or more objectives <b>302</b> utilized in the motion planning process may include built-in objectives governing high-level behavior (e.g., avoiding collision with other objects, maneuvering within dynamic limitations, etc.), as well as objectives based on control inputs <b>308</b> (e.g., from users or other onboard systems). Each of the objectives <b>302</b> may be encoded as one or more equations for incorporation in one or more motion planning equations utilized by the motion planner <b>130</b> when generating a planned trajectory to satisfy the one or more objectives. The control inputs <b>308</b> may be in the form of control commands from a user or from other components of the navigation system <b>120</b> such as a tracking system <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, such inputs are received in the form of calls to an application programming interface (API) associated with the navigation system <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the control inputs <b>308</b> may include predefined objectives that are generated by other components of the navigation system <b>120</b> such as tracking system <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Each given objective of the set of one or more objectives <b>302</b> utilized in the motion planning process may include one or more defined parameterizations that are exposed through the API. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows an example objective <b>332</b> that includes a target <b>334</b>, a dead-zone <b>336</b>, a weighting factor <b>338</b>, and other parameters <b>340</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The target <b>344</b> defines the goal of the particular objective that the motion planner <b>130</b> will attempt to satisfy when generating a planned trajectory <b>320</b>. For example, the target <b>334</b> of a given objective may be to maintain line of sight with one or more detected objects or to fly to a particular position in the physical environment.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The dead-zone defines a region around the target <b>334</b> in which the motion planner <b>130</b> may not take action to correct. This dead-zone <b>336</b> may be thought of as a tolerance level for satisfying a given target <b>334</b>. For example, a target of an example image-relative objective may be to maintain image capture of a tracked object such that the tracked object appears at a particular position in the image space of a captured image (e.g., at the center). To avoid continuous adjustments based on slight deviations from this target, a dead-zone is defined to allow for some tolerance. For example, a dead-zone can be defined in a y-direction and x-direction surrounding a target location in the image space. In other words, as long as the tracked object appears within an area of the image bounded by the target and respective dead-zones, the objective is considered satisfied.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The weighting factor <b>336</b> (also referred to as an &#x201c;aggressiveness&#x201d; factor) defines a relative level of impact the particular objective <b>332</b> will have on the overall trajectory generation process performed by the motion planner <b>130</b>. Recall that a particular objective <b>332</b> may be one of several objectives <b>302</b> that may include competing targets. In an ideal scenario, the motion planner <b>130</b> will generate a planned trajectory <b>320</b> that perfectly satisfies all of the relevant objectives at any given moment. For example, the motion planner <b>130</b> may generate a planned trajectory that maneuvers the UAV <b>100</b> to a particular GPS coordinate while following a tracked object, capturing images of the tracked object, maintaining line of sight with the tracked object, and avoiding collisions with other objects. In practice, such an ideal scenario may be rare. Accordingly, the motion planner system <b>130</b> may need to favor one objective over another when the satisfaction of both is impossible or impractical (for any number of reasons). The weighting factors for each of the objectives <b>302</b> define how they will be considered by the motion planner <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an example embodiment, a weighting factor is a numerical value on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. A value of 0.0 for a particular objective may indicate that the motion planner <b>130</b> can completely ignore the objective (if necessary), while a value of 1.0 may indicate that the motion planner <b>130</b> will make a maximum effort to satisfy the objective while maintaining safe flight. A value of 0.0 may similarly be associated with an inactive objective and may be set to zero, for example, in response to toggling the objective from an active state to an inactive state. Low weighting factor values (e.g., 0.0-0.4) may be set for certain objectives that are based around subjective or aesthetic targets such as maintaining visual saliency in the captured images. Conversely, high weighting factor values (e.g., 0.5-1.0) may be set for more critical objectives such as avoiding a collision with another object.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the weighting factor values <b>338</b> may remain static as a planned trajectory is continually updated while the UAV <b>100</b> is in flight. Alternatively, or in addition, weighting factors for certain objectives may dynamically change based on changing conditions, while the UAV <b>100</b> is in flight. For example, an objective to avoid an area associated with uncertain depth value calculations in captured images (e.g., due to low light conditions) may have a variable weighting factor that increases or decreases based on other perceived threats to the safe operation of the UAV <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, an objective may be associated with multiple weighting factor values that change depending on how the objective is to be applied. For example, a collision avoidance objective may utilize a different weighting factor depending on the class of a detected object that is to be avoided. As an illustrative example, the system may be configured to more heavily favor avoiding a collision with a person or animal as opposed to avoiding a collision with a building or tree.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The UAV <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and the associated navigation system <b>120</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> are examples provided for illustrative purposes.

For example, the first motor housing may include a proximal end and a distal end arranged along an axis <b>480</b>. The first motor housing includes a generally cylindrical side wall <b>440</b> that is arranged about axis <b>480</b> and an end wall (or &#x201c;top wall&#x201d;) <b>441</b> intersecting axis <b>480</b> at the distal end of the first motor housing. The side wall <b>440</b> and end wall <b>441</b> define an interior space of the first motor housing with a generally circular opening at the proximal end of the first motor housing. Similarly, the second motor assembly includes walls <b>442</b>, <b>443</b> that form a second motor housing. The second motor housing also has a proximal end and a distal end arranged along axis <b>480</b>. The second motor housing includes a generally cylindrical side wall <b>442</b> that is arranged about axis <b>480</b> and an end wall (or &#x201c;bottom wall&#x201d;) <b>443</b> intersecting axis <b>480</b> at the distal end of the second motor housing. The side wall <b>442</b> and end wall <b>443</b> define an interior space of the second motor housing with a generally circular opening at the proximal end of the second motor housing.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The first motor assembly further includes an axle bearing <b>462</b> coupled to the first motor housing, and a stator stack arranged around the axle bearing <b>462</b>. In an embodiment, the stator stack includes multiple stator coils <b>444</b> and optionally multiple stator teeth <b>446</b> which can divide an induced electromagnet into multiple sections. Axle bearing <b>462</b> is intended to accommodate the previously mentioned axle <b>460</b> such that axle <b>460</b> is freely rotatable within axle bearing <b>462</b>. Axle bearing <b>462</b> may be of any type suitable to allow for rotation of axle <b>460</b>. For example, in an embodiment, axle bearing <b>462</b> is a plain bearing including a generally cylindrical hollow space within which the shaft of axle <b>460</b> can rotate. In some embodiments, axle bearing <b>462</b> includes rolling elements such as ball bearings arranged between generally cylindrical races. The stator coils <b>444</b> may be made of a conductive material (e.g., copper) through which an electric current can be run to induce the electromagnet of the stator stack.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The second motor assembly further includes the axle <b>460</b> that is affixed to the second motor housing and multiple magnets <b>450</b> that are affixed to an interior surface of the side walls <b>442</b> of the second motor housing. The fixed magnets <b>450</b> of the second motor assembly are affixed to the inner surface of side wall <b>442</b> and arranged such that that may cause the first motor assembly to rotate about axis <b>480</b> when a current is applied (and therefore an electromagnetic force induced) via the stator stack of the first motor assembly, thereby causing the attached rotor blades <b>410</b> to rotate.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some situations, operation of the motor <b>410</b> may cause vibrations or electromagnetic interference that may interfere with or otherwise affect the operation of an image capture device <b>414</b> in close proximity. To counteract the effects of such vibration and/or electromagnetic interference, the rotor assembly <b>413</b> may include an isolator component or system <b>470</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">For example, to isolate the image capture device <b>414</b> from vibration caused by the motor <b>410</b>, the isolator system <b>470</b> may include one or more active and/or passive motion dampeners. The one or more motion dampeners may isolate the image capture device <b>414</b> from the vibrations of the motor <b>411</b> and/or the motion of the surrounding walls of the rotor housing <b>404</b> (i.e., caused by the motion of the UAV). Similarly, the one or more motion dampeners may isolate the walls of the rotor housing <b>404</b> from the vibrations of the motor <b>411</b> so that those vibrations are not transferred to the image capture device <b>414</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Alternatively, or in addition, to isolate the image capture device <b>414</b> from electromagnetic interference caused by the motor <b>411</b>, the isolator system <b>470</b> may include electromagnetic shielding. Electromagnetic shielding may include one or more barriers made of conductive and/or magnetic materials. Specific material may include, for example, sheet metal, metal screen, metal mesh. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic shield of the isolator system <b>470</b> may be configured as a barrier wall between the motor <b>411</b> and the image capture device <b>414</b>, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. In other embodiments, the electromagnetic shield may be configured as a cage or container to enclose the image capture device <b>414</b> and/or motor <b>411</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The image capture device <b>414</b> can also be arranged within any of the other structures extending from the central body of the UAV, such as any of one or more rotor support arms (e.g., arm <b>403</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>) or other structures unrelated to the rotors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> shows an alternative rotor assembly <b>413</b><i>d </i>that includes an image capture device <b>414</b> arranged within a rotor support arm <b>413</b><i>d </i>that structurally couples the motor <b>411</b> or rotor housing <b>404</b><i>d </i>to the body of the UAV. In other words, the image capture device <b>414</b> is arranged within the rotor support arm <b>403</b><i>d </i>at a point substantially between the motor <b>411</b> and the central body of the UAV. The term &#x201c;substantially between&#x201d; in this context means that the image capture device <b>414</b> is at a position generally between the motor <b>411</b> and the body of the UAV, but is not necessarily positioned along a shortest line between the motor <b>411</b> and the body of the UAV.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The image capture device <b>414</b> may be arranged at any point along a length of the support arm extending out from the body of the UAV. In some embodiments, the rotor housing may be substantially integrated as part of a support arm extending from the body of the UAV. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref> shows another alternative rotor assembly <b>413</b><i>e </i>that includes an integrated support arm rotor housing <b>403</b><i>e </i>within which both the motor <b>411</b> and image capture device <b>414</b> are arranged.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some embodiments, the walls of the rotor housing and/or support arm may not fully or substantially enclose the motor <b>411</b> and/or image capture device. For example, in some embodiments, the individual housings of the image capture device <b>414</b> and/or motor <b>411</b> may be sufficient to protect internal components from the elements. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref> shows another alternative rotor assembly <b>413</b><i>f </i>that includes an integrated support arm rotor housing <b>403</b><i>f </i>with walls that do not fully or substantially enclose the motor <b>411</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>, the walls of the integrated support arm rotor housing <b>403</b><i>f </i>substantially enclose the image capture device <b>414</b> but do not fully or substantially enclose the motor <b>411</b>. Instead, the motor <b>411</b> is partially nested into an indentation on the support arm <b>403</b><i>f </i>or alternatively structurally coupled to a top surface of the support arm <b>403</b><i>f</i>. Such an embodiment may be possible where the motor <b>411</b> includes its own housing (e.g., the aforementioned side walls <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> and end walls <b>441</b>, <b>443</b> described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>) and does not require the additional protection of the walls of support arm <b>403</b><i>f</i>. Although not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>, in some embodiments, the walls of the support arm <b>403</b><i>f </i>may not fully or substantially enclose the image capture device <b>414</b> similar to the motor <b>411</b>. For example, the image capture device <b>414</b> may include its own housing and may therefore not require the additional protection of the walls of support arm <b>403</b><i>f. </i></p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">For illustrative simplicity, embodiments of a UAV may be described herein with reference to just rotor assembly <b>413</b>; however, such embodiments may similarly implement alternative rotor assemblies such as assemblies <b>413</b><i>d</i>, <b>413</b><i>e</i>, and <b>413</b><i>f</i>. Further, the various alternative rotor assemblies <b>413</b>, <b>413</b><i>d</i>, <b>413</b><i>e</i>, and <b>413</b><i>f </i>are examples provided for illustrative purposes and shall not be construed as limiting. Other embodiments may combine certain features of the various rotor assemblies <b>413</b>, <b>413</b><i>d</i>, <b>413</b><i>e</i>, and <b>413</b><i>f</i>. For example, another alternative rotor assembly (not depicted in the FIGS.) may include support arm and/or rotor housing walls that do not fully or substantially enclose the motor <b>411</b> and/or image capture device <b>414</b> (e.g., as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>) and may arrange the image capture device <b>414</b> at a position substantially between the motor <b>411</b> and the body of the UAV (e.g., as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>).

For example, the UAV <b>100</b> may include four stereoscopic image capture devices at each of four corners of the UAV as well as an upward-facing stereoscopic image capture device and a downward-facing stereoscopic image capture device. Since each stereoscopic image capture device includes two cameras, this represents a total of twelve cameras. In general, an autonomous navigation system that relies heavily on captured images will tend to be more effective the more image capture devices are utilized to capture the images. However, increasing quantities of cameras on board a UAV can have a detrimental effect in other areas. For example, the added weight of the additional cameras can impact the maneuverability of the UAV and reduce flight time due to increased draw on batteries from the electrical motors to keep the heavier craft airborne. The additional cameras themselves will draw more power from the batteries, further reducing overall flight time. To reduce weight and power draw, fewer cameras (e.g., fewer than twelve) can be utilized in various arrangements on board the UAV, while still providing sufficient coverage of the surrounding environment to allow an autonomous navigation system to plan the motion of the UAV to satisfy certain behavioral objectives and to avoid obstacles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref> illustrate several example arrangements of image capture devices on board a UAV.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>C, and <b>5</b>B</figref> show a top view, bottom view, and side view (respectively) of an example UAV <b>500</b>.

Each of the rotor assemblies <b>513</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may include an image capture device and powered rotor as described, for example, with respect to rotor assembly <b>413</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> or any of the alternative rotor assemblies in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>D-<b>4</b>F</figref>. The UAV <b>500</b> also includes image capture devices <b>517</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>mounted to the body <b>502</b>. Specifically, image capture device <b>517</b><i>a </i>is upward-facing and image capture device <b>517</b><i>b </i>is downward-facing.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Notably, the multiple image capture devices included in the rotor assemblies <b>513</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and the body mounted image capture devices <b>517</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are arranged such that the UAV <b>500</b> includes three upward-facing image capture devices and three downward-facing image capture devices. Specifically, the upward-facing image capture devices include image capture device <b>517</b><i>a </i>and the image capture devices of rotor assemblies <b>513</b><i>a </i>and <b>513</b><i>b</i>. Similarly, the downward-facing image capture devices include image capture device <b>517</b><i>b </i>and the image capture devices of rotor assemblies <b>513</b><i>c </i>and <b>513</b><i>d</i>. Note that rotor assemblies <b>513</b><i>a </i>and <b>513</b><i>b </i>may represent inverted arrangements of similar rotor assemblies <b>513</b><i>c </i>and <b>513</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Each of the image capture devices of UAV <b>500</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref> may include a single camera with a relatively wide (e.g., greater than 100 degree) FOV. The upward and downward-facing image capture devices are arranged as two overlapping triangles. In other words, a first trio of upward-facing image capture devices is arranged as a first triangle providing upward-facing trinocular image capture (e.g., for accurate depth estimation) and a second trio of downward-facing image capture devices is arranged as a second triangle providing downward-facing trinocular image capture (e.g., for accurate depth estimation). In some embodiments, the trio of upward-facing image capture devices may be arranged to enable trinocular stereoscopic vision in multiple directions substantially above the UAV and the trio of downward-facing image capture devices may be arranged to enable trinocular stereoscopic vision in multiple directions substantially below the UAV. Further, at least some of the upward-facing image capture devices and downward-facing image capture devices may have overlapping fields of view if image capture devices with an FOV greater than 180 degrees are utilized. This arrangement, in which the upward and downward-facing cameras have overlapping FOV, allows for effective depth estimation up to a full 360 degrees around the UAV, reduces the total number of cameras from twelve (as in UAV <b>100</b>) to six or fewer, and can be exploited to calibrate the upward and downward-facing image capture devices.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref>, the body <b>502</b> extends along a longitudinal axis <b>590</b> from a first end (or &#x201c;forward end&#x201d;) to a second end (or &#x201c;aft end&#x201d;).

Still further, the body <b>502</b> has a third side (or &#x201c;top side&#x201d;) and a fourth side (or &#x201c;bottom side&#x201d;) that is opposite the third side. These relative orientations associated with the body <b>502</b> are provided for illustrative purposes and are not to be construed as limiting. For example, although one end of the UAV <b>500</b> is labeled as a &#x201c;forward end&#x201d; this does not mean that the UAV <b>500</b> only travels forward in this direction.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the example UAV <b>500</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref>, the body <b>502</b> is depicted as rectangular when viewed from above suggesting a cuboid structure, however it shall be understood that body <b>502</b> may have any shape of any dimension.

The one or more mechanical gimbals of the gimbaled image capture device <b>615</b> enable changes in orientation of the one or more cameras about one or more axes relative to the body <b>602</b>. In some embodiments, the image capture device <b>615</b> may include a hybrid digital-mechanical gimbal system as previously described.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Otherwise, similar to UAV <b>500</b>, example UAV <b>600</b> includes three upward-facing image capture devices (image capture device <b>617</b><i>a </i>mounted to body <b>602</b> and the integrated image capture devices of rotor assemblies <b>613</b><i>a </i>and <b>613</b><i>b</i>) and three downward-facing image capture devices (image capture device <b>617</b><i>b </i>and the integrated image capture devices of rotor assemblies <b>613</b><i>c </i>and <b>613</b><i>d</i>). In this example, the three upward-facing image capture devices and three downward-facing image capture devices may be utilized for visual navigation, while the gimbaled image capture device <b>615</b> is utilized to capture images of the surrounding physical environment for later display.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Notably, the gimbaled image capture device <b>615</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref> as coupled to a first end wall of the body <b>602</b> of the UAV <b>600</b>. In other words, the gimbaled image capture device <b>615</b> coupled to the body <b>602</b> proximate to the forward end of the body <b>602</b>. This is an example arrangement provided for illustrative purposes and is not to be construed as limiting. In other embodiments, the gimbaled image capture device <b>615</b> may be arranged at a different location on the body of the UAV. However, the example arrangement depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref> is advantageous in several respects. First, coupling the gimbaled image capture device <b>615</b> to an end wall of the body <b>602</b> instead of a bottom wall of the body <b>602</b> results in a narrower side profile for the UAV <b>600</b>, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>. This narrower profile allows for easier storage and transport and may help to avoid obstacles in the physical environment. Second, coupling the gimbaled image capture device <b>615</b> to an end wall of the body <b>602</b>, instead of a bottom wall of the body <b>602</b>, allows the UAV <b>600</b> to land on the ground without damaging the gimbaled image capture device <b>615</b> and without the need for extraneous landing gear that adds weight and may affect flight dynamics. Third, coupling the gimbaled image capture device <b>615</b> to an end wall of the body <b>602</b> instead of a bottom wall of the body <b>602</b> keeps the gimbaled image capture device substantially out of the fields of view of the upward-facing and downward-facing image capture devices that are used for visual navigation (i.e., image capture devices <b>617</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and the image capture devices associated with rotor assemblies <b>613</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>).

For example, in some embodiments, the protective structural element <b>1390</b> can be made of plastic, metal (e.g., aluminum), carbon fiber, synthetic fiber, or some sort of composite material such as carbon fiber embedded in an epoxy resin. The actual materials used will depend on the performance requirements of a given embodiment. The protective structural element <b>1390</b> may be manufactured using any manufacturing process suited for the selected material. For example, in the case of plastic materials, the protective structural element <b>1390</b> may be manufactured using injection molding, extrusion molding, rotational molding, blow molding, 3D printing, milling, plastic welding, lamination, or any combination thereof. In the case of metal materials, the protective structural element <b>1390</b> may be manufactured using machining, stamping, casting, forming, metal injection molding, CNC machining, or any combination thereof. These are just example materials and manufacturing processes that are provided for illustrative purposes and are not to be construed as limiting.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In some embodiments, the protective structural element <b>1390</b> may represent a portion of an exterior surface of a UAV. For example, the walls of any of the rotor housing <b>1304</b> and/or the rotor arm <b>1303</b> may be manufactured to include a portion that extends, for example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the protective structural element <b>1390</b> may be manufactured as a separate part and affixed to an exterior surface of a UAV, for example, using mechanical fasteners (e.g., clips, screws, bolts, etc.), adhesives (e.g., glue, tape, etc.), welding, or any other suitable process for affixing parts together.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In some embodiments, a protective structural element similar to element <b>1390</b> may be arranged proximate to each of one or more image capture devices of a UAV. This may include upward-facing image capture devices to protect such device from contact with the ground, for example, if the UAV lands upside down, or from contact with other surfaces above the UAV, such as a ceiling or the underside of a bridge. In some embodiments, the protective structural element <b>1390</b> may represent a part of a bezel or frame that is installed flush with a surface associated with the UAV and around a lens of an image capture device.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Removable Rotor Blades</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The propellers on certain UAVs (e.g., quadcopter drones) are often considered to be consumable because they are the most likely part of the aircraft to be damaged in the event of a collision with another object. Accordingly, manufacturers of such UAVs typically design the propellers to be user replaceable in the field, without the need of any kind of tools and with a minimum of effort. There are currently two widely used methods of attaching propellers to drones that meet this need. The first is by using a separate, easy to hand-tighten, propeller nut that threads onto the propeller shaft or equivalent structure, pinching the propeller in place. This method has the downside of needing a small separate part (i.e., the propeller nut), that if lost, renders the UAV unusable, and has a tendency to spontaneously loosen and come off when subjected to rotational and vibrational loads. Such a propeller nut also requires frequent re-tightening or exotic, left-handed threads. The second method uses a bayonet lock to attach a propeller directly to a motor. Since this method relies on a spring to keep the propeller seated in its locked position, the propeller cannot be relied upon to undergo any loading that would push back against this spring, and so cannot be used in a pusher configuration or for three-dimensional flight, where the propeller is run in both directions for maximum maneuverability. An improved technique for removable rotor blades is described below to address these challenges.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> shows an example rotor assembly <b>1400</b><i>a </i>that includes removable rotor blades. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, the rotor assembly includes a motor <b>1410</b> (e.g., an electric motor) that spins, when powered. Coupled to the spinning portion of the motor <b>1410</b> are one or more pins <b>1430</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. The one or more pins <b>1430</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are configured to detachably couple to removable rotor blades <b>1440</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, each removable rotor blade <b>1440</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may include a keyhole shaped slot <b>1442</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>(respectively) through an attachment portion of the rotor blade <b>1440</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. Removable rotor blade <b>1440</b><i>a </i>is shown in an installed position, while removable rotor blade <b>1440</b><i>b </i>is shown in a removed position. Notably, the keyhole shaped slots <b>1442</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and corresponding pins <b>1430</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may be configured such that the blades <b>1440</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are easy to remove and replace without any tools. As indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, each rotor blade <b>1440</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>can be secured in place by bringing the widest portion of the keyhole slot <b>1442</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>down over the head of the pin <b>1430</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and then pulling laterally to lock the removable blade <b>1440</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>in place. The keyhole shaped slots <b>1442</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and corresponding pins <b>1430</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may be further configured such that, when in use, a centrifugal force effect caused by the rotation of the motor <b>1410</b> helps to keep the rotor blades <b>1440</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>secured in place.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some embodiments, the pins <b>1430</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may be shaped and/or sized differently based on the type and/or arrangement of the motor <b>1410</b> to force proper installation by the user. For example, as previously described (e.g., with respect to UAV <b>500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref>), in some embodiments, a UAV may include one or more inverted rotors (e.g., to direct an integrated camera upward). In such embodiments, the pins on the inverted (i.e., downward-facing) motors may be shaped and/or sided differently than the pins on the upward-facing motors so as to force a user to install the proper rotor blades (e.g., clockwise vs. counterclockwise blades) on each motor.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The keyhole/pin attachment mechanism depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> is just an example provided for illustrative purposes. Other non-screw attachment mechanisms may similarly be implemented. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>B and <b>14</b>C</figref> show a perspective view and top view (respectively) of another example rotor assembly <b>1400</b><i>b </i>that includes removable rotor blades. In the example rotor assembly <b>1400</b><i>b </i>depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>B and <b>14</b>C</figref>, locking features <b>1410</b><i>c </i>on the innermost ends of individual propeller blades <b>1420</b><i>c </i>are lowered axially into a central mounting socket <b>1430</b><i>c </i>and are then pulled radially outward to lock them into place. In this locked position the propeller blades <b>1420</b><i>c </i>are accurately and rigidly located by a small taper-angle interface with the central mounting socket <b>1430</b><i>c</i>. This radially engaged connection ensures that the blades <b>1420</b><i>c </i>are properly seated in the socket as soon as the motor <b>1440</b><i>c </i>spins up, and the centrifugal loading forces imposed on the blades <b>1420</b><i>c </i>helps to secure the blades correctly in position. Once properly seated, the blades <b>1420</b><i>c </i>are prevented from coming loose by a small spring driven member <b>1450</b><i>c </i>in the middle of the central socket <b>1430</b><i>c </i>that pops up and does not allow the blades <b>1420</b><i>c </i>to move far enough radially inward to disengage from the tabs that form the part of the socket <b>1430</b><i>c </i>that holds the blades <b>1420</b><i>c </i>in place. To remove a propeller blade <b>1420</b><i>c </i>(e.g., in the event that it is damaged and needs to be replaced), the user can press down on this spring driven member <b>1450</b><i>c </i>to lower it out of the way, and then push the blade <b>1420</b><i>c </i>radially inward until it disengages and can then be lifted axially out of the socket <b>1430</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The techniques for removable propeller attachments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>C</figref> allow for the replacement of individual propeller blades instead of replacing an entire propeller assembly. The blades are held securely against loading in any direction and so can be used in pull-propeller, push-propeller, and three-dimensional flight configurations. Since the security of the mounting technique only increases as the propeller spins up, there is no risk of the propeller becoming loose over time as there is with a propeller nut arrangement. The number of blades that can be secured by this method is only limited by the size of the central socket. In some embodiments, folding propellers can be implemented by integrating a pivot joint into the propeller blade next to the innermost locking features.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Removable Battery Pack as a Launch Handle</heading><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In some embodiments, an autonomous UAV can be configured to launch and land from a user's hand.
