The plurality of sockets on the socket connector M<b>2</b> can be divided into first sockets M<b>201</b> and second sockets M<b>202</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the plurality of sockets can be divided into upper and lower rows, so as to correspond to the column bodies <b>11</b> of the electrical power connector M<b>1</b> that are arranged into the upper and lower rows.

In other words, the electrical power connector M<b>1</b> can only be mated to the socket connector M<b>2</b> in a fixed mating direction.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In continuation of the above, each of the first sockets M<b>201</b> of the socket connector M<b>2</b> has a plurality of mating pillars, and each of the second sockets M<b>202</b> has one of the mating pillars (not shown in the figures). When the plurality of column bodies <b>11</b> of the electrical power connector M<b>1</b> are respectively mated to the plurality of sockets of the socket connector M<b>2</b>, each of the mating pillars is mated to the corresponding mating section <b>22</b> of the electrically conductive terminal <b>2</b> inside the electrical power connector M<b>1</b> through the corresponding first terminal opening <b>101</b> and the corresponding opening <b>20</b>, so that the electrical power connector M<b>1</b> is electrically connected to the socket connector M<b>2</b>.

Accordingly, when one of the mating pillars is mated to the mating section <b>22</b> of the electrically conductive terminal <b>2</b>, the one of the mating pillars is in physical contact with the at least one protruding portion <b>225</b>, such that the electrically conductive terminal <b>2</b> is electrically connected to the one of the mating pillars. Further, in the present disclosure, the average thickness of any part of the electrically conductive terminal <b>2</b> is increased for increasing the amount of electrical current that can be carried by the electrically conductive terminal <b>2</b>. However, such a design increases a positive force applied to the mating pillar by the mating section <b>22</b>, making it more difficult for a user to plug and unplug the electrical power connector M<b>1</b> and the socket connector M<b>2</b> (the user needs to exert more force to plug and unplug the electrical power connector M<b>1</b> and the socket connector M<b>2</b>). Therefore, in the present disclosure, the first notch C<b>1</b> is configured at the opening <b>20</b> of the mating section <b>22</b> of the electrically conductive terminal <b>2</b> to increase the flexibility of the opening <b>20</b>, so as to reduce the positive force applied to the mating pillar by the mating section <b>22</b>, reduce the difficulty of plugging and unplugging the electrical power connector M<b>1</b> and the socket connector M<b>2</b>, and prevent the metal pieces in the opening <b>20</b> of the electrically conductive terminal <b>2</b> from colliding with each other when the electrically conductive terminal <b>2</b> is formed during the bending process. In addition, since the mating pillar is in physical contact with the protruding portion <b>225</b> of the mating section <b>22</b>, and the outermost layer of the protruding portion <b>225</b> is coated with a thin metal layer, a friction coefficient of the thin metal layer (that is made from gold or tin) is small. Therefore, a frictional force between the mating pillar and the protruding portion <b>225</b> is reduced. At the same time, a contact impedance is reduced, and contact between dissimilar metals is avoided. Thus, effects of reducing the positive force applied to the mating pillar by the mating section <b>22</b>, reducing the difficulty of plugging and unplugging the electrical power connector M<b>1</b> and the socket connector M<b>2</b>, reducing the contact impedance, and avoiding galvanic corrosion between the dissimilar metals can be further achieved.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, ends of the mating pillars in the plurality of sockets of the socket connector M<b>2</b> extend out from one side of the socket connector M<b>2</b> to form a plurality of pins M<b>22</b>.
