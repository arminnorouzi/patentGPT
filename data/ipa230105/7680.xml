Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, and time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. An example telecommunication standard is 5G New Radio (NR). 5G NR is part of a continuous mobile broadband evolution promulgated by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet new requirements associated with latency, reliability, security, scalability (e.g., with Internet of Things (IoT)), and other requirements. 5G NR includes services associated with enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), and ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC). Some aspects of 5G NR may be based on the 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard. There exists a need for further improvements in 5G NR technology. These improvements may also be applicable to other multi-access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects.

The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system, wireless communications may be transmitted on a directional beam. Different beams may be selected between a user equipment (UE) and a base station to improve the efficiency and reliability of the wireless communications. Some systems may utilize transmission configuration indication (TCI) states to control selection of beams. The number of TCI states and available beams may be limited due to complexities and delays in beam indication.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an aspect, MIMO communications may be improved by reducing latency of beam switching and lowering overhead of beam indications while maintaining beam indication reliability. For example, both the base station and the UE may switch beams at the same time to utilize corresponding beams.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an aspect, the present disclosure includes techniques for indicating a beam or TCI state in a downlink control information (DCI) and switching the beam after an acknowledgment based on a scheduled transmission for the DCI. In particular, the DCI may include a TCI indicating anew control beam and also schedule a transmission, which may utilize a new data beam. Because the DCI is subject to blind decoding by the UE and is not protected by hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), there may be uncertainty as to whether the UE has received the DCI and is prepared to change beams. Accordingly, the base station may wait until an acknowledgment of the DCI is received to change the control beam. Otherwise, if the base station switches beams and the UE does not switch beams, the UE may have difficulty decoding a DCI transmitted on a control beam that does not correspond to the control beam of the UE.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The acknowledgment of the DCI may be based on the scheduled transmission indicated by the DCI. For downlink transmissions such as a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), the DCI may be acknowledged when the UE transmits a positive acknowledgment of the scheduled transmission indicated by the DCI. For uplink transmissions such as a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), physical random access channel (PRACH), sounding reference signal (SRS), or channel state information (CSI) report, the uplink transmission may be considered an acknowledgment of the DCI. Both the UE and the base station may switch control beams after a time offset from the acknowledgment of the DCI. The time offset may allow the base station to transmit another DCI scheduling a retransmission of the scheduled transmission in case the acknowledgment of the DCI is not received correctly at the base station. In view of the above, the present disclosure provides for robust DCI based fast beam indication that reduces latency of beam switching while providing reliable beam indication for both the UE and the base station.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Several aspects of telecommunication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, components, circuits, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;).

In the dynamic HARQ codebook or Type II HARQ codebook configuration, the first DCI <b>510</b> may include a counter downlink assignment index (cDAI) that indicates a number of scheduled downlink transmissions up to the point that the DCI was received. For example, the cDAI may have a value of 0 indicating the first DCI <b>510</b> schedules a first transmission. In this example, the first DCI <b>510</b> may not include a TCI activation.

The gNB <b>402</b> may transmit an RRC message <b>610</b> that configures a TCI list, for example, by adding or removing TCI states from the TCI list. Each TCI in the TCI list may refer to a reference signal, such as CSI-RS, or SSB, or SRS. The configured TCI list may indicate parameters of TCI states that may be selected. The gNB <b>402</b> may optionally transmit a MAC-CE <b>620</b> that includes a TCI subset selection. The TCI subset selection may identify a number of TCI states that may be activated with a DCI. A TCI field in the DCI may be used to indicate the TCI. Each codepoint in the TCI field of the DCI corresponding to one of the TCI states in the subset. In particular, one codepoint may be reserved as not to indicate the new TCI. The TCI subset selection may define an identifier (ID) or index for each TCI state. The use of an index may minimize the number of bits, i.e., the length of the field in the DCI for TCI indication. The gNB <b>402</b> may transmit a DCI <b>630</b> having format 1_1 that includes a field for indicating a TCI for a control beam. The indicated TCI may be a TCI ID having a value of x that identifies one of the TCIs on the TCI list. The DCI <b>630</b> may also schedule a PDSCH <b>640</b> having a HARQ ID with a value of y. The gNB <b>402</b> may transmit the scheduled transmission of the PDSCH <b>640</b> that may or may not use a data beam based on the TCI x. Similarly, the UE <b>404</b> may receive the scheduled transmission of the PDSCH <b>640</b> that may or may not use a data beam based on the TCI x. The UE <b>404</b> may transmit an ACK <b>650</b> for the PDSCH <b>640</b> having the HARQ ID y. For example, the ACK <b>650</b> may be a UCI carried on the PUCCH.

In other words, the gNB <b>402</b> and the UE <b>404</b> may update the TCI used to transmit/receive the CORESET with the TCI ID x. Accordingly, the new control beam may be activated.

In another aspect, the DCI format 0_1 may include a field to indicate the new spatial relation information (SRI) that similarly indicates new beam information as TCI. In an aspect, an RRC configuration message may indicate whether the DCI format 0_1 includes a field for TCI ID.
