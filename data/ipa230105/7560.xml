Continuous measurement in this period of time is mostly unnecessary. A period of time usually lasts from a moment at which the terminal device is disconnected from a network to a moment at which the terminal device finds a network again, and network search performed by the terminal device in an area without network coverage is meaningless. It can be learned that the cell measurement and the network search in the conventional technology cause relatively high power consumption of the terminal device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of this application provide a cell measurement method, a measurement apparatus, a terminal device, a chip, and a storage medium, to resolve a problem in the conventional technology that power consumption of a terminal device is relatively high due to cell measurement and network search.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of this, a first aspect of this application provides a cell measurement method, and the method may include: When a terminal device camps on a first cell, if the terminal device determines that the terminal device is in a target environment, the terminal device may obtain signal strength of the first cell on which the terminal device camps. The target environment is a fixed place or a fixed route that is identified by the terminal device in advance. Then, the terminal device performs measurement on a second cell if the obtained signal strength is less than a first threshold and greater than a second threshold. The second cell is a cell determined by the terminal device based on the target environment. The terminal device performs measurement on a third cell if the obtained signal strength is less than the second threshold. The third cell includes a neighboring cell of the first cell. In this application, a cell corresponding to the target environment may be learned in advance. In this way, if the terminal device is in the target environment, and signal strength of a cell on which the terminal device currently camps is less than the first threshold and greater than the second threshold, cell measurement may be performed based on the learned cell. Therefore, invalid measurement can be effectively avoided, and power consumption of the terminal device is reduced. In addition, when the second cell does not meet a condition, the terminal device may search for the third cell, to expand a search range.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment, the terminal device includes a first processor and a second processor. It may be understood that the first processor is configured to generate a target measurement policy, and the second processor is configured to execute the target measurement policy. The first processor of the terminal device sends the target measurement policy to the second processor of the terminal device. The target measurement policy includes at least one of the first threshold, the second threshold, and cell information corresponding to at least one second cell, the second threshold is less than the first threshold, and the cell information corresponding to the second cell includes at least one of a frequency corresponding to the second cell and a cell identifier corresponding to the second cell. In this way, the second processor may perform cell measurement based on the information included in the target measurement policy. Because the target measurement policy is a measurement policy that is corresponding to the target environment and that is learned by the terminal device in advance, invalid measurement can be effectively avoided, and power consumption of the terminal device is reduced.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment, the terminal device determines that the terminal device is in a target environment may include: The terminal device obtains first information. If the first information matches second information, the terminal device determines that the terminal device is in the target environment. The second information is description information of the target environment, and the description information is determined by the terminal device based on the target environment. In this way, the terminal device may obtain the description information of the target environment in advance, and associate the description information with the target environment. Therefore, after obtaining the first information of the current environment, the terminal device may perform information matching based on the description information and the first information, to accurately identify whether the terminal device is in a fixed environment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the description information may be one or more of a Wi-Fi name, an identifier of a serving cell, signal strength of the serving cell, an identifier of a neighboring cell of the serving cell, and signal strength of the neighboring cell.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, if a measurement result of the second cell meets a cell handover condition, a cell on which the terminal device camps is handed over from the first cell to the second cell; or if a measurement result of the third cell meets a cell handover condition, a cell on which the terminal device camps is handed over from the first cell to the third cell. It may be understood that the handover herein may be understood as handover or reselection. To be specific, handover is performed when the terminal device is in a connected state, and reselection is performed when the terminal device is in an idle state. In this way, after performing cell measurement in the foregoing manner, the terminal device can quickly obtain a cell that meets the cell handover condition, thereby improving cell handover efficiency.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, the target measurement policy may further include a measurement priority corresponding to the at least one second cell. In this way, that the terminal device performs measurement on a second cell may include: The terminal device performs measurement on the second cell based on the measurement priority corresponding to the at least one second cell. Because the terminal device may preferentially measure a cell with a relatively high measurement priority, measurement efficiency is improved, and power consumption of the terminal is reduced.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, when the target environment is a fixed place, the terminal device collects information during a specified time period, and uses the collected information as the description information. There is a correspondence between the specified time period and the fixed place. In this way, because a user usually resides in the fixed place during a specific time period, the description information of the fixed place may be accurately obtained by collecting information about the time period.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, when the target environment is a fixed route, the terminal device collects information during a period from a moment at which the terminal device leaves a first fixed place to a moment at which the terminal device enters a second fixed place, and uses the collected information as the description information of the fixed route. In this way, because the fixed route in this application is a route formed by different fixed places, the description information of the fixed route can be accurately obtained by detecting leaving from the fixed place and entering to the fixed place.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A second aspect of this application provides a cell measurement method, and the method may include: When a terminal device camps on a first cell, if the terminal device determines that the terminal device is in a target environment, the terminal device may obtain signal strength of the first cell on which the terminal device camps. The target environment is a fixed place or a fixed route that is identified by the terminal device in advance.

If the preset network selection policy is stored at the application framework layer, because an adapter (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) that matches the RIL is disposed in the modem, the preset network selection policy at the application framework layer may be transmitted to the NAS through communication between the adapter in the modem and the RIL. In this way, in this application, a process of obtaining a target network selection policy (which is equivalent to a target measurement policy or a target network search policy in this application) may be performed in the NAS, and after the target network selection policy is obtained, network selection processing is performed in the RRC based on the target network selection policy (which is equivalent to cell measurement or network search in this application).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the conventional technology, power consumption of the terminal device includes power consumption generated by the application processor and the modem. The power consumption of the modem is mainly reflected in standby power consumption and data service power consumption. The standby power consumption and the data service power consumption may be caused by factors such as network search and cell measurement.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The network search in the conventional technology may include a plurality of cases. For example, the terminal device may periodically obtain a signal level value or a signal quality value of a current cell on which the terminal device camps. If it is determined, based on the obtained signal level value or signal quality value, that the terminal device meets an inter-frequency measurement start condition, the terminal device performs measurement on an inter-frequency neighboring cell or an inter-RAT neighboring cell. For another example, when the terminal device is disconnected from a network, the terminal device continuously searches for a network in turn. For another example, if a network on which the terminal device currently camps is not a highest-standard network supported by the terminal device, the terminal device continuously searches for the highest-standard network. For example, the highest-standard network supported by the terminal device is 4G. If the network on which the terminal device currently camps is a 3G network, the terminal device continuously searches for the 4G network. The foregoing inter-frequency measurement start condition may be Srxlev&#x3c;=SnonIntraSearchP or Squal&#x3c;=SnonIntraSearchQ. Srxlev indicates an obtained signal level value, Squal indicates an obtained signal quality value, SnonIntraSearchP indicates a level threshold for inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurement, and SnonIntraSearchQ indicates a quality threshold for inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurement. Definitions of the involved parameters are the same as those in 3GPP TS 36.304.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The network search in the conventional technology has the following disadvantage: A terminal device usually needs to take a period of time to perform measurement on an inter-frequency neighboring cell and an inter-RAT neighboring cell starting from a moment at which an inter-frequency measurement start condition is met to a moment at which cell reselection is performed. Continuous measurement in this period of time is mostly unnecessary. Consequently, a waste of system resources is caused, and power consumption of the terminal device is relatively high. In addition, the terminal device may be in an area without network coverage in a time period from a moment at which the terminal device is disconnected from a network to a moment at which the terminal device finds a network again. In this case, continuous network searching causes a waste of system resources and a large amount of power consumption, and the terminal device cannot connect to the network. Consequently, this is meaningless. In addition, some areas may have only 3G network coverage but not 4G network coverage. When the terminal device is located in these areas, continuous searching for the 4G network by the terminal device only wastes a large amount of power consumption, and is meaningless.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In this application, a wireless network signal feature of a fixed route or a fixed place is learned, identified, and predicted, to optimize network search, cell measurement, and the like of a terminal, thereby reducing power consumption of the terminal.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Embodiments of this application provide a plurality of different implementation solutions, which are separately described below.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Technical Solution of Cell Measurement[TX(1]</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a cell measurement method according to an embodiment of this application.
