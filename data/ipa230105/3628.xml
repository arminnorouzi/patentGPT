of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for measuring condensable particulate matters formed from exhaust gas, and more particularly, to a method for measuring an amount of condensable particulate matters by separately measuring condensable particulate matters and filterable particulate matters.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description about National Research and Development Support</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This study was supported by the technology development program respond to the climate change of Ministry of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea (Projects No. 1711116689) under the superintendence of National Research Foundation of Korea.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Particulate Matter (PM) is one of the main factors for evaluating air quality and has a great impact on health and the environment, so it is regulated through a permissible emission standard for air pollution sources including stationary pollution sources such as power plants and mobile pollution sources such as internal combustion engines including vehicles.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the permissible emission standard of particulate matters of air and the calculation of emission factor of particulate matters are based on the weight of the filterable particulate matters (FPM) collected in a filter paper.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As described above, the particulate matters emitted from pollution sources in the form of particulate is called primary particulate matters, and is distinguished from secondary particulate matters that forms from gaseous precursors by photochemical reactions in the atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Primary particulate matters include not only filterable particulate matters, but also condensable particulate matters (CPM). The condensable particulate matters are particles that are condensed at a rapid rate following a rapid temperature change as soon as the exhaust gas including filterable particulate matters is emitted from stacks or tailpipes to the atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since formation of the condensable particulate matters is affected by the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere involved in condensation, it is difficult to accurately measure and calculate it, unlike the filterable particulate matters. In addition, the condensable particulate matters has recently gained interest as a contrast to the filterable particulate matters, and unlike the filterable particulate matters, there is no domestically and internationally allowable emission standard for CPM, and related measurement standard methods have not yet been sufficiently established.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As an example of a method for measuring the condensable particulate matter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, there are two types, an impinger method that calculates an amount of potential condensable particulate matters by inserting a sampling port inside the chimney of a stationary pollution sources to extract potential gaseous pollutants that are going to form the condensable particulate matters, and a dilution method that simulates the formation mechanism of the condensable particulate matters in the air.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the case of the impinger method, the amount of condensable particulate matters is calculated assuming that all gaseous pollutants dissolved in the solution used to collect gaseous pollutants are converted to the condensable particulate matters. Therefore, there is a disadvantage of overestimating the amount of condensable particulate matters.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, in the case of the dilution method developed to compensate for the impinger method, the first filter paper is used to remove the filterable particulate matters, and then the condensable particulate matters homogeneously formed by the dilution air is collected on the second filter paper at the downstream and calculated.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, since only room temperature air is used for dilution and the filterable particulate matter is removed, there is a disadvantage that the condensable particulate matters heterogeneously formed through the process of condensing on the surface of filterable particulate matters are not considered.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, the method of calculating the emission amount by measuring the condensable particulate matters eventually collected on the filter paper for a certain duration time, such as the filterable particulate matter, can be applied to stationary pollution sources with relatively stable air pollutant emission, but is not suitable for mobile pollution sources such as internal combustion engines, including vehicles, where the composition and emission of air pollutants might be changed due to variables such as changes in combustion conditions and atmospheric temperature of the internal combustion engines during acceleration/deceleration.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In other words, the amount of condensable particulate matters affected by changing the composition and amount of emitted air pollutants can also change. Therefore, the existing impinger and dilution methods are not suitable for measuring the condensable particulate matters emitted by vehicles with large time variability and calculating an emission factor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, in order to overcome these problems, it is necessary to develop a system capable of measuring in real time the change in the amount of condensable particulate matters emitted from the internal combustion engine including a vehicle, which may appear in various atmospheric conditions.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Documents of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">(Patent Document 1) KR Patent Publication No. 10-2199628</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Accordingly, the present invention proposes a system capable of measuring in real time a change in an amount of condensable particulate matters emitted from an internal combustion engine including a vehicle that can be formed under various atmospheric conditions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to achieve the above object, the present invention may provide a method for measuring condensable particulate matter formed from exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine including the steps of: sucking exhaust gas from the internal combustion engine; diluting the sucked exhaust gas to simulate it to atmospheric condition; a first measurement step of branching some of the exhaust gas of the atmospheric condition and measuring particulate matter including condensable particulate matter and filterable particulate matter; a second measurement step of branching the rest of the exhaust gas of the atmospheric condition to remove the condensable particulate matter and measuring the particulate matter including only the filterable particulate matter; and comparing the first measurement step and the second measurement step to calculate an amount of the condensable particulate matter in the exhaust gas of the atmospheric condition.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, the present invention may further include the step of filtering fine particulate matter from the exhaust gas, after the step of sucking exhaust gas from the internal combustion engine.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, the step of filtering fine particulate matter of the present invention may be implemented using a cyclone.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, the step of diluting the sucked exhaust gas to simulate it to atmospheric condition of the present invention may be performed by injecting air into the exhaust gas in a dilution chamber.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, in the present invention, the exhaust gas may be transferred via a conduit, and the conduit may be wound with a heating tape so that it is able to be heated, so the conduit may maintain a temperature range of 200&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, in the step of diluting the sucked exhaust gas to simulate it to atmospheric condition of the present invention, a ratio of the air to a volume of the exhaust gas may be made in a dilution ration of 1:9 to 1:29, and the step may be performed in a range of &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C. through a cooler and a heater.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, in the present invention, some of the exhaust gas in the atmospheric condition may be branched to a bypass pipe, and the first measurement step may be performed. The rest of the exhaust gas in the atmospheric condition may be branched to a thermodenuder and the second measurement step may be performed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the thermodenuder of the present invention may be heated in a range of 25&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C., and the condensable particulate matter may be removed by being adsorbed on a carbon cloth inside the thermodenuder.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, the step of calculating an amount of the condensable particulate matter may include measuring number density size distribution of the particulate matter including the condensable particulate matter and the filterable particulate matter in the first measurement step, measuring the number density size distribution of the particulate matter including only the filterable particulate matter in the second measurement step, and subtracting the concentration particle size distribution of the second measurement step from the concentration particle size distribution of the first measurement step.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the present invention, it is possible to completely remove a condensable particulate matter component from the particulate matter emitted by a vehicle, so it is possible to calculate the contribution and emission factor of condensable particulate matter among the particulate matter emitted by a vehicle, which is difficult to be confirmed by the existing evaluation method.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, the present invention can calculate the change in the amount of condensable particulate matter in a specific section during a vehicle evaluation cycle by measuring in real time the particle size distribution of the particulate matter emitted from the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, since the present invention can simulate an atmospheric temperature condition, it can overcome the limitations of the existing method for evaluating the emission factor of the particulate matter emitted from the vehicle which is performed at room temperature, measure the amount of condensable particulate matter that is changed in various atmospheric conditions and calculate the emission factor of the particulate matter that is close to reality by reflecting the measurement.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, since in the present invention a change in the dilution ratio is allowed, it is possible to calculate the emission factor of the particulate matter that is close to the reality by reflecting the amount of condensable particulate matter due to a change in the degree of dilution of the particulate matter emitted from the vehicle according to the density of the vehicles.</p><?summary-of-invention

The dilution ratio can be controlled by using a flow controller and a vacuum pump (not shown) to maintain a predetermined dilution ratio. In the dilution chamber <b>20</b>, the dilution air is injected to generate turbulence, so that the exhaust gas sample can be mixed with the dilution air, and complete mixing can be performed in a short time.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The dilution ratio can be set to 2 to 50 times in a range that simulates the dilution ratio when the exhaust gas is exposed to the atmosphere, depending on the density of vehicles on a road, but preferably, the ratio of air to exhaust gas is 1:9 to 1:29. When the dilution ratio is greater than 1:9, it is difficult to obtain accurate data because the concentration of exhaust gas is set high and dilution is hardly performed, and when the dilution ratio is lower than 1:29, excessive dilution may occur.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">On the other hand, the dilution chamber 20 can perform temperature control in the range of &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C.
