Epitope mapping may be useful in the discovery and development of novel therapies, vaccines, diagnostics, among other biomedical applications. Epitope mapping can also be useful for securing intellectual property (IP) protection of, for example, novel therapeutic antibodies. Exhaustive characterization of the amino acid identity and conformational structure of a novel antibody's epitope helps define the novelty of the antibody, the non-obviousness of the antibody, and enables providing the required written descriptive support for disclosure of the novel antibody. Crowded IP spaces, for example, a therapeutic target for which multiple drugs already exist, require the ability to differentiate between a novel antibody and previously disclosed antibodies for the same target.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Likewise, paratope mapping is the characterization of the properties of an antibody that confer specificity to its antigen, for example amino acid compositions, charge, and three-dimensional conformation. Thorough characterization of the antibody-antigen interaction by both epitope and paratope mapping are useful for understanding the mechanisms and dynamics of specific binding between the antibody and antigen and can be used to gain structural insights into the binding interface. Methods for epitope and paratope mapping include array-based oligo-peptide scanning, site-directed mutagenesis mapping, high-throughput shotgun mutagenesis mapping, cross-linking-coupled mass spectrometry, among others.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">More broadly, characterization of the binding dynamics at the interface between any two proteins that specifically interact plays a role in myriad biomedical applications. The methods disclosed herein may provide for the high-throughput characterization of the specific interaction at the interface between two protein binding partners.

All publications mentioned herein are incorporated by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing devices, methods and cell populations that may be used in connection with the presently described invention.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0064">The term &#x201c;complementary nucleotides&#x201d; as used herein refers to Watson-Crick base pairing between nucleotides and specifically refers to nucleotides hydrogen bonded to one another with thymine or uracil residues linked to adenine residues by two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine residues linked by three hydrogen bonds. In general, a nucleic acid includes a nucleotide sequence described as having a &#x201c;percent complementarity&#x201d; or &#x201c;percent homology&#x201d; to a specified second nucleotide sequence. For example, a nucleotide sequence may have 80%, 90%, or 100% complementarity to a specified second nucleotide sequence, indicating that 8 of 10, 9 of 10 or 10 of 10 nucleotides of a sequence are complementary to the specified second nucleotide sequence. For instance, the nucleotide sequence 3&#x2032;-TCGA-5&#x2032; is 100% complementary to the nucleotide sequence 5&#x2032;-AGCT-3&#x2032;; and the nucleotide sequence 3&#x2032;-TCGA-5&#x2032; is 100% complementary to a region of the nucleotide sequence 5&#x2032;-TTAGCTGG-3&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0065">&#x201c;Homology&#x201d; or &#x201c;identity&#x201d; or &#x201c;similarity&#x201d; refers to sequence similarity between two peptides or, more often in the context of the present disclosure, between two nucleic acid molecules. The term &#x201c;homologous region&#x201d; or &#x201c;homology arm&#x201d; refers to a region on the donor DNA with a certain degree of homology with the target genomic DNA sequence. Homology can be determined by comparing a position in each sequence which may be aligned for purposes of comparison. When a position in the compared sequence is occupied by the same base or amino acid, then the molecules are homologous at that position. A degree of homology between sequences is a function of the number of matching or homologous positions shared by the sequences.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0066">&#x201c;Operably linked&#x201d; refers to an arrangement of elements, e.g., barcode sequences, gene expression cassettes, coding sequences, promoters, enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, where the components so described are configured so as to perform their usual function. Thus, control sequences operably linked to a coding sequence are capable of effecting the transcription, and in some cases, the translation, of a coding sequence. The control sequences need not be contiguous with the coding sequence so long as they function to direct the expression of the coding sequence. Thus, for example, intervening untranslated yet transcribed sequences can be present between a promoter sequence and the coding sequence and the promoter sequence can still be considered &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; to the coding sequence. In fact, such sequences need not reside on the same contiguous DNA molecule (i.e. chromosome) and may still have interactions resulting in altered regulation.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0067">As used herein the term &#x201c;selectable marker&#x201d; refers to a gene introduced into a cell, which confers a trait suitable for artificial selection. General use selectable markers are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Drug selectable markers such as ampicillin/carbenicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, bleomycin, streptomycin, puromycin, hygromycin, blasticidin, and G418 may be employed. A selectable marker may also be an auxotrophy selectable marker, wherein the cell strain to be selected for carries a mutation that renders it unable to synthesize an essential nutrient. Such a strain will only grow if the lacking essential nutrient is supplied in the growth medium. Essential amino acid auxotrophic selection of, for example, yeast mutant strains, is common and well-known in the art. &#x201c;Selective medium&#x201d; as used herein refers to cell growth medium to which has been added a chemical compound or biological moiety that selects for or against selectable markers or a medium that is lacking essential nutrients and selects against auxotrophic strains.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0068">As used herein, the term &#x201c;vector&#x201d; is any of a variety of nucleic acids that comprise a desired sequence or sequences to be delivered to and/or expressed in a cell. Vectors are typically composed of DNA, although RNA vectors are also available. Vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmids, fosmids, phagemids, virus genomes, BACs, YACs, PACs, synthetic chromosomes, among others.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0069">As used herein, &#x201c;affinity&#x201d; is the strength of the binding interaction between a single biomolecule to its ligand or binding partner. Affinity is usually measured and described using the equilibrium dissociation constant, K<sub>D</sub>. The lower the K<sub>D </sub>value, the greater the affinity between the protein and its binding partner. Affinity may be affected by hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic and Van der Waals forces between the binding partners, or by the presence of other molecules, e.g., binding agonists or antagonists.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0070">In some implementations, affinity may be described using arbitrary units, wherein a certain binding affinity within an assay, for example the binding affinity between two wild-type protein binding partners or the wild-type species of a first protein binding partner and the wild-type species of a second protein binding partner, is set to an arbitrary unit of 1.0 and binding affinities for other pairs of protein binding partners, for example the mutant species of a first protein binding partner and the mutant species of a second protein binding partner, are measured relative proportionally to that certain binding affinity.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0071">As used herein, &#x201c;site saturation mutagenesis&#x201d; (SSM), refers to a mutagenesis technique used in protein engineering and molecular biology, wherein a codon or set of codons is substituted with all possible amino acids at the position in the polypeptide. Alternatively, SSM may describe changing an amino acid residue at a given position to one of a subset of possible amino acid substitutions at the position, for example, substitution to all possible amino acids except for cysteine. SSM may be performed for one codon, several codons, or for every position in the protein. The result is a library of mutant proteins representing the full complement of possible amino acids at one, several, or every amino acid position in a polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0072">As used herein, &#x201c;user-directed mutagenesis&#x201d; refers to any process wherein a user modifies the amino acid sequence of polypeptide by any technique well known to those of skill in the art. A polypeptide may be modified at one or more amino acid residues in a defined way, e.g. an alanine residue may be changed to an arginine residue, or a polypeptide sequence may be modified in a randomized way, i.e., by using degenerate primers and randomized PCR amplification. A polypeptide may be modified by user-directed mutagenesis at one amino acid residue or many amino acid residues. A polypeptide may be modified by user-directed mutagenesis to include insertion and/or deletions of one or more amino acid residues, or a polypeptide sequence may be truncated by user-direction mutagenesis. A polypeptide may be modified by user-directed mutagenesis to include insertions or substitutions with natural or unnatural amino acids.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0073">As used herein, a &#x201c;paratope&#x201d; is a part of an antibody which specifically recognizes and binds to the antibody's corresponding antigen. A paratope may also be known as an antigen-binding site. A paratope may comprise as many as approximately 15 amino acid residues of the antibody polypeptides, of which approximately 5 amino acid residues typically contribute most of the binding energy to a paratope. The amino acids comprising a paratope may be a continuous sequence of amino acid residues within the polypeptide chain of the antibody protein structure or may be discontinuous amino acid residues that confer conformational specificity upon the three-dimensional structure of the antibody protein structure. As used herein, &#x201c;paratope mapping&#x201d; is the process of experimentally identifying and characterizing the composition of a paratope within an antibody protein structure. Paratope mapping may define the amino acid sequence of the paratope, the three-dimensional structure of the paratope, and may provide information on the mechanisms of action defining the interaction of an antibody and its antigen.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0074">As used herein, an &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; is a part of an antigen which is specifically recognized and bound by an antibody.

The library of pembro scFv mutants comprised a comprehensive site-saturation mutagenesis library of 33 amino acid residues spanning several domains from position 30 to position 235 of the polypeptide. The library of PD-1 mutants comprised a comprehensive site-saturation mutagenesis library of 60 amino acid residues spanning several domains from position 5 to position 115 of the polypeptide.

Results for a subset of the compensatory mutations are plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. For example, the affinity of the PD-1 mutant K54F with wild-type pembro scFv was 0.05 relative to the wild-type by wild-type interaction of the two protein binding partners (n=3; standard deviation=0.03). The affinity of the pembro scFv mutant Y33P with wild-type PD-1 was 0.33 relative to the wild-type by wild-type interaction of the two protein binding partners (n=3; standard deviation=0.08). However, the affinity of the PD-1 mutant K54F with the pembro scFv mutant Y33P was 1.19 relative to the wild-type by wild-type interaction of the two protein binding partners (n=3; standard deviation=0.38), i.e., the interaction of these two mutants of the protein binding partners was about equivalent to the wild-type by wild-type interaction indicating a pair of compensatory mutations of the two protein binding partners. An analogous signature of affinities between the two binding partners was observed for the PD-1 mutant K54M and the pembro scFv mutant Y33P. For a third pair of mutant protein binding partners, the affinity of the PD-1 mutant K54I with wild-type pembro scFv was 0.40 relative to the wild-type by wild-type interaction of the two protein binding partners (n=3; standard deviation=0.22) and the affinity of the pembro scFv mutant Y101K with wild-type PD-1 was 1.06 relative to the wild-type by wild-type interaction of the two protein binding partners (n=3; standard deviation=0.18), indicating that pembro scFv mutant Y101K had no impact on affinity. However, the affinity of the PD-1 mutant K54I with the pembro scFv mutant Y101K was 1.87 relative to the wild-type by wild-type interaction of the two protein binding partners (n=3; standard deviation=0.35), i.e., the interaction of these two mutants of the protein binding partners had a significantly higher affinity than the wild-type by wild-type interaction indicating a pair of compensatory mutations of the two protein binding partners.

The native yeast sexual agglutinins have been replaced with surface displayed binders (SAPs), and mating efficiency was measured using flow-cytometry. A diploid chromosomal translocation system was developed to combine the genes for both binders onto a single chromosome such that next generation sequencing can be used to evaluate the mating frequency of a particular pair of binders in a large library.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0202">While there are numerous cell-based assays to analyze extracellular binding between a library of proteins and a single target, only cell-free approaches have been developed for characterizing whole protein interaction networks in a single assay. This has meant time consuming and costly library preparation steps involving the purification and labeling of each protein constituent in the network. This example demonstrates a pairwise yeast surface display (PYSD) assay for library-on-library characterization of protein interactions that combines yeast surface display and sexual agglutination to link protein binding to the mating of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. In particular, this example demonstrates that sexual agglutination is highly engineerable by knocking out the native agglutination proteins and instead displaying complementary binding proteins (synthetic agglutination proteins, SAPs) on the surface of MATa and MATalpha yeast cells. This example shows that mating efficiency is highly dependent on the binding affinity and expression level of the surface expressed proteins. A chromosomal translocation scheme can allow protein-protein interaction networks to be analyzed with next generation sequencing and applied to the analysis of two engineered protein interaction networks.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0203">The characterization of protein interaction networks for both binding affinity and specificity is crucial for understanding cellular functions, screening therapeutic candidates, and evaluating engineered protein networks. For example, protein &#x201c;interactome&#x201d; mapping has expanded the understanding of biological systems and disease states and can be used to evaluate therapeutic drug candidates for the proper mediation or disruption of specific protein interactions. Additionally, the construction of synthetic systems often requires highly specific and orthogonal protein interactions to properly control cellular behavior. Engineered protein binding domains that allow for the construction of arbitrary protein interaction networks require careful characterization in the context of a highly complex biological system.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0204">Many approaches exist for the analysis of binding between a library of proteins and a single protein target. Yeast surface display (YSD) has been widely used, in part due to the ease of library construction. In order to analyze protein networks, however, it is necessary to screen for binding between all possible protein pairs. Since YSD measures binding with cell fluorescence following incubation with soluble fluorescently tagged target, this approach does not allow for screening against a library of target proteins. A recently developed approach uses DNA barcoded proteins for one-pot library-on-library characterization, but requires the purification of each constituent protein in the network, making the analysis of large networks enormously time consuming and expensive. This disclosure presents a novel method that combines the ease of YSD library generation with a high throughput assay capable of characterizing entire protein interaction networks in a single pot.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0205">A pairwise yeast surface display (PYSD) platform is used for one-to-one, many-to-one, or many-to-many protein interaction characterization. For a one-to-one screen, two isogenic displayer strains, one MATa constitutively expressing a fluorescent marker (e.g., mCherry) and one MATalpha constitutively expressing a second fluorescent marker (e.g., mTurquoise), each express a synthetic adhesion protein (SAP) on their surface as a fusion to Aga2 (Aga2-myc). A mating assay is then used to determine the effect of displaying those particular SAPs on mating efficiency, which is reported as the percent of diploid cells after 17 hours. Haploids and diploids are distinguished based on their expression of mCherry and mTurquoise in a flow cytometry assay. The surface expression strength of each SAP is determined by incubating the mixed culture with FITC conjugated anti-myc antibody prior to flow cytometry.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0206">For a many-to-one or many-to-many screen, one or both of the isogenic displayer strains are replaced with a display library, or a library of displayer cells each expressing a unique SAP. After a short mating period, cells are transferred to media lacking lysine and leucine, which is used to select for diploid cells only. For a many-to-many screen, R-Estradiol (&#x3b2;E) is also added to induce CRE recombinase expression in mated diploids. Recombinase expression results in translocation at lox66/lox71 sites, which flank the SAP integrations, resulting in the juxtaposition of the SAP genes onto one copy of chromosome III. Because of the biased nature of the lox66/71 recombinase site pair, the majority of the population now consists of translocated diploids. Following translocation, cell lysis no longer uncouples the SAP pair from a particular diploid cell. For both the many-to-one and many-to-many screens, a colony PCR of the diploid population is analyzed with next generation sequencing to determine the mating frequency of each SAP pair compared to all other possible SAP pairs included in the assay.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Materials and Methods:</heading><p id="p-0162" num="0207">PLASMID CONSTRUCTION: The plasmids used for a first example (Example A) are listed in Table 1.

The sequence of each promoter, open reading frame, terminator, and chromosomal homology were verified with Sanger sequencing.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Plasmids used in Example A.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Plasmid </entry><entry/><entry/><entry>Integration </entry></row><row><entry>Name</entry><entry>Gene Cassette</entry><entry>Marker</entry><entry>Locus</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>pPYSD2</entry><entry>Ura3KO</entry><entry>[5-FOA]</entry><entry>AGA1</entry></row><row><entry>pPYSD2</entry><entry>pGPD-mCherry</entry><entry>BleoMX</entry><entry>LTR2</entry></row><row><entry>pPYSD3</entry><entry>pGPD-mTurquoise</entry><entry>BleoMX</entry><entry>LTR2</entry></row><row><entry>pPYSD4</entry><entry>Aga2KO</entry><entry>URA</entry><entry>AGA2</entry></row><row><entry>pPYSD5</entry><entry>Sag1KO</entry><entry>URA</entry><entry>SAG1</entry></row><row><entry>pPYSD6</entry><entry>pGPD-Aga1</entry><entry>NatMX</entry><entry>HIS3</entry></row><row><entry>pPYSD7</entry><entry>pGAL1-HygMX/pACT1-Zev4</entry><entry>KanMX</entry><entry>YCR043</entry></row><row><entry>pPYSD8</entry><entry>pZ4-CRE/pGPD-GAVN</entry><entry>KanMX</entry><entry>YCR043</entry></row><row><entry>pPYSD9</entry><entry>pGPD-Aga2 Bfl1/lox66/mCherry</entry><entry>Trp1</entry><entry>ARS314</entry></row><row><entry>pPYSD10</entry><entry>pGPD-Aga2 BclB/lox66/mCherry</entry><entry>Trp1</entry><entry>ARS314</entry></row><row><entry>pPYSD11</entry><entry>pGPD-Aga2 Bcl2/lox66/mCherry</entry><entry>Trp1</entry><entry>ARS314</entry></row><row><entry>PPYSD12</entry><entry>pGPD-Aga2 BHRF1/lox66/mCherry</entry><entry>Trp1</entry><entry>ARS314</entry></row><row><entry>PPYSD13</entry><entry>pGPD-Aga2 Bim-BH3/lox71/</entry><entry>Trp1</entry><entry>ARS314</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>mTurquoise</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>PPYSD14</entry><entry>pGPD-Aga2 BINDI-F21/lox71/</entry><entry>Trp1</entry><entry>ARS314</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>mTurquoise</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>PPYSD15</entry><entry>pGPD-Aga2 BINDI-B+/lox71/</entry><entry>Trp1</entry><entry>ARS314</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>mTurquoise</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>PPYSD16</entry><entry>pGPD-Aga2 BINDI-2+/lox71/</entry><entry>Trp1</entry><entry>ARS314</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>mTurquoise</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>PPYSD17</entry><entry>pGPD-Aga2 BINDI-N62S/lox71/</entry><entry>Trp1</entry><entry>ARS314</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>mTurquoise</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0164" num="0208">YEAST STRAIN CONSTRUCTION AND GROWTH CONDITIONS: The <i>S. cerevisiae </i>strains used in a second example (Example B) are listed in Table 2. EBY100a and W303&#x3b1;MOD were used as initial parent strains. EBY100&#x3b1; was generated through the mating of these two parent strains followed by sporulation and tetrad screening for the appropriate selectable markers. All other strains were constructed with chromosomal integrations by linearizing a given plasmid with a Pme1 restriction digest and conducting a standard LiAc transformation procedure. Selection transformants was accomplished using media deficient in a given auxotrophic marker or with media supplemented with a eukaryotic antibiotic. Diagnostic colony PCRs were conducted following each transformation to verify integration into the proper locus. All yeast assays use standard yeast culture media and growth at 30&#xb0; C. All liquid culture growth is performed in 3 mL of YPD liquid media and shaking at 275 RPM.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="280pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Yeast strains used in Example B.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Strain Name</entry><entry>Description</entry><entry>Parent</entry><entry>Transformant</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>EBY100a</entry><entry>Yeast surface display </entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>strain</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>W303&#x3b1;MOD</entry><entry>MAT&#x3b1;

Each haploid was then combined in a fresh 3 mL YPD liquid culture such that the MATa strain was at a density of 100 cells/&#x3bc;L and the MATa strain was at a density of 600 cells/&#x3bc;L. This difference in starting concentration was an adjustment for an observed uneven growth response to mating factor. The cells were also each grown separately in fresh YPD in order to individually assess their surface expression strength. Following 17 hours of growth, 2.5 &#x3bc;L of mating culture was added to 1 mL of molecular grade water and read on a flow cytometer. MATa, MATalpha, and diploid cells were distinguished based on fluorescent intensity of mCherry and mTurquoise. For the experiments described here, a Miltenyi MACSQUANT&#xae; VYB was used. The Y2 channel (561 nm excitation laser and 615 nm emission filter) was used to measure mCherry expression and the V1 channel (405 nm excitation laser and 450 nm emission filter) was used to measure mTurquoise expression. The diploid cell population as a percent of total cell population after 17 hours was used as a measure of mating efficiency. Surface expression strength was measured by incubating 10 &#x3bc;L of each individually grown cell strain for 15 minutes with FITC conjugated anti-myc antibody in PBSF following a wash in 1 mL of water. Cells were then washed again and resuspended in 1 mL of water. Flow cytometry was then performed. For the determination of surface expression strength, an ACCURI&#x2122; C6 cytometer was used. The FL1.A channel (488 nm excitation laser and 533 nm emission filter) was used to measure FITC binding to the cell. FLOWJO&#x2122; is used for all cytometry analysis.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0210">For a one-to-many batched mating assay, a recombinant MATa yeast strain expressing a single SAP fused to Aga2 is combined in a fresh 3 mL YPD culture with multiple recombinant MATalpha yeast strains expressing distinct SAPs fused to Aga2. The MATa strain is added at a density of 100 cells/&#x3bc;L and the MATalpha strains are added in equal concentrations for a total density of 600 cells/&#x3bc;L. After 6 hours of growth, hygromycin is added at 100 ng/&#x3bc;L. 20 hours after the initial culture inoculation, 1 mL of cells are pelleted. 2 &#x3bc;L of cells are removed from the pellet, lysed with 0.2% SDS, spun down to remove all cellular debris, and diluted in water. The lysate is then used as a template for a PCR with standard primers containing overhangs for next generation sequencing and the PCR product, expected to be approximately 350 bases, is purified from a gel slice. Single-read next generation sequencing is then performed. The frequency that a particular barcode is observed relative to the total number of reads provides a relative measure for the number of matings that were caused by the SAP associated with that particular barcode.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0211">For a many-to-many (also see Example 6) batched mating assay, multiple haploid yeast strains of each mating type are combined in a fresh 3 mL YPD culture.

The lysate is then used as a template for a PCR with standard primers containing overhangs for next generation sequencing and the PCR product, expected to be 650 bases, is purified from a gel slice.

Sag1, the primary MATalpha sexual agglutinin protein, is essential for agglutination. When Sag1 is knocked out, MATalpha cells are unable to mate with wild-type MATa cells in a turbulent liquid culture. However, when complementary SAPs are expressed on a display pair, mating is recovered. Non-complementary SAPs are unable to recover mating.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0213">The frequency of mating events between any two display cells is dependent on the binding affinity between their SAP pair and the surface expression strength of each SAP. The results demonstrate that binding affinity and observed mating efficiency are positively correlated. However, it is possible to improve the correlation by adjusting the mating efficiency for the expression level of each SAP.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0214">Seven SAP pairs with known affinities were evaluated for mating efficiency (see Table 3). The mating efficiency for each pair was tested four times, and an average and standard deviation were calculated. The surface expression strength (SES) of each haploid display strain was also measured, as described in the materials and methods. A &#x201c;mating score,&#x201d; which adjusts the mating efficiency for differences in surface expression strength, was calculated by dividing the mean mating efficiency by the product of the surface expression strengths of both haploid displayer strains.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left"

possible to determine the relative interaction strengths between many proteins in a single assay. By barcoding each SAP, a many-to-one screen can evaluate the relative mating frequencies between a particular SAP and a SAP library using single-read next generation sequencing. A CRE recombinase-based translocation scheme can be used to juxtapose the barcodes from each mating type onto the same chromosome. With the addition of this chromosomal translocation procedure, it is possible to evaluate relative mating frequencies between two SAP libraries using paired-end next generation sequencing. This approach allows for the analysis of arbitrary protein interaction topologies.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0216">Performing additional mating assays with more SAP pairs and using all measured affinities of the SAP pairs can provide the surface expression strength of each SAP and the mating efficiency. A statistical analysis can be performed to determine the relationship between binding affinity, surface expression strength of each SAP, and mating efficiency. The result could be used to determine a predictive relationship between these four variables so that measuring mating efficiency and surface expression strengths could be used to provide an estimation of binding affinity and to determine a threshold for a detectable recovery of mating efficiency.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0217">Example 2 demonstrates a pairwise yeast surface display assay that allows for library-on-library characterization of protein interactions in a single assay. By replacing native <i>S. cerevisiae </i>sexual agglutinin proteins with synthetic adhesion proteins, it is possible to couple mating efficiency and protein binding strength. This approach can then be used to evaluate binding between two specific proteins or to determine the relative interactions strengths between a library of proteins.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0218">While certain embodiments have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosures.
