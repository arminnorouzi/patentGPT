The coating layer <b>120</b> is located on the surface of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b>. The coating layer <b>120</b> is a layer containing a coating material. The positive-electrode active material <b>110</b> is covered with the coating material.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The coating layer <b>120</b> contains lithium and carbon.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The ratio C/Li of the carbon content to the lithium content in a surface layer portion of the coated active material <b>130</b> is 3.27 or more based on the atomic ratio. The phrase &#x201c;surface layer portion of the coated active material <b>130</b>&#x201d; refers to a portion from the outermost surface to a predetermined depth position of the coated active material <b>130</b>. The &#x201c;predetermined depth position&#x201d; may be a position at which composition information can be acquired by a method for analyzing a surface composition. For example, the coating layer <b>120</b> with a thickness exceeding the penetration depth of soft X-rays or an electron beam used in the composition analysis is regarded as the &#x201c;surface layer portion of the coated active material <b>130</b>&#x201d;. When the coating layer <b>120</b> has a smaller thickness than the penetration depth of soft X-rays or an electron beam used in the composition analysis, part of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b> and the coating layer <b>120</b> are included in the &#x201c;surface layer portion of the coated active material <b>130</b>&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The positive-electrode active material <b>110</b> is separated from the solid electrolyte <b>100</b> by the coating layer <b>120</b>. The positive-electrode active material <b>110</b> may not be in direct contact with the solid electrolyte <b>100</b>. This is because the coating layer <b>120</b> has ionic conductivity.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Such a structure can improve the discharge voltage of a battery.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">International Publication No. WO 2019/135322 discloses that an oxidative decomposition side reaction of extracting electrons from a solid electrolyte in contact with a positive-electrode active material occurs while charging and forms an oxidized layer with low lithium ion conductivity between the positive-electrode active material and the solid electrolyte, thereby increasing the interfacial resistance. It is also mentioned that a coating layer can be formed between the positive-electrode active material and the solid electrolyte to reduce the formation of the oxidized layer and reduce the increase in interfacial resistance. However, the surface composition of the coating layer is not clarified.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">On the other hand, as a result of extensive studies, the present inventors have found the problem that battery operation changes the composition of a surface layer portion of a coated active material including a coating layer and a positive-electrode active material, increases the interfacial resistance, and decreases the discharge voltage. As a result of further detailed investigation, the present inventors have found that intentionally increasing the ratio (C/Li) of the carbon content to the lithium content in a surface layer portion of a coated active material improves the discharge voltage.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The coating layer <b>120</b> may contain a carbonate as a coating material. An increase in the ratio (C/Li) of the surface layer portion of the coated active material <b>130</b> results in a decrease in the lithium content of a carbonate (for example, lithium carbonate, lithium hydrogen carbonate, etc.) contained in the coating layer <b>120</b>. A decrease in the lithium content results in the coating layer <b>120</b> with improved potential stability. The coating layer <b>120</b> with improved potential stability further reduces the formation of an oxidized layer between the coated active material <b>130</b> and the solid electrolyte <b>100</b> and decreases the interfacial resistance in an electrode reaction. This can improve the discharge voltage of a battery.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The effect of improving the potential stability of the coating layer <b>120</b> is expected to reduce not only the formation of an oxidized layer of the solid electrolyte but also the oxidation of the electrolyte solution. Thus, the technique of the present disclosure is also effective in a battery containing an electrolyte solution.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The ratio (C/Li) may be controlled by any method. For example, the coated active material <b>130</b> is heat-treated in an oxygen atmosphere and is then recovered in an atmosphere with a dew point of &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. or less. The oxygen atmosphere may be a pure oxygen atmosphere. The heat treatment conditions and the atmospheric conditions for taking out the coated active material <b>130</b> from the heat treatment apparatus after the heat treatment can be appropriately selected on the basis of the compositions of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b> and the coating layer <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The surface composition of the coated active material <b>130</b> may be analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) or electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). The method for analyzing a surface composition is appropriately selected according to the composition of the coating material contained in the coating layer <b>120</b> and the coating state of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b>. Surface composition analysis using XPS is less likely to be local analysis and can examine a relatively large area of the surface of a material. XPS is suitable as a surface composition analysis method because average surface composition information at a depth of 10 nm from the outermost surface can be acquired and because the quality control of the material is easy.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The ratio (C/Li) may be 3.72 or more and 50 or less. A ratio (C/Li) of 50 or less results in a sufficient Li content of the carbonate. This can reduce the decrease in the Li ionic conductivity and consequently reduce the increase in the internal resistance of the positive-electrode material <b>1000</b>. The positive-electrode material <b>1000</b> with a smaller increase in the internal resistance enables a battery to operate at high output power. The ratio (C/Li) may be 3.72 or more and 6.83 or less. A ratio (C/Li) in such a range can result in a smaller increase in interfacial resistance due to an electrode reaction and can result in the coating layer <b>120</b> with high Li ionic conductivity. This further improves the discharge voltage of a battery.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The solid electrolyte <b>100</b> may be a halide solid electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The halide solid electrolyte is represented by the following composition formula (1), for example.

The powder of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b> is synthesized by a solid phase method, for example. In the solid phase method, a plurality of raw powders are mixed and heat-treated to produce a powder of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b>. Furthermore, powders of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b> with various compositions are commercially available and are readily available.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">The coating layer <b>120</b> is then formed on the surface of the particles of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b>. The coating layer <b>120</b> may be formed by any method. The coating layer <b>120</b> may be formed by a liquid phase coating method or a gas phase coating method.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">For example, in the liquid phase coating method, a precursor solution of an ion-conducting material is applied to the surface of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b>. To form the coating layer <b>120</b> containing LiNbO<sub>3</sub>, the precursor solution may be a mixed solution (sol solution) of a solvent, a lithium alkoxide, and a niobium alkoxide. The lithium alkoxide may be lithium ethoxide. The niobium alkoxide may be niobium ethoxide. The solvent is an alcohol, such as ethanol, for example. The amounts of lithium alkoxide and niobium alkoxide are adjusted to the target composition of the coating layer <b>120</b>. If necessary, water may be added to the precursor solution. The precursor solution may be acidic or alkaline.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0108">The precursor solution may be applied to the surface of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b> by any method. For example, the precursor solution can be applied to the surface of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b> using a tumbling granulation coating apparatus. In the tumbling granulation coating apparatus, the precursor solution can be sprayed over and applied to the surface of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b> while tumbling the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b>. Thus, a precursor film is formed on the surface of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b>. The positive-electrode active material <b>110</b> covered with the precursor film is heat-treated. The heat treatment promotes the gelation of the precursor film and forms the coating layer <b>120</b>. Thus, the coated active material <b>130</b> is prepared. At this point, the coating layer <b>120</b> covers almost the entire surface of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b>. The coating layer <b>120</b> has an almost uniform thickness.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0109">The gas phase coating method may be a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method, a vacuum deposition method, a sputtering method, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, or a plasma chemical vapor deposition method. For example, in the PLD method, an ion-conducting material serving as a target is irradiated with a high-energy pulsed laser (for example, KrF excimer laser, wavelength: 248 nm) to deposit the sublimated ion-conducting material on the surface of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b>. To form the coating layer <b>120</b> of LiNbO<sub>3</sub>, LiNbO<sub>3 </sub>sintered to a high density is used as a target.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0110">The coated active material <b>130</b> is then treated to adjust the ratio (C/Li). For example, the coated active material <b>130</b> is heat-treated in an oxygen atmosphere and is then recovered in an atmosphere with a dew point of &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. or less. The oxygen atmosphere may be a pure oxygen atmosphere. The heat treatment conditions and the atmospheric conditions for taking out the coated active material <b>130</b> from the heat treatment apparatus after the heat treatment can be appropriately selected on the basis of the compositions of the positive-electrode active material <b>110</b> and the coating layer <b>120</b>. The heat treatment temperature is 150&#xb0; C. or more and 1000&#xb0; C. or less, for example. The heat treatment time is 1 hour or more and 72 hours or less, for example. The heat treatment may be followed by a treatment for regrinding the coated active material <b>130</b>. For example, the ratio (C/Li) tends to increase with the heat treatment temperature.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0111">The pure oxygen atmosphere may be formed by the following method, for example. The chamber is purged with oxygen gas with a purity of 99% or more to decrease the volume concentration of gases other than the oxygen gas to less than 1%. The pressure of the pure oxygen atmosphere is equal to atmospheric pressure, for example.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112">The positive-electrode material <b>1000</b> with a desired ratio (C/Li) is produced through these steps.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0113">A second embodiment is described below.
