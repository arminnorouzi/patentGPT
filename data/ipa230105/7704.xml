Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet the demand for wireless data traffic having increased since deployment of 4G communication systems, efforts have been made to develop an improved 5G or pre-5G communication system. Therefore, the 5G or pre-5G communication system is also called a &#x2018;Beyond 4G Network&#x2019; or a &#x2018;Post LTE System&#x2019;. The 5G communication system is considered to be implemented in higher frequency (mmWave) bands, e.g., 60 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates. To decrease propagation loss of the radio waves and increase the transmission distance, the beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), Full Dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, an analog beam forming, large scale antenna techniques are discussed in 5G communication systems. In addition, in 5G communication systems, development for system network improvement is under way based on advanced small cells, cloud Radio Access Networks (RANs), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul, moving network, cooperative communication, Coordinated Multi-Points (CoMP), reception-end interference cancellation and the like. In the 5G system, Hybrid FSK and QAM Modulation (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC) as an advanced coding modulation (ACM), and filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), non-orthogonal multiple access(NOMA), and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) as an advanced access technology have been developed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Internet, which is a human centered connectivity network where humans generate and consume information, is now evolving to the Internet of Things (IoT) where distributed entities, such as things, exchange and process information without human intervention. The Internet of Everything (IoE), which is a combination of the IoT technology and the Big Data processing technology through connection with a cloud server, has emerged. As technology elements, such as &#x201c;sensing technology&#x201d;, &#x201c;wired/wireless communication and network infrastructure&#x201d;, &#x201c;service interface technology&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Security technology&#x201d; have been demanded for IoT implementation, a sensor network, a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, Machine Type Communication (MTC), and so forth have been recently researched. Such an IoT environment may provide intelligent Internet technology services that create a new value to human life by collecting and analyzing data generated among connected things. IoT may be applied to a variety of fields including smart home, smart building, smart city, smart car or connected cars, smart grid, health care, smart appliances and advanced medical services through convergence and combination between existing Information Technology (IT) and various industrial applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In line with this, various attempts have been made to apply 5G communication systems to IoT networks. For example, technologies such as a sensor network, Machine Type Communication (MTC), and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication may be implemented by beamforming, MIMO, and array antennas. Application of a cloud Radio Access Network (RAN) as the above-described Big Data processing technology may also be considered to be as an example of convergence between the 5G technology and the IoT technology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, when a User Equipment (UE) in IDLE mode in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) access intents to send Mobile Originating (MO) data to a network or receive Mobile Terminating (MT) data from the network (in response to a paging procedure), the UE can trigger a Service Request procedure to be in CONNECTED mode. The Service Request procedure involves the UE sending a Service Request message to the network. If the Service Request is accepted by the network, the UE can engage in data transfer. However, when the network is congested, the network may reject the Service Request and send a timer T3346 to indicate to the UE that the UE needs to refrain from sending further Service Requests prior to the expiry of the timer T3346. The UE can receive the timer T3346 in a Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signalling message and refrain from triggering the service request procedure prior to the expiry of the timer T3346. It may be noted that the UE may not intend to send MO data or receive MT data at the instance when the timer T3346 is expired. In such instance, the expiry of the timer T3346 is not a significant event for the UE and the UE does not trigger the service request procedure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">If the UE is registered on non-3GPP (N3GPP) access, the UE is always in CONNECTED mode and, hence, does not require triggering the service request procedure. The UE can send MO data or receive MT data at all times given the user plane resources are already active. If the UE moves out of N3GPP access coverage area, the UE comes to the IDLE mode. The UE may initiate a Service Request procedure if the UE detects that 3GPP access is available outside the N3GPP coverage area. However, if the network is congested, the UE may not be able to send MO data or receive MT data (due to triggering of T3346 timer by the network) on N3GPP access, even if the UE returns to the N3GPP access coverage area.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a sequence diagram depicting the triggering of service request by the UE only for sending MO data packets to the Access and Mobility Function (AMF) or for receiving MT data packets from the AMF, after the expiry of the back-off timer (timer <b>3346</b>).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Consider that the UE(<b>101</b>) is registered with a Fifth Generation (5G) communication network. The UE(<b>101</b>) is connected to the AMF(<b>102</b>), which is a core network element of the 5G communication network.

The AMF(<b>102</b>) of the 5G communication network sends a Service Reject (a NAS signalling response message) over 3GPP access(step <b>115</b>). The NAS signalling response message includes the cause of rejection of the Service Request and a timer T3346 to indicate to the UE that the UE needs to back-off from sending further Service Requests prior to the expiry of the timer T3346. After receiving the NAS signalling response message, the UE starts the timer T3346(step <b>120</b>).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">At this instant, it is to be noted that the UE does not trigger a Service Request procedure after the expiry of the timer T3346(step <b>125</b>, step <b>130</b>). Further, after an &#x2018;x&#x2019; time duration, the UE can trigger a Service Request procedure over 3GPP access only when the UE needs to send MO data packets to the 5G communication network(trigger-1) or when the UE needs to receive MT data packets from the 5G communication network(trigger-2).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In case of trigger-1, when the UE generates the MO data packets(step <b>135</b>), the UE(<b>101</b>) sends the Service Request (the NAS signalling message) to the AMF(<b>102</b>) of the 5G communication network over 3GPP access to send the MO data packets(step <b>140</b>).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In case of trigger-2, when the AMF(<b>102</b>) receives MT data intended for the UE(<b>101</b>)(step <b>145</b>), the AMF(<b>102</b>) sends a paging message to the UE(<b>101</b>) over 3GPP access(step <b>150</b>). In response to the paging message, the UE triggers the Service Request(step <b>155</b>).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sequence diagram depicting the rejection or dropping of downlink data packets by AMF due to non-reception of the downlink data packets by a UE.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, consider that the UE(<b>201</b>) is registered with the 5G communication network. As the UE(<b>201</b>) is registered with the 5G communication network, the UE(<b>201</b>) is receiving 5GMM REGISTERED NORMAL SERVICE and is operating in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over N3GPP access(step <b>205</b>). Consider that the UE(<b>201</b>) has moved out of the service area over N3GPP access (coverage area of N3GPP access)(step <b>210</b>).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Therefore, the UE(<b>201</b>) is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over N3GPP access. The UE(<b>201</b>) sends a Service Request or Registration Request (a NAS signalling message) to the AMF(<b>202</b>) of the 5G communication network over 3GPP access(step <b>215</b>). Consider that the 5G communication network is congested. As such, the network may send a Service Reject or Registration Reject message (a NAS signalling response message) over 3GPP access(step <b>220</b>). The NAS signalling response message includes a cause of congestion Information Element (IE) and a timer T3346 to indicate to the UE that the UE needs to back-off from sending further Service Requests prior to the expiry of the timer T3346. After receiving the NAS signalling response message, the UE starts the timer T3346(step <b>225</b>).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Consider that the UE comes back within the coverage area of N3GPP access(step <b>230</b>). The UE-NAS layer in the 5GMM-IDLE mode receives an indication, from the lower layers of N3GPP access, which informs that an access stratum connection has been established between the UE and the AMF. However, as the timer T3346 has not expired, the UE does not trigger a service request procedure over N3GPP access. The UE does not trigger a service request procedure over N3GPP access even if the timer T3346 expires, in case the UE does not have MO data to send. The UE triggers a Service Request procedure over N3GPP access, after the expiry of the timer T3346(step <b>235</b>), when the UE needs to send MO data to the 5G communication network. Thus, the UE remains in 5GMM IDLE state over N3GPP access.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Prior to the UE triggering a Service Request procedure over N3GPP, if the AMF receives MT data intended for the UE(step <b>240</b>), the AMF sends a paging message to the UE over 3GPP access(step <b>245</b>). The paging message can be sent to the UE even if the Timer T3346 has not expired. The AMF can also send downlink NAS messages, apart from the paging message, such as downlink NAS TRANSPORT and messages for UE configuration update, even if the Timer T3346 has not expired.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When the AMF receives MT data intended for the UE over N3GPP access, the AMF sends a paging message with the access type set to N3GPP access over 3GPP access. This indicates that the AMF has received N3GPP MT data intended for the UE. The AMF, through the paging message, intends to determine a UE policy for reception of N3GPP downlink data packets over 3GPP access. The UE sends service request message over 3GPP access(step <b>250</b>), in response to the paging message, wherein the service request message includes the policy that indicates to the AMF about the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) sessions of N3GPP access that are allowed by the UE to be converted to 3GPP access. The policy defines whether the UE has allowed a N3GPP PDU session, established for transfer of data over N3GPP access, to be shifted to 3GPP access. If the policy allows the PDU session to be shifted to 3GPP access and if data is pending to be delivered to the UE, then the PDU sessions are shifted to 3GPP access and the UE can receive N3GPP MT data over 3GPP access(Step <b>255</b>). However, if the policy does not allow shifting the PDU session to 3GPP access, the AMF will be compelled to drop the N3GPP MT downlink data packets(step <b>255</b>).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, either the UE is unable to receive N3GPP MT downlink data packets over 3GPP access if the UE is in IDLE mode in the N3GPP coverage area, and the policy does not allow the PDU session to be shifted to 3GPP access; or unintentionally the PDU sessions are moved from N3GPP access to 3GPP access even though UE is in the N3GPP access coverage area.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The principal object of the embodiments herein is to disclose methods and systems for managing the triggering of Service Request procedures by a User Equipment (UE) for receiving Mobile Terminating (MT) packets over Non-Third Generation Partnership Project (N3GPP) access.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another object of the embodiments herein is to configure the UE to trigger a Service Request procedure if the UE detects that the UE is in N3GPP access coverage area, and if the UE detects that the UE is in Fifth Generation Mobility Management (5GMM)-IDLE mode over N3GPP access when a back-off timer has expired.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Accordingly, the embodiments provide methods and apparatus for receiving Mobile Terminating (MT) packets, by a User Equipment (UE), over Non-Third Generation Partnership Project (N3GPP) access. In an embodiment, consider that the UE has moved out of N3GPP access service area. The UE can transition from Fifth Generation Mobility Management (5GMM)-CONNECTED mode to 5GMM-IDLE mode over N3GPP access when the UE moves out of N3GPP access coverage area or N3GPP service area. When the UE is in the 5GMM-IDLE mode (after the UE moving out of the N3GPP service area) the UE sends a service request (a Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signaling message) to a Fifth Generation (5G) communication network for sending Mobile Originating (MO) data and MT data over 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) access. If the 5G communication network is congested, the 5G communication network, on receiving the service request (the NAS signaling message) from the UE, activates a back-off timer. The UE is prevented from sending further service requests prior to the expiry of the back-off timer. The UE remains in the 5GMM-IDLE mode.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Consider that the UE has returned to the N3GPP access service area. The embodiments include detecting that the UE is in the coverage area of N3GPP access. The embodiments include detecting that the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over N3GPP access. Thereafter, the UE, in the 5GMM-IDLE mode over N3GPP access, can receive an indication from lower layers of N3GPP access, that an access stratum connection is established between the UE and the 5G network over N3GPP access. The embodiments include determining that the back-off timer is activated.

The UE(<b>301</b>) was in the service area of the N3GPP access network, and has moved out of the service area of the N3GPP access network(step <b>310</b>). As the UE(<b>301</b>) moves out of the coverage area of the N3GPP access, the UE(<b>301</b>) is no longer connected to the AMF(<b>302</b>) through N3GPP access. The UE(<b>301</b>) is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over N3GPP access.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The UE(<b>301</b>) can determine that the UE(<b>301</b>) is in the coverage area of 3GPP access. Therefore, the UE(<b>301</b>) can send a Service Request or Registration Request to the AMF over 3GPP access. The UE(<b>301</b>) sends the Service Request (a NAS signalling message) over 3GPP access(step <b>315</b>). Consider that the 5G network is congested. The AMF(<b>302</b>) sends a Service Reject or Registration Reject message (a NAS signalling response message) over 3GPP access(step <b>320</b>), which includes a cause of rejection of the Service Request with a cause value #22 and a timer T3346.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">After receiving the NAS signalling response from the AMF(<b>302</b>), the UE(<b>301</b>) starts the timer T3346(step <b>325</b>) and determine, based on the cause value, that the 5G network is congested and that the UE(<b>301</b>) needs to back-off from sending further Service Requests prior to the expiry of the timer T3346. When the UE(<b>301</b>) comes back to the service area of N3GPP access(step <b>330</b>), the UE(<b>301</b>) receives an indication.

When the timer T3346 expires(step <b>335</b>), the UE(<b>301</b>) triggers a Service Request procedure over N3GPP access(step <b>340</b>). The UE(<b>301</b>) can send Service Request to the AMF(<b>302</b>) (a NAS signalling message). This allows the UE(<b>301</b>) to switch from the 5GMM-IDLE state over N3GPP access to 5GMM-CONNECTED state over N3GPP access, if the Service Request is accepted by the AMF(<b>302</b>).
