These aspects may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limiting; rather, these embodiments are provided by way of example so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and to fully convey the scope of all aspects of invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the description.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an environment in which embodiments presented herein can be applied. Access between a first physical space <b>14</b> and a second physical space <b>15</b> is restricted by a door <b>6</b> which can be closed or open. The door <b>6</b> can be any type of door (e.g. hinged, sliding, roller) and is provided in a doorway <b>5</b> between the first physical space <b>14</b> and a second physical space <b>15</b>. In order to control access in either or both direction between the physical spaces <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> a lock device (not shown) can be provided to thereby selectively unlock and lock the door <b>6</b>. Optionally, the status of the door <b>6</b>, e.g. open or closed, can be detected by a door sensor (not shown) as known in the art per se.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A people detector <b>1</b> is provided by the doorway <b>5</b>. The people detector comprises a people sensor <b>2</b> which is directed to detect any people passing through the doorway <b>5</b>. In this way, the people detector can detect when someone enters the first physical space <b>14</b> from the second physical space <b>15</b> and vice versa. The people sensor <b>2</b> can e.g. be a pulsed coherent radar. By having the radar pulsed, the amount of power used by the people sensor <b>2</b> is reduced. By having the radar coherent, great accuracy is achieved. Alternatively, the people sensor can be based on any other suitable technology, e.g. infrared radar, ultrasonic signals, thermal camera, infrared camera, and/or conventional camera.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The people sensor <b>2</b> of the people detector <b>1</b> is thus capable of detecting when a person <b>7</b> moves to the first physical space <b>14</b> from the second physical space <b>15</b> (and vice versa). The number of people passing through can also be detected. This can be utilised when an intruder attempts to enter a restricted physical space by passing right after a person with legitimate access, a procedure which is also known as back tailing. Optionally, the people sensor is also capable of detecting size of the person <b>7</b> moving between the physical spaces <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. The size can be indicative of age, with at least having the capability of distinguishing small children from adults.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The detection of people <b>7</b>, and optionally a direction of movement, by the people sensor <b>2</b> is recorded by the people detector <b>1</b> and the people detector <b>1</b> can communicate this information to an external device <b>8</b>. The external device <b>8</b> can be an alarm system, a building automation system or any other suitable device. The external device <b>8</b> can be at the same site as the people detector <b>1</b> or it can be remotely located. The external device <b>8</b> can use the people detection information to determine e.g. how many people are in the first physical space <b>14</b> and/or the second physical space <b>15</b>. This information can be used by the external device <b>8</b> e.g. to control ventilation, heating, cooling and/or lighting. Alternatively or additionally, this information can be used if an emergency occurs, to know where people are located and how many people there are. When there is only one doorway to a physical space (e.g. a room, office or home), the people detector can thus be used count how many people are in the physical space at any point in time. When there are multiple doorways to a physical space, each doorway can be provided with a people detector. This enables the external device to keep track of the number of people in the physical space by detecting each time someone enters or exits through any of the doorways.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A physical space (for which the number of people is kept track of) can be any type of space where people can be present. Hence, the physical space can be any one or more of a room, a set of rooms (e.g. an office), a home, a shop, an arena, a theme park or any other commercial or residential space.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Optionally, physical spaces are arranged in a hierarchy, such that several physical spaces are represented collectively by an access zone, e.g. in an office environment. In this way, the external device <b>8</b> can keep track of the number of people in each physical space (e.g. room) and also in the combined access zone. The number of people in each access zone (based on the people counting) can be compared with the number of persons having entered using the access control system, which can thereby be used to detect the occurrence of back tailing.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is schematic diagram illustrating an embodiment in which the people detector <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is embodied in a door closer <b>10</b>. The door closer <b>10</b> is any suitable device used to dampen or otherwise control the closing of the door <b>6</b>. The door closer <b>10</b> can also be included in a device which also includes door opening functions. The location of a door closer <b>10</b> in a doorway <b>5</b> suits very well for placing the people detector <b>1</b> and its people sensor <b>2</b>, since anyone passing through the doorway needs to pass under the door closer <b>10</b>. The door closer <b>10</b> is here provided in the fixed structure around the door, such as fixed to or part of the door frame or above the door frame.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, the people detector <b>1</b> can comprise an energy harvesting module <b>4</b>, which converts mechanical energy from door kinetics, (e.g. door opening/closing) to electric energy which is stored in a battery of the people detector <b>1</b>. In this way, the people detector <b>1</b> needs less (or even no) externally sourced energy, such as from an energised battery or mains power.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the people detector <b>1</b> is embodied in the door closer <b>10</b>, the operation in the door closer <b>10</b> can be controlled based on people sensing. For instance, in one scenario, if all people leave a room (such as a conference room), the door closer can be set in a keep-open state to improve ventilation in the room.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one scenario, if passthrough rate, defined as the number of persons passing through the door per time unit, exceeds a threshold value, the door closer can be set in a keep-open state to make it smoother to pass through the door. Alternatively, the door closer can be configured to close at a slower speed in this scenario. Once the passthrough rate reduces below the threshold (or below a second, lower threshold), the door closer can be reset to a normal (faster) door closing speed. The threshold(s) can be configurable.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating embodiments of methods for detecting people. The methods are performed in the people detector, which is provided by or in a doorway.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a receive open signal step <b>40</b>, the people detector receives an open signal indicating that a door of the doorway is open. The open signal can e.g. be received from a door status sensor or an electronic lock for the door.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an activate people sensor step <b>42</b>, the people detector sets the people sensor of the people detector in an active mode. This step is performed based on receiving the open signal. In other words, when the open signal is received in step <b>40</b>, this step is triggered. The active mode can be a mode where the people sensor is active, e.g. in contrast to a power save mode, also known as a sleep mode.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a detect people step <b>44</b>, the people detector detects when a person passes through the doorway. This is detected using the people sensor. As explained above, the people sensor can comprise a pulsed coherent radar. In one embodiment, this step detects the direction of movement of the person through the doorway. This step can continue to detect people until a closed signal is detected in the next step. When multiple entries and/or exits are detected, the number of entries and the number of exits are counted and stored as part of a result.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a receive closed signal step <b>46</b>, the people detector receives a closed signal indicating that the door of the doorway is closed. The closed signal can e.g. be received from a door status sensor or an electronic lock for the door. As explained above, the closed signal acts as a trigger to end the people counting, since the door is closed and no more people can enter or exit.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a transmit result step <b>47</b>, the people detector transmits a result of the step of detecting to an external device. The result can e.g. be the number of people that have entered or exited the door. This transmitting is performed based on receiving the closed signal. In other words, the closed signal is a trigger for the transmission of the result. In one embodiment, the transmitted result contains a counter of all entries and a counter of all exits, since the last transmitted result. In other words, the result of all entries and exits through the doorway are respectively accumulated and transmitted once the door is closed. This makes the communication with the external device efficient, since only one signal needs to be transmitted to communicate the detection of multiple persons entering and/or exiting through the door. Alternatively, the transmitting of the result can occur regardless of the state of the door, e.g. periodically or whenever a person passes.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a set people sensor in power save step <b>48</b>, the people detector sets the people sensor in a power save mode, such as an idle state or sleep state, where power consumption is greatly reduced. This step is performed based on receiving the closed signal. In other words, when the closed signal is received, this triggers the people sensor being set in a power save mode.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Using the embodiments presented herein, the number of people passing the doorway can be counted, and also in which direction the passing occurs. The speed of movement can be detected as well as the passthrough rate. Additionally, the time between when the door is started to open until a person passes through can be detected,</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">By controlling the power state of the people sensor based on the open/closed signals, the power requirements for the people detector are greatly reduced. In particular, if the door is normally closed, this will result in the people sensor being normally closed. This is a large difference in power consumption compared to if the people device were to be constantly active. Moreover, setting the people sensor in a power save state when the door is closed does not reduce accuracy since the door needs to be open for people to pass through, in which case the people sensor is activated. By saving this amount of power, the people detector can be powered only on battery, optionally combined with energy harvesting as described above.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">By providing the people detector by the doorway, the people sensor only needs to monitor the limited space of the doorway, since people cannot pass through the structure surrounding the doorway. Compared to other people sensors in the prior art which are applied for larger spaces, the requirements of this people sensor are significantly lower. A low power, low cost, movement tuned radar can be used, thus reducing cost and complexity while providing high accuracy.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating components of the people detector <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>. It is to be noted that one or more of the mentioned components can be shared with the door closer, when the people detector <b>1</b> is embodied therein, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. A processor <b>60</b> is provided using any combination of one or more of a suitable central processing unit (CPU), multiprocessor, microcontroller, digital signal processor (DSP), etc., capable of executing software instructions <b>67</b> stored in a memory <b>64</b>, which can thus be a computer program product.
