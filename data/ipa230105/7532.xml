Apparently, the described embodiments are some rather than all of the embodiments of the present disclosure. All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the present disclosure shall fall within the protection scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The technical solutions of the present disclosure may be performed by various communication systems, such as: a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) system, a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system, Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), a general packet radio service (GPRS), and a long term evolution (LTE)/long term evolution advanced (LTE-A), and New Radio (NR).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">User equipment (UE), also referred to as a terminal device, a mobile terminal, mobile user equipment, and the like, may communicate with one or more core networks through a radio access network (RAN) and the like. The user equipment may be a mobile terminal, such as a mobile phone (also referred to as a &#x201c;cellular&#x201d; phone) and a computer with a mobile terminal. For example, the user equipment may be a portable, pocket-sized, handheld, computer built-in, or in-vehicle mobile apparatus, which exchanges languages and/or data with the radio access network.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A base station may be a base transceiver station (BTS) in GSM or CDMA, or may be a NodeB in WCDMA, or may be an evolved NodeB (eNB or e-NodeB) and a 5G base station (gNB) in LTE. This is not limited in the present disclosure. However, for ease of description, the following embodiments are described by using a gNB as an example. When providing the content services for the terminal device, the network side adopts the dedicated mode or the shared mode for transmission. When providing the content services for the terminal device, the application server adopts the unicast mode or the multicast mode for transmission. However, in the related art, there is no solution for conversion among four transmission modes that is triggered by the network side, and therefore the reasonable utilization of resources cannot be ensured.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The technical solutions provided in the embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a transmission mode conversion indication method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method <b>100</b> may be performed by a base station. In other words, the method may be performed by software or hardware installed on the base station. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method may include the following steps.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">S<b>110</b>: Send a first message to a core network or send a second message to a terminal device, so as to indicate that a transmission mode conversion is required, where the first message carries first user information and first multicast group information.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this embodiment of the present disclosure, the first user information carried in the first message sent to the core network is used for indicating a terminal device that needs to perform the transmission mode conversion. After receiving the first message, the core network may send, according to the first user information, a transmission mode conversion indication to a terminal device associated with the first user information to indicate that the corresponding terminal device performs the transmission mode conversion.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this embodiment of the present disclosure, in a case that the transmission mode conversion is required, the base station may indicate that the core network or the terminal device needs to perform the transmission mode conversion, and carry first multicast (group-cast or multicast) group information indicating a multicast service that requires the transmission mode conversion, so that the base station may determine whether to convert a transmission mode of multicast service data according to a specific scenario situation.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a possible implementation, the second message may alternatively carry the first multicast group information indicating the multicast service that requires the transmission mode conversion. Certainly, the second message may alternatively not carry the first multicast group information, and then it indicates that multicast services that require the transmission mode conversion are all current multicast services of the UE.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a possible implementation, the first message and the second message may carry mode information. The mode information is used for indicating the transmission mode of the multicast service data. Through the mode information, the core network or the terminal device may determine the transmission mode of the multicast service data corresponding to the first multicast group information after conversion.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Optionally, the transmission mode may include at least one of the following: a shared mode, a dedicated mode, a unicast mode, or a multicast mode.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an actual application, the first message or the second message may alternatively not carry the mode information, and then it may be predetermined that the first message and the second message indicate a converted transmission mode by default. For example, it may be converted into the shared mode by default. Certainly, this is not limited herein, and it may also be converted into the dedicated mode or other transmission modes by default.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a possible implementation, the first multicast group information may include a multicast group identifier or a multicast group identifier list, for example, a temporary mobile group identifier (TMGI) or a TMGI list, that is used for indicating the multicast service that requires the transmission mode conversion. The multicast group identifier list may include a plurality of multicast group identifiers. That is, there may be one or more multicast group services that require the transmission mode conversion.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a possible implementation, the first user information may be a first user identifier or may be a first user identifier list. The first user identifier list may include a plurality of first user identifiers that are used for indicating users that require the transmission mode conversion. For example, a globally unique temporary user terminal identifier (GUTI) or a GUTI list indicates one or more users that require the transmission mode conversion.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a possible implementation, before S<b>110</b>, the method may further include: receiving a third message sent by the terminal device, where the third message carries second user information and second multicast group information, and the second multicast group information is used for indicating a multicast group that requires the transmission mode conversion. That is, in this possible implementation, the base station may indicate, after receiving the third message sent by the terminal device, that the core network or the terminal device needs to perform the transmission mode conversion.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the foregoing possible implementation, the second multicast group information may include a multicast group identifier or a multicast group identifier list. That is, the terminal device indicates that there may be one or more multicast group services that require the transmission mode conversion.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the foregoing possible implementation, the second user information may include: a second user identifier, and the second user identifier is used for indicating the terminal device that sends the third message.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an application, the first user information includes at least the second user information. That is, the base station indicates that the terminal device that needs to perform the transmission mode conversion includes at least the terminal device that sends the third message, and may also include other terminal devices.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Similarly, the first multicast group information may include at least the second multicast group information. That is, the base station indicates that the multicast service data that requires the transmission mode conversion includes at least the multicast service data indicated by the second multicast group information.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, in an application, a first terminal device determines, according to a situation thereof, that a transmission mode of a certain piece of multicast service data needs to be converted into the shared mode, and then sends a third message to the base station. The message carries user information of the first terminal device and multicast group information <b>1</b> of the multicast service data of which a transmission mode needs to be converted into the shared mode. A second terminal device under the same base station determines, according to a situation thereof, that a transmission mode of a certain piece of multicast service data needs to be converted into the shared mode, and then sends a third message to the base station. The message carries user information of the second terminal device and multicast group information <b>2</b> of the multicast service data of which a transmission mode needs to be converted into the shared mode. The base station sends, after receiving the third message from the first terminal device and the second terminal device, a first message to the core network. First user information carried in the first message may include the user information of the first terminal device and the user information of the second terminal device. First multicast group information carried in the first message may include the multicast group information <b>1</b> and the multicast group information <b>2</b>. Certainly, this is not limited herein. The base station may also send, after receiving the third message sent by the first terminal device, a first message to the core network. First user information carried in the first message is the user information of the first terminal device, and first multicast group information is the multicast group information <b>1</b>. This may be specifically determined according to an actual application.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a possible implementation, after the sending a second message to a terminal device, the method further includes: receiving a mode conversion request sent by the terminal device, where the mode conversion request carries the first multicast group information; and sending a fourth message to the core network, where the fourth message includes the mode conversion request and a trigger indication, where the trigger indication is used for indicating that the mode conversion request is triggered by a radio access network node. That is, the base station may add, after receiving the mode conversion request sent by the terminal device, a trigger indication on the basis of the mode conversion request, and then forward the mode conversion request and the trigger indication to the core network. Through this optional implementation, the core network determines, after receiving the mode conversion request, that the mode conversion request is triggered by a radio access network node (for example, the base station), and is a trigger that can be trusted, thereby releasing a service of the base station to a user plane corresponding to the multicast group identifier or the multicast group identifier list carried in the mode conversion request.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a possible implementation, the base station may also determine, according to a current scenario, whether to send the first message or the second message. In this possible implementation, before S<b>110</b>, the method may further include: determining that a quantity of target users is greater than or less than a preset transmission mode conversion trigger condition, where the quantity of target users is a total quantity of users receiving a multicast service corresponding to the first multicast group information; or determining, based on a resource status of the base station, that the transmission mode conversion is required. For example, a current transmission mode of one or more multicast group services is the shared mode, and the base station determines that a current quantity of target users of the multicast services is less than the preset transmission mode conversion trigger condition, and then sends the first message or the second message to indicate that the transmission mode of the multicast services is converted into the dedicated mode. In addition, user information currently using the multicast services may be carried in the first message. Through this possible implementation, the base station may convert the transmission mode of the multicast service data in a case that a quantity of users receiving a multicast service changes or in a case that a resource status of the base station changes, thereby ensuring the utilization of the resources.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is another schematic flowchart of a transmission mode conversion indication method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method <b>200</b> may be performed by a network function node. In other words, the method may be performed by software or hardware installed on the network function node. In an actual application, network functions of a plurality of core networks may be integrated on the network function node.
