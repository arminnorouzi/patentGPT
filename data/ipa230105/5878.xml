During the application of the first light <b>150</b>, no other member for restricting the movement of the semiconductor chip <b>100</b> is provided on the second surface <b>102</b> side of the semiconductor chip <b>100</b>. In the present embodiment, a laser beam is used as the first light <b>150</b>. The wavelength of the laser beam can be 600 nm to 1300 nm, 750 nm to 1200 nm, or 850 nm to 1100 nm. When the wavelength is less than 600 nm, the absorption of light by the semiconductor chip becomes large, and thus, there is a concern that the semiconductor chip may be damaged. When the wavelength exceeds 1300 nm, the effective energy provided by the exposure becomes small, and thus, the temperature of the connection portion does not rise quickly. The application time of the laser beam is, for example, 0.1 seconds to 60 seconds, 0.5 seconds to 30 seconds, or 1 second to 15 seconds. When the application time is less than 0.1 seconds, the temperature may not rise substantially, and when the application time exceeds 60 seconds, there can be a problem in that the manufacturing throughput becomes slow. By using the laser beam of an above-mentioned wavelength as the first light <b>150</b>, it is possible to prevent the energy of the laser beam from being absorbed significantly by the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, and it is thus possible to efficiently use the energy of the laser beam for heating the metal bump <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A light other than a laser beam may be used as the first light <b>150</b>.

It is not necessary to melt all of the plurality of metal bumps <b>130</b> provided on the semiconductor chip <b>100</b> by the application of the first light <b>150</b>, and it can be sufficient if at least two metal bumps <b>130</b> among the plurality of metal bumps <b>130</b> are melted.

When the wavelength is less than 600 nm, the absorption of light by the semiconductor chip becomes large, and thus, there is a concern that the semiconductor chip may be damaged.
