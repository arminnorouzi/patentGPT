The instrument panel is formed with a vent for blowing the air conditioned through the air conditioner into the interior, and the air vent device is installed in the vent to control discharge volume and direction of the conditioned air. Alternatively, the air vent device may be provided in a console for a rear passenger.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The air vent device may control discharge volume and direction of the conditioned air through rotation of a plurality of wings based on user manipulation, and block a discharge port with the plurality of wings when discharge of the air is not desired.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a partial plane view schematically showing a conventional air vent device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the conventional air vent device includes a plurality of wing members <b>10</b> that rotate by user's manipulation to control discharge volume and direction of conditioned air. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when the plurality of wing members <b>10</b> overlap one another by rotating in one direction, they enter a closed state where discharge of the air may be blocked.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the conventional air vent device has a problem in which the air leaks into the interior of the vehicle through a gap <b>20</b> between the wing members <b>10</b> in the closed state of the plurality of wing members <b>10</b>, and in this case, whistle noise is generated.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, when the plurality of wing members <b>10</b> are closed, they make noise by colliding with one another.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is provided to solve the foregoing problems, and aims to provide an air vent for a vehicle, which is capable of minimizing inflow of air between wing members when the wing members close a flow path for discharging conditioned air into the interior of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention also aims to provide an air vent for a vehicle, which is capable of preventing generation of whistle noise by reducing a flow rate even in case of inflow of the air between wing members when the wing members close a flow path for discharging conditioned air into the interior of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, the present invention aims to provide an air vent for a vehicle, which is capable of preventing noise from being generated by collision between wing members when the wing members rotate in a direction to close a flow path for discharging conditioned air into the interior of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An air vent for a vehicle includes a housing having formed therein a flow path in which air flows and a plurality of wing members rotatably engaged to the housing to open and close the flow path and having a gap formed to prevent the plurality of wing members to contact one another when the plurality of wing members rotate in a direction to close the flow path.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Herein, the gap may change a flow path through which air flows to minimize inflow of the air, and may form a pressure reducing section to reduce a flow rate.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">More specifically, the gap may include an inflow path formed in a direction perpendicular to a flow direction of the air flowing in the flow path, a curved flow path connected to the inflow path and formed curvedly to protrude in the flow direction of the air flowing in the flow path, and a discharge flow path connected to the curved flow path and through which the flowing-in air is discharged.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Herein, the inflow path and the discharge flow path may be formed in a direction parallel to a plurality of wing members.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The discharge flow path may be formed upper than the inflow path with respect to the flow direction of the air.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The inflow path, the curved flow path, and the discharge flow path may be formed to have the same cross-sectional area in the flow direction of the air.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Alternatively, the curved flow path may be formed to have a smaller cross-sectional area in the flow direction of the air than at least any one of the inflow path and the discharge flow path.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Moreover, the discharge flow path may be formed to have a larger cross-sectional area than the inflow path in the flow direction of the air.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The wing member may include a protrusion portion formed to protrude outwardly from a surface, a first flange portion formed to extend outwardly from the protrusion portion, a groove portion formed insertedly in the other surface and accommodating a protrusion portion of an adjacent wing member to form the gap, and a second flange portion continuing from the groove portion on the other surface and formed protruding to face a first flange portion of the adjacent wing member.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this case, the gap may include an inflow path formed by the first flange portion of the wing member and a second flange portion of the adjacent wing member, a curved flow path formed by the protrusion portion of the wing member and a groove portion of the adjacent wing member, and a discharge flow path connected to the curved flow path and formed by the wing member and the adjacent wing member to allow the flowing-in air to be discharged therethrough.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Herein, an outer circumferential surface of the first flange portion and an outer circumferential surface of the second flange portion may be formed curvedly to extend to each other in a streamlined shape and guide the air in a direction inclined with respect to the flow direction of the air flowing in the flow path.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With this structure, the air flowing along the outer circumferential surface of the first flange portion and the outer circumferential surface of the second flange portion may form eddies with air having collided with the wing member where the second flange portion is formed to minimize inflow of the air between the first flange portion and the second flange portion.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The wing member may include a support portion formed protruding from the first flange portion and contacting the second flange portion of the adjacent wing member to maintain the gap.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Herein, a plurality of support portions may be disposed separated in a width direction of the first flange portion and make a point-contact with an adjacent wing member.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Alternatively, the support portion may be formed continuously in the width direction of the first flange portion and make a line-contact with the adjacent wing member.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The air vent for a vehicle according to an embodiment of the present invention may further include a sealing portion manufactured of an elastic material and provided in a side end portion of the wing member to contact the adjacent wing member.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sealing portion may include an engagement portion engaged to the wing member, a protrusion portion formed protruding to be accommodated in a groove portion formed insertedly in the other surface of the adjacent wing member and thus to form the gap, and a first flange portion formed to extend outwardly from the protrusion portion and make a surface-contact with the second flange portion formed to protrude continuing from the groove portion on the other surface of the adjacent wing member.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The outer circumferential surface of the first flange portion and the outer circumferential surface of the second flange portion may be formed curvedly to continue with each other in a streamlined shape and guide the air in a direction inclined with respect to the flow direction of the air flowing in the flow path.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary
