More preferably, the present invention also refers to a composition comprising the 2-phenyl-6-(1H-imidazol-1-yl) quinazoline (CR4056) compound and at least one opioid for use in the prevention of opioid abuse and in the prevention of opioid-induced adverse events in a non-addicted subject.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Opioids are the most effective medications used for the management of pain, since they are potent analgesics. However, their use is hindered by several drawbacks that may have serious consequences.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The prototype opioid analgesics, such as morphine (but also e.g. codeine, dextromethorphan, dextropropoxyphene, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, levorphanol, meperidine, methadone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and their derivatives and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts), exert their pharmacological effects by engaging the endogenous opioid system, where they act as agonists at the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). The agonist action at MOR in specific brain areas is the responsible for both analgesia and the rewarding effects of opioids (Volkow N D. JAMA Psychiatry 2019; 76:208-16).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition and unfortunately, MORs are also located in other areas of the central and peripheral nervous system and interaction with their agonists induces adverse events. These may include gastrointestinal effects such as dry mouth, nausea, and especially constipation that may be severe and disabling, or central effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, somnolence, or sedation. Even more importantly, MORs are also located in brainstem areas that regulate breathing, where MOR agonists inhibit neuronal firing: this results in respiratory depression, which is the main cause of death from opioid overdose (Volkow N D. JAMA Psychiatry 2019; 76:208-16).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The analgesic and rewarding effects of opioids, but not all of the adverse effects above, are subject to tolerance: thus, patients require increasingly higher doses to obtain the same analgesic (or rewarding) effects, thereby increasing the risk of respiratory depression and fatal overdose.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The rewarding effects of opioids (such as e.g. euphoria), may cause opioid use disorders (OUDs), namely their misuse or abuse, that may trigger addiction and physical dependence.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For the purposes of contextualizing the present invention, it is important to understand the nature and general definition of misuse, abuse and related events (MAREs).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">They have been classified by a public-private partnership with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and their published definitions are the following (Smith S M et al. Pain 2013; 154:2287-96):<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">Misuse refers to the intentional therapeutic use of a drug in an inappropriate way, i.e. other than as prescribed. While there may be similarities to certain definitions of &#x201c;abuse&#x201d;, the term &#x201c;misuse&#x201d; excludes that of &#x201c;abuse&#x201d; when the term is restricted to &#x201c;therapeutic&#x201d; use;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">Abuse consists of any intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug or substance, even once, for the purposes of achieving a desirable psychological or physiological effect. Opioids are misused or abused for their analgesic effects or rewarding properties. The latter reflects their ability to increase the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and to increase dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (Volkow N D. JAMA Psychiatry 2019; 76:208-16).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">Misuse and especially abuse should be distinguished by other related events (MAREs), such as:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0013">Addiction, which is primarily defined as compulsive substance use that occurs despite personal harm or negative consequences (Smith S M et al. Pain 2013; 154:2287-96). Addiction involves molecular processes associated with learning, which consolidate automatic behaviours in response to the stimuli associated with the drug (Volkow N D. JAMA Psychiatry 2019; 76:208-16).</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0014">Dependence usually identifies physical dependence and consists of the manifestations of withdrawal symptoms due to rapid reduction in exposure to the drug when it is discontinued (or when the subject is exposed to an antagonist, e.g. naloxone in the case of opioids) (Smith S M et al. Pain 2013; 154:2287-96).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">It is essential to underline that physical dependence on opioids is distinct from addiction since they have a different definition and indeed reflect different neuroadaptation processes, but they are often confused in the common language (Volkow N D. JAMA Psychiatry 2019; 76:208-16). In addition, while addiction occurs in a smaller subset of opioid users, all patients treated with opioids will develop physical dependence, regardless of abuse.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">It is also important to note that some definitions of physical dependence include the development of tolerance (Smith S M et al. Pain 2013; 154:2287-96) as they probably reflect similar mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">Thus, from the foregoing it is essential to indicate that, while abuse depends on opioid rewarding properties due to increased dopaminergic activity, addiction or dependence (and possibly tolerance) are due to neuroadaptive processes: all these phenomena should be therefore clearly distinguished between them.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">Therefore, in summary, opioid abuse is one of the leading causes of increased use of opioids, which in turn triggers and favours addiction and accelerates the development of tolerance and dependence, thus leading to the use of higher doses to obtain the same rewarding effects and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Opioid abuse is therefore the ultimate responsible for the use of high doses of opioids, which increase the risk of respiratory depression and fatal overdose.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">Indeed, the so-called &#x201c;opioid crisis&#x201d; is currently one of the most urgent medical emergencies in the USA and worldwide (NIH. Opioid overdose crisis. https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis #five. Revised March 2018; Volkow N D and Collins F S. NEJM 2017,377:391-94):<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0020">Every day more than 115 people in the USA die from opioid overdose (mainly respiratory depression)</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0021">Misuse/abuse of opioid analgesics play a major role</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0022">In 2015 an estimated 2 million people in the USA suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioids</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0023">21% to 29% patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain misuse/abuse them</li>        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0024">About 80% heroin users, first misused/abused prescription opioids.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0025">This represents a real &#x201c;social scourge&#x201d;, as well as a medical problem, whose impact is devastating in the Western world (Manchikanti, Pain Physician. 2017; 20(Suppl. 2):S3-S92). Therefore, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched an aggressive effort to develop, among other measures, safe and effective strategies devoid of abuse liability, to manage chronic pain. The US FDA has acknowledged this necessity and, for example, produced a guidance for industry for the development of so-called &#x201c;abuse-deterrent opioid formulations&#x201d; (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). Abuse-Deterrent Opioids: Evaluation and Labeling-Guidance for Industry. April 2015). Indeed, when abused for their rewarding effects, prescription opioids even from oral formulations are frequently snorted or injected, which leads to faster uptake in the brain, enhancing their rewarding effects. A few abuse-deterrent formulations have been approved lately, but this does not yet solve the problem of avoiding opioid abuse. Conversely and for the first time, the present invention aims at providing a method which is capable of avoiding and thus of preventing opioid abuse in opioid non-addicted subjects. The 2-phenyl-6-(1H-imidazol-1-yl) quinazoline (CR4056) compound is known as a powerful imidazoline I2 receptor ligand endowed with analgesic properties. The analgesic activity of CR4056 per se has been described in numerous publications utilizing different experimental models.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0026">Previous art in the scientific literature describes that imidazoline I2 receptor agonists potentiate morphine-induced analgesia. Giordani et al. (WO2009/152868) have in fact demonstrated, in a rat experimental model of chronic inflammation induced by a subcutaneous injection in the paw of complete Freund adjuvant (CFA), that CR4056 enhanced synergistically the effect of a morphine low and sub-analgesic dose. This enhancing effect of opioid-induced analgesia is known for other 1-2 ligands (Li et al., European Journal of Pharmacology, 669(2011) 59-65) and it has been confirmed for CR4056 also in other studies, e.g. as published by Lanza et al. (British Journal of Pharmacology, 2014: 171 3693-3701) in a post-operative pain model in rats.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0027">I2 receptor agonists also prevent the development of tolerance to the analgesic effects of opioids (Boronat M A et al. Br J Pharmacol 1998, 125:175-85; Caprioli G et al. Eur J Pharmacol 2015,769:219-24). More extensively, David A Thorn et al (British Journal of Pharmacology, vol. 173, no. 8, (2016-01-18), pages 1363-1372) report the use of imidazolidine I2 receptor agonists on the development of tolerance to and behavioural/physical dependence on morphine in a combination used for the treatment of pain. Such a combination is described as capable to attenuate the development of tolerance to and behavioural/physical dependence on morphine. These effects described in previous art should not be confused with the prevention of opioid use disorders such as abuse which is the primary aim that the present invention intends to solve, since they represent completely different phenomena and mechanisms, as described in Smith S M et al. Pain 2013; 154:2287-96, and as summarized above. Indeed, tolerance and physical dependence probably derive from similar biological mechanisms and actually the definition of dependence may include the development of tolerance, beside the typical withdrawal symptoms on decrease of opioid blood levels or administration of an antagonist (Smith S M et al. Pain 2013; 154:2287-96). With respect to the effects of imidazoline 12 agonists, the prevention of tolerance is probably still related to opioid potentiation, i.e. a potentiated dose may be effective for longer periods of repeated administrations before the onset of tolerance, and the same mechanism may apply to the mitigation of withdrawal effects (i.e. a potentiated dose may be less sensitive to the decrease in blood levels or administration of an antagonist).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0028">As a matter of fact, Giordani et al (WO2009/152868) claimed the use of CR4056 to enhance opioid-induced analgesia and to treat physical dependence, i.e. the withdrawal symptoms from the administration of different substances (including opioids). In addition, they claimed the use of CR4056 as an antidepressant to avoid, among other medical uses as antidepressant, to fall back into episodes of abuse in previously addicted subjects.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0029">The inventors have evaluated the compound CR4056 in experimental animal models that are predictive of drug abuse in humans and more in particular of morphine or other opioids abuse, and they have discovered that CR4056 was capable to prevent opioid abuse in an opioid non-addicted subject. In addition, they have found that CR4056 was also capable to prevent opioid side effects, such as constipation and sedation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0030">It is worthy to point out that prior art uses are completely different than the use to prevent opioid-abuse in non-addicted subjects which is described in the present invention: the latter is counterintuitive and unexpected, compared with the uses claimed in WO2009/152868. Indeed, Giordani et al (WO2009/152868) even describe something which is opposite to what is described in the present invention, when they claim the use of CR4056 in the enhancement of the opioid pharmacological action in general: in fact, the present invention demonstrates that while opioid analgesia can be potentiated as reported in previous art, abuse liability is not potentiated and, conversely, can be prevented. This effect is surprising: since the mechanisms of opioid analgesia and opioid rewarding effects are the same, as described above (Volkow N D. JAMA Psychiatry 2019; 76:208-16), it would be expected that a compound that potentiates morphine-induced analgesia also potentiates morphine rewarding effects, thus favouring abuse, or not limiting it in case low doses of opioid are used but are potentiated to achieve full analgesic and thus possibly full rewarding effects.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0031">Surprisingly, the present invention thus shows how the administration of an opioid dose, thanks to the combination with CR4056, is able to remain free from phenomena of abuse on a group of subjects considered not-opioid-dependent, non-addicted patients.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0032">A fortiori, the invention is even more surprising when considering the opioid side effects, specifically constipation and sedation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0033">In fact, the present invention demonstrates that the combination of at least one opioid and the compound CR4056 allows to potentiate opioid analgesia, however it does not increase its side effects, specifically constipation and sedation. Therefore, from a medical point of view the objective of the present invention is a method to prevent opioid abuse in a non-addicted subject who receives opioids for the treatment of pain. This objective is achieved by the administration of the lowest possible dose of an opioid which is able to exert maximal analgesia thanks to potentiation by CR4056, but which is devoid of abuse liability and at the same time of typical opioid adverse effects such as constipation and sedation, since none of the latter is potentiated by CR4056 as demonstrated here for the first time.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0034">In the present invention, the inventors have therefore surprisingly found a method to prevent the abuse of opioid drugs in an opioid non-addicted subject and some opioid adverse effects, notwithstanding maximal analgesia and thus to be used preferably in the course of pain therapy.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0035">In a first aspect, the invention therefore concerns a compound of formula 2-phenyl-6-(1H-imidazol-1-yl) quinazoline (CR4056) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in the prevention of abuse of at least one opioid in an opioid non-addicted subject</p><p id="p-0028" num="0036">In the present invention when the term is indicated<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0037">&#x201c;opioid&#x201d; means a substance capable of acting as agonist at the mu-opioid receptors (MORs) and include e.g. morphine, codeine, dextromethorphan, dextropropoxyphene, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, levorphanol, meperidine, methadone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and their derivatives and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Opioids are also generally referred to as opioid drugs, or opiates;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0038">&#x201c;abuse&#x201d; means any non-therapeutic and intentional use of a drug or substance, in this case an opioid drug, to achieve a desirable physiological or psychological effect;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0039">&#x201c;non-addicted subject&#x201d; means a subject who is not addicted by use of an opioid. As above indicated, it is known in the art that imidazoline-2 (12) agonists are capable to potentiate opioid-induced analgesia, thus making sub-analgesic doses of an opioid fully analgesic. Therefore it was logically expected that other unwanted effects of opioids would also be potentiated, such as the rewarding effects leading to opioid abuse and the development of side effects such as opioid-induced constipation and/or sedation. Contrarily to what was expected the inventors surprisingly showed that, while enhancing the analgesic effects of low doses of opioid, the administration of 2-phenyl-6-(1H-imidazol-1-yl) quinazoline (CR4056) did not lead to opioid abuse nor to the development of constipation or sedation, thus preventing them.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0029" num="0040">Preferably, the prevention of abuse to an opioid consists in the co-administration of a dose, in this respect active, of CR4056 and a sub-analgesic dose of an opioid in an opioid non-addicted subject.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0041">According to another aspect, the invention therefore concerns a composition comprising a compound of formula 2-phenyl-6-(1H-imidazol-1-yl) quinazoline (CR4056) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and at least one opioid for use in the prevention of abuse of that opioid in an opioid non-addicted subject.

This test exploits the tendency of rats to associate the environment where they are located with the effect of drugs administered during a conditioning period. The experiment was done in a wooden apparatus consisting of two lateral chambers (30&#xd7;25 cm, length&#xd7;width) with different visual and tactile properties and a central &#x201c;neutral&#x201d; chamber, smaller than the others (12&#xd7;25 cm, length&#xd7;width) with total white floor and walls. The lateral chambers had different decoration of walls (points or stripes) and different type of floor (smooth or rough). These differences can be recognized by rats, and thus associated with the effect of drug or vehicle treatment. All walls were 38.5 cm high. Four days before the preconditioning phase, the light/dark cycle was inverted; all phases of experiments were performed during the dark phase. On the preconditioning day (day 1), Wistar rats (Charles River) were placed in the neutral chamber and for 15 min they were free to explore all the environments of the apparatus (van der Kam E. L. et al. Pain, 2008, 136:373-379). The time spent in each chamber was recorded with a video tracking software (Ethovision XT 13, Noldus information technology). Rats that spent over 60% of time in one of two lateral chambers were not admitted to the conditioning phase: for admitted animals, the &#x201c;preferred&#x201d; chamber was therefore the one where a rat spent between 50% and 60% of time during preconditioning (while the &#x201c;unpreferred&#x201d; chamber was the opposite one). After preconditioning, rats were randomly assigned to the experimental groups (n=16). A total of 256 rats were used in this model. During the 2 days of the conditioning phase rats were treated with the test drug(s) (day 2) or vehicle (day 3). On the first conditioning day rats were treated with the test drug(s) and were confined in the preconditioning unpreferred lateral chamber (now defined paired chamber), with no access to the other chambers of the apparatus for 40 min. On the second day of conditioning rats were treated with vehicle and were located in the opposite chamber (unpaired chamber). The control group received vehicle in both chambers. CR4056 or its vehicle were administered 40 min before conditioning, whereas morphine or its vehicle were administered immediately before conditioning. There was no treatment on the test day (day 4), when rats were placed in the neutral chamber with the possibility to explore all chambers of the apparatus. The time spent in each chamber was recorded. A significant difference between the mean time spent in the paired vs the unpaired chamber on the test day suggests the potential for a drug to induce preference (i.e. to induce a rewarding effect and thus to exert an abuse liability) (Mueller D. et al., Behavioural Brain Research 2002, 136:389-397).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0078">In this set of experiments, three doses of morphine were administered alone. Results are reported in Table 1 and show that morphine induced preference for the paired chamber in a dose dependent manner already after acute administration. Actually, 1 mg/kg of morphine did not induce preference while doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg induced a statistically significant difference of time spent by rats in the paired vs the unpaired chamber.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>&#x201c;Conditioned Place Preference&#x201d; (CPP): Effects of morphine,</entry></row><row><entry>CR4056, and their combination after single administration</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Seconds</entry><entry>Seconds in</entry><entry>Seconds in</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>in Paired</entry><entry>Neutral</entry><entry>Unpaired</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>chamber</entry><entry>chamber</entry><entry>chamber</entry><entry>&#x394;(P &#x2212;</entry><entry>%(P &#x2212;</entry></row><row><entry>Treatment</entry><entry>(P)</entry><entry>(N)</entry><entry>(U)</entry><entry>U) &#xb1; ES</entry><entry>U)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Saline</entry><entry>344</entry><entry>197</entry><entry>359</entry><entry>&#x2002;<sup>&#x2009;</sup>&#x2212;15.2 &#xb1; 9.3</entry><entry>&#x2212;2.3</entry></row><row><entry>Morphine</entry><entry>348</entry><entry>211</entry><entry>341</entry><entry>&#x2003;&#x2002;<sup>&#x2009;</sup>7.6 &#xb1; 9.4</entry><entry>1.2</entry></row><row><entry>(1 mg/Kg)</entry></row><row><entry>Morphine</entry><entry>411</entry><entry>198</entry><entry>291</entry><entry>120.5(*) &#xb1; 20.7</entry><entry>17.1</entry></row><row><entry>(2.5 mg/Kg)</entry></row><row><entry>Morphine</entry><entry>358</entry><entry>276</entry><entry>266</entry><entry>132.1(*) &#xb1; 26.5</entry><entry>20.2</entry></row><row><entry>(5 mg/Kg)</entry></row><row><entry>CR4056 (6</entry><entry>326</entry><entry>220</entry><entry>354</entry><entry><sup>&#x2003;</sup>&#x2212;5.6 &#xb1; 86</entry><entry>&#x2212;0.5</entry></row><row><entry>mg/kg) +</entry></row><row><entry>Saline</entry></row><row><entry>CR4056 (6</entry><entry>340</entry><entry>213</entry><entry>347</entry><entry>&#x2003;<sup>&#x2009;</sup>&#x2212;7.9 &#xb1; 9.9</entry><entry>&#x2212;1.1</entry></row><row><entry>mg/kg) +</entry></row><row><entry>Morphine</entry></row><row><entry>(1 mg/kg)</entry></row><row><entry>CR4056 (6</entry><entry>417</entry><entry>194</entry><entry>289</entry><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;<sup>&#x2009;&#x2009;</sup>128.1 &#xb1; 16.2(*)</entry><entry>18.1</entry></row><row><entry>mg/kg) +</entry></row><row><entry>Morphine</entry></row><row><entry>(5 mg/kg)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="left" id="FOO-00001">(*)Paired t-test &#x3c; 0.05</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0065" num="0079">The bottom half of Table 1 reports the effects of CR4056 and of the co-administration of morphine with CR4056.

A full analgesic dose of morphine (10 mg/kg subcutaneous) or codeine (12 mg/kg oral) were administered 15 minutes after CR4056 or vehicle.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0087">The results obtained are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the effect of the administration of CR4056 6 mg/kg on defecation in comparison to codeine 12 mg/kg and to the CR4056-codeine combination treatment. Codeine alone induced a significant decrease in defecation compared with vehicle or CR4056. The co-administration of a full analgesic dose of CR4056 did not worsen codeine-induced constipation and thus did not show a synergistic or additive modulation of this opioid adverse effect.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> Panel A shows the effect on defecation of full analgesic doses of morphine and CR4056, 10 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg, respectively. Morphine significantly reduced faecal count (P&#x3c;0.05 vs vehicle; Tukey's multiple comparisons test) and thus induced constipation. Under these experimental conditions, co-administration of CR4056 with morphine did not worsen opioid-induced constipation; rather there was a trend for improvement. Importantly, the low doses of CR4056 1 mg/kg and morphine 1 mg/kg that act synergistically in analgesia (see above), did not induce constipation when co-administered (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, Panel B).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0090">This set of experiments shows therefore that regardless of the dose administered, CR4056 did not worsen morphine or codeine-induced constipation. Most importantly, there was no constipation when the low doses of CR4056 and morphine were combined, despite the known synergistic analgesic effects described above.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 3</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0091">CR4056 does not Synergize with Opioids on Opioid-Induced Sedation</p><p id="p-0079" num="0092">To confirm that there is no synergism also for other typical adverse reactions to opioids, CR4056 was studied in rodent models of opioid-induced sedation.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0093">The so-called open field test was used as a first model and the experiments were performed according to the procedure described by Haleem and Nawaz (Pain, 2017, 18:19-28). Drugs were administered 60 min (CR4056 or its vehicle, p.o.) and 30 min (morphine or its vehicle, s.c.) before the open field test. The video tracking was performed using the software Ethovision XT 13 (Noldus Information Technology), to assess the &#x201c;distance travelled&#x201d; as the primary parameter of sedation in this model. The test was performed every day after 4 days of repeated treatment.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0094">The second model consisted of the rotarod performance test for the evaluation of the impairment of motor coordination as a sedation effect (Chuck T. L. et al. Life Sci, 2006, 79:154-161). The rotarod paradigm consists of a rotating cylinder suspended above the floor, on which rodents try to stay in order to avoid falling to the ground. The test had a duration of 2 days. On day 1 each rat did four trials on the rotarod apparatus (Rota-Rod/RS, Panlab, Spain) at a constant speed of 5 rpm during the first and second trials, and of 10 rpm during the third and fourth trials. For each trial, the time of endurance on rotarod (latency) was recorded and the mean value (2 min.) was used as the cut-off during the selection day. The rats that passed the selection (80%, while 20% had to be discarded), were randomly assigned to the experimental groups on day 2. The apparatus was set to acceleration mode: the speed of rotation increased from 0 to 40 rpm in 5 min that was the cut-off of the experiment. Four trials were performed during the test day: the first one immediately before treatment, and the following trials 15, 30 and 45 min after treatment. Sedation consisted in a worsening of performance.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0095">In addition, sedation was scored before each rotarod testing by the sedation rating scale. This scale consists of a panel of 8 parameters (ocular ptosis, head position, posture, muscle tone, spontaneous movements, exploration, righting reflex, corneal reflex) recorded by the operator after drug administration (Chuck T. L. et al. Life Sci, 2006, 79:154-161). At each time point, a score from 0 (maximum sedation) to 5 (absent sedation) was assigned to each of the 8 parameters. The sum of the scores produced the total score.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0096">Results of these experiments are reported in the figures that follow.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> reports the effect of morphine on locomotor activity in the open field test. The results showed a clear sedative effect of morphine at doses higher than 5 mg/kg. Lower doses of morphine were not sedative and, in line with literature data in rodents (Nestler E. J. et al. Semin. Neurosci. 1997, 9: 84-93), there was a modest sensitization in the range 1-2.5 mg/kg, as reflected by increased locomotor activity over the 4 days of repeated treatment.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0098">Notably, a low dose of 1 mg/kg CR4056 which is able to potentiate the analgesic effect of a low dose of morphine 1 mg/kg (see above) is not sedative per se and it is not able to potentiate this morphine low dose to exert a sedative effect (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows that CR4056 did not change the locomotor activity profile of non-sedative and sedative doses of morphine (2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg/kg in panels A, B, or C, respectively) at low or full analgesic doses (1 and 6 mg/kg, respectively). The results obtained from the sedation rating scale and rotarod test are reported in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> (panels A and B). A dose of 10 mg/kg morphine was clearly sedative in these models compared with controls, and was therefore used for the evaluation of possible synergistic interactions with CR4056. Low and high doses of CR4056 (1 and 6 mg/kg, respectively) did not further worsen but even tended to improve the performance of rats treated with 10 mg/kg morphine, with a significant difference in sedation scores at the higher dose of CR4056.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0100">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, there were no significant changes in performance vs. control rats when morphine was administered at a non-sedative dose of 1 mg/kg, alone or in combination with different doses of CR4056.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-15" num="01-15"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>15</b>.
