Therefore, the target value upper limit of the generator-side terminal voltage may be associated with the voltage of the DC bus in real time, and the target value upper limit of the generator-side terminal voltage can be dynamically changed with the change of the voltage of the DC bus.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Here, the generator-side terminal voltage is a terminal voltage of a generator whose output terminal is connected to the converter (i.e., the output terminal voltage of the generator). As an example, the generator-side terminal voltage may be a generator-side phase voltage or a generator-side line voltage.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Here, the target value of the generator-side terminal voltage is a control reference value of the generator-side terminal voltage, that is, a control target value of a field weakening voltage of the generator.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As an example, on the basis of the current voltage value of the DC bus of the converter, the target value upper limit of the generator-side terminal voltage may be determined further based on at least one of a preset maximum availability of a voltage of the DC bus, a voltage loss corresponding to a dead time of an IGBT module in a generator-side rectifier unit of the converter, and an on-state voltage drop of the IGBT module in the generator-side rectifier unit of the converter.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As an example, under a condition that the generator-side terminal voltage is the generator-side line voltage, and considering that the commonly used modulation technology of the converter is a space vector modulation (SVPWM) method, the maximum availability of the DC voltage is 1.1547 when this modulation method is adopted. The maximum line voltage value that can be modulated theoretically is shown in equation (1):</p><p id="p-0025" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>U</i><sub>linevoltage_max</sub><i>=U</i><sub>dc</sub>/&#x221a;{square root over (2)}&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">Wherein U<sub>linevoltage_max </sub>is the maximum value of the generator-side line voltage that can be modulated theoretically, and U<sub>dc </sub>is the voltage value of the DC bus.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">It can be seen from equation (1) that for the terminal voltage of the generator, the voltage of the DC bus limits its upper limit value. Therefore, under a condition that the DC voltage changes greatly, the corresponding upper limit value of the terminal voltage of the generator also changes. That is, if the voltage of the DC bus is greatly increased, the maximum voltage that can be output by the converter will also increase (at this time, using a fixed target value of the terminal voltage of the generator may result in low utilization of the DC voltage). If the voltage of the DC bus is greatly reduced, the maximum voltage that can be output by the converter will also decrease (at this time, using a fixed target value of the terminal voltage of the generator may result in overmodulation). Therefore, using a fixed target value of the terminal voltage of the generator cannot adapt to the change of the DC voltage, which brings the above problems.

For example, the current values under the same terminal voltage of the generator will be different. If a constant target value of the terminal voltage of the generator is used, it cannot adapt to the change of the operating state, and the goal of minimizing the current of the generator cannot be achieved, thereby reducing the efficiency of the system. Therefore, the present application takes the minimized generator-side current as the goal, and searches for the optimal target value of the terminal voltage of the generator, so as to improve the efficiency of the electrical transmission chain of the generator. Therefore, the calorific value of the generator and the converter during operation can be reduced, the working load of the cooling devices of the generator and the converter can be reduced, and the working life of the cooling devices can be increased.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0032">As an example, it can be determined whether the current generator-side terminal voltage belongs to a preset optimal search interval [U<sub>min</sub>, U<sub>max</sub>]; and under a condition that it is determined that the current generator-side terminal voltage belongs to the optimal search interval, the target value of the generator-side terminal voltage may be set to different values in the optimal search interval in sequence, so as to search for the target value of the generator-side terminal voltage that is able to minimize the generator-side current at present.
