Compared to prior generations of mobile and wireless networks, the 5G architecture is service based, meaning that wherever suitable, architecture elements are defined as network functions that offer their services to other network functions via common framework interfaces. In order to support this wide range of services and network functions across an ever-growing base of user equipment (UE), 5G networks have incorporated network slicing.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some scenarios, users may have their user devices connected to both a 5G network and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) simultaneously.

The features and advantages of the disclosure can be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features of the disclosure will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or can be learned by the practice of the principles set forth herein.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A method can include associating, by a wireless local area network (WLAN), a client device with the WLAN by assigning a WLAN identity to the client device. The client device can be subscribed to a 5G network. The method can further include authenticating, by the WLAN, the client device, and generating, by the WLAN, a subscription policy for the client device. The subscription policy can specify how to route messages, e.g. SMS messages, to the client device from the 5G network through the WLAN.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A system can include one or more processors and at least one computer-readable storage medium storing instructions which, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to associate, by a wireless local area network, a client device with the WLAN by assign a WLAN identity to the client device, authenticate, by the WLAN, the client device, and generate, by the WLAN, a subscription policy for the client device. The client device can be subscribed to a 5G network. The subscription policy specifies how to route to the client device from the 5G network through the WLAN.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored therein instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to associate, by a wireless local area network, a client device with the WLAN by assign a WLAN identity to the client device, authenticate, by the WLAN, the client device; and generate, by the WLAN, a subscription policy for the client device. The client device can be subscribed to a 5G network. The subscription policy specifies how to route to the client device from the 5G network through the WLAN.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">5G includes a new SMS Function (SMSF) where Access and Mobility Management Functions modules (AMF) anchor a user equipment (UE) session and register the UE's identity and anchor point with the SMSF. Specifically, messages received by the SMSF are delivered to the AMF, which in turn will deliver the messages to the UE over NAS interfaces. However, such delivery is possible only if the UE is within the range of the public mobile network operator (MNO).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">UE can be associated with an enterprise WLAN network and may not be within public MNO coverage. In such scenarios, the subscriber can fail to get SMS delivery sent to its Public mobile station international subscriber directory number (MSISDN). The subscriber is also unable to send SMS to any other cellular subscriber.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally, Private 5G networks may be deployed by enterprises. The deployment of Private 5G services can have coverage deficiencies within a desired physical coverage space of an enterprise. However, these enterprises can continue to have WLAN coverage in the desired physical coverage space of the enterprise, e.g. through other networks. Hence, there can be plenty of coverage holes where the UE is not within Private 5G coverage but has WLAN coverage. In such cases, it can be desirable to deliver SMS messages meant for a UE's Private 5G identity via a WLAN link using a WLAN identity. The UE may be attached to an enterprise Wi-Fi network, or to an OpenRoaming Wi-Fi hotspot, but it should be able to receive SMS messages sent to its public/private 5G identity.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The disclosed technology addresses the need in the art for delivering SMS messages destined for a 5G identity associated with a user device through a WLAN.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Moreover, the disclosed technology provides a mechanism to deliver SMS messages meant for UE's private or public 5G identity via WLAN link using WLAN identity. Further, using this mechanism, the delivery of SMS messages can happen over a plurality of end user devices. Another potential advantage of this mechanism is that SMS messages could be delivered to UE over WLAN OpenRoaming when MNO is used as an identity provider (IDP).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A description of network environments and architectures for network data access and services, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, and <b>2</b></figref> is first disclosed herein.

The fog computing architecture can be used to form part of a TCP connection or otherwise be accessed through the TCP connection.

The fog can thus extend the cloud <b>102</b> to be closer to the client endpoints <b>116</b>. The fog nodes <b>162</b> can be the physical implementation of fog networks. Moreover, the fog nodes <b>162</b> can provide local or regional services and/or connectivity to the client endpoints <b>116</b>. As a result, traffic and/or data can be offloaded from the cloud <b>102</b> to the fog layer <b>156</b> (e.g., via fog nodes <b>162</b>). The fog layer <b>156</b> can thus provide faster services and/or connectivity to the client endpoints <b>116</b>, with lower latency, as well as other advantages such as security benefits from keeping the data inside the local or regional network(s).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The fog nodes <b>162</b> can include any networked computing devices, such as servers, switches, routers, controllers, cameras, access points, gateways, etc. Moreover, the fog nodes <b>162</b> can be deployed anywhere with a network connection, such as a factory floor, a power pole, alongside a railway track, in a vehicle, on an oil rig, in an airport, on an aircraft, in a shopping center, in a hospital, in a park, in a parking garage, in a library, etc.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some configurations, one or more fog nodes <b>162</b> can be deployed within fog instances <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>.

In some embodiments, core network <b>230</b> is an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network, which combines aspects of the 5GC with existing 4G networks. Regardless of the particular design of core network <b>230</b>, the plurality of NFs typically execute in a control plane of core network <b>230</b>, providing a service based architecture in which a given NF allows any other authorized NFs to access its services. For example, a Session Management Function (SMF) controls session establishment, modification, release, etc., and in the course of doing so, provides other NFs with access to these constituent SMF services.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the plurality of NFs of core network <b>230</b> can include one or more Access and Mobility Management Functions (AMF; typically used when core network <b>230</b> is a 5GC network) and Mobility Management Entities (MME; typically used when core network <b>230</b> is an EPC network), collectively referred to herein as an AMF/MME for purposes of simplicity and clarity. In some embodiments, an AMF/MME can be common to or otherwise shared by multiple slices of the plurality of network slices <b>252</b>, and in some embodiments an AMF/MME can be unique to a single one of the plurality of network slices <b>252</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The same is true of the remaining NFs of core network <b>230</b>, which can be shared amongst one or more network slices or provided as a unique instance specific to a single one of the plurality of network slices <b>252</b>.

Various other NFs can be provided without departing from the scope of the present disclosure, as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Across these four domains of the 5G network environment <b>200</b>, an overall operator network domain <b>250</b> is defined. The operator network domain <b>250</b> is in some embodiments a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), and can be thought of as the carrier or business entity that provides cellular service to the end users in UE domain <b>210</b>. Within the operator network domain <b>250</b>, a plurality of network slices <b>252</b> are created, defined, or otherwise provisioned in order to deliver a desired set of defined features and functionalities, e.g. SaaSs, for a certain use case or corresponding to other requirements or specifications. Note that network slicing for the plurality of network slices <b>252</b> is implemented in end-to-end fashion, spanning multiple disparate technical and administrative domains, including management and orchestration planes (not shown). In other words, network slicing is performed from at least the enterprise or subscriber edge at UE domain <b>210</b>, through the Radio Access Network (RAN) <b>120</b>, through the 5G access edge and the 5G core network <b>230</b>, and to the data network <b>240</b>. Moreover, note that this network slicing may span multiple different 5G providers.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, as shown here, the plurality of network slices <b>252</b> include Slice <b>1</b>, which corresponds to smartphone subscribers of the 5G provider who also operates network domain, and Slice <b>2</b>, which corresponds to smartphone subscribers of a virtual 5G provider leasing capacity from the actual operator of network domain <b>250</b>. Also shown is Slice <b>3</b>, which can be provided for a fleet of connected vehicles, and Slice <b>4</b>, which can be provided for an IoT goods or container tracking system across a factory network or supply chain. Note that these network slices <b>252</b> are provided for purposes of illustration, and in accordance with the present disclosure, and the operator network domain <b>250</b> can implement any number of network slices as needed, and can implement these network slices for purposes, use cases, or subsets of users and user equipment in addition to those listed above. Specifically, the operator network domain <b>250</b> can implement any number of network slices for provisioning SaaSs from SaaS providers to one or more enterprises.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">5G mobile and wireless networks will provide enhanced mobile broadband communications and are intended to deliver a wider range of services and applications as compared to all prior generation mobile and wireless networks. Compared to prior generations of mobile and wireless networks, the 5G architecture is service based, meaning that wherever suitable, architecture elements are defined as network functions that offer their services to other network functions via common framework interfaces. In order to support this wide range of services and network functions across an ever-growing base of user equipment (UE), 5G networks incorporate the network slicing concept utilized in previous generation architectures.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Within the scope of the 5G mobile and wireless network architecture, a network slice comprises a set of defined features and functionalities that together form a complete Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) for providing services to UEs. This network slicing permits for the controlled composition of a PLMN with the specific network functions and provided services that are required for a specific usage scenario. In other words, network slicing enables a 5G network operator to deploy multiple, independent PLMNs where each is customized by instantiating only those features, capabilities and services required to satisfy a given subset of the UEs or a related business customer needs.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In particular, network slicing is expected to play a critical role in 5G networks because of the multitude of use cases and new services 5G is capable of supporting. Network service provisioning through network slices is typically initiated when an enterprise requests network slices when registering with AMF/MME for a 5G network. At the time of registration, the enterprise will typically ask the AMF/MME for characteristics of network slices, such as slice bandwidth, slice latency, processing power, and slice resiliency associated with the network slices. These network slice characteristics can be used in ensuring that assigned network slices are capable of actually provisioning specific services, e.g. based on requirements of the services, to the enterprise.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Associating SaaSs and SaaS providers with network slices used to provide the SaaSs to enterprises can facilitate efficient management of SaaS provisioning to the enterprises. Specifically, it is desirable for an enterprise/subscriber to associate already procured SaaSs and SaaS providers with network slices actually being used to provision the SaaSs to the enterprise. However, associating SaaSs and SaaS providers with network slices is extremely difficult to achieve without federation across enterprises, network service providers, e.g. 5G service providers, and SaaS providers.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example environment <b>300</b> having a UE <b>330</b> in communication with a 5G network <b>310</b> and an enterprise WLAN <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">5G network <b>310</b> can be a public 5G network, such as a 5G network owned by a mobile network operator (MNO). 5G network <b>310</b> can include a SMS Function (SMSF) <b>312</b> and a Data Network&#x2014;Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (DN-AAA) server <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">SMSF <b>312</b> enables SMS over Non-Access Stratum (NAS) by providing SMS management subscription data checking and conducting SMS delivery accordingly.
