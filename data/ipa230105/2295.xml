Starting from alkanes, and methane in particular, it is feasible to obtain the corresponding alkyl halide, for example, methyl halide. Alkyl halide can be then transformed into olefins. By adjusting the reaction conditions and employing a specific catalyst, the ratios of these various olefins may be modified, leading to the obtaining of the desired effluents, that can be then separated by known technology. The process for converting one or more alkyl halides into olefins, namely the second step of the two-step process for producing olefins from alkanes, has already been thoroughly studied.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In US 2016/0347681, 10-membered ring-containing HZMS-5 zeolite having a silica-to-alumina ratio (SAR) comprised between 25 and 500 allows for converting methyl chloride at 350&#xb0; C. with selectivity to ethylene and propylene of 38.2% and with a conversion of 35.1 after 20 hours on stream. When HZMS-5 was ion-exchanged to MgZMS-5, the conversion was increased to 99.8% but the selectivity dropped to 25.9%. A significant amount of C4 olefins was formed in both cases. In US 2016/0200642, HZMS-5 zeolite presenting a SAR of 1192 has been used. After 20 hours on stream, the selectivity to ethylene and propylene was increased to 66.7%, while the selectivity to C4 olefins reaches 21.7% and to C5+ olefins reaches 7.4%. Under these conditions, no aromatics were generated.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In US 2016/0347682, a crystalline zeolite catalyst having an STI framework topology, such as SSZ-75, was used for the conversion of an alkyl halide to olefins. In some aspects, this catalyst has shown, under reaction temperature ranging between 300&#xb0; C. and 500&#xb0; C., a selectivity to ethylene and propylene ranging from 70% to 90%. Besides the light olefins, the reaction produces by-products such as methane, C4-C5 olefins and BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">US 2008/0188701 describes the use of a silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve catalyst, which comprises 50 wt. % of SAPO-34 molecular sieve as active component and 50 wt. % of alumina as a matrix. At a temperature of 450&#xb0; C., methyl chloride, diluted with methanol in a ratio methanol/methyl chloride of 0.1:1, was converted in a fixed bed reactor with 2 grams of catalyst at 77.89% and afforded a selectivity to ethylene and propylene of 84.35% after 1 hour. Formation of C4 olefins amounts to 10.47%. However, when the reaction was conducted into a fluidized bed reactor with 75 grams of a catalyst prepared by the spray drying process, the conversion decreases to 72.78%, but the selectivity to ethylene and propylene increases to 87.59%. Formation of C4 olefins diminishes to 7.99%.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In US 2017/0057886, an aluminosilicate zeolite catalyst, i.e. a chabazite zeolite of the SSZ-13 type having relatively small pore diameter which inhibits the molecule larger than those bearing four carbon atoms to exit its framework, has been used in the olefin production from methyl halide. It is described that in particular aspects, the combined maximum selectivity of ethylene, propylene and butylene is at least 85%. The selectivity in C4 alkenes ranges between 0% and 15% and the selectivity in aromatic compounds or C2-C4 alkanes is less than 0.1%. In one instance, at a temperature of 450&#xb0; C., the selectivity to ethylene and propylene was reported to be of 73.64% at a conversion of 99.65%. However, after less than 1.5 hours on stream, the catalyst gets deactivated, dropping the conversion to less than 20% after 3 hours on stream.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In WO 2016/099775, the methyl chloride transformation into olefins was studied with a SAPO zeolite catalyst. After 20 h on stream, a conversion of 34.5% was achieved and a selectivity to ethylene and propylene of 90.7% was observed. 5.0% of C4 olefins was generated.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is admitted that any unreacted alkyl halide can be recycled and reintroduced in the alkyl halide feed to further maximize the overall conversion of alkyl halides to olefins. It is also admitted that separation steps have also to be considered for removing C4+ olefins to transform them into ethylene and propylene in additional processes. These considerations have resulted in the establishment of integrated processes to produce ethylene and propylene from alkyl halide.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In US 2010/0087686, an integrated process for producing aromatic hydrocarbons, ethylene and/or propylene from methane is described. Methane is first transformed in methyl bromide which is, in a second step, converted into higher molecular hydrocarbons. Using a coupling catalyst, for instance, zeolite with a dopant (i.e. manganese), an effluent comprising 32% of aromatics (i.e. benzene, toluene and xylenes) and thus only 68% of C2-C5 alkanes, with a minor amount of C2-C5 alkenes, methane and hydrogen bromide, is produced. The zeolite catalyst is described as being gradually deactivated by the formation of coke. Distillation steps are carried out to separate the aromatics and the C2-C5 alkanes (with also methane, hydrogen bromide and a minor concentration of C2-C5 alkenes). The aromatics are further processed to produce benzene and p-xylene, which are separated. The stream containing the C2-C5 linear alkanes (and a minor amount of C2-C5 alkenes) is first purified to remove hydrogen bromide and methane before being cracked to produce pure ethylene and pure propylene after a final separation step. Nevertheless, the important number of aromatics produced, 32%, reduces considerably the efficiency of the further treatments (numerous separation steps before and after the cracking step itself). Indeed, each of the further steps is susceptible to reduce the overall yield in ethylene and propylene.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Starting from an alkyl halide and wishing to obtain ethylene and propylene is thus not straightforward. In processes converting alkyl halide into olefins, a large amount of by-products (notably aromatics and coke) is formed, reducing thus the number of side products that need to undertake an additional step, for instance, a pre-conversion of the alkyl halide at a lower temperature to the olefinic hydrocarbons stream before the cracking step. One should also mention that this cracking step is typically performed at high temperature (&#x3e;500&#xb0; C.), which may lead to a partial thermal disproportionation of the alkyl halide to alkyl di-halide and CH<sub>4</sub>. As a consequence, the formed alkyl di-halide transforms to heavy aromatics and may cause reactor plugging. The facility to form alkyl halide increases in the series F&#x3c;Cl&#x3c;Br&#x3c;I. starting from Br, the direct processing of the alky halide is practically impossible and required a pre-conversion step. However, if the alkyl halide (CH<sub>3</sub>Br) is present in a mixture with olefins, the formation of coke is mitigated and the carbon from CH<sub>3</sub>Br is substantially incorporated in the olefins pool. This means that the CH<sub>3</sub>Br should be pre-converted partially or fully to hydrocarbons at low temperature or subjected to high-temperature conversion zone only in the presence of heavier hydrocarbons.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure has thus the objective of increasing the amount of the intermediate products in a process involving at least one step of cracking for the conversion of one or more alkyl halides into ethylene and propylene.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a first aspect, the disclosure provides a process for converting one or more alkyl halides to ethylene and propylene, said process comprising the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">a) providing a feedstream comprising one or more alkyl halides; optionally, diluted in at least one diluent;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0014">b) providing a first catalyst composition and a second catalyst composition, said second catalyst composition comprising a cracking catalyst;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0015">c) contacting said feedstream with said first catalyst composition in a first reaction zone under first reaction conditions to provide a first product stream; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0016">d) subjecting at least a part of said first product stream to an Olefin Catalytic Cracking (OCC) with said second catalyst composition in a second reaction zone under second reaction conditions to provide a second product steam,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">the process is remarkable in that it further comprises a step of steaming said first catalyst composition before the step (c), and in that said first catalyst composition comprises one or more zeolites and a binder, wherein said one or more zeolites comprise at least one 10-membered ring channel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">With preference, step (d) comprises subjecting said first product stream in totality, without conducting a separation step, to an Olefin Catalytic Cracking (OCC) with said second catalyst composition in a second reaction zone under second reaction conditions to provide a second product steam.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">The first and second catalyst compositions can be the same or different.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">Surprisingly, it has been found that both a high selectivity to acyclic C3-C6 olefins and a high conversion can be achieved with the use of a first catalyst composition wherein at least one zeolite has a structure shaped with a binder.

Indeed, as demonstrated in the examples, a selectivity of at least 70% for the acyclic C3-C6 olefins can be achieved together with a conversion rate of the one or more alkyl halides of at least 20%. In addition, as demonstrated in the examples, a selectivity of at least 75% for the acyclic C3-C6 olefins can be achieved together with selectivity to ethylene of less than 5%, preferably less than 1% and with selectivity to aromatics of less than 15%, preferably less than 11%.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">In a preferred embodiment, said one or more zeolites of the first catalyst composition contain less than 1000 wt. ppm of alkali metals as determined by XRF based on the total weight of the one or more zeolites and/or less than 5000 wt. ppm of transition metals as determined by XRF based on the total weight of the one or more zeolites.

Therefore, the removal of a large fraction of Al from the lattice leads to rearrangements of Si-T (tetrahedron) atoms and hence to the generation of large voids in the structure.

It is generally known by the persons in the art that steam treatment of zeolites results in aluminium that leaves the zeolite framework and resides as aluminiumoxides in and outside the pores of the zeolite. This transformation is known as the dealumination of zeolites. The treatment of the steamed zeolite with an acid solution results in the dissolution of the extra-framework aluminiumoxides. This transformation is known as leaching. Then the zeolite is separated, advantageously by filtration, and optionally washed. A drying step can be envisaged between the filtering and washing steps. The solution after the washing can be either separated, by way of example, by filtering from the solid or evaporated. The residual phosphorus-content is adjusted by the phosphorus concentration in the leaching solution, drying conditions, and washing procedure if any. This procedure leads to dealumination of zeolites and retention of phosphorus. Advantageously, at least 0.1 wt. % and up to 7.0 wt. % of phosphorus is retained after dealumination on zeolite. Both factors dealumination and the retention of phosphorus stabilize the lattice aluminium in the zeolitic lattice, thus avoiding further dealumination. This leads to higher hydrothermal stability, tuning of molecular sieves properties and adjustment of acid properties. The degree of dealumination can be adjusted by the steaming and leaching conditions.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0185">The preferred techniques suitable for the modification by phosphorous are impregnation and chemical vapour deposition.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0186">These techniques imply a minimum waste to treat and allow maintaining substantially all phosphorus on the catalyst.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0187">In an embodiment, the phosphorus is introduced by a treatment of the catalyst in a solution containing a source of phosphorus at a temperature ranging between 25 and 100&#xb0; C. for 0.1-96 h followed by filtering or evaporation.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0188">In a preferred embodiment, the incipient wetness (IW) impregnation techniques are used. In these IW impregnation techniques, the phosphorus is introduced via impregnation using a limited amount of liquid water which is subjected to contact with the catalyst. This method is also known as dry impregnation.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0189">Incipient wetness (IW) or incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) is a commonly used technique for the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts. Typically, the precursor (phosphorus-containing compounds) is dissolved in an aqueous or organic solution. The volume of solution, which is used for dissolution of the precursor, is substantially the same as the pore volume of catalyst precursor containing both binder and zeolite. Then the precursor-containing solution is added to a catalyst precursor. Capillary action draws the solution into the pores.

The low boiling point fraction <b>19</b> is redirected through a separation unit <b>11</b>, which allows for the separation of the stream <b>13</b> comprising essentially ethylene and propylene and which can be the same or different of the first one, preferably it is the same. In this implementation, the C4-C7 compounds of the low boiling point fraction <b>19</b> can also be recycled. Alternatively yet, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the first product stream <b>5</b> is directed in a separation unit <b>11</b>, to afford a C4+ stream <b>15</b> which is then directed through an additional separation unit <b>17</b>, preferably a deoctanizer. This allows for removing a high boiling point fraction <b>21</b>, preferably comprising C8+ compounds, that can be valorised as fuel, and to allow the low boiling point fraction <b>19</b>, comprising essentially C4-C7 compounds, to go through the second reaction zone <b>7</b> to be subjected to the cracking step. The second product stream <b>9</b> generated from said second reaction zone <b>7</b>, which comprises essentially ethylene and propylene, but also C4+ compounds, is then redirected to a separation unit <b>11</b> which allows for the separation of the stream <b>13</b> comprising essentially ethylene and propylene and which can be the same or different of the first one, preferably it is the same. With this configuration, the C4+ compounds are thus separated from the second product stream <b>9</b> and can be recycled.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0260">Test and Determination Methods</p><p id="p-0186"

Desorption (TPD) is the method of observing desorbed molecules from a surface when the surface temperature is increased. It has been performed by following the heating sequences I, and Ill shows on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, respectively corresponding to activation, saturation and analysis. In brief, in the first step (marked as I on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), starting from room temperature (25&#xb0; C.) under a flow of helium (rate 50 cc/min), the temperature has been gradually increased to 600&#xb0; C. at a rate of 20&#xb0; C./min. After 1 hour at 600&#xb0; C., the zeolite sample is considered as being activated and the temperature is then gradually decreased to 100&#xb0; C. at a rate of 10&#xb0; C./min. Then, in the second step (marked as II on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) during 3 hours, the temperature is maintained at 100&#xb0; C. and in the first 1 hour, 10% of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) is added to the helium flow (which is decreased to 30 cc/min). The surface of the zeolite is thus saturated with the molecules of ammonia that are going to be adsorbed onto the surface. The last 2 hours of the temperature threshold at 100&#xb0; C., the initial flow of helium is reinstated. Then, in the third step (marked as Ill in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) the temperature is increased again to 600&#xb0; C. at a rate of 10&#xb0; C./min to desorb the ammonia. The sample is maintained at 600&#xb0; C. for an additional one hour. It is highlighted that the skilled person could use different parameters (time, temperature, flow rate, carrier gas) to perform the method. The measurement of the amount of ammonia using a thermal conductivity detector allows to recognize the different adsorption conditions of the ammonia onto the zeolite and allows for obtaining a description of the surface of the zeolite, such as the number of acid sites.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0273">For the measurement of the amount of ammonia in the zeolite sample, the sample is dried, corrected to loss of ignition at 200&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0274">In order to determine the Si/Al molar ratio of the zeolites sample by NH<sub>3</sub>-TPD method, the measurement of the amount of aluminium in the framework is based on the assumption that one NH<sub>3 </sub>molecule interacts with one Br&#xf8;nsted or Lewis acid site. As the sample of zeolite is saturated at 100&#xb0; C. with dry NH<sub>3</sub>, all kind of physisorption (physical sorption on sites non-linked with Al in the framework) is avoided to limit the polydentate interactions (interaction of the acid sites with several molecules of ammonia). Subsequently, only the strongly adsorbed NH<sub>3 </sub>molecules on the acid sites are quantified. This means that by the measurement of the amount of the strongly adsorbed NH<sub>3 </sub>in TPD, it is possible to obtain the amount of the acid sites linked with Al in the framework of zeolite. In general, one atom of aluminum in the framework of zeolite generates one acid site. The number of moles (n) of NH<sub>3 </sub>consumed thus corresponds to the amount of Al atoms, as determined by the following equation:</p><p id="p-0205" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>n</i>(<i>Al</i><sub>2</sub><i>O</i><sub>3</sub>)=<i>n</i>(<i>NH</i><sub>3</sub>)/2 [mol].<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0206" num="0275">The rest would correspond to SiO<sub>2</sub>, as calculated according to the following equation when the mass of the dried zeolite sample is 1 g:</p><p id="p-0207" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>n</i>(<i>SiO</i><sub>2</sub>)=(1 [g]&#x2212;<i>Mr</i>(<i>Al</i><sub>2</sub><i>O</i><sub>3</sub>)*<i>n</i>(<i>NH</i><sub>3</sub>)/2)/<i>Mr</i>(<i>SiO</i><sub>2</sub>), <i>Mr </i>standing for molecular mass.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0208" num="0276">Gas chromatography experiments were carried out to determine quantitatively the selectivity of the reaction.
