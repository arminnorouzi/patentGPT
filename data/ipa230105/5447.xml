In this case, the display control unit <b>2080</b> needs to recognize an address (a MAC address or the like) of a destination as identification information of the display apparatus <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Regarding the display apparatus <b>30</b> detected from the target image <b>10</b>, methods of determining identification information thereof are varied. For example, information (hereinafter, display placement information) indicating identification information and a placement position of each of the display apparatuses <b>30</b> is stored in a storage apparatus in advance, and the identification information of each of the display apparatuses <b>30</b> is determined by utilizing the information.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">As a more specific example, it is assumed that, for each exhibition shelf, a camera that captures the exhibition shelf is prepared. In this case, in association with identification information of a camera, display placement information of each of the display apparatuses <b>30</b> placed on an exhibition shelf to be captured by the camera is stored in a storage apparatus in advance. The display control unit <b>2080</b> determines identification information of a camera generating the target image <b>10</b> acquired by the first acquisition unit <b>2020</b>, and acquires display placement information being associated with the identification information. The display control unit <b>2080</b> determines display placement information being associated with each of the display apparatuses <b>30</b> included in the target image <b>10</b>, by comparing a position of each of the display apparatuses <b>30</b> within the target image <b>10</b> with a placement position of the display apparatus <b>30</b> indicated by each piece of the acquired display placement information. Thereby, identification information of each of the display apparatuses <b>30</b> included in the target image <b>10</b> is determined.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Note that, a camera may be configured in such a way that a field angle thereof can be changed (e.g., a PTZ camera). In this case, the display control unit <b>2080</b> can recognize a capture range (i.e., which part of an exhibition shelf is included in the target image <b>10</b>) of the camera at a timing when the target image <b>10</b> is generated, by using the target image <b>10</b>, and a camera parameter (a pan value, a tilt value, a zoom value, and the like) when the target image <b>10</b> is captured. The display control unit <b>2080</b> determines identification information of each of the display apparatuses <b>30</b> included in the target image <b>10</b>, by utilizing display placement information and a capture range of a camera determined by utilizing a camera parameter.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Additionally, for example, each of the display apparatuses <b>30</b> may be provided with a function of displaying own identification information. In this case, the display control apparatus <b>2000</b> acquires the target image <b>10</b> capturing each of the display apparatuses <b>30</b> in a state where identification information is displayed, performs an image analysis of the target image <b>10</b>, and thereby determines the identification information displayed on each of the display apparatuses <b>30</b>. Thereby, the display control apparatus <b>2000</b> can recognize identification information of each of the display apparatuses <b>30</b> included in the target image <b>10</b>. Note that, for example, a technique disclosed in Patent Document 2 can be utilized for a technique of &#x201c;causing a display apparatus to display identification information, analyzing an image including the display apparatus, and thereby recognizing identification information of the display apparatus&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Some or all of the above-described example embodiments can also be described as, but are not limited to, the following supplementary notes.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">1.
