For example, one or more of x-ray inspection, eddy current inspection, or acoustic (e.g., ultrasonic) inspection can be used to obtain data for imaging of features on or within a test specimen. For example, acoustic imaging can be performed using an array of ultrasound transducer elements, such as to image a region of interest within a test specimen. Different imaging modes can be used to present received acoustic signals that have been scattered or reflected by structures on or within the test specimen.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Acoustic testing, such as ultrasound-based inspection, can include focusing or beam-forming techniques to aid in construction of data plots or images representing a region of interest within the test specimen. Use of an array of ultrasound transducer elements can include use of a phased-array beamforming approach and can be referred to as Phased Array Ultrasound Testing (PAUT). For example, a delay-and-sum beamforming technique can be used such as including coherently summing time-domain representations of received acoustic signals from respective transducer elements or apertures. In another approach, a Total Focusing Method (TFM) technique can be used where one or more elements in an array (or apertures defined by such elements) are used to transmit an acoustic pulse and other elements are used to receive scattered or reflected acoustic energy, and a matrix is constructed of time-series (e.g., A-Scan) representations corresponding to a sequence of transmit-receive cycles in which the transmissions are occurring from different elements (or corresponding apertures) in the array. Such an approach where A-scan data is obtained for each element in an array (or each defined aperture) can be referred to as a &#x201c;full matrix capture&#x201d; (FMC) technique.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Capturing time-series A-scan data either for PAUT or TFM beamforming applications can involve generating considerable volumes of data. For example, digitization of A-scan time-series data can be performed locally by a test instrument having an analog-front-end and analog-to-digital converter physically cabled to a transducer probe assembly. A corresponding digitized amplitude resolution (e.g., 8-bit or 12-bit resolution) and time resolution (e.g., corresponding to a sample rate in excess of tens or hundreds of megasamples per second) can result in gigabits of time-series data for each received A-scan record for later processing, particularly if such A-scan records are stored as full-bandwidth and full-resolution analytic representations. Accordingly, the present inventors have recognized, among other things, that a compression technique can be used for processing or storage of acquired acoustic inspection data. For example, data indicative of peak values of an A-scan time-series can be stored to provide a compressed representation of such time-series data. A representation of the original A-scan data can be reconstructed, such as using the data indicative of the peak values, and a digital filter. Such an approach can dramatically reduce a volume of data associated an acoustic acquisition, such as a Full Matrix Capture (FMC) acquisition to be used for Total Focusing Method (TFM) beamforming and related imaging.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an example, a machine-implemented method for processing compressed acoustic inspection data can include receiving digital representations of peak locations in acquired acoustic echo data corresponding to respective received acoustic echo signals, the respective received acoustic echo signals corresponding to transducer apertures of a multi-element electroacoustic transducer array used for an acoustic inspection operation, reconstructing time-series representations of respective received acoustic echo signals including up-sampling the digital representations of the peak locations and applying a time-domain interpolation filter, and processing the time-series representations of the respective received acoustic echo signals to generate a visual representation of a result of the acoustic inspection operation. Generally, the digital representations of the peak locations comprise a lesser volume of data than the reconstructed time-series representations.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an example, a system for processing compressed acoustic inspection data can include a first processing facility comprising at least one first processor circuit and at least one first memory circuit, along with a first communication circuit communicatively coupled with the first processing facility.

The coupling medium can include a fluid or gel or a solid membrane (e.g., an elastomer or other polymer material), or a combination of fluid, gel, or solid structures.

Another challenge can be that a data transfer rate between the probe, acquisition support circuitry, and analysis facilities, is generally limited, potentially reducing scan productivity. The techniques herein can be used to reduce a volume of a data set associated with acoustic inspection, facilitating archival or remote analysis. The techniques herein are applicable, for example, to full-matrix capture (FMC), where elementary (e.g., element-by-element or aperture-by-aperture) acoustic data is acquired and can be used to produce virtually any acoustic focusing configuration through further processing.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In generally-available non-destructive test (NDT) instruments, FMC data is used to compute an acoustic image contemporaneously and then such contemporaneously generated imaging may not be saved, nor is the underlying elementary acoustic data. In the present subject matter, data can be saved in compressed form for use in reconstructing a representation of the originally acquired acoustic echo signals (e.g., elementary A-scan representations) using a filter (e.g., a digital filter). Examples of techniques (such as software or firmware implemented methods), are discussed below. As an illustrative example, some or all computation (e.g., compression or decompression) could be performed using a digital signal processor (DSP) or field-programmable gate array (FPGA) such as during acquisition, or thereafter.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows an illustrative example of an acquired acoustic echo signal <b>224</b> (e.g., representative of an acquired A-scan echo signal). The acquired acoustic echo signal <b>224</b> can be one signal amongst many such acquired signals related to an acoustic inspection operation. Such signals can be analyzed, such as used for PAUT or TFM beamforming and related imaging. Generally, due to a volume of acoustic echo signal associated with an acquisition operation, imaging performed using PAUT or TFM may not include saving all the underlying acoustic echo data (or even any of the data). When such data is saved for further analysis or archival purposes, it can occupy a significant storage volume or consume significant resources in terms of network bandwidth. The present inventors have recognized, among other things, that compression of such acquired acoustic echo data facilitates storage, on-line or off-line analysis, and archival, providing enhanced traceability and analysis support.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Generally, a peak encoding technique can be used to perform encoding for storage or transmission (such as to provide a &#x201c;compressed&#x201d; representation of the acoustic echo signal <b>224</b>). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows an illustrative example of identification of positive-going peak locations <b>226</b>A in the acquired acoustic echo signal <b>224</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows yet another illustrative example of identification of positive-going peak locations and negative-going peak locations <b>226</b>B in the acquired acoustic echo signal <b>224</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Generally, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, detection of peaks can include identifying either positive and negative-going ([+] and [&#x2212;]) or only positive or negative-going peaks ([+] or [&#x2212;]). Detecting only ([+] or [&#x2212;]) peaks as shown illustratively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> allows for a greater degree of compression, but with a potentially greater degree of mismatch between the originally acquired acoustic echo signal <b>224</b> and a reconstructed representation. By contrast, detecting both ([+] and [&#x2212;]) peaks, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, allows for better signal reconstruction (e.g., interpolation), but with a lesser degree of data compression.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Encoding of the detected peaks can include storage in a form where the digital representations of peak locations in acquired acoustic echo data encode a temporal location of respective peaks and amplitudes of respective peaks. For example, temporal locations of the respective peaks can be encoded as a temporal offset from an adjacent peak location (rather than in terms of some absolute time reference). The temporal offset can be in terms of a count of samples.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As an illustration, a series of peaks can be encoded, streamed, or stored in a form as follows: [Peak Time Step][Peak Amp][Peak Time Step][Peak Amp], and so on. As a numerical example, a stream of encoded data can be provided as follows: [Peak Step][Peak Amp][Peak Time Step][Peak Amp] . . . =[16][241][16][45][26][220] . . . , and a count of bits for encoding &#x2018;Peak Step&#x2019;=ceil(log 2(max([Peak Time Step]))). The respective [Peak Time Step] values can correspond to a count of samples between a prior peak and a present peak or another relative indication of temporal position. Such an approach allows temporal positions of peaks to be saved using a reduced count of bits (between 3 and 6 bits, as an illustrative example) versus a timestamp. Generally, a data structure and related memory allocation (e.g., bit depth) for time step encoding may depend on a center acoustic frequency of a probe used (e.g., given a specified sampling rate and A-Scan record length (e.g., echo signal time-series duration). Generally, a lower-bandwidth probe or a probe operating at a lower center frequency produces less high-frequency information (and corresponding peaks) than a higher-bandwidth probe or a probe otherwise operating a higher center frequency. The amplitude can be encoded in 12 bits, as an illustrative example.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a comparison between the originally acquired acoustic echo signal <b>224</b> (e.g., the A-scan) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, identified positive-going peak locations and negative-going peak locations <b>226</b>B, and a reconstructed time-series representation <b>328</b> generated using a linear interpolation filter.

For the latter, an optimized FIR filter coefficient set could be encoded at the end of the coded A-scan record (or elsewhere in a record associated with the compressed A-scan representation). The Gabor filter profile is merely illustrative of one wavelet filter example. Other types of wavelet kernels or filter configurations can be used (e.g. Morlet, Mexican Hat, or the like). Generally, an impulse response of the filter is selected to correspond to the transmitted probe pulse or corresponding echo (e.g., a to a pulse morphology). The examples herein refer to TFM summation being performed using both amplitude and peak temporal location data. In another example, a temporal position of the [+] or [&#x2212;] peak locations (e.g., without taking into account the amplitude information) can be used independently to perform a TFM summation. For example, peak locations have the same periodic properties as edges in the A-Scan signal phase. Accordingly, a binary phase TFM summation can be performed using data indicative of the peak temporal positions, without requiring amplitude values, in a manner similar to a phase-based approach for performing TFM summation and related imaging.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates generally a technique <b>800</b>, such as a method, that can be used for performing processing of time-series representations, such as to perform one or more of compression or decompression of digital representations of acoustic imaging data. For example, at <b>820</b>, digital representations of peak locations in acquired acoustic echo signal data can be received, such as from a wired or wireless network or storage device. At <b>825</b>, time-series representations of respective received acoustic echo signals can be reconstructed, such as including up-sampling the digital representations of peak locations and applying a time-domain interpolation filter. At <b>830</b>, a real-valued time-series representation can be generated, and optionally, at <b>835</b>, an imaginary-valued time-series representation can be generated, such as using a second filter having coefficients that represent a phase-shifted version of the first filter or a Hilbert transform thereof. At <b>845</b>, the reconstructed time-series representations can be processed, such as to generate a visual representation of an acoustic inspection operation. As discussed above, such processing can include TFM beamforming accomplished by coherent summation of respective reconstructed acoustic echo signals. TFM beamforming is merely an example, and the techniques described herein are applicable to other beamforming and related imaging modalities, such as imaging techniques that can be performed using acquired FMC data, more generally. The operations at <b>820</b>, <b>825</b>, and <b>845</b> can be performed using a compute facility that is separate from the apparatus used for actual acoustic acquisition. For example, at <b>805</b>, acoustic echo data can be acquired and digitized, such as acquired by a multi-element electroacoustic transducer array forming a portion of a probe assembly. At <b>810</b>, digital representations of the peak locations can be generated, such as corresponding to peak detection and encoding as discussed above. At <b>815</b>, the digital representations of the peak locations can be transmitted from an acquisition unit to a separate processing unit.
