It is estimated that over 70 million people in the United States alone suffer from a cardiovascular disease or disorder including but not limited to high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, dislipidemia, congestive heart failure and stroke. A need exists for improved treatments for cardiovascular diseases and disorders.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is further estimated that more than 6 million Americans suffer from some form of seafood allergy. Sicherer et al., <i>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</i>, Volume 114, Issue 1, Pages 159-165. Therapies derived from fish oil have been proven effective at lowering triglycerides, among other effects. Unfortunately, such products are contraindicated in subjects that are allergic or hypersensitive to fish.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In various embodiments, the present invention provides methods of treating and/or preventing cardiovascular-related diseases and, in particular, a method of blood lipid therapy comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutical composition comprising eicosapentaenoic acid or a derivative thereof.

In another embodiment, the composition is present in a capsule shell. In another embodiment, the composition contains substantially no or no amount of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or derivative thereof such as ethyl-DHA (DHA-E), for example not more than about 0.06%, about 0.05%, or about 0.04%, by weight. In a related embodiment, the composition is substantially free of or is free of allergens.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of increasing serum, plasma and/or red blood cell (RBC) EPA levels comprising administering a composition as described herein to a subject in need of increased serum, plasma and/or RBC EPA levels.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a related embodiment, the subject has a baseline EPA plasma, serum and/or RBC level not greater than about 50 &#x3bc;g/g and upon administering the composition to the subject for a period of at least about 6 weeks, the subject exhibits at least a 100%, at least a 150%, at least a 200%, at least a 250%, at least 300%, at least 350% or at least 400% increase (change in EPA level divided by baseline EPA level) in plasma, serum and/or RBC EPA levels compared to baseline or placebo control. In a related embodiment, the subject has a baseline EPA plasma, serum and/or RBC level not greater than about 50 &#x3bc;g/g. In another embodiment, the subject is provided with an amount of said composition effective to achieve said increases in EPA levels.
