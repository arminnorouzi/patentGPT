Specifically, the communication circuit <b>80</b> transmits communication data including battery voltage information of the electronic device <b>50</b> to a communication circuit <b>40</b> of the charger <b>10</b>. The battery voltage information is, for example, information on a battery voltage VBAT, and may be voltage difference information between a battery voltage and a charging voltage, that is, information on a voltage difference between the battery voltage VBAT and a charging voltage VCHG. Here, the battery voltage VBAT is a voltage of the battery <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

The transistor TR and the resistor RS are provided in series between a supply node of the charging voltage VCHG and an output node of the battery voltage VBAT. The current control circuit <b>92</b> outputs an output signal to a gate terminal of the transistor TR and performs control of flowing a constant current through the resistor RS.

For example, a current flowing through the current source IS is IDA, and a current flowing through the resistor RS is IRS. Then, the control is performed such that IRS&#xd7;RS=IDA&#xd7;RC<b>1</b>.

Therefore, by setting &#x394;V which is a given set voltage such that the VDS which is the drain-source voltage of the transistor TR is a minimum necessary voltage for flowing the current IRS, heat generation in the transistor TR can be minimized. That is, in a method of a comparative example in which VCHG&#x2212;VBAT=&#x394;V is not set, since VRS is a constant voltage as described above when the battery voltage VBAT is low, VDS which is the drain-source voltage of the transistor TR is high.
