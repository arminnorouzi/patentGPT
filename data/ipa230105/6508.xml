Therefore, by applying, to the rotating part, an inertial force in a tangential direction depending on a rotation speed only with control of supplying a drive current to the electric motor, the permanent magnet of the rotating part and the permanent magnet of the fixing part can be controlled to be separated from and attracted to each other, and there is an effect that it is possible to perform a stopping operation between a start point and an end point in a drive range by a driving force, maintain this stopping operation, and smoothly and reliably execute respective operations that start from this stopped state without applying any external force other than a drive input of the electric motor. Operations of stopping and starting the electric motor can be executed in a non-contact state of the rotating part and the fixing part, and hence there is also an effect of excellent quietness.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the drive control mechanism of the geared motor according to the present invention, as required, the braking means includes a rotating part rotatably and pivotally supported by the drive shaft of the electric motor, and including one permanent magnet, and a fixing part fixed to the case of the electric motor, and including another permanent magnet disposed facing the one permanent magnet of the rotating part with a different polarity in the stopped state.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Thus, in the present invention, the braking means includes the rotating part rotatably and pivotally supported by the drive shaft of the electric motor, and including the one permanent magnet, and the fixing part fixed to the case of the electric motor, and including the other permanent magnet disposed facing the one permanent magnet of the rotating part with the different polarity in the stopped state. Therefore, by applying, to the rotating part, the inertial force in the tangential direction depending on the rotation speed of the electric motor only with control of supplying the drive current to the electric motor, the one permanent magnet of the rotating part and the other permanent magnet of the fixing part can be controlled to be separated from and attracted to each other, and there is an effect that it is possible to execute the stopping operation between the start point and the end point in the drive range by the driving force, maintain this stopping operation, and smoothly and reliably execute the respective operations that start from this stopped state without applying any external force other than the drive input of the electric motor. The operations of stopping and starting the electric motor can be executed in the non-contact state of the rotating part and the fixing part, and hence there is also an effect of excellent quietness.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the drive control mechanism of the geared motor according to the present invention, as necessary, one end side of the drive shaft of the electric motor is the input shaft of the speed change unit, and the rotating part of the braking means is disposed on the other end side of the drive shaft.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Thus, according to the present invention, in the drive control mechanism of the geared motor, one end side of the drive shaft of the electric motor is the input shaft of the speed change unit, and the rotating part of the braking means is disposed on the other end side of the drive shaft. Therefore, to control a large torque output by the speed change unit, which is an output from the geared motor, the braking means can drive and control the drive shaft of a small torque output with high-speed rotation from the electric motor, which provides an effect that it is possible to smoothly and reliably execute respective operations of starting and stopping the braking means and maintaining a stopped state with a machine configuration that is as simple as possible and disposed away from the speed change unit.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the drive control mechanism of the geared motor according to the present invention, as necessary, one permanent magnet of the rotating part and another permanent magnet of the fixing part are arranged by aligning polarities in a radial direction around the drive shaft, and matching polarities adjacent to each other in a circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, according to the present invention, in the drive control mechanism of the geared motor, the one permanent magnet of the rotating part and the other permanent magnet of the fixing part are arranged by aligning the polarities in the radial direction around the drive shaft and matching the polarities adjacent to each other in the circumferential direction. Therefore, it is possible to perform drive control by a drive control force due to an attraction force generated between one permanent magnet of the rotating part and the other permanent magnet of the fixing part in all the parts arranged to face each other, and there is an effect that it is possible to execute and maintain the stopping operation smoothly and reliably.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the drive control mechanism of the geared motor according to the present invention, as necessary, one permanent magnet of the rotating part and another permanent magnet of the fixing part are arranged by aligning polarities in a radial direction around the drive shaft, and with different polarities adjacent to each other in a circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Thus, according to the present invention, in the drive control mechanism of the geared motor, the one permanent magnet of the rotating part and the other permanent magnet of the fixing part are arranged by aligning the polarities in the radial direction around the drive shaft, and with the different polarities adjacent to each other in the circumferential direction. Therefore, drive control can be achieved not only by the drive control force due to the attraction force between the one permanent magnet of the rotating part and the other permanent magnet of the fixing part that are arranged to face each other during the stopping operation, but also by a drive control force due to a repulsion force of the one permanent magnet of the rotating part and another permanent magnet adjacent to the other permanent magnet of the fixing part. There is an effect that it is possible to smoothly and reliably execute and maintain the stopping operation, use, as a rotational force of the drive shaft, the repulsion force of one permanent magnet of the rotating part against the other permanent magnet of the fixing part when the drive shaft rotates in the starting operation, and smoothly and reliably execute the starting operation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the drive control mechanism of the geared motor according to the present invention, as necessary, an area of each of facing magnetic pole surfaces of one permanent magnet of the rotating part and another permanent magnet of the fixing part is smaller than an area of an opposite magnetic pole surface to the magnetic pole surface.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Thus, according to the present invention, in the drive control mechanism of the geared motor, since the area of each of the facing magnetic pole surfaces of the one permanent magnet of the rotating part and the other permanent magnet of the fixing part is smaller than the area of the opposite magnetic pole surface to the magnetic pole surface, a magnetic flux density in a magnetic field on a fixing part side increases in the one permanent magnet of the rotating part, and a magnetic flux density in a magnetic field on a rotating part side increases in the other permanent magnet of the fixing part. Therefore, an attraction force acting between the rotating part and the fixing part increases, and there is an effect that it is possible to execute and maintain the stopping operation smoothly and reliably.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the drive control mechanism of the geared motor according to the present invention, as necessary, the rotating part of the braking means includes a storage part formed to store the one permanent magnet, and having a central axis shifted with respect to a radial axis of the drive shaft of the electric motor.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, according to the present invention, in the drive control mechanism of the geared motor, since the rotating part of the braking means includes the storage part formed to store the one permanent magnet, and having the central axis shifted with respect to the radial axis of the drive shaft of the electric motor, in the stopped state, the motor is stopped in a state where the one permanent magnet of the rotating part is inclined with respect to the other permanent magnet of the fixing part. A magnetic flux distribution between a front end and a rear end of the one permanent magnet, and the other permanent magnet can be biased to a front end side of the one permanent magnet which is a tip side of a rotating direction. Therefore, there is an effect that it is possible to shift from the stopped state to a starting state smoothly and reliably.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the drive control mechanism of the geared motor according to the present invention, as necessary, the rotating part of the braking means includes a storage part formed to slidably store one permanent magnet, and having gaps from left and right surfaces of the one permanent magnet in a radial direction.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Thus, according to the present invention, in the drive control mechanism of the geared motor, since the rotating part of the braking means includes the storage part formed to slidably store the one permanent magnet, and having the gaps from the left and right surfaces of the one permanent magnet in the radial direction, the one permanent magnet in each storage part tilts (falls) in a falling direction depending on a rotating direction of the drive shaft driven by the electric motor. Therefore, a tapered gap is formed on a front end side of the one permanent magnet, and the magnetic flux distribution between the front end and the rear end of the one permanent magnet, and the other permanent magnet can be biased to the front end side of the one permanent magnet which is the tip side in the rotating direction, so that it is possible to smoothly and reliably shift from the stopped state to the starting state.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the drive control mechanism of the geared motor according to the present invention, as necessary, the braking means includes a rotating part formed of an annular body rotatably and pivotally supported by the drive shaft of the electric motor, and including a radially oriented permanent magnet divided into a plurality of portions in a circumferential direction of the annular body, each of the respective divided portions being magnetized in a radial direction, respective adjacent portions having different polarities from each other; and a fixing part formed of an annular body disposed facing a circumferential surface of the rotating part, and fixed to a case of the electric motor, and including a radially oriented permanent magnet divided into a plurality of portions in a circumferential direction of the annular body, each of the respective divided portions being magnetized in a radial direction, respective adjacent portions having different polarities from each other.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, in the present invention, the braking means includes the rotating part formed of the annular body rotatably and pivotally supported by the drive shaft of the electric motor, and including the radially oriented permanent magnet divided into the plurality of portions in the circumferential direction of the annular body, each of the respective divided portions being magnetized in the radial direction, the respective adjacent portions having the different polarities from each other; and the fixing part formed of the annular body disposed facing the circumferential surface of the rotating part, and fixed to the case of the electric motor, and including the radially oriented permanent magnet divided into the plurality of portions in the circumferential direction of the annular body, each of the respective divided portions being magnetized in the radial direction, the respective adjacent portions having the different polarities from each other. Therefore, the radially oriented permanent magnets of the annular bodies arranged facing each other with the different polarities coaxially inside and outside the drive shaft of the electric motor or the output shaft of the speed change unit attract each other, which provides an effect that it is possible to execute the stopping operation between the start point and the end point in the drive range by the driving force, maintain this stopping operation, and smoothly and reliably execute the respective operations that start from this stopped state without applying any external force other than the drive input of the electric motor.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the drive control mechanism of the geared motor according to the present invention, as necessary, one end side of the drive shaft of the electric motor is the input shaft of the speed change unit, and the rotating part of the braking means is disposed on the other end side of the drive shaft.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Thus, according to the present invention, in the drive control mechanism of the geared motor, the one end side of the drive shaft of the electric motor is the input shaft of the speed change unit, and the rotating part of the braking means is disposed on the other end side of the drive shaft.

Therefore, a magnetic force acting between the rotating part and the fixing part can be increased, and there is an effect that it is possible to execute and maintain the stopping operation smoothly and reliably.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the drive control mechanism of the geared motor according to the present invention, as necessary, the radially oriented permanent magnet of the fixing part is magnetized so that a magnetic field formed by a magnetic pole on a side of the rotating part is stronger than a magnetic field formed by a magnetic pole on a side opposite the rotating part side.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, according to the present invention, in the drive control mechanism of the geared motor, since the radially oriented permanent magnet of the fixing part is magnetized so that the magnetic field formed by the magnetic pole on the side of the rotating part is stronger than the magnetic field formed by the magnetic pole on the side opposite to the rotating part side, a magnetic force acting between the rotating part and the fixing part can be increased.
