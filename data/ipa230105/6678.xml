To do this, the rising edge of a data pulse is delayed by a different amount than the delay on the falling edge. To achieve this, a phase locked loop can be used to create phase signals from a clock signal which can be used to delay the data edges precisely. By controlling the delay on the positive and the negative edge, pulse width modulation can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some cases, it is desirable to have very small pulse width at the output of the pulse width modulator. The width of the pulse may need to be the size of a single unit step, where the unit step is the period of the clock signal divided by the number of phase signals generated from the clock signal. This can be difficult to achieve.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A pulse width modulator in accordance with principles of the present disclosure is able to provide pulses with very small widths. The pulse width modulator includes a multiplexer that includes multiple stages. The multiplexer is designed so that the final output stage has a very small delay compared with the preceding stages. The preceding stages collectively have a large delay but are balanced so their output signals arrive at the final stage with a same delay. The pulse width modulator can output pulses with widths as small as the very small delay of the final multiplexer stage.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The pulse width modulator generates N phase signals from a clock signal. Each phase signal has the same period T as the clock signal but is delayed from the clock signal by a respective number of unit steps ranging from 0 unit steps to N&#x2212;1 unit steps, where a unit step has a value equal to T/N. When a data signal is received by the pulse width modulator, the pulse width modulator generates N data delay signals each corresponding to one of the phase signals. Each data delay signal matches the data signal but is delayed by the number of unit steps corresponding to the associated phase signal. In one embodiment, each data delay signal is delayed by the number of unit steps plus one clock cycle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Half of the data delay signals are received by a first substage of the multiplexer. The other half of the data delay signals are received by a second substage of the multiplexer. The first and second substages correspond to the first stage of the multiplexer. Each substage provides one of the data delay signals to the final stage. The first and second substages have identical delays. The final substage outputs a pulse having a width based on the rising and falling edges of the outputs of the first stage. The final stage has a delay that is smaller than a single unit step. This enables the multiplexer to output a pulse with a width equal to a single unit step.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Reference will now be made by way of example only to the accompanying drawings.

The pulse width modulator <b>100</b> is configured to receive an input data signal (DATA IN) and to generate an output data signal (DATA OUT). The output data signal is a pulse having a width that represents the value of the input data signal. As is set forth in more detail below, the pulse width modulator <b>100</b> is able to generate a data output pulse having a very small pulse width.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The pulse width modulator <b>100</b> includes a phase locked loop <b>102</b>. The phase locked loop <b>102</b> receives a clock signal CLK. The clock signal CLK has a frequency f and period T. The clock signal CLK can include a square wave form having rising and falling edges.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The pulse width modulator <b>100</b> receives the clock signal CLK and generates N phase signals P<sub>0</sub>-P<sub>N-1</sub>, where N is an integer. Each of the phase signals has the same form, frequency, and period of the clock signal CLK. Accordingly, the phase signals can be considered clock signals in form and function. Each of the phase signals is delayed from the clock signal by an integer number of unit steps. A single unit step has a value of T/N. The phase signal P<sub>0 </sub>is delayed by 0 unit steps and thus has no delay from the clock signal CLK. The phase signal P<sub>1 </sub>is delayed from the clock signal by a single unit step. The phase signal P<sub>2 </sub>is delayed from the clock signal by two unit steps. The final phase signal, P<sub>N-1 </sub>is delayed from the clock signal by N&#x2212;1 unit steps. As an illustrative example, the phase signal P<sub>1 </sub>is delayed by a single unit step. This means that the rising edge of the phase signal P<sub>1 </sub>is delayed from the rising edge of the clock signal CLK by a single unit step, or by a length of time equal to T/N.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The pulse width modulator <b>100</b> includes a data delay generator <b>104</b>. The data delay generator <b>104</b> is coupled to the phase locked loop <b>102</b>. The data delay generator <b>104</b> receives each of the phase signals P<sub>0</sub>-P<sub>N-1 </sub>from the phase locked loop <b>102</b>. The data delay generator <b>104</b> also receives a data input signal. The data input signal indicates that data has been received and that the pulse width modulator <b>100</b> should generate an output pulse corresponding to the value of the data signal that has been received and the value of the phase select signal PS<sub>&#x3c;k:0&#x3e;</sub>, as will be described in more detail below. In one embodiment, DATA IN may simply be an indicator that data has been received. The pulse width modulator may receive the actual data value separately.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The data delay generator <b>104</b> generates N data delay signals D<sub>0</sub>-D<sub>N-1</sub>. Each data delay signal D<sub>0</sub>-D<sub>N-1 </sub>is associated with a respective phase signal. The data delay signal D<sub>0 </sub>is associated with the phase signal P<sub>0</sub>. The data delay signal P<sub>1 </sub>is associated with the phase signal P<sub>1</sub>. The data delay signal D<sub>N-1 </sub>is associated with the phase signal P<sub>N-1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The data delay generator <b>104</b> outputs the data delay signals with a timing based on the clock signal CLK, the phase signals, and the data input signal. In particular, when the data delay generator <b>104</b> receives the data input signal which is in sync with the rising edge of the clock signal, the data delay generator begins outputting the data delay signals upon the next rising edge of the clock signal CLK. Each data delay signal has a rising edge that is delayed from the rising edge of the clock signal by the value of the delay of the phase signal with which the data delay signal is associated. For example, when a data input signal is received, at the next rising edge of the clock signal the data delay generator will output the data delay signal D<sub>0</sub>. The rising edge of the data delay signal D<sub>0 </sub>coincides with the rising edge of the clock signal CLK because the phase signal P<sub>0 </sub>with which the data delay signal D<sub>0 </sub>is associated is in sync with the clock signal CLK. The rising edge of the data delay signal D<sub>1 </sub>is delayed from the rising edge of the clock signal by a single unit step because the phase signal P<sub>1 </sub>associated with the data delay signal D<sub>1 </sub>is delayed from the clock signal by a single unit step. The rising edge of the data delay signal D<sub>N-1 </sub>is delayed from the rising edge of the clock signal by N&#x2212;1 unit steps because the associated phase signal P<sub>N-1 </sub>is delayed from the clock signal by N&#x2212;1 unit steps.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The pulse width modulator <b>100</b> includes a multiplexer <b>106</b>. The multiplexer <b>106</b> is coupled to the data delay generator <b>104</b>. In particular, the multiplexer <b>106</b> receives each of the data delay signals D<sub>0</sub>-D<sub>N-1 </sub>from the data delay generator <b>104</b>. The multiplexer <b>106</b> outputs a data output pulse having a width corresponding to the value of the data associated with the data input signal.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The multiplexer <b>106</b> receives a phase select signal PS<sub>&#x3c;k:0&#x3e;</sub>, or various selection signals generated from the phase select signal by selection logic not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The phase select signal PS<sub>&#x3c;k:0&#x3e;</sub> is a data signal that selects or controls the width of the output data pulse from the multiplexer <b>106</b>. The phase select signal has k+1 bits, where k=log<sub>2</sub>(N)&#x2212;1. The phase select signal includes information that causes the multiplexer to select input data delay signals to be provided at the output of the multiplexer. In this way, the phase select signal PS<sub>&#x3c;k:0&#x3e;</sub> controls the width of the output data pulse.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the rising and falling edges of the data input signal are delayed by the amount represented by the decimal equivalent of the phase select signal PS<sub>&#x3c;k:0&#x3e;</sub> at that edge. Therefore, by varying the delays at the rising and falling edges of the data input, the output pulse width can be modulated.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Traditional multiplexers may not be able to output a data output pulse having a width corresponding to a single unit step. This is because the internal delay associated with a multiplexer may be larger than a single unit step. In traditional multiplexers, the result is that the minimum width of the output pulse is equal to the total delay of the multiplexer, which is longer than a single unit step.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The pulse width modulator <b>100</b> overcomes the drawbacks of traditional pulse width modulators by providing a multiplexer <b>106</b> that has identical delays for all data paths and that has a final stage that has a delay that is less than a single unit step. The multiplexer <b>106</b> of the pulse width modulator <b>100</b> includes high delay stages <b>108</b> and a low delay stage <b>110</b>. The high delay stages <b>108</b> are in parallel with each other and collectively receive all of the data delay signals D<sub>0</sub>-D<sub>N-1 </sub>from the data delay generator <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one example, the high delay stages <b>108</b> include a first high delay stage and a second high delay stage. The first high delay stage receives half of the data delay signals. The second high delay stage receives the other half of the data delay signals. The first and second high delay stages are in parallel with each other and are identical to each other. This means that the first and second high delay stages of the high delay stages <b>108</b> have identical delays. The first high delay stage outputs a first midpoint signal. The second high delay stage outputs a second midpoint signal. The first and second midpoint signals correspond to the respective data delay signal being output by the high delay stages.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The low delay stage <b>110</b> receives first midpoint signal and the second midpoint signal. In one example, the first midpoint signal controls the rising edge of the data output signal and the second midpoint signal controls the falling edge of the data output signal. However, either of the midpoint signals can control either edge of the data output signal, depending on the particular situation. The low delay stage has a delay that is smaller than a single unit step. The low delay stage <b>110</b> outputs a data pulse that has a delay smaller than a single unit step and is thus able to output the data pulses with a width of a single unit step, if the data value calls for such a small pulse.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram of the multiplexer <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, according to one embodiment.
