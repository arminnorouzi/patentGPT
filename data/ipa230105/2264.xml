In particular, it relates to a wastewater plant that utilizes a two-stage digestion process.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wastewater plant with two stage digestion can include, for example, a thermophilic digester followed by a heat exchanger and a mesophilic digester. In this system, struvite typically forms in the heat exchanger and mesophilic digester as well as other equipment downstream of the digesters where ammonia, phosphorus, and magnesium are present. A critical location is the heat exchanger between the thermophilic and mesophilic digesters. Struvite precipitates in this heat exchanger that is heating the inbound sludge and cooling the outbound thermophilic digestate. The struvite precipitation can render the heat exchanger ineffective, and accumulate in the mesophilic digester requiring periodic dredging foul pipelines, valves, pumps and other equipment creating operational issues and causing additional maintenance expenses.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one example, a waste treatment process includes processing waste activated sludge in a thermophilic digester to produce a thermophilic digestate.

Waste Activated Sludge (WAS), which may or may not be thickened, flows through heat exchanger <b>14</b> to thermophilic digester <b>12</b>, which operates at, for example, approximately <b>55</b> degrees Celsius (C). Thermophilic digestate from thermophilic digester <b>12</b> passes through heat exchanger <b>14</b> so that cooled thermophilic digestate is fed into the mesophilic digester <b>16</b>, which operates, for example, at approximately <b>30</b> degrees C. The cooling medium for heat exchanger <b>14</b> is the WAS that is inbound to thermophilic digester <b>12</b>, so that as much heat as possible is recovered and the operating expense of heating thermophilic digest <b>12</b> is reduced. The mesophilic digestate from mesophilic digester <b>16</b> is supplied to dewatering apparatus <b>18</b>, which may be a centrifuge, a screw press, a filter or other device for separating liquid and solids. The liquid fraction (effluent) is sent back to the headworks (HW) or other location of plant <b>10</b>, while the dewatered bio-solids are generally incinerated, land-filled, or land applied for beneficial use.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Struvite scaling issues arise when the thermophilic digestate enters heat exchanger <b>14</b>. Popular belief is that this is a result of the cooling of the liquid stream and the related decrease in solubility of struvite at mesophilic temperatures. While this plays a role in struvite scaling, another mechanism for struvite scaling is the resulting increase in pH that is caused by turbulent flow through traditional shell and tube and plate heat exchangers. The increase in pH causes struvite to scale on the walls of heat exchanger <b>14</b> and inhibit its performance and ability to return heat to the inbound WAS liquid stream.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic block diagram of wastewater treatment plant <b>20</b>A, which includes thickener device <b>22</b>, thermophilic digester <b>24</b>, air stripper <b>26</b> (which includes outer chamber <b>27</b>A, coarse bubble air diffuser <b>27</b>B, and air pump or blower <b>27</b>C), heat exchanger <b>28</b>, mesophilic digester <b>30</b>, struvite reactor <b>32</b>, and dewatering apparatus <b>34</b>. WAS is supplied to thickener device <b>22</b>, which separates thickened WAS and filtrate. Thickened WAS is fed to heat exchanger <b>28</b>, and filtrate is returned to the plant <b>20</b>A. The thickened WAS flows from heat exchanger <b>28</b> to thermophilic digester <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Air stripper (or CO<b>2</b> release tank) <b>26</b> is connected downstream from thermophilic digester <b>24</b> and upstream from heat exchanger <b>28</b>. Air stripper <b>26</b> is aerated by air provided by pump <b>27</b>D to coarse bubble air diffuser <b>27</b>C. The aeration removes carbon dioxide (CO<b>2</b>), from the thermophilic digestate. The carbon dioxide exits the upper end of air stripper <b>26</b>. The removal of carbon dioxide raises the pH of the thermophilic digestate. This allows struvite to form in a controlled environment until the available magnesium (Mg), which is typically the limiting element in the formation of struvite in this process, is exhausted or reaches a new equilibrium at much lower concentrations. The balance of the downstream equipment is thereby protected from rapid struvite scaling.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The reduced carbon dioxide thermophilic digestate flows from air stripper <b>26</b> through heat exchanger <b>28</b> to mesophilic digester <b>30</b>. The flow of thickened WAS through heat exchanger <b>28</b> cools the thermophilic digestate before it enters mesophilic digester <b>30</b>. Struvite reactor <b>32</b> can be installed either between the mesophilic digester and the dewatering apparatus <b>34</b> or after dewatering apparatus <b>34</b> to solve specific plant issues related to dewatering issues, struvite harvesting, sequestration, or return phosphorus loads to the headworks of the plant.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, struvite reactor <b>32</b> is located between mesophilic reactor <b>30</b> and dewatering apparatus <b>34</b>. Mesophilic digestate is fed to struvite reactor <b>32</b>, which is a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR). A reagent (or reagents) is also supplied to reactor <b>32</b>. While the common reagent used in struvite precipitation is magnesium chloride (MgC<b>12</b>), depending on the specific process conditions, these reagents could also include sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for additional pH and buffering control or magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)<b>2</b>) for the additional Mg source and buffering capacity to accommodate, for example, a deammonification process downstream of this phosphorus/struvite technology. Other reagents are possible and preferred depending on the specific conditions within the process.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The treated digestate from reactor <b>32</b> is fed to dewatering apparatus <b>34</b>, which separates effluent from the bio-solids that are now enriched with struvite.

Pump <b>36</b> supplies cyclone separator <b>38</b> with treated digestate from struvite reactor <b>32</b>. Cyclone separator <b>38</b> separates about 50% of the struvite from the biosolids and water in the treated digestate based on pressure drop across the cyclone and the differences in specific gravity of the medium. This recovered struvite can then be used for beneficial use with alternate disposition than the biosolids. The remaining treated digestate is fed to dewatering apparatus <b>34</b>. Dewatering apparatus <b>34</b> separates effluent from biosolids and the remaining struvite.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of wastewater treatment plant <b>20</b>C, which includes thickener device <b>22</b>, thermophilic digester <b>24</b>, air stripper <b>26</b> (which includes chamber <b>27</b>A, coarse bubble air diffuser <b>27</b>B, and air pump <b>27</b>C), heat exchanger <b>28</b>, mesophilic digester <b>30</b>, struvite reactor <b>32</b>, dewatering apparatus <b>34</b>, pump <b>36</b>, cyclone separator, <b>38</b>, and holding tank <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Holding tank <b>40</b> receives the WAS and provides biological release of phosphorus (bio-P) from the WAS in holding tank <b>40</b>. The residence time of the WAS in holding tank <b>40</b> is a few hours with the addition of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Alternatively, the residence time is longer without the addition of VFAs to holding tank <b>40</b>. Magnesium is also released, as well as phosphorus in this bio-P process.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Once the aged WAS exits holding tank <b>40</b>, it is dewatered by thickening device <b>22</b>. The phosphorus and magnesium rich filtrate from thickening device <b>22</b> is sent to struvite reactor <b>32</b>. This bypasses the rest of the process stream to also protect thermophilic digester <b>24</b> from struvite scaling and sedimentation issues. In this case, struvite reactor <b>32</b> is located downstream of dewatering apparatus <b>34</b> to avoid dilution of the stream from mesophilic digester <b>30</b> prior to dewatering. The liquid fraction (mesophilic effluent) from dewatering apparatus <b>34</b> is then combined with the filtrate from thickener device <b>22</b>. Because solids have been removed by dewatering device <b>34</b>, struvite settles to the bottom of struvite reactor <b>32</b> and can be collected from reactor <b>32</b>. Treated effluent from reactor <b>32</b> is supplied by pump <b>36</b> to cyclone separator <b>38</b>. Fine struvite crystals remaining in the treated effluent are separated by cyclone separator <b>38</b>, and the treated effluent is sent to headworks of plant <b>20</b>C.

In this embodiment, both air stripper and struvite reactor <b>32</b> are located upstream of mesophilic digester <b>30</b>. In this case it is also preferred to also include pump <b>36</b> and cyclone separator <b>38</b> upstream of mesophilic digester <b>30</b>, because otherwise the struvite formed through the process would settle and accumulate in mesophilic digester <b>30</b>. In this configuration, even with this harvesting, accumulations of settled struvite in mesophilic digester <b>30</b> are expected. Plant <b>20</b>G would have to plan for periodic dredging of mesophilic digester <b>30</b> to clean out these settled solids. Harvesting at this point in the process will at best recover 50% of the struvite that is precipitated, leaving the balance to settle in the mesophilic digester if it is not well-mixed. In reality it can be anticipated that there will be dead zones where it is inevitable there will be accumulations. This dredging, while a nuisance for the plant, may be preferred over the other equipment and piping scaling issues that would be encountered otherwise. In this configuration, the air stripper could be configured as either an air stripper/heat exchanger <b>42</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref>, or could be air stripper <b>24</b> followed by heat exchanger <b>28</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>3</b></figref>. It would be preferred to have the struvite reactor after the heat exchanger as solubility is lower at lower temperatures and the reaction would be more effective/efficient at the mesophilic temperature level than thermophilic temperatures.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref> show &#x201c;Reagents&#x201d; being added to struvite reactor <b>32</b>. Reagents would be added to the struvite reactor in most embodiments (extremely rare case there would not be any). The reagents discussed above are only the reagents commonly considered. Others can be used depending on the water chemistry. For most applications the process will be deficient in magnesium, so magnesium chloride or magnesium hydroxide are logical sources to introduce more for the reaction to continue. Additionally, the incoming liquid stream may require additional pH or buffering capacity, which would lead towards use of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or magnesium hydroxide. But these selections are all to get the proper water chemistry. It can be envisioned that other reagents are more suitable in other applications. For example, in a system where there is sufficient magnesium, but the process stream is lacking both ammonia (nitrogen source) and in buffering capacity, an appropriate reagent is ammonium hydroxide. So the reagent selection will be based on characteristics of the incoming flow and there won't be a one-size-fits-all reagent.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the schematics shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref>, the incoming sludge is acting as the cooling medium in the heat exchanger to both cool the outbound thermophilic sludge and also pre-heat that inbound sludge. From a thermal efficiency standpoint, this is preferred. But, you could use anything else as the cooling medium and just send the inbound sludge directly into the thermophilic digester without any pre-heating. This would just mean that the plant would need additional heat (natural gas most likely) to supplement the thermophilic digester to keep it at the correct temperature and just increase the operating expense a bit.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In still other embodiments, air stripper <b>26</b> and heat exchanger <b>28</b> can be multiple units in parallel to optimize air pump operations.
