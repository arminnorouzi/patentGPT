Some embodiments of the teachings herein may include methods and/or apparatuses for determining a collection frequency.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Digitization is a trend being followed in the manufacturing industry. Device-related digitization is an important application in factories, especially cloud-based application programs such as device condition monitoring, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), fault diagnosis, and predictive maintenance. Therefore, how to efficiently collect valid field data of devices, for example, how to determine an appropriate frequency of data collection from devices, has become a key factor in providing a successful digitization solution.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, more and more devices that are highly diverse are in use in factories. Even for the same type of devices, the performance of their hardware and control systems varies considerably due to differences in purchase date and in hardware and software versions. Therefore, setting an appropriate collection frequency of data for a device is a complex task that should be handled by a very professional specialist.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The situation has worsened as application programs on the cloud become increasingly common. Providers/developers of cloud application programs tend to have a poorer understanding of true states of field devices. If they adopt a uniform collection frequency of data for devices without considering the types of devices, hardware and software versions, workloads of devices, etc., then frequent data collection may lead to a low production efficiency, a high defective rate, and even device damage.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, a fixed collection frequency of data for a device is usually set on the basis of application programs, field testing, or experience, which requires the handling of a lot of tasks with the skills of very experienced engineers. In addition, a collection frequency needs to be adjusted on a trial-and-error basis, for example, at increasing defective rates and decreasing device operating speeds.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure describes adaptive methods for setting an appropriate collection frequency of data for a device.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, first, in block S<b>102</b>, a collection frequency requirement of the application program regarding the data of the device is determined. Different application programs have different collection frequency requirements regarding data. Some application programs need to collect data several times a day, some application programs need to collect data several times an hour, and some application programs may need to collect data more than a thousand times a second. In addition, in different states of a device or at different times, an application program has different collection frequency requirements regarding data. Therefore, in a method incorporating teachings of the present disclosure, a determined collection frequency requirement of an application program regarding data may comprise the following specific situations.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">First, a collection frequency requirement of the application program itself is determined by a function of the application program. In some embodiments, a collection frequency requirement of an application program itself may comprise a default collection frequency, a minimum collection frequency, and a zero frequency. The default collection frequency is the optimal frequency for the application program and is used as long as the control system of the device can bear it. The minimum collection frequency is used when the control system of the device is too busy with performing proper operation to share any resources with the data collection function. If the control system of the device cannot bear even the minimum collection frequency, then a further reduction of the collection frequency should be attempted to ensure proper production work. The zero frequency means that no data collection is required.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">For example, in the application scenario of preventive maintenance of a device, vibration data, current data, etc. need to be sampled with very great frequency to meet the requirements for subsequent data analysis; in a scenario where a device state is to be made transparent, highly frequent sampling is not required and, usually, the requirement for making a device state transparent may be met at a sampling rate of 1 Hz.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">In a scenario where energy consumption data are to be collected, the requirement of energy consumption management may be met by collecting data on the current energy consumption every hour or even within a longer sampling period, and data such as those on energy consumption may be collected when the device is not involved in any production productivities, so that the device operation remains unaffected.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">Second, different states of the device can comprise: an operating state, an idle state, a fault state, a repair state, and a maintenance state. An application program may have different collection frequency requirements regarding data in different states of the device. For example, with an application program for monitoring energy consumption, the collection frequency should be low when the device is in idle mode, and should become higher when the device has switched to active mode; with an application program for predictive maintenance, data collection may not be required when the device is in idle or maintenance mode. In this case, the collection frequency of data may be greatly lowered to reduce the cost of data communication, storage and processing. Therefore, for each state of the device, the corresponding preferred collection frequency, minimum collection frequency, and zero frequency may also be set respectively. For example, when the device is in the &#x201c;operating state&#x201d;, one of the default collection frequency, the minimum collection frequency, and the zero frequency set for the &#x201c;operating state&#x201d; may also be selected for data collection according to specific operating conditions of the device.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">In addition, different work hours, including operating hours, non-operating hours, and 24 hours a day (such as morning shift, middle shift, and evening shift) may be defined in a factory, different data collection frequencies may also be set for different times, and, for example, a low frequency of data collection should be set during non-operating hours. In addition, each time period may also be provided with a corresponding default collection frequency, minimum collection frequency, and zero frequency, respectively.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">Further, there may be a plurality of application programs for the same device, which means that a plurality of application programs may require the same data of the same device. In this case, requirements of the plurality of application programs may be combined such that collected data can meet the requirements of all the application programs.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">Thus, through the operation performed in block S<b>102</b>, the collection frequency requirements of an application program regarding the data of a certain device under various circumstances may be determined. It is understandable that collection frequency requirements of the application program regarding the data of the device are not limited to those described above, and those of ordinary skill in the art, when using a method according to the present disclosure to determine a collection frequency of data, can also consider any other factor related to an application program and possibly affecting the collection frequency of data, which will not be described in detail again herein.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">Next, in block S<b>104</b>, state information of the device is determined. State information of a device is collected from, for example, a field device in a factory, or from a third-party system. Device information may comprise, for example, the following: an operating state of the device; operating and non-operating hours of the device; a performance indicator of the device; and hardware information. An operating state of the device may be, for example, an operating state, an idle state, a fault state, a repair state, and a maintenance state. A performance indicator of the device comprises, for example, CPU usage, RAM usage, I/O read time, and CPU temperature.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">For each device performance indicator, an experienced engineer can preset a threshold for evaluating the device performance indicator, or the device performance may be evaluated by an automatic evaluation method, for example, by measuring the response time of the control system of the device. Hardware information may comprise: CPU version and memory version. With hardware information, the collection frequency of one device may be used as a reference for another similar device. State information of a device is not limited to that described above, and those of ordinary skill in the art, when using a method incorporating teachings of the present disclosure to determine a collection frequency of data, can also consider any other device state information that affects the collection frequency of data, which will not be described in detail again herein.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">Then, in block S<b>106</b>, the collection frequency of data is determined according to a preset rule on the basis of the determined collection frequency requirement of the application program regarding the data of the device and the determined state information of the device. A preset rule herein may comprise, for example, that the collection frequency should at least meet the minimum requirement for implementing the function of the application program; that, to avoid incurring excessive costs in data transmission, storage, processing and visualization, the collection frequency should not be too high; that the collection frequency should not affect the operating performance of the device; that different collection frequencies may be set for different device states; and that, for devices with different hardware and software, the corresponding collection frequency, etc. may be customized.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">In some embodiments, an appropriate rule may be preset by those of ordinary skill in the art from experience, rather than being limited to the preset rule described above, and then an appropriate collection frequency of data for the device is automatically calculated on the basis of the determined collection frequency requirement of the application program regarding the data of the device and the determined state information of the device. In some embodiments, the method <b>100</b> for determining a collection frequency of data may further comprise performing the operation in block S<b>108</b> to collect a real-time performance parameter of the device and, according to the real-time performance parameter, determine whether the collection frequency needs to be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">Specifically, real-time performance parameters, such as real-time CPU usage, RAM usage, network load, and response speed, of the device may be collected. For each performance parameter, a threshold may be preset, and the performance of the device may be determined by comparing the parameter with the threshold, so that whether it is necessary to adjust the collection frequency may be determined. In some embodiments, a test instruction may be sent to a device periodically, and then whether the response speed of the device is low may be determined by the response time of the device. Thus, a large number of tests may be automatically performed, and then the test data may be analyzed by a self-learning method to determine a threshold. By this means, it may be determined according to a real-time performance parameter that the state of the device has changed, or how the data collection has influenced normal production, etc., so that the collection frequency may be adjusted in a timely manner.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">A collection frequency of data determined by a method incorporating teachings of the present disclosure may be provided, for example, to a gateway responsible for data collection, and the gateway collects data according to the determined collection frequency of data and provides the data to a corresponding application program. In some embodiments, it is possible to monitor the usage of the device in real time, and, for example, when the operating speed of the device has decreased, the collection frequency may be automatically reduced, and the updated collection frequency may be sent to the gateway. Even for different devices, there is no need to perform processing separately.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">In some embodiments, a balance may be achieved between a requirement and an actual situation on the basis of the requirement of the application program and the operating condition of the field device. In some embodiments, a requirement of an application program may be met as much as possible while ensuring the proper operation of the device, so that interference with the proper operation of the device by data collection may be avoided. In some embodiments, configuration personnel do not need to meet any demanding requirements, and the workload and complexity of setting an appropriate collection frequency of data may be reduced, especially when thousands of different types of devices are used. In some embodiments, collection of any invalid data may be avoided, so as to reduce the amount of data collected, thereby lowering the cost of data communication, storage and processing.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary configuration of an apparatus <b>200</b> for determining a collection frequency of data incorporating teachings of the present disclosure.
