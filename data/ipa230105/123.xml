Steviol glycosides offer a non-caloric alternative to traditional caloric sweeteners such as sugar, glucose, sucrose, and/or fructose. Steviol glycosides are a class of sweet-tasting glycosylated diterpene compounds commonly obtained from the leaves of <i>Stevia rebaudiana</i>. Various steviol glycosides are known, some of which provide a sugar-like taste profile and are 150 to 450 times sweeter than sugar. Such compounds are typically characterized by a single steviol backbone and the presence of differing arrangements of glycosidic carbohydrate residues at positions C13 and C19.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some steviol glycosides can suffer from poor acidic stability on their own, limiting their use in acidic compositions such as carbonated soft drinks or throw syrups.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In various aspects, the present invention provides a composition including one or more steviol glycoside malonic acid esters (SGMAs) or salts thereof.

The composition can be a freeze-dried power. The composition can be a sweetener. The composition in a solid form can have any suitable water solubility. For example, the solid composition can have a water solubility of 80 wt % or more (i.e., the solid composition dissolved in deionized water at 22&#xb0; C. to form an aqueous solution of which the solid composition is 80 wt % or more), or 1 wt % to 80 wt %, or 40 wt % to 80 wt %, or 0 wt %, or less than, equal to, or greater than 2 wt %, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, or 75 wt %, or 80 wt % or less.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0061">The composition can be a solid food stuff, such as a snack bar, a dried fruit product, a cookie, a cereal, a chocolate, a chewing gum, a candy, a cake, a donut, or a combination thereof.

The composition can be a beverage concentrate, such as a liquid water enhancer used to flavor or sweeten still water or a throw syrup that can be used to make a carbonated soft drink via addition of water and carbonation. The composition can be a sweetener, and can be a liquid, a solid, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0063">The composition can include any suitable one or more additional components, or can be substantially free of one or more additional components. Examples of the one or more additional components include another stabilizer (e.g., another one or more materials, in addition to the stabilizer including one or more caffeoyl-substituted quinic acids or salts thereof, that stabilize the composition to acidic conditions), a microbial stabilizer (e.g., sodium benzoate or sodium sorbate), another sweetener, a bulking agent, erythritol, a desiccant, an anti-caking agent, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0064">The composition can be substantially free of <i>stevia </i>plant matter that is not soluble in water or a water-miscible alcohol such as ethanol or methanol.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0065">In various aspects, the composition can be stable under acidic conditions in the absence of steviol glycoside stabilizers that stabilize steviol glycosides to acidic conditions (e.g., prevent or significantly limit degradation). The degradation can include, for example, hydrolysis of the malonyl ester bond of the SGMA. Measuring change in total SGMA content can be a suitable measure of the amount of degradation that has occurred. The SGMAs, salts thereof, or the combination thereof can degrade more slowly over time under acidic conditions (e.g., at pH 1.7 to 4) as compared to a corresponding composition that includes less or none of the stabilizer. For example, SGMAs in the composition can be stable (e.g., less than 20 wt %, 10 wt %, 5 wt %, 1 wt %, or less than 0.1 wt % degradation of the SGMA or salt thereof at 22&#xb0; C. over 4 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years or more) at a pH of 1 to 9, 1.7 to 4, 2.5 to 3.5, 1.7 to 2.0, 4 to 9, or 1 or more, or less than, equal to, or greater than 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.8, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, or 9 or less.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0066">In one suitable standardized test for measuring degradation of the SGMAs in a composition, the composition is dissolved in an aqueous, alcohol-free buffered citric acid solution having a SGMA concentration of 50,000 ppm (5 wt %) and a pH of 1.7, which is stored at 22&#xb0; C. This degradation test can be used to measure degradation over a fixed period of time. For example, compositions of the invention can have an SGMA content after 7 days that is equal to or greater than 85 wt %, 90%, 92%, 94%, 95%, 96%, or 97%, or 98% or more of the SGMA content present at the outset of the test. This degradation test can also be used to measure how long it takes to reach a fixed amount of degradation. For example, compositions of the invention can have an SGMA content that is at least 90 wt % of the SGMA content present at the outset of the test after storage for at least 4 days, at least 5 days, at least 7 days, at least 10 days, at least 14 days, or at least 20 days. The composition having a pH of 1.7 over 5 days at 22&#xb0; C. can be stable such that 90 wt % of more of the SGMAs, salts thereof, or the combination thereof are undegraded. The composition having a pH of 1.7 over 35 days at 22&#xb0; C. can be stable such that 50% or more of the SGMAs, salts thereof, or the combination thereof are undegraded.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0067">The composition can be substantially free of materials from <i>stevia </i>leaf that are removed during a chromatographic separation to obtain the SGMA or salts thereof of the composition.

The residual plant mass was washed with an additional volume of 50% vol/vol ethanol in water (800 mL). The initial extract was treated with ethyl acetate (1:1 extraction volume) to remove hydrophobic colored bodies and any residual ethyl acetate was allowed to evaporate under a stream of nitrogen. The clarified extract was then passed through an anionic resin (Dowex 66) to bind the ionic SGMA species. The resin was washed with aqueous ethanol (50%) to remove all neutral species, including traditional SGs. The SGMAs were then eluted with aqueous ethanol (50%) containing 5% sodium acetate. The eluent was collected and dried to remove excess ethanol. Once&#x3c;10% ethanol remained, the eluent was acidified with HCl to pH 1-2 and was desalted on a hydrophobic resin (Diaion Sepabeads SP70) by loading directly, followed by washing with 15% vol/vol ethanol and eluting with 70% ethanol. The desalted eluent was then dried under nitrogen to remove the ethanol and lyophilized to complete dryness.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0102">Aspartame was used to benchmark degradation of the steviol glycoside malonic acid esters (SGMAs). Aspartame has demonstrated commercially acceptable shelf life in a wide variety of common retail food and beverage products, including many carbonated soft drinks that have a pH below 4. Initial testing demonstrated that SGMA stability was worse than aspartame at pH 1.7 and 3.0 without the stabilizer.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0103">The stabilizer was formed by extracting and purifying monocaffeoylquinic acids (MCQAs) and dicaffeoylquinic acids (DCQAs) from yerba mate leaf. Yerba mate leaf (300 g) was added to a glass container and a solution of 50% vol/vol ethanol in water (1500 mL) was also added and allowed to extract for 60 minutes with occasional stirring. The solution was filtered through a Buchner funnel and Whatman 54 filter paper. The residual plant mass was washed with additional water to increase yields and to obtain an extract containing 35% ethanol (vol/vol). This extract was loaded onto an ion exchange resin (Amberlite FPA53) and the resin was washed with 35% ethanol (vol/vol). The MCQAs and DCQAs were eluted with a solution of 50% ethanol (vol/vol) containing 10% (wt/vol) sodium chloride. The ethanol was evaporated from this eluent and the pH was adjusted to 1-2 with HCl. The acidified solution was loaded onto a hydrophobic resin (Diaion Sepabeads SP70) and the resin was washed with 10% ethanol in water (vol/vol) acidified to pH&#x3c;2 with HCl followed by a wash with pure water to desalt the MCQAs and DCQAs. The compounds were eluted with 70% ethanol in water and the ethanol was evaporated from the eluent solution. This solution was decolored via membrane ultrafiltration (3 kDa nominal molecular weight cutoff, TurboClean NP010). The decolored permeate was concentrated then lyophilized to dryness to provide a stabilizer.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0104">Acid-stability measurements were taken for samples of aspartame, SGMAs, and a combination of SGMAs with the stabilizer. The sample including SGMAs and the stabilizer had a weight ratio of SGMAs to MCQAs and DCQAs of 1:1. Acid-stability was measured in water having a pH of 1.7. The concentration of the aspartame or the SGMAs in the samples during the testing was 0.1 to 10 wt %. The samples were stored at room temperature (nominally about 22&#xb0; C.) and samples were taken periodically. The concentration of the aspartame, SGMAs, MCQAs and DCQAs, as the case may be, was measured by UHPLC/UV then divided by the original concentration to determine a percent recovered.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the results for three samples&#x2014;one had 3000 ppm (0.3 wt %) aspartame, another had 5 wt % SGMAs, and the third had 5 wt % each of the SGMAs and the stabilizer. Aspartame has limited solubility, but 3000 ppm is on par with concentrations of throw syrups used to make some diet carbonated soft drinks that have about 500 ppm of aspartame. Acid-stability of the SGMAs alone fell well short of that of aspartame under these conditions. After 14 days of storage, the concentration of aspartame was about 78% of the initial concentration; stated another way, about 22% of the aspartame was degraded. In the same 14 days, the concentration of SGMAs in the SGMA-only sample was about 67% of the initial concentration, a degradation of about 33%. That means the SGMA degradation was 50% higher than the aspartame degradation (33% vs 22%).</p><p id="p-0169" num="0106">In contrast, the SGMA concentration in the sample with SGMAs and stabilizer at 14 days was about 81% of the initial concentration, a degradation of 19%, which is almost 15% lower than the degradation of aspartame (19% vs 22%). The remarkable effects of the stabilized SGMAs continued to be borne out over the rest of the 35-day test, with more than 60% of the SGMAs remaining with the stabilizer versus only about 38% SGMAs remaining in the SGMA-only sample.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0107">The terms and expressions that have been employed are used as terms of description and not of limitation, and there is no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features shown and described or portions thereof, but it is recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the embodiments of the present invention.
