The blade holder <b>12</b> includes a base <b>14</b>, a blade mount <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) supported by the base <b>14</b>, and a retaining member <b>22</b> removably coupled to the blade mount <b>18</b>. The circular saw blade <b>10</b> has an outer diameter D<b>1</b> and a thickness or width W (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The illustrated circular saw blade <b>10</b> includes a body <b>26</b>, a plurality of cutting teeth <b>30</b>, a central aperture <b>34</b>, and at least one relief slot <b>38</b>. In other embodiments, the circular saw blade <b>10</b> may have other configurations. The blade holder <b>12</b> also has a diameter D<b>2</b> that is substantially similar to, but slightly larger than the diameter D<b>1</b> of the saw blade <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the diameter D<b>1</b> of the saw blade <b>10</b> and the diameter D<b>2</b> of the blade holder <b>12</b> may have little to no similarity in size.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the illustrated base <b>14</b> includes a hub <b>42</b>, one or more spokes <b>46</b> extending from the hub <b>42</b>, and a rim <b>50</b>. The hub <b>42</b> is positioned substantially at the center of the base <b>14</b> and supports the saw blade mount <b>18</b>. The spokes <b>46</b> extend radially outward from the hub <b>42</b> to the rim <b>50</b>. A void <b>54</b> is defined between each pair of spokes <b>46</b> to reduce the amount of material needed to support the saw blade mount <b>18</b> on the base <b>14</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the base <b>14</b> includes three spokes <b>46</b> that extend from the hub <b>42</b> and three corresponding voids <b>54</b>. The spokes <b>46</b> are equally spaced about the base <b>14</b>. In other embodiments, the base <b>14</b> may include other numbers of spokes <b>46</b> and voids <b>54</b> and/or the spokes <b>46</b> may be unevenly spaced. Alternatively, the base <b>46</b> may be a monolithic disk that does not include the voids <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the rim <b>50</b> includes a lip <b>58</b> around an outer circumference of the rim <b>50</b>. The lip <b>58</b> extends in an axial direction <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) away from the rim <b>50</b>. In some embodiments, the lip <b>58</b> may extend a distance equal to at least the width W (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the saw blade <b>10</b>. The lip <b>58</b> may help cover and radially constrain the saw blade <b>10</b> while the saw blade <b>10</b> is held on the holder <b>12</b>. The base <b>14</b> further includes at least one hang tab <b>62</b> that projects from the rim <b>50</b>. The hang tab <b>62</b> may be used to hang the holder <b>12</b>. The holder <b>12</b> may be hung for a number of reasons. Such reasons may include hanging the holder <b>12</b> to display the saw blade <b>10</b> during merchandising or hanging the holder <b>12</b> to store the saw blade <b>10</b> at home or in a workshop. In the illustrated embodiment, the hang tab <b>62</b> is integrally formed with the remainder of the base <b>14</b>. In other embodiments, the hang tab <b>62</b> may be a separate piece that is permanently or removably coupled to the rim <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the blade mount <b>18</b> extends away from the base <b>14</b>. The blade mount <b>18</b> is configured to be received in the central aperture <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the circular saw blade <b>10</b>. The blade mount <b>18</b> supports the circular saw blade <b>10</b> on the holder <b>12</b>. The illustrated blade mount <b>18</b> includes a first flexible wall <b>66</b> and a second flexible wall <b>70</b>. The flexible walls <b>66</b>, <b>70</b> each include a base <b>66</b><i>a, </i><b>70</b><i>a </i>and a body <b>66</b><i>b, </i><b>70</b><i>b </i>and are positioned across from one another. The flexible walls <b>66</b>, <b>70</b> are connected to the hub <b>42</b> at the bases <b>66</b><i>a, </i><b>70</b><i>a </i>such that the bodies <b>66</b><i>b, </i><b>70</b><i>b </i>are movable (e.g., elastically deformable) toward one another. In other words, a user may pinch the flexible walls <b>66</b>, <b>70</b> together for the mount <b>18</b> to receive the central aperture <b>34</b> of the saw blade <b>10</b>. Similarly, the user may pinch the flexible walls <b>66</b>, <b>70</b> together to remove the saw blade <b>10</b> from the mount <b>18</b>. Each of the flexible walls <b>66</b>, <b>70</b> include a flange <b>74</b>, <b>78</b> that assists to retain the saw blade <b>10</b> to the mount <b>18</b>. The flanges <b>74</b>, <b>78</b> are ramped on one side to provide a slip surface and flat on another side to provide a retaining surface. The flexible walls <b>66</b>, <b>70</b> may also be deformed toward one another by pressing the central aperture <b>34</b> of the saw blade <b>10</b> against the ramped portion of the flanges <b>74</b>, <b>78</b>. The mount <b>18</b> further includes a first rigid wall <b>82</b> and a second rigid wall <b>86</b> that are also constrained to the hub <b>42</b>. The rigid walls <b>82</b>, <b>86</b> are positioned across from one another and adjacent to the flexible walls <b>66</b>, <b>70</b>. The flexible walls <b>66</b>, <b>70</b> and rigid walls <b>82</b>, <b>86</b> are curved and arranged relative one another to form a complimentary surface with the central aperture <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the retaining member <b>22</b> may be received on the saw blade mount <b>18</b> to retain the saw blade <b>10</b> to the holder <b>12</b>. The illustrated retaining member <b>22</b> is a generally annular member having an overall cross-section that is larger than the central aperture <b>34</b>. The illustrated retaining member <b>22</b> is also reusable and may be referred to as a reusable retaining member. In some embodiments, the retaining member <b>22</b> may be referred to as a reusable washer or a washer. The retaining member <b>22</b> has a central opening <b>87</b> that receives the blade mount <b>18</b>. The illustrated central opening <b>87</b> is circular to generally match the shape and size of the blade mount <b>18</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the retaining member <b>22</b> also includes a plurality of radial slots or cutouts <b>88</b> formed in a perimeter of the retaining member <b>22</b>. The radial slots <b>88</b> divide an outer perimeter of the retaining member <b>22</b> into separate lobes <b>89</b> and increase the flexibility of the retaining member <b>22</b>. The retaining member <b>22</b> may be fitted to the blade mount <b>18</b> after the flexible walls <b>66</b>, <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) are pinched together. The flexible walls <b>66</b>, <b>70</b> may also be deformed toward one another by pressing the retaining member <b>22</b> against the ramped portion of the flanges <b>74</b>, <b>78</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the retaining member <b>22</b> may be placed on the blade mount <b>18</b> after one circular saw blade <b>10</b> is coupled to the blade mount <b>18</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) or after multiple circular saw blades <b>10</b> are coupled to the blade mount <b>18</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the retaining member <b>22</b> may be elastically flexible in the axial direction <b>20</b>. The retaining member <b>22</b> includes an inner diameter ID and an overall outer diameter OD. The retaining member <b>22</b> defines a first or upper portion <b>90</b> at the inner diameter ID and a second or lower portion <b>92</b> at the outer diameter OD. The upper portion <b>90</b> may be slightly offset from the lower portion <b>92</b> (e.g., raised as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). An inner surface that defines the central opening <b>87</b> in the upper portion <b>90</b> may contact or bear against the flanges <b>74</b>, and the lower portion <b>92</b> may contact the saw blade <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates an elevation region <b>94</b> of the retaining member <b>22</b>. Within the elevation region <b>94</b>, the retaining member <b>22</b> rises from the lower portion <b>92</b> at outer diameter OD to the upper portion <b>90</b> at inner diameter ID. Such a rise allows the retaining member <b>22</b> to deform elastically in the axial direction <b>20</b> such that an angle <b>98</b> of the elevation region <b>94</b> may change as the retaining member <b>22</b> is being deformed or flexed. Such a rise also allows the retaining member <b>22</b> to flex or compress to fill a space between the flanges <b>74</b> and the saw blade <b>10</b>. The space between the flanges <b>74</b> and the saw blade <b>10</b> may change depending on the width W of the saw blade <b>10</b> or the number of saw blades <b>10</b> that are being supported on the mount <b>18</b>. In other words, the retaining member <b>22</b> may flex or compress to retain a number of saw blades having different widths to the holder <b>12</b>, even if there is only one saw blade. The retaining member <b>22</b> also includes radially spaced relief cutouts <b>88</b>. The cutouts <b>88</b> allow the retaining member <b>22</b> to deform elastically in a radial direction.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The retaining member <b>22</b> may be formed of an elastically flexible material that also maintains rigidity to constrain at least one saw blade <b>10</b> on the blade mount <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, the retaining member <b>22</b> may be made of plastic. In other embodiments, the retaining member <b>22</b> may be made of other suitable materials, such as metal or a composite material. As such, the retaining member <b>22</b> is also reusable. That is, the retaining member <b>22</b> may be removed from the blade mount <b>18</b> without cutting, breaking, or otherwise destroying the retaining member <b>22</b>. The retaining member <b>22</b> may, therefore, be reconnected to the blade mount <b>18</b> after the circular saw blade <b>10</b> is removed and recoupled to the blade mount <b>18</b> for storage. The retaining member <b>22</b> may also be connected to another blade mount on a similar holder, if desired.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The inner diameter ID across the central opening <b>87</b> of the retaining member <b>22</b> may be any dimension suitable to receive the blade mount <b>18</b>. The overall size of the blade mount <b>18</b> may be sized to correspond with a size of the central aperture <b>34</b> of the saw blade <b>10</b> such that the retaining member <b>22</b> and blade holder <b>12</b> could have different dimensions to display/retain a saw blade of a larger or smaller diameter Dl. Likewise, the outer diameter OD of the retaining member <b>22</b> may be increased to reduce the elastic deformity of the retaining member <b>22</b> to thereby retain a larger saw blade <b>10</b> (e.g., saw blade with a greater width W, saw blade with larger outer diameter D<b>1</b>, heavier saw blade, etc.).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the holder <b>12</b> and the circular saw blade <b>10</b> may be covered in a packaging material while the holder <b>12</b> is packaged and on display. The packaging material may be a transparent material (e.g., plastic shrink-wrap) that at least partially surrounds the saw blade <b>10</b> and the holder <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates multiple saw blades <b>10</b> that may be supported on the saw blade mount <b>18</b> and retained on the mount <b>18</b> by the retaining member <b>22</b>. The pinch-fit of the saw blade <b>10</b> and retaining member <b>22</b> on the mount <b>18</b> allows the holder <b>12</b> to be reusable for holding the saw blade <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the holder <b>12</b> is configured to hold two of the same saw blades <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the holder <b>12</b> is configured to hold saw blades <b>10</b> having different dimensions and features (i.e., number of teeth, pitch of teeth, etc.). Therefore, the holder <b>12</b> may be used to display saw blades <b>10</b> and re-used to store saw blades <b>10</b> over any desired period of time.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of one or more independent aspects of the invention as described.
