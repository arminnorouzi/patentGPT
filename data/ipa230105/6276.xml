particular for an electrical energy storage device for a motor vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent applications US 2017/176108 and WO 2013/056938 describe heat exchangers for cooling battery cells. In addition, patent application US 2011/0206967 A describes an example of such a battery. In that application, the cells are stored in containers having housings for receiving the cells. A wall of the containers, intended to be in contact with a wall of a neighboring container, has depressions forming part of a duct for the circulation of a heat transfer fluid.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The aim of the present invention is in particular to simplify the manufacture of a compartment for receiving battery cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The subject of the present invention is thus a compartment for an item of equipment liable to give off heat during its operation, in particular for an electrical energy storage device for a motor vehicle, this compartment having at least one channel for the circulation of a cooling fluid, this channel being obtained by molding a polymer-based material, with fluid-assisted injection molding, in particular gas- or liquid-assisted injection molding, for forming this channel in the polymer-based material.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention in particular makes it possible to have a compartment, for example for receiving battery cells, which also has the function of cooling these cells, the manufacture of which is simplified.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The formation of the cooling fluid channel or channels in the polymer-based material by liquid- or gas-assisted injection molding makes it possible to have a one-step manufacturing method, instead of a multi-step method for forming the channel or channels that would require welding. The invention thus makes it possible to avoid certain sealing problems associated with cooling fluid leaks. In the invention, these leakage problems are avoided since the channel or channels are formed by hollow shapes directly in the material. The manufacturing operations are also simplified.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the channel has an internal wall without a join, which is the result of the hollowing of the polymer-based material by the fluid injected during the molding.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the channel has a cylindrical shape, at least along a part of its length, in particular with a rectangular or oval or round cross section.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the polymer-based material in which the channel is formed is connected to a sheet of polymer-based composite material.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This connection is in particular the result of molding, in particular overmolding or co-molding, between the material which has the channel or channels for the circulation of cooling fluid and this sheet of composite material.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the sheet of composite material has an opening and the material that forms the channel passes through this opening such that this channel also passes through this opening in the sheet.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the material in which the channel is formed is in the form of a layer, which extends over a face of the sheet of composite material.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">This layer and this sheet form in particular a bottom cover.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to one of the aspects of the invention, this layer of material and the sheet are planar over at least a part of their surface area.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one of the aspects of the invention, this layer and the sheet have an edge that is inclined with respect to this planar part, and the channel passes into the layer of material at this edge.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the channel in the material is connected to a fluidic connection member, in particular at this inclined edge.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one of the aspects of the invention, this fluidic connection member is molded with the material of the layer that comprises the channel.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the layer of material has at least two channels resulting from assisted injection molding, these channels being in particular parallel along the majority of their length.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the compartment has a cooling plate disposed on a side of the sheet of composite material that is opposite to the side of the layer of molded material.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the plate is designed to be passed through by a cooling fluid that also circulates in the channels of the molded layer. These channels are in particular feeder channels, which respectively supply and evacuate the cooling fluid circulating in the plate. Provision is for example made of a single supply feeder channel and a single evacuation feeder channel.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the layer that has the feeder channels has a connection portion which is formed in one piece with the rest of the layer and which is designed to be connected to the cooling plate. This connection portion protrudes through the sheet of composite material.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the channels are formed only in the layer of molded material, in other words the channels are not formed by the assembly of two separate layers, for example.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the layer has grooves for forming the channels and reinforcing ribs, in particular of honeycomb shape, for mechanically reinforcing the compartment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The molded layer thus occupies only part of the outer face of the composite sheet, and not all of this face. This molded layer occupies for example less than 50% of the outer face of the sheet, or even less than 25% thereof.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention also relates to an electrical energy storage module having a plurality of battery cells that are in particular disposed in a row, and a compartment as described above, the cells being placed in this compartment in thermal interaction with the cooling plate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention also relates to a method for manufacturing a compartment for an item of equipment liable to give off heat during its operation as described above, the method having the step of forming a layer of polymer-based material, with fluid-assisted injection molding for forming a channel in this layer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Another subject of the invention, independently of or in combination with the foregoing, is a compartment for an item of equipment liable to give off heat during its operation, in particular for an electrical energy storage device for a motor vehicle, this compartment having at least one cooling plate which is designed to be passed through by a cooling fluid and which is designed to cool said item of equipment, this compartment furthermore having an upper housing designed to receive said item of electrical equipment, and a lower housing in which at least one fluid connection element for supplying fluid to the cooling plate is placed, the lower housing and upper housing being insulated from one another in a fluid-tight manner.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the cooling plate or plates separate the lower housing from the upper housing.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to one of the aspects of the invention, a plurality of cooling plates separate the lower housing from the upper housing, and these plates are disposed in parallel rows.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to one of the aspects of the invention, each cooling plate has a fluid inlet and a cooling fluid outlet which are each connected to one of the fluid connection elements, this fluid inlet and fluid outlet both being directed toward the lower housing.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, in the event of a leak at this inlet and outlet, the cooling fluid flows into this lower housing, and not into the upper housing, so as to preserve the electrical components, in particular when these elements are battery cells.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Ducts are in particular provided within the cooling plates for the circulation of cooling fluid.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the compartment has a bottom cover comprising a cooling fluid channel, and the fluid connection element is connected to this channel.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the bottom cover has a substantially planar main face.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to one of the aspects of the invention, this bottom cover, together with the cooling plates, defines the lower housing.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the lower and upper housings cover substantially the same surface area. These housings are thus in a stacked arrangement.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the bottom cover has at least one sheet of composite material based on plastics material.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the lower housing has, in free space, a height less than 25%, in particular less than 15%, of the height of the upper housing.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to one of the aspects of the invention, a seal is disposed on a joining periphery between the lower housing and the upper housing.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the upper housing has at least one frame, in particular made of aluminum, which defines a periphery of the upper housing, and the seal is in contact with this frame.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to one of the aspects of the invention, this frame has external bars forming a periphery and partitions, which are in particular parallel to one another, for forming receptacles that are each intended to receive one battery cell. These partitions form, for example, two identical rows of multiple receptacles.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the cooling plates are assembled on the frame by screwing or adhesive bonding, for example.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to one of the aspects of the invention, one or more seals are provided between these bars and partitions of this frame for the one part and the lower housing for the other.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the seal or seals are disposed in a tight manner between a zone of the frame and a zone of a cooling plate, and/or between a zone of the frame and a zone of the bottom cover.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the seal is made of electrically conductive material so as to contribute to an electromagnetic protection function (also referred to as EMC or electromagnetic compatibility) for the upper housing which receives the electrical component.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the upper cover is designed to bear against the frame in order to close the compartment, in particular with the interposition of a seal, in particular made of electrically conductive material.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The invention makes it possible to have a total height of the compartment that is relatively low, this being advantageous given the size constraints. The compartment can also be manufactured in a simplified manner.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the upper cover comprises a composite material based on plastics material.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The invention also relates to an electrical energy storage device having a plurality of battery cells, in particular disposed in a row, and a compartment as described previously, the cells being placed in this compartment in thermal interaction with the cooling plate.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further features, details and advantages of the invention will become more clearly apparent upon reading the detailed description given below, and from several exemplary embodiments that are given by way of nonlimiting indication, with reference to the attached schematic drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic side view of a compartment according to one example of the invention;</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the compartment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in cross section;</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic view of a compartment according to another example of the invention;</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is another schematic view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> show an electrical energy storage module <b>1</b> having a plurality of battery cells <b>9</b>, which are visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and a compartment <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">This compartment <b>2</b> has two cooling fluid channels <b>3</b> for circulation of a cooling fluid, which are visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and are parallel.
