The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; generally refers to a range of numbers that one of skill in the art would consider equivalent to the recited value (e.g., having the same function or result). In many instances, the terms &#x201c;about&#x201d; may include numbers that are rounded to the nearest significant figure. Other uses of the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; (e.g., in a context other than numeric values) may be assumed to have their ordinary and customary definition(s), as understood from and consistent with the context of the specification, unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The recitation of numerical ranges by endpoints includes all numbers within that range (e.g. 1 to 5 includes 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 3, 3.80, 4, and 5).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although some suitable dimensions, ranges, and/or values pertaining to various components, features and/or specifications are disclosed, one of skill in the art, incited by the present disclosure, would understand desired dimensions, ranges, and/or values may deviate from those expressly disclosed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is generally employed in its sense including &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. It is to be noted that in order to facilitate understanding, certain features of the disclosure may be described in the singular, even though those features may be plural or recurring within the disclosed embodiment(s). Each instance of the features may include and/or be encompassed by the singular disclosure(s), unless expressly stated to the contrary. For simplicity and clarity purposes, not all elements of the disclosed invention are necessarily shown in each figure or discussed in detail below.

In some instances, the terms &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; and &#x201c;distal&#x201d; may be arbitrarily assigned in an effort to facilitate understanding of the disclosure, and such instances will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan. Other relative terms, such as &#x201c;axial&#x201d;, &#x201c;circumferential&#x201d;, &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d;, &#x201c;lateral&#x201d;, &#x201c;radial&#x201d;, etc. and/or variants thereof generally refer to direction and/or orientation relative to a central longitudinal axis of the disclosed structure or device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The terms &#x201c;extent&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;maximum extent&#x201d; may be understood to mean a greatest measurement of a stated or identified dimension, while the term &#x201c;minimum extent&#x201d; may be understood to mean a smallest measurement of a stated or identified dimension. For example, &#x201c;outer extent&#x201d; may be understood to mean a maximum outer dimension, &#x201c;radial extent&#x201d; may be understood to mean a maximum radial dimension, &#x201c;longitudinal extent&#x201d; may be understood to mean a maximum longitudinal dimension, etc. Each instance of an &#x201c;extent&#x201d; may be different (e.g., axial, longitudinal, lateral, radial, circumferential, etc.) and will be apparent to the skilled person from the context of the individual usage. Generally, an &#x201c;extent&#x201d; or &#x201c;maximum extent&#x201d; may be considered a greatest possible dimension measured according to the intended usage. Alternatively, a &#x201c;minimum extent&#x201d; may be considered a smallest possible dimension measured according to the intended usage. In some instances, an &#x201c;extent&#x201d; may generally be measured orthogonally within a plane and/or cross-section, but may be, as will be apparent from the particular context, measured differently&#x2014;such as, but not limited to, angularly, radially, circumferentially (e.g., along an arc), etc.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is noted that references in the specification to &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;some embodiments&#x201d;, &#x201c;other embodiments&#x201d;, etc., indicate that the embodiment(s) described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it would be within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect the particular feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments, whether or not explicitly described, unless clearly stated to the contrary. That is, the various individual elements described below, even if not explicitly shown in a particular combination, are nevertheless contemplated as being combinable or arrangeable with each other to form other additional embodiments or to complement and/or enrich the described embodiment(s), as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For the purpose of clarity, certain identifying numerical nomenclature (e.g., first, second, third, fourth, etc.) may be used throughout the description and/or claims to name and/or differentiate between various described and/or claimed features or configurations. It is to be understood that the numerical nomenclature is not intended to be limiting and is exemplary only. In some embodiments, alterations of and deviations from previously-used numerical nomenclature may be made in the interest of brevity and clarity. That is, a feature or configuration identified as a &#x201c;first&#x201d; element or configuration may later be referred to as a &#x201c;second&#x201d; element or configuration, a &#x201c;third&#x201d; element or configuration, etc. or may be omitted entirely, and/or a different feature or configuration may be referred to as the &#x201c;first&#x201d; element or configuration. The meaning and/or designation in each instance will be apparent to the skilled practitioner.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Stents, and stent delivery systems are utilized throughout the world in medical procedures. Many such systems generally have an outer and/or delivery sheath that constrains the expandable stent in a radially contracted, delivery state. The self-expanding stent can be freed from the restraint of the delivery sheath by removing the sheath from the constrained stent, allowing the expandable stent to expand to a radially expanded, deployed state.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, some stent delivery system works by proximally retracting the deployment sheath relative to the stent and/or distally pushing the stent relative to the deployment sheath, causing the stent to begin deployment at its distal end. Once unconstrained by the deployment sheath, the stent can expand, for example, to force itself against the luminal wall of the body lumen. Such distal deployment systems (DDS) may be desirable, for example, where precise placement of the distal end of the stent is of particular concern.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some other cases, the stent delivery system works by distally advancing the deployment sheath relative to the stent and/or proximally pushing the stent relative to the deployment sheath, causing the proximal end of the stent to deploy first. Such proximal deployment systems (PDS) may be desirable, for example, where precise placement of the proximal end of the stent is of particular concern.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">One common characteristic of proximal deployment systems is that the delivery sheath extends distally beyond the distal end of the stent during and/or after deployment of the stent. As such, to remove the delivery system from the anatomy after deployment of the stent, the deployment sheath often needs to be withdrawn proximally back through the deployed stent.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">During proximal withdrawal of the delivery sheath back through the deployed stent, there is a possibility that a portion of the stent, such as the distal end of the stent, may be snagged, caught, or disrupted by a portion of the delivery sheath, such as the proximal end of the delivery sheath. For example, the delivery sheath may have an open proximal end from which the stent was deployed, and this open proximal end may provide a step and/or edge and/or surface that may catch or snag on the stent when withdrawing the delivery sheath back through the deployed stent. Additionally and/or alternatively, the delivery sheath is typically moved and/or deployed using an inner member having a small diameter compared to that of the diameter of the deployment sheath. The difference and/or step up in diameter between the inner member and the open proximal end of the deployment sheath may provide an edge and/or surface and/or step that may catch or snag the stent when withdrawing the delivery sheath back through the deployed stent. Catching and/or snagging the stent during withdrawal of the deployment sheath can create problems. For example, catching and/or snagging the stent with the proximal end of the deployment sheath during withdrawal could cause difficulties in withdrawal, stent migration, stent or delivery system damage, vessel damage, and/or embolism risk if a part of the delivery system and/or stent breaks. The risk of catching and/or snagging may be exacerbated if the stent is located along a curve.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for improvements in catheters, devices, and/or systems that deliver self-expanding stents, to help reduce and/or prevent catching and/or snagging of the stent during withdrawal of the delivery sheath and/or other components of the delivery system. As such, some embodiments of the present disclosure may include methods, devices, and/or systems that may be configured or designed to help reduce and/or prevent such catching and/or snagging. For example, it may be desirable to provide a stent delivery device and/or system that includes an anti-catch member that is positionable adjacent to the proximal end of the deployment sheath and/or other portions of the delivery system, and is designed to allow portions of the delivery system, such as the proximal end of the deployment sheath, to be passed through the stent while reducing or eliminating the risk of catching or snagging on the stent.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> show an example embodiment of a stent delivery system <b>10</b> disposed within a body lumen, such as within a blood vessel <b>8</b>.

Radiopaque materials are understood to be materials capable of producing a relatively bright image on a fluoroscopy screen or another imaging technique during a medical procedure. This relatively bright image aids the user of the stent delivery systems and/or other components thereof in determining its location. Some examples of radiopaque materials can include, but are not limited to, gold, platinum, palladium, tantalum, tungsten alloy, polymer material loaded with a radiopaque filler, and the like. Additionally, other radiopaque marker bands and/or coils may also be incorporated into the design of the stent delivery systems and/or other components thereof to achieve the same result.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, a degree of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compatibility is imparted into the stent delivery systems and/or other components thereof. For example, the stent delivery systems and/or other components thereof, or portions thereof, may be made of a material that does not substantially distort the image and create substantial artifacts (e.g., gaps in the image). Certain ferromagnetic materials, for example, may not be suitable because they may create artifacts in an MRI image. The stent delivery systems and/or other components thereof, or portions thereof, may also be made from a material that the MRI machine can image. Some materials that exhibit these characteristics include, for example, tungsten, cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys (e.g., UNS: R30003 such as ELGILOY&#xae;, PHYNOX&#xae;, and the like), nickel-cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys (e.g., UNS: R30035 such as MP35-N&#xae; and the like), nitinol, and the like, and others.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">It should be understood that this disclosure is, in many respects, only illustrative.
