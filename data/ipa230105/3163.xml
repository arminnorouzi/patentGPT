The entire contents of this application are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a system for performing flushing of a cooling water pathway in a marine propulsion device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A marine propulsion device is required to perform a work called &#x201c;flushing&#x201d; after being used in sea water. Flushing is performed for washing out sea water with fresh water flowing through a cooling water pathway for an engine in the marine propulsion device. The engine is provided with a connection port connected to the cooling water pathway. In performing flushing, a hose extended from a water source (a water supply, a tank, etc.) is connected to the connection port.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 9,517,495 discloses a system for automatically performing flushing. The system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,517,495 includes a timer control unit, a start switch, and a plurality of solenoid valves. When the start switch is pushed, the timer control unit sequentially opens and closes the plurality of solenoid valves at constant time intervals. Accordingly, flushing is performed for a marine propulsion device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Chances are that flushing is not sufficiently performed when the flushing time is short. In this case, salt contained in sea water remains in the engine, and inevitably reduces the product life of the engine. However, an appropriate time for flushing depends on factors such as the pressure of water in the water source or the status of the marine propulsion device. Therefore, it is difficult for a user to grasp an appropriate time for flushing. Because of this, when the system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,517,495 is applied to practical situations, for instance, flushing time becomes extremely long such that flushing can be sufficiently performed even at a low water pressure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, Japan Laid-open Patent application Publication No. 2020-78956 discloses a configuration that a controller obtains data from a marine propulsion device to determine whether to end flushing or not. Then, the controller determines whether to end flushing or not based on the obtained data. Because of this, the controller can determine appropriate timing for ending flushing. As a result, flushing can be sufficiently performed in a short time.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the system disclosed in Japan Laid-open Patent application Publication No. 2020-78956, it is required to supply electric power to the marine propulsion device such that the controller can obtain the data from the marine propulsion device during flushing. Because of this, a user of the marine propulsion device stands by until the end of flushing, while keeping an electric power switch of the marine propulsion device turned on. After the end of flushing, the user turns off the electric power switch of the marine propulsion device, whereby electric power is stopped from being supplied to the marine propulsion device.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide systems by which a user is able to be informed of an end of flushing without needing to wait until the end of flushing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a system for flushing a cooling water pathway in a marine propulsion device by water supplied from a water source includes a water control device, an electric power control device, a data communication module, and a controller.

When it is determined to end the flushing, the controller is configured or programmed to control the electric power control device to stop the supply of the electric power to the marine propulsion device, and control the data communication module to notify a terminal of a user of the marine propulsion device of the end of the flushing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the controller is configured or programmed to determine whether to end the flushing or not. When it is determined to end the flushing, the controller is configured or programmed to then stop the supply of the electric power to the marine propulsion device. Because of this, the user is not required to wait until the end of the flushing and is able to go home at the onset of the flushing.

The controller <b>5</b> may determine to end flushing when the concentration of salt in the cooling water pathway <b>22</b> does not become the predetermined threshold or less even at or after the elapse of a predetermined time since the start of flushing.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">When it is determined to end flushing, the controller <b>5</b> controls the water control device <b>3</b> to stop the supply of water to the cooling water pathway <b>22</b> in the marine propulsion device <b>1</b>. The controller <b>5</b> controls the electric power control device <b>4</b> to stop the supply of electric power to the pump <b>8</b>. The pump <b>8</b> is thus stopped. When it is determined to end flushing, the controller <b>5</b> controls the electric power control device <b>4</b> to stop the supply of electric power to the watercraft operating system <b>2</b>. The marine propulsion device <b>1</b> is thus powered off.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When flushing ends, the controller <b>5</b> controls the DCM <b>6</b> to notify the terminal <b>220</b> of the user of the marine propulsion device <b>1</b> of the end of flushing. The end of the flushing may be notified by, for instance, transmission of an e-mail or a short message. The end of flushing may be notified as a notification command to an application or software installed in the user terminal <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The controller <b>5</b> may determine whether flushing has ended normally or abnormally. When flushing has ended normally, the controller <b>5</b> may notify the user terminal <b>220</b> of the normal ending of flushing. When flushing has ended abnormally, the controller <b>5</b> may notify the user terminal <b>220</b> of the abnormal ending of flushing.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The controller <b>5</b> records a history of flushing performed in the marine propulsion device <b>1</b> in the storage device <b>46</b>. The history of flushing contains, for instance, date and time when flushing has been performed. The history of flushing may contain whether flushing has ended normally or abnormally. The history of flushing may contain clock time when the engine has stopped. The controller <b>5</b> may send the history of flushing performed in the marine propulsion device <b>1</b> to the server <b>210</b> to store the sent history therein. The controller <b>5</b> may send the history of flushing performed in the marine propulsion device <b>1</b> to the user terminal <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the system <b>100</b> according to the preferred embodiments explained above, the controller <b>5</b> determines whether to end flushing or not. Then, when it is determined to end flushing, the controller <b>5</b> stops the supply of electric power to the marine propulsion device <b>1</b>. Because of this, the user is not required to wait until the ending of flushing and is able to go home at the onset of flushing. When it is determined to end flushing, the controller <b>5</b> notifies the terminal <b>220</b> of the user of the marine propulsion device <b>1</b> of the end of flushing. Accordingly, even the user is if away from the marine propulsion device <b>1</b> before the end of flushing, the user is able to be informed of the end of flushing.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Preferred embodiments of the present invention have been explained above. However, the present invention is not limited to the preferred embodiments described above, and a variety of changes can be made without departing from the gist of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The marine propulsion device <b>1</b> is not limited to the outboard motor, and alternatively, may be another type of marine propulsion device such as an inboard motor. The number of marine propulsion devices is not limited to one, and alternatively, may be greater than one. The configuration of the marine propulsion device <b>1</b> is not limited to that in the preferred embodiments described above and may be changed. The configuration of the system <b>100</b> is not limited to that in the preferred embodiments described above and may be changed. For example, the water source is not limited to the tank <b>7</b>, and alternatively, may be a water supply.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The configuration of the controller <b>5</b> is not limited to that in the preferred embodiments described above and may be changed. The controller <b>5</b> may be integral with the water control device <b>3</b>. The controller <b>5</b> may be integral with the display <b>36</b> and/or the input device <b>37</b>. The controller <b>5</b> may be the ECU <b>29</b>. In other words, the ECU <b>29</b> may execute the processes executed by the controller <b>5</b> described above.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The end of flushing may be determined not only based on the concentration of salt in the cooling water pathway <b>22</b> but also based on other data. For example, the controller <b>5</b> may count an elapsed time from the start of flushing. When the elapsed time reaches a predetermined threshold, the controller <b>5</b> may determine to end flushing.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The storage device <b>46</b> for recording the history of flushing is not limited to the storage device provided in the controller <b>5</b>, and alternatively, may be a storage device provided in another device. For example, the history of flushing may be recorded in a storage device provided in the input device <b>37</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The DCM <b>6</b> may receive a command to start flushing from the user terminal <b>220</b>. When the DCM <b>6</b> receives the command to start flushing, the controller <b>5</b> may control the water control device <b>3</b> to start flushing. This configuration enables the user to operate the start of flushing from a remote location.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">When it is determined to end flushing, the controller <b>5</b> may determine whether consumption of electric power for any purpose other than flushing has been detected or not. When the consumption of electric power for any purpose other than flushing has been detected, the controller <b>5</b> may control the electric power control device <b>4</b> to stop the supply of electric power to the marine propulsion device <b>1</b> after the consumption of electric power ends. For example, during system updating of the ECU <b>29</b>, electric power is kept supplied to the ECU <b>28</b> even if flushing ends. When the system updating is then completed, the controller <b>5</b> stops the supply of electric power to the marine propulsion device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it is to be understood that variations and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.
