Each of the OLED sub-pixels includes an anode layer, a cathode layer, and a light-emitting layer disposed between the anode layer and the cathode layer. The light-emitting layer can emit light under the drive of the anode layer and the cathode layer.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">However, due to the close distance between the plurality of OLED sub-pixels, light emitted from the light-emitting layer in an OLED sub-pixel may be exited from the cathode layer of an OLED sub-pixel adjacent to the OLED sub-pixel, and light emitted from the plurality of OLED sub-pixels may have crosstalk, which affects the display effect of the display device.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Silicon-based OLED display panels are widely used in virtual reality (VR) devices, augmented reality devices, camera viewfinders or sights for the ultra-high pixels per inch (PPI).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">However, due to the small size of the sub-pixels in the silicon-based OLED display panel, the accuracy of manufacturing the light-emitting layer of the sub-pixel by using a mask is low. Therefore, in general, the display panel may be prepared by using a white light OLED and a color filter layer. That is, light emitted from each sub-pixel in the display panel is white light, and the white light forms light of various colors after passing through the color filter layer in the display panel.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the display panel includes a base substrate, a plurality of sub-pixels (three sub-pixels are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and an encapsulation film layer. Each of the sub-pixels includes: an anode layer, a light-emitting layer, and a cathode layer laminated in sequence along a direction going away from the base substrate. Since some of the light rays emitted from the light-emitting layer of a sub-pixel have a big angle, these light rays may be emitted from the cathode layer of a sub-pixel adjacent to the sub-pixel, resulting in crosstalk of the light rays from the plurality of sub-pixels. Therefore, the display device has a poor display effect.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">An embodiment of the present disclosure provides a display panel, which can solve the problem of poor display effect of the display device caused by light crosstalk of a plurality of sub-pixels <b>102</b> in the related art. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the display panel <b>10</b> may include a base substrate <b>101</b> and a plurality of sub-pixels <b>102</b> disposed on a side of the base substrate <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Each of the sub-pixels <b>102</b> may include a first electrode (anode) <b>1021</b>, a light-emitting film layer <b>1022</b>, and a second electrode (cathode) <b>1023</b> laminated in sequence along a direction going away from the base substrate <b>101</b>. The light-emitting film layer <b>1022</b> may emit light under the drive of the first electrode <b>1021</b> and the second electrode <b>1023</b>. The first electrode <b>1021</b> may include a first portion <b>10211</b> and a second portion <b>10212</b> surrounding the first portion <b>10211</b>.

In the display panel, the thickness of the second portion of the first electrode of the sub-pixel may be relatively large, which can prevent light emitted from the portion, disposed on the first portion of the first electrode, of the light-emitting film layer from transmitting to the region where the adjacent sub-pixel is disposed, thereby preventing the light emitted from the light-emitting film layer in the sub-pixel from being exited from the second electrode of the adjacent sub-pixel. Therefore, crosstalk of light emitted from the plurality of sub-pixels is avoided, and the display effect of the display device is better.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the embodiment of the present disclosure, the first electrode <b>1021</b> may be made from a non-light-transmitting metal material to ensure that the second portion <b>10212</b> of the first electrode <b>1021</b> can effectively reflect light so as to prevent the light from transmitting to the second electrode <b>1023</b> of the adjacent sub-pixel <b>102</b>.
