These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the present subject matter. References to &#x201c;an&#x201d;, &#x201c;one&#x201d;, or &#x201c;various&#x201d; embodiments in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references contemplate more than one embodiment. The following detailed description is demonstrative and not to be taken in a limiting sense. The scope of the present subject matter is defined by the appended claims, along with the full scope of legal equivalents to which such claims are entitled.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present detailed description will discuss hearing devices generally, including earbuds, headsets, headphones and hearing assistance devices using the example of hearing aids. Other hearing devices include, but are not limited to, those in this document. It is understood that their use in the description is intended to demonstrate the present subject matter, but not in a limited or exclusive or exhaustive sense.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Biuetooth&#x2122; Low Energy (BLE) connections are made between a master device and one or more slave devices. This topology is referred to as a piconet. Radio controllers and in particular the radio controller in the master device is responsible for the scheduling of events, and those events must be scheduled with one or more slave devices. In addition, the radio controller must mitigate other competing radio connections such as WiFi connections and even cellular connections if the controller is part of a smart phone or media device. The master controller, based on these competing multiple access wireless systems, will schedule the events of the slave devices in the Bluetooth&#x2122; piconet. At any time, this master controller may modify connections and their relative timing between devices. This is problematic if the master is delivering packets containing synchronized audio bound for multiple slave devices, and as such it is the responsibility of the slave devices to maintain synchronization for rendering those packets if the two devices are ear worn left and right stereo audio sink devices.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In previous cases of transferring audio to left and right hearing devices, some systems use classic Bluetooth&#x2122; instead of the BLE protocol to avoid synchronization problems. Other previous systems use a pre-determined time delay (delta) between the left and right audio devices. However, using a pre-determined delta between the left and right devices means the audio source is assumed to have control over the BLE controller to place the events for these devices at that delta, requiring the source to implement a special BLE stack to co-exist with standard BLE.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present subject matter provides systems and methods for synchronizing audio between left and right audio channels arriving asynchronously via wireless protocols, with an undetermined time offset. In some embodiments, the present subject matter can be used to synchronize audio coming from Android&#x2122; devices using an audio streaming for hearing aid (ASIA) protocol or over a generic attribute protocol (GATT) from devices such as MyEye&#x2122; devices from OrCam&#x2122;, in various embodiments. When an Android&#x2122; (or any BLE host) transmits audio to a pair of sink devices (such as hearing devices) using ASHA or GATT, the audio packets arrive asynchronously to the left and right side. Therefore, the audio cannot be played as it arrives since there is phase delay which is not fixed from stream to stream and the amount of this delay is not provided to hearing devices. Thus, the left and right ear audio packets should be synchronized as provided by the present subject matter before they are presented to the user, so that the user has a good listening experience.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a system <b>100</b> for audio synchronization for hearing device applications, according to various embodiments of the present subject matter. In various embodiments, audio events are sent over a BLE connection from a master/host device <b>106</b> to two slave/sink devices, such as one left hearing device <b>102</b> and one right hearing device <b>104</b>, where each slave/sink device is sent one audio event per audio interval. The master/host device <b>106</b> may include any device capable of wireless audio signals, including but not limited to a streaming device, MyEye&#x2122; device, laptop, tablet or smartphone. The audio signals sent by the master/host device <b>106</b> may be of a stereo nature where the left and right channels are time synchronized at the source or they may be monaural in which case the left and right audio information is the same in each audio channel. In either case the slave/sink devices <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> should render the information synchronously. The time division nature of the wireless transport events may come in any order (left first then right, or vice versa), and any spacing between left and right events up to the audio interval are possible and could for example be any number between 2.5 milliseconds (msec) to 17.5 msec if the audio interval is 20 msec, in an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Audio packets sent from the master/host device <b>106</b> are acknowledged by the slave devices <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> when received correctly, and may be retransmitted by the master when the slave does not send an acknowledgement. The audio packets typically have sequence numbers with a modulo counter associated with the packets. To help mitigate lost packets, a packet buffer is typically implemented in each receiver in case packets are lost temporarily over the link. Buffer underflows may occur if the packet error rate is too high or if the receiver is not phase locked to the transmitter. Buffer underflows indicate a re-synchronization is required between receivers.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To aid in synchronization, the present subject matter provides a direct wireless connection between the left device <b>102</b> and the right device <b>104</b>. The direct wireless ear-to-ear connection is used to synchronize the rendering of received audio packets, in various embodiments. In one embodiment, the wireless ear-to-ear connection is made using a BLE communication protocol. In another embodiment, the ear-to-ear connection is uses Near Field Magnetic induction (NFMI). Other types of connections and other types of wireless communication protocols can be used for the direct ear-to-ear connection without departing from the scope of the present subject matter. In the direct wireless ear-to-ear connection, in some embodiments one of the devices (left or right) acts as the master device for the connection between the left and right devices, and each of the left and right devices is capable of acting as the master device in various embodiments. If the devices are powered on and in a connection with one another, the audio sent from a master device such as a cell phone remains muted on both devices until synchronization is achieved, in various embodiments. If one of the ear-worn devices is out of range of the other ear-worn device or powered off, then the available device may decide to render the audio sent from the master, in various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In various embodiments of the synchronization procedure of the present subject matter, each audio packet sent from the master/host of the audio link contains a sequence number. The synchronization algorithm starts when one of the devices that is in the ear-to-ear connection receives an audio packet from the master device of the audio connection, in various embodiments. One of the devices that is in the ear-to-ear connection, on one of the following connection intervals, sends a synchronization packet (including the sequence number of the audio packet from its audio packet buffer that it expects to render) to the other device that is in the ear-to-ear connection, in an embodiment. The other device of the ear-to-ear connection then acknowledges receipt of the synchronization packet, and may then render the same audio packet from its packet buffer. Once the synchronization packet is sent by one device in the ear-to-ear connection and acknowledged successfully by the other device in the ear-to-ear connection, both sides may unmute their audio and begin delivering the synchronized audio to their output transducers thus ensuring audio synchronization between the devices receiving the audio, in various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">To maintain synchronization between the devices receiving the audio (left and right hearing devices, for example), several methods may be employed. In one embodiment, the devices may from time to time either periodically or randomly re-synchronize or at least ensure synchronization by sending messages containing information about the present audio sequence that each device is preparing to render. In another embodiment, if an underfiow of an audio buffer is indicated on either receiving device, that receiving device should initiate the synchronization procedure. In an embodiment, the radio controller may inform the host device if link layer connection parameters have been modified such that the audio interval, connection interval or connection phase has been modified. This information can be used by the radio host processor to signal that synchronization between left and right receiving devices should be activated on the ear-to-ear link between the devices as described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>. In another embodiment, the left and right hearing devices may maintain a counter between packets received from the master of the audio connection. This counter can be on the order of 1 microsecond (&#x3bc;sec) increments, for example. Under normal circumstances, packets will be received at the audio interval corresponding to the radio connection interval. However, under channel conditions that cause packets to be lost, or packets which are received in error, or when the master device has not scheduled an audio packet to be sent in the audio interval, successful audio packets may take more than one connection interval to be received.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a graphical diagram showing timing of reception of audio packets in a system for audio synchronization for hearing device applications, according to various embodiments of the present subject matter. For example, in an audio interval of 20 msec, if a packet is not received due to packet loss it may take 40 or 60 msec to receive a successful packet. The local timer at one of the ear-worn devices which is timing the interval between subsequent audio packets may indicate the time it took to receive the next packet as being longer than the expected value of 20 msec, thus indicating a potential packet lost. Subsequent packets may however be received faster than normal since the master is allowed to transmit pending packets from the host immediately within the same connection event once a packet is acknowledged from the slave, thus allowing the master to &#x201c;catch up&#x201d;. Once the slave is receiving packets again at the 20 msec interval, the slave can assume that both sides are caught up. At the point at which a slave or master has reached the point of having caught up and packets are being received at a normal interval, the slave can look back at the intervals recorded by its packet interval timer and determine if there has been a change of phase and if so, initiate a resynchronization on the ear-to-ear link as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>, which illustrates a flow diagram of a method for audio synchronization for hearing device applications including a host device <b>306</b>, a left hearing device <b>302</b> and a right hearing device <b>304</b>, according to various embodiments of the present subject matter. The application may mute the audio until synchronization is re-established using the synchronization method described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As an example, if the connection interval is 20 msec and a packet is lost, the timer will indicate a packet interval of 40 msec, however the next packet may come in at 1.25 msec later. If the subsequent packet comes in at 18.75 msec then all is normal and no synchronization is required. If, on the other hand, the next packet was received after having received a packet 1.25 msec later, at an interval other than 18.75 msec+n(20 msec) where n is an integer, then the phase of the sent packet has changed and a synchronization procedure should be restarted, in various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another case, if a packet is received at an interval of greater than the audio interval and less than twice the audio interval, then the phase of this audio interval is changed and the device should initiate a synchronization procedure between the ear-worn devices. In various embodiments, additional circumstances that may trigger a re-synchronization include, but are not limited to: (1) an audio packet found in the receive buffer containing a sequence number that is out of order; (2) an underflow of the audio buffer has been detected; (3) a packet is received sooner than expected when packet has loss detection has been cleared; (4) a packet loss has been detected and packet loss has been cleared but the average packet timing once the packet loss is cleared does not equal the audio interval; or (5) a packet is first lost indicated by an audio packet not being received at the audio interval but instead is received at a time equivalent to (n times the audio interval), where n is an integer, indicating a packet loss. The slave device having experienced this situation should keep track of its reception timer. If at any time after having recorded this first loss of packet, the algorithm begins which keeps track of each subsequent packet timings.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a flow diagram of a method for audio synchronization for first and second hearing devices, according to various embodiments of the present subject matter.
