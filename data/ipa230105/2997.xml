The steel pile cofferdam has following advantages: bearing capacity is strong, a construction period is short, materials thereof is recyclable, and water retaining performance is good, which can meet requirements of structural safety, environment protection and the like, therefore, the steel pile cofferdam plays a vital role in the field of foundation construction, and is especially widely used in foundation construction of bridges.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, in a process of bridge construction, a method for constructing the steel sheet pile cofferdam is mainly applied to a soft geological layer including powdered clay and sandy soil, and if the construction method is applied to a construction area with hard geological condition such as an over-sized solitary stone in a gravel layer, the process is difficult and construction progress thereof is slow; and during the process, steel sheet piles are very easy to be damaged and difficult to be piled at a designed elevation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of this, it is required to provide a method for constructing a steel sheet pile cofferdam on a deep sand gravel overburden layer, to ensure that the steel sheet pile cofferdam is easy to be constructed in an area with an over-sized gravel.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The first problem to be solved by the present disclosure is to provide a method for constructing a steel sheet pile cofferdam on a deep sand gravel overburden layer, which is simple in operation, safe and reliable in a construction process and fast in a construction progress.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To solve the above technical problems, a method for constructing a steel sheet pile cofferdam on a deep sand gravel overburden

target depth in the blast hole through a conveyance sleeve, arranging a blasting device, detonating the explosive to break the over-sized boulder subjected to explosion energy of the explosive, and then continuing piling the steel sheet piles to a designed elevation until the steel sheet pile cofferdam is closed by the steel sheet piles;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">step S<b>4</b>, pouring subsealing concrete at a bottom of the steel sheet pile cofferdam;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">step S<b>5</b>, arranging multiple layers of purlins and multiple layers of internal supports within the

pumping water within the steel sheet pile cofferdam through a pump and then pouring to form a bearing platform on the subsealing concrete; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">step S<b>8</b>, removing the steel sheet pile cofferdam after the bearing platform is formed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, in the step S<b>2</b>, the guide frame brackets are arranged in at least two layers, and the guide frame is arranged in at least two layers.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">More preferably, the step S<b>3</b> may further include: during piling the steel sheet piles, when one of the steel sheet piles is unable to continue to be piled resulting from encountering the over-sized boulder, piling the steel sheet pile around the over-sized boulder through trials to determine a planar position, a depth and a size of the over-sized boulder, and estimating a dosage and an influence radius of the explosive.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, preferably, the step S<b>3</b> may further include: after the explosive is fed, filling the blast hole with coarse sand, where a filled length is in a range from 0.8 meters (m) to 1.5 m.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the step S<b>3</b> may further include: drilling the over-sized boulder below the overburden layer through a geological driller

the steel sheet pile cofferdam.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Based the above technical solutions, the method for constructing a steel sheet pile cofferdam on a deep sand gravel overburden layer may at least have the following beneficial effects.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Firstly, a hole is drilled on an over-sized boulder in the deep sand gravel overburden layer through a geological driller cooperative with the steel sleeve tube, an explosive is fed to the hole through the conveyance sleeve, and the explosive is detonated for achieving breaking and disintegration of the over-sized boulder, which can effectively avoid the influence of the over-sized boulder in a deep sand gravel overburden layer on the construction of the steel sheet pile cofferdam and avoid the piled steel sheet pile not reaching a designed elevation, the construction method is efficient and simple, which can greatly improves the construction efficiency of the steel sheet pile cofferdam and has good promotion value.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Secondly, after the over-sized boulder is encountered during the process of piling of the steel sheet piles, the steel sheet pile is struck around the over-sized boulder through trials to determine a planar position, a depth and a size of the over-sized boulder, and a dosage of the explosive is calculated by estimating an approximate volume of the over-sized boulder, and an influence radius is determined according to the dosage of the explosive, which avoids the impact of blasting on surrounding steel sheet piles already piled in.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Thirdly, after the hole drilling operation is completed, in order to ensure the breaking effect of the over-sized boulder, a conveyance sleeve is piled inside the steel sleeve tube, and then the steel sleeve tube is removed, and the explosive and a blasting device is fed to a target position through the conveyance sleeve.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Fourthly, by pouring the subsealing concrete at the bottom of the steel sheet pile cofferdam, it can effectively prevent the water from entering and form a water-free working environment inside the steel sheet pile cofferdam to ensure the safety of construction of the bearing platform, and after the purlins and the internal supports are arranged inside the steel sheet pile cofferdam, the bottom of the steel sheet pile cofferdam is sealed again to ensure bottom sealing effect.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Fifthly, a pump is arranged at the bottom of the steel sheet pile cofferdam, such that a pressure and permeable water at the bottom of the sealed bottom concrete are introduced to the outside of the steel sheet pile cofferdam to avoid a large area of water gushing inside the steel sheet pile cofferdam and to ensure water-free operating environment inside the steel sheet pile cofferdam and thereby to reduce difficulty of construction of the bearing platform and save construction cost.</p><p

According to an actual depth of the steel sheet pile cofferdam, the guide frame brackets <b>2</b> and the guide frame can also be set in multiple layers, for effectively increasing installation convenience of the steel sheet pile cofferdam.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the step S<b>3</b> may include: during piling the steel piles, when the steel sheet pile is unable to continue to be piled resulting from encountering the over-sized boulder, the steel sheet pile <b>3</b> is piled around the over-sized boulder <b>9</b> through trials to determine a planar position, a depth and a size of the over-sized boulder <b>9</b>, and a dosage and an influence radius of the explosive <b>12</b> are estimated.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">After the planar position, the depth and the size of boulder <b>9</b> are determined, the steel sheet piles <b>3</b> in an area of the boulder <b>9</b> are required to be pulled out. After the steel sheet piles <b>3</b> are pulled out, a drilling position of a geological driller is determined using a fixing device, and the geological driller cooperates with a steel sleeve tube <b>10</b> to drill the over-sized boulder <b>9</b> to form the blast hole. After the boulder <b>9</b> is drilled, a gravel or sundries around the blast hole is cleaned up to prevent the gravel or the sundries from falling into the blast hole to fill the blast hole. Next, the blast hole will be strictly inspected by a blasting engineer and technician. If the blast hole is found to be inconsistent with a designed size, a corresponding measure is taken to correct the blast hole in time to ensure that the blast hole can be adapted for performing corresponding operations. Then, the conveyance sleeve <b>11</b> is piled into the steel sleeve tube <b>10</b> to reach the blast hole, and the explosive <b>12</b> is delivered into the drilled blast hole through the conveyance sleeve <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It should be noted herein that, the over-sized is not limited specifically. During piling the steel sheet piles <b>3</b>, when the steel sheet pile <b>3</b> is prevented by a boulder with a specific size from continuing to travel downwards, so that the steel sheet piles <b>3</b> cannot reach the designed elevation, the boulder <b>9</b> with this specific size can be understood as the over-sized boulder <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Preferably, in step S<b>3</b>, after the explosive <b>12</b> is fed, coarse sand is used to fill the blast hole, and a filled length is in a range from 0.8 meters (m) to 1.5 m.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Preferably, the filling length is 1 m. During the construction, it is not allowed to increase the dosage of the explosive <b>12</b> or change the filled length at will. When filling the hole, the compactness of filled materials should be ensured to prevent filling from hanging up, and a nonel tube should be not pulled too tightly, so as to avoid corresponding damage.

A water surface width of the main bridge is about 540 m. A maximum value of a water depth thereof is about 4.5 m, and the water depth has a change range from 1.0 m to 1.5 m. Under a current river condition, a design peak flow corresponding to a bridge section P=0.33% is 6350 m<sup>3</sup>/second (s), and a corresponding flood level is 1206.99 m; a design peak flow corresponding to a bridge section P=5% is 5620 m<sup>3</sup>/s, and a corresponding flood level is 1206.69 m; a design peak flow corresponding to a bridge section P=10% is 5530 m<sup>3</sup>/s, and a corresponding flood level of 1206.66 m. Bridge piers 8# to 13# of the main bridge of Zhenhuang River Bridge is located in the Yellow River. According to a design specification, a highest flood level is 1206.99 m, and a height difference between a top surface of the bearing platform and the highest flood level is in a range from 4.539 m to 7.078 m. Geological conditions at the bridge piers are complex, and a stratum is divided from top to bottom into following layers: a silty clay layer of a depth from 0.8 m to 2.5 m with a fine sand layer of a depth from 1.4 m to 1.5 m, and a gravel layer of a depth from 4.6 m to 22.9 m with a silty clay layer of a depth from 0.8 m to 2.5 m, and a fine sand layer of a depth from 1.4 m to 1.5 m.

Because the gravel layer is thick and there is an over-sized boulder <b>9</b> in the gravel layer, it is difficult to pile the steel sheet piles <b>3</b> to a designed elevation, it is required to pull out the blocked steel sheet pile <b>3</b> and drill a blast hole and perform a blasting operation in the blast hole at the original position, to break and disintegrate the over-sized boulder <b>9</b> in the thick gravel layer.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">3. The blocked steel sheet pile <b>3</b> at the original position is piled through trials, to determine a planar position and a depth of the over-sized boulder <b>9</b>, and estimate a size of the over-sized boulder <b>9</b> and determine a dosage of an explosive according to the determined size of the boulder <b>9</b>, and pull out the steel sheet pile <b>3</b> around a blasting influence area that has been successfully piled according to the blasting influence area.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">4. A geological driller is used to drill the over-sized boulder <b>9</b> to take the blast hole. It should be noted that, the geological driller is used to cooperate with the steel sleeve tube <b>10</b>, which can avoid collapse phenomenon of the blast hole and ensure accurate feeding of explosives to a target location.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">5. After drilling and taking the blast hole, gravels or sundries around the blast hole are cleaned up to prevent the gravels or sundries from falling into the blast hole and blocking the blast hole.
