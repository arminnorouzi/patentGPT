Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a control system with cascade driving circuits and a related driving method, and more particularly, to a synchronization technique performed on a control system with cascade driving circuits and a related synchronization method.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the data quantity to be processed in a control system increases and increases, a multi-chip system may be required. The deployment of multiple chips allows a tremendous amount of data to be processed successfully. In a multi-chip system, the chips may be coupled in series as a cascade structure, where each chip may receive signals from the previous one and forward the signals to the next one. The transmitted signals may be received by each chip in the system to realize a specific purpose, such as driving a panel to emit light or further optimizing the display image. Therefore, due to the high resolution of the modern display system, a single chip may not be enough to deal with the tremendous quantity of display data, and the multi-chip system may be more feasible.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the chips are coupled in series, the signals to be processed by a chip may come from its previous chips. Thus, there is a time delay on the signal flow from one chip to another, and a time difference of signal reception arises between different chips. In order to allow the chips to operate normally, processing of the signals should be synchronized. For example, in a display system where the panel is driven by multiple chips, the display data output by different chips should be synchronized with each other. Thus, how to synchronize the operations of the chips in a multi-chip system has become an important issue in this art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide a control system composed of cascade chips and a related driving method to perform synchronization between the chips.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An embodiment of the present invention discloses a control system comprising a plurality of driving circuits coupled in series. The plurality of driving circuits comprise a first driving circuit and a second driving circuit. The first driving circuit comprises a first receiver, a first transmitter and a first flag signal selector. The first transmitter is coupled to the first receiver, and the first flag signal selector is coupled between the first receiver and the first transmitter. The second driving circuit, coupled to the first driving circuit, comprises a second receiver, a second transmitter and a second flag signal selector. The second transmitter is coupled to the second receiver, and the second flag signal selector is coupled between the second receiver and the second transmitter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another embodiment of the present invention discloses a driving circuit, which comprises a receiver, a transmitter and a flag signal selector. The transmitter is coupled to the receiver. The flag signal selector is coupled between the receiver and the transmitter. Wherein, the flag signal selector comprises a select circuit coupled to output terminals of a plurality of flip-flops.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another embodiment of the present invention discloses a method of driving a controller for a control system having a plurality of driving circuits coupled in series. The plurality of driving circuits comprise a first driving circuit and a second driving circuit. The method comprises steps of: receiving, by the first driving circuit, a first signal from a previous stage; transmitting, by the first driving circuit, the first signal to the second driving circuit; delaying the first signal to generate a second signal according to a flag signal by performing at least one of the following steps: selecting a first flag signal from a plurality of first flag signals corresponding to different clock cycles in each of the first driving circuit and the second driving circuit; and selecting a second flag signal from a plurality of second flag signals corresponding to different phases in each of the first driving circuit and the second driving circuit; and controlling a timing of outputting the second signal to the controller by using the selected flag signal, to synchronize the second signal output by the first driving circuit and the second driving circuit.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a control system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> are schematic diagrams of a control system according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrate exemplary implementations of the delay circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a waveform diagram illustrating the waveforms of the clock signals.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a control system according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart of a synchronization process according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which is a schematic diagram of a control system <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the control system <b>10</b> includes controllers <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, and driving circuits N<b>0</b>, N<b>1</b>, M<b>0</b> and M<b>1</b> for controlling the controllers <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, respectively. In detail, the driving circuits N<b>0</b> and N<b>1</b> are used for driving the controller <b>102</b> and the driving circuits M<b>0</b> and M<b>1</b> are used for driving the controller <b>104</b>. Each driving circuit may be an integrated circuit (IC) implemented in a chip. Therefore, the driving circuits N<b>0</b> and N<b>1</b> may be a chipset configured to control the controller <b>102</b>, and the driving circuits M<b>0</b> and M<b>1</b> maybe a chipset configured to control the controller <b>104</b>. The controllers <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> may broadly refer to any type of control circuit being served as a load receiving controls from the driving circuits and/or providing a control function.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In detail, in the control system <b>10</b>, the driving circuits are coupled in series. A signal source may provide a data or clock signal for each of the driving circuits, and transmit the data or clock signal to the driving circuit in the first stage. This driving circuit then forwards the data or clock signal to the driving circuit in the next stage, and so on. As for each driving circuit, the data or clock signal may be received from the signal source or the driving circuit in the previous stage. In addition, each driving circuit (except for those in the last stage) may transmit the data or clock signal to the next stage.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Therefore, since each controller is controlled by multiple driving circuits, these driving circuits configured to control the same controller need to be synchronized. In other words, the driving signals of the driving circuits sent to the same controller need to be synchronized with each other. In the control system <b>10</b>, the driving circuits N<b>0</b> and N<b>1</b> for controlling the controller <b>102</b> need to be synchronized, and the driving circuits M<b>0</b> and M<b>1</b> for controlling the controller <b>104</b> need to be synchronized.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Please note that the control system <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is merely served to illustrate an exemplary control system where each controller is controlled by two driving circuits. In another embodiment, a controller may be controlled by more than two driving circuits, and/or the control system may include any number of controllers receiving controls from the driving circuits. If a controller is controlled by more than two driving circuits, all of these driving circuits need to be synchronized with each other.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, each of the controllers <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> may be a light board as a segment of a splicing screen of a display panel such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel, a light-emitting diode (LED) display panel, or a micro-LED display panel. Therefore, the data or clock signals forwarded between the driving circuits may include display data and/or control signals for controlling the parameters associated with display image, optical features, sound features, etc. of the display panel. Alternatively, the data or clock signals may be used to generate the display data and/or control signals. However, in the control system <b>10</b>, the signals are forwarded between the driving circuits stage by stage; hence, there is a timing difference of signal reception between each driving circuit. That is, a driving circuit in the former stage may receive the signals earlier, while a driving circuit in the latter stage may receive the signals later. Therefore, the driving circuits should be synchronized appropriately, so that the driving signals of the driving circuits for controlling the controller and the corresponding display panel will be output with a synchronous timing, allowing the image to be shown correctly.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment, the control system <b>10</b> may be any other type of electronic system, and should not be limited to the display system described herein. Based on the applications of the controller, if the output signals of multiple driving circuits are cooperated to realize a predetermined function, these output signals should be synchronized. As mentioned above, each driving circuit may be an IC implemented in a chip; hence, the synchronization is performed between chip and chip.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, the driving circuits are synchronized using a delay replica scheme. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which is a schematic diagram of a control system <b>20</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the control system <b>20</b> includes a controller <b>202</b> and two driving circuits D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>. The controller <b>202</b> may receive driving signals S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> from the driving circuits D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>, respectively. The driving circuits D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> may be two of a plurality of driving circuits coupled in series included in the control system <b>20</b>, where the driving circuit D<b>1</b> may receive a data or clock signal from the signal source or a driving circuit in the previous stage, and forward the data or clock signal to the driving circuit D<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In detail, the driving circuit D<b>1</b> includes a receiver RX<b>1</b>, a transmitter TX<b>1</b> and an output buffer BF<b>1</b>, and the driving circuit D<b>2</b> includes a receiver RX<b>2</b>, a transmitter TX<b>2</b> and an output buffer BF<b>2</b>. The receiver RX<b>2</b> of the driving circuit D<b>2</b> is coupled to the transmitter TX<b>1</b> of the driving circuit D<b>1</b>, allowing the driving circuit D<b>2</b> to receive the data or clock signal from the driving circuit D<b>1</b>. The receivers RX<b>1</b> and RX<b>2</b> may include circuitry capable of receiving signals from the previous stage. The transmitters TX<b>1</b> and TX<b>2</b> may include circuitry capable of transmitting signals to the next stage. The output buffers BF<b>1</b> and BF<b>2</b> are configured to output the driving signals S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> to drive the controller <b>202</b>, respectively, and the output driving signals S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> need to be synchronized. That is, the timing of the driving circuit D<b>2</b> outputting the driving signal S<b>2</b> to the controller <b>202</b> is synchronized with the timing of the driving circuit D<b>1</b> outputting the driving signal S<b>1</b> to the controller <b>202</b>. Note that each of the output buffers BF<b>1</b> and BF<b>2</b> may be composed of a buffer circuit such as a register, a D flip-flop, or any other type of circuit capable of forwarding the received data or clock signal. Alternatively, the output buffer BF<b>1</b> or BF<b>2</b> may include a processing circuit, which may identify and process the data signals to generate the driving signals S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> for the controller <b>202</b> based on the received data signals. In an embodiment, if the controller <b>202</b> includes a display panel configured to receive the driving signals S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> from the driving circuits D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>, each of the output buffers BF<b>1</b> and BF<b>2</b> may include a level shifter configured to convert the level of the signals to be compatible with the display panel, and/or include an operational amplifier capable of driving the large panel loading. In another embodiment, the output buffers BF<b>1</b> and BF<b>2</b> may be omitted, and the signals from the receiver or replica receiver may be directly output to the controller <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this embodiment, the output buffer BF<b>1</b> of the driving circuit D<b>1</b> may output the driving signal S<b>1</b> by receiving the data or clock signal, and the output buffer BF<b>2</b> of the driving circuit D<b>2</b> may output the driving signal S<b>2</b> by receiving the same data or clock signal. Since the driving circuit D<b>1</b> is previous to the driving circuit D<b>2</b>, the driving circuit D<b>1</b> may receive the data or clock signal prior to the driving circuit D<b>2</b>. In order to synchronize the driving signals S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>, the driving circuit D<b>1</b> may further include a replica receiver RRX<b>1</b>, which is coupled to the output terminal of the transmitter TX<b>1</b> (and also coupled to the input terminal of the receiver RX<b>2</b> of the driving circuit D<b>2</b>). The replica receiver RRX<b>1</b> may have a circuit structure similar to the structure of the receiver RX<b>2</b>, so as to generate a delay time identical to the delay time generated by the receiver RX<b>2</b>. In addition, the replica receiver RRX<b>1</b> is disposed in the output path of the data or clock signal, e.g., coupled to the output terminal of the transmitter TX<b>1</b>. Therefore, the data or clock signal from the input terminal of the driving circuit D<b>1</b> may be sent to the output buffer BF<b>1</b> through the receiver RX<b>1</b>, the transmitter TX<b>1</b> and the replica receiver RRX<b>1</b>, and the same data or clock signal from the input terminal of the driving circuit D<b>1</b> may be sent to the output buffer BF<b>2</b> through the receiver RX<b>1</b>, the transmitter TX<b>1</b> and receiver RX<b>2</b>, so that the data or clock signal may reach the output buffers BF<b>1</b> and BF<b>2</b> at the same time. In addition, the output buffers BF<b>1</b> and BF<b>2</b> may have the same circuit structure, allowing the driving signals to be output with well synchronization.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In such a situation, the synchronization may be easily realized without large area and high cost, where only one additional replica receiver is included. Preferably, the circuit structure of the replica receiver RRX<b>1</b> may be exactly identical to the circuit structure of the receiver RX<b>2</b>. In addition, the process variation between the replica receiver RRX<b>1</b> and the receiver RX<b>2</b> may be minimized by using layout techniques. For example, the driving circuit D<b>1</b> may further include a dummy transmitter coupled to the output terminal of the replica receiver RRX<b>1</b>, where the circuit structure of the dummy transmitter may be identical to the circuit structure of the transmitter TX<b>2</b> of the driving circuit D<b>2</b>. This allows the output loading of the replica receiver RRX<b>1</b> to be identical to the output loading of the receiver RX<b>2</b>. As a result, the replica receiver RRX<b>1</b> and the receiver RX<b>2</b> may generate almost the same delay time on the signals, allowing the signals to be well synchronized.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Please note that the delay replica scheme of the present invention may also be applicable to synchronize more than two driving circuits in a control system.

The data or clock signal is forwarded from the driving circuit D<b>1</b> to D<b>2</b> and D<b>3</b> in sequence.

The delay time between each driving circuit may be monitored based on the output time of the flag signal. Without any synchronization operation, a flag signal of a driving circuit in the former stage may be output earlier, and a flag signal of a driving circuit in the latter stage may be output later. The time difference of outputting the flag signals stands for the delay time between the two driving circuits. According to the delay frame start scheme, the flag signal may be output by selecting different delay times for different driving circuits to perform synchronization on the flag signal, allowing the driving signals of the driving circuits to be output at the same time.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, which is a schematic diagram of a further control system <b>40</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.
