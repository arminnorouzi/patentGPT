level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to methods and systems for upgrading pyrolysis oil, more specifically, methods and systems for upgrading pyrolysis oil to light aromatic compounds using two stage catalytic process.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Background</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Crude oil can be converted to valuable chemical intermediates and products through one or more refinery processes. The refinery processes can include steam cracking, in which larger hydrocarbons in the crude oil are cracked to form smaller hydrocarbons. Steam cracking units produce a bottom stream, which is referred to as pyrolysis oil. The pyrolysis oil may include an increased concentration of aromatic compounds compared to the crude oil feedstock. In many crude oil processing facilities, this pyrolysis oil is burned as fuel. However, the aromatic compounds in the pyrolysis oil can be converted to greater value chemical products and intermediates, which can be used as building blocks in chemical synthesis processes. For example, aromatic compounds from the pyrolysis oil can be converted into xylenes, which can be the initial building blocks for producing terephthalic acid, which can then be used to produce polyesters. The aromatic compounds in the pyrolysis oil can be upgraded to many other greater value aromatic products and intermediates. The market demand for these greater value aromatic compounds continues to grow.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multi-ring aromatic compounds in the pyrolysis oil can be converted to light aromatic compounds, which can include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BTEX), other aromatic compounds, or combinations of these by various reactions, such as, but not limited to hydrogenation, ring opening, disproportionation, dealkylation, transalkylation, cracking, or aromatic cracking. In general, these conventional processes convert a portion of the multi-ring aromatic compounds in the pyrolysis oil to light aromatic compounds in a single step. However, the single step process may be complex and insufficient to meet the demand for BTEX. Further, these conventional process may be difficult to accomplish without employing severe conditions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, ongoing needs exist for improved systems and methods for upgrading pyrolysis oils to produce light aromatic compounds to increase the yield of BTEX using mild processing conditions. Embodiments of the present disclosure meet this need by providing a two stage catalytic process, which may upgrade pyrolysis oils to BTEX in a single process by using two slurry reactors in series. The first slurry reactor may include a mixed metal oxide catalyst and may be operable to convert at least a portion of multi-ring compounds in the pyrolysis oil to intermediate aromatic compounds, such as di-aromatic compounds. The second slurry reactor may include a mesoporous zeolite supported metal catalyst and may be operable to convert at least a portion of the intermediate aromatic compounds to BTEX. The methods and systems may convert a portion of the multi-ring aromatic compounds in the pyrolysis oil to BTEX in a two stage catalytic process, without conducting a subsequent chemical reaction step. The methods and systems may also produce greater yields of BTEX from upgrading pyrolysis under mild conditions compared to upgrading pyrolysis oil according to conventional methods.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one or more aspects of the present disclosure, a method for upgrading pyrolysis oil may include contacting a pyrolysis oil feed with hydrogen in the presence of a mixed metal oxide catalyst in a first slurry reactor. The pyrolysis oil feed may include multi-ring aromatic compounds comprising greater than or equal to sixteen carbon atoms. The mixed metal oxide catalyst may include a plurality of catalyst particles and each of the plurality of catalyst particles comprises a plurality of different metal oxides. The method may further include contacting the pyrolysis oil feed with hydrogen in the presence of the mixed metal oxide catalyst in the first slurry reactor to convert at least a portion of the multi-ring aromatic compounds in the pyrolysis oil feed to light aromatic compounds comprising di-aromatic compounds, tri-aromatic compounds, or both, and passing an intermediate stream comprising the light aromatic compounds to a second slurry reactor downstream of the first slurry reactor. The method may further include contacting the intermediate stream with hydrogen in the presence of a mesoporous zeolite supported metal catalyst in a second slurry reactor to convert at least a portion of the light aromatic compounds in the intermediate stream to react to form aromatic compounds having six to eight carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one or more other aspects of the present disclosure, a system for upgrading pyrolysis oil may include a first slurry reactor comprising a mixed metal oxide catalyst. The mixed metal oxide catalyst may include a plurality of catalyst particles and each of the plurality of catalyst particles comprises a plurality of different metal oxides. The first slurry reactor may be operable to contact a pyrolysis oil feed with hydrogen in the presence of the mixed metal oxide catalyst to produce a first reactor effluent comprising light aromatic compounds that include di-aromatic compounds, tri-aromatic compounds, or both. The system may further include a first separator disposed downstream of the first slurry reactor and operable to separate the first reactor effluent to produce a used mixed metal oxide catalyst and an intermediate stream comprising the light aromatic compounds, and a second slurry reactor downstream of the first separator and comprising a mesoporous zeolite supported metal catalyst.

Product streams may be further processed in accompanying chemical processing systems or may be commercialized as end products. System inlet streams may be streams transferred from accompanying chemical processing systems or may be non-processed feedstock streams.

In particular, the methods may comprise contacting the pyrolysis oil feed <b>102</b> with hydrogen <b>104</b> in the presence of a mixed metal oxide catalyst <b>106</b> at reaction conditions to produce a first reactor effluent <b>114</b> comprising light aromatic compounds, passing an intermediate stream <b>122</b> comprising the light aromatic compounds to a second slurry reactor <b>130</b> downstream of the first slurry reactor <b>110</b>, and contacting the intermediate stream <b>122</b> with hydrogen <b>132</b> in the presence of a mesoporous zeolite supported metal catalyst <b>126</b> at reaction conditions to produce at least one product effluent <b>142</b> comprising aromatic compounds having six to eight carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The various methods and systems of the present disclosure for upgrading pyrolysis oil may increase the yields of BTEX through a two stage catalytic process under mild conditions. Traditionally, pyrolysis oil has not been able to be upgraded to xylenes in a single processing step under mild conditions. Further, existing single step processes can be complex and can be insufficient to meet the demand of BTEX.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the methods and systems of the present disclosure, the pyrolysis oil may be contacted with hydrogen in the presence of the mixed metal oxide catalyst to covert multi-ring aromatic compounds in the pyrolysis oil to light aromatic compounds comprising di-aromatic compounds, tri-aromatic compounds, or both, and then the light aromatic compounds may be contacted with hydrogen in the presence of the mesoporous zeolite supported metal catalyst to form aromatic compounds having six to eight carbon atoms, such as BTEX. These two stage catalytic processes may increase the yields of BTEX through a single process by using two slurry reactors in series under mild conditions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;catalyst&#x201d; may refer to any substance that increases the rate of a specific chemical reaction. Catalysts and catalyst components described in this disclosure may be utilized to promote various reactions, such as, but not limited to selective hydrogenation, ring opening, disproportionation, dealkylation, hydrodealkylation, transalkylation, cracking, aromatic cracking, other chemical reactions, or combinations of these.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;cracking&#x201d; may refer to a chemical reaction where a molecule having carbon-carbon bonds is broken into more than one molecule by the breaking of one or more of the carbon-carbon bonds; where a compound including a cyclic moiety, such as an aromatic, is converted to a compound that does not include a cyclic moiety; or where a molecule having carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to carbon-carbon single bonds. Some catalysts may have multiple forms of catalytic activity, and calling a catalyst by one particular function does not render that catalyst incapable of being catalytically active for other functionality.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used in this disclosure, the term &#x201c;aromatic compounds&#x201d; may refer to one or more compounds having one or more aromatic ring structures. The term &#x201c;light aromatic compounds&#x201d; may refer to one or more compounds having an aromatic ring, with or without substitution, and from six to eight carbon atoms. The term &#x201c;BTEX&#x201d; may refer to any combination of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, para-xylene, meta-xylene, and ortho-xylene.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used in this disclosure, the term &#x201c;xylenes,&#x201d; when used without a designation of the isomer, such as the prefix para, meta, or ortho, may refer to one or more of meta-xylene, ortho-xylene, para-xylene, and mixtures of these xylene isomers.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used in this disclosure, the term &#x201c;outer surfaces&#x201d; may refer to surfaces at the outer periphery of a catalyst or catalyst support, such as the hierarchical mesoporous zeolite support.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used in this disclosure, the term &#x201c;pore surfaces&#x201d; may refer to the inner surfaces of pores in a catalyst or catalyst support, where the pores include at least the pores in fluid communication with the outer surfaces of the catalyst or catalyst support and are accessible to reactants.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used in this disclosure, the &#x201c;average pore size&#x201d; of a catalyst or catalyst support may refer to the average pore size determined by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) analysis. BJH analysis measures the amount of a gas (argon) that detaches from a material, such as the hierarchical mesoporous zeolite support, at 87 Kelvin over a range of pressures. Using the Kelvin equation, the amount of argon adsorbate removed from the pores of the material and the relative pressure of the system can be used to calculate the average pore size of the material.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used throughout the present disclosure, the terms &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; may refer to the relative positioning of unit operations with respect to the direction of flow of the process streams. A first unit operation of a system may be considered &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; of a second unit operation if process streams flowing through the system encounter the first unit operation before encountering the second unit operation. Likewise, a second unit operation may be considered &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; of the first unit operation if the process streams flowing through the system encounter the first unit operation before encountering the second unit operation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used in the present disclosure, passing a stream or effluent from one unit &#x201c;directly&#x201d; to another unit may refer to passing the stream or effluent from the first unit to the second unit without passing the stream or effluent through an intervening reaction system or separation system that substantially changes the composition of the stream or effluent. Heat transfer devices, such as heat exchangers, preheaters, coolers, condensers, or other heat transfer equipment, and pressure devices, such as pumps, pressure regulators, compressors, or other pressure devices, are not considered to be intervening systems that change the composition of a stream or effluent. Combining two streams or effluents together upstream of a process unit also is not considered to comprise an intervening system that changes the composition of one or both of the streams or effluents being combined. Simply dividing a stream into two streams having the same composition is also not considered to comprise an intervening system that changes the composition of the stream.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;separator&#x201d; refers to any separation device that at least partially separates one or more chemicals that are mixed in a process stream from one another. For example, a separator may selectively separate differing chemical species from one another, forming one or more chemical fractions. Examples of separators include, without limitation, distillation columns, flash drums, knock-out drums, knock-out pots, centrifuges, filtration devices, traps, scrubbers, expansion devices, membranes, solvent extraction devices, and the like. It should be understood that separation processes described in this disclosure may not completely separate all of one chemical consistent from all of another chemical constituent. It should be understood that the separation processes described in this disclosure &#x201c;at least partially&#x201d; separate different chemical components from one another, and that even if not explicitly stated, it should be understood that separation may include only partial separation. As used in this disclosure, one or more chemical constituents may be &#x201c;separated&#x201d; from a process stream to form a new process stream. Generally, a process stream may enter a separator and be divided or separated into two or more process streams of desired composition. Further, in some separation processes, a &#x201c;light fraction&#x201d; and a &#x201c;heavy fraction&#x201d; may separately exit the separator. In general, the light fraction stream has a lesser boiling point than the heavy fraction stream. It should be additionally understood that where only one separator is depicted in a figure or described, two or more separators may be employed to carry out the identical or substantially identical separation. For example, where a distillation column with multiple outlets is described, it is contemplated that several separators arranged in series may equally separate the feed stream and such embodiments are within the scope of the presently described embodiments.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used in this disclosure, the term &#x201c;effluent&#x201d; may refer to a stream that is passed out of a reactor, a reaction zone, or a separator following a particular reaction or separation process. Generally, an effluent has a different composition than the stream that entered the separator, reactor, or reaction zone. It should be understood that when an effluent is passed to another system unit, only a portion of that system stream may be passed. For example, a slip stream (having the same composition) may carry some of the effluent away, meaning that only a portion of the effluent may enter the downstream system unit. The term &#x201c;reaction effluent&#x201d; may more particularly be used to refer to a stream that is passed out of a reactor or reaction zone.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should further be understood that streams may be named for the components of the stream, and the component for which the stream is named may be the major component of the stream (such as comprising from 50 weight percent (wt. %), from 70 wt. %, from 90 wt. %, from 95 wt. %, from 99 wt. %, from 99.5 wt. %, or even from 99.9 wt. % of the contents of the stream to 100 wt. % of the contents of the stream). It should also be understood that components of a stream are disclosed as passing from one system component to another when a stream comprising that component is disclosed as passing from that system component to another. For example, a disclosed &#x201c;hydrogen stream&#x201d; passing to a first system component or from a first system component to a second system component should be understood to equivalently disclose &#x201c;hydrogen&#x201d; passing to the first system component or passing from a first system component to a second system component.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a system <b>100</b> for upgrading pyrolysis oil feed <b>102</b> is schematically depicted.
