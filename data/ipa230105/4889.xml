More specifically, but not by way of limitation, this disclosure relates to database improvements that provide the ability to link data anonymously between separate data sources.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As regulations protecting privacy become increasingly common and stringent, it becomes increasingly important to find ways to anonymously and securely handle data in distributed systems. Typically, when integrating data across different databases, personally identifying information (PII) is exchanged. Some solutions to reduce transmission of PII between systems include using a shared identifier as a placeholder for such PII data. However, even when transmitting a shared identifier, sensitive information can be extracted.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As an example application, risk monitoring is common in the context of credit. Such monitoring involves analyzing a great deal of data from widely distributed computing devices, as thousands of transactions are conducted every day, and each may have an impact on credit risk. Employers, such as government agencies, use credit reports as part of the background investigation process and for periodic review of employees. Particularly for government agencies handling sensitive information, the employees must also be periodically reviewed for risk indicators such as financial strain. Traditionally, these periodic reviews are conducted by retrieving employee credit reports from a credit monitoring service every few years or several times per year. However, a credit report is out of date the day after it is pulled. Thus, current methods for identifying risk indicators in such inside-threat contexts are inefficient and ineffective. Moreover, by sharing the credit report repeatedly, a credit inquiry is recorded to the credit file. Thus, frequent credit monitoring of an individual runs the risk of revealing the identity of the individual. This is particularly problematic in the case of individuals holding security clearances, as such information may be used to infer participation in intelligence agencies or other protected groups.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems and methods for continuous and anonymous risk evaluation. A monitoring system may monitor a periodically updated dataset for warnings or indicators of an insider threat. An insider threat is a threat to an organization originating within the organization, such as from employees or contractors with access to data, computer systems, and security processes. An insider threat may, for example, arise if an employee falls under financial stress and sells confidential information. By identifying preliminary indicators of such an insider threat, losses can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one example, a server computer of a monitoring system can receive, from a requesting entity computer (e.g., associated with an employer), a request for monitoring of a plurality of target entities. For each target entity, of the plurality of target entities, the request comprises a first identifier associated with the target entity and information about the target entity. For each target entity, of the plurality of target entities, the server computer generates a second identifier associated with the target entity based on the information about the target entity, the second identifier being prevented from being provided to the requesting entity computer. The server computer generates a third identifier associated with the monitored target entity when a rule is satisfied or threshold exceeded. The generated result is associated by the third identifier for reference as a randomly-generated, transaction ID. The server computer stores, in a secure database, a mapping of the second identifier to the first identifier and the third identifier when a result is generated through monitoring. The server computer monitors a periodically updated data set and determines a risk metric for the target entity based on monitoring the periodically updated data set. The server computer compares the risk metric of the target entity to a threshold value to identify a subset of the plurality of target entities discovering events defined as risk indicators of an insider threat and assigns corresponding third identifiers. The server computer provides the third identifiers with the risk indicators to the requesting entity computer. Responsive to providing the third identifiers, the server computer receives, from the requesting entity computer, a request for a first identifier associated with a unique third identifier. The server computer uses the third identifier and the stored mapping to identify the requested first identifier, and provides the first identifier and the third identifier to the requesting entity computer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used in isolation to determine the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The system may monitor a periodically updated dataset for warnings or indicators of an event, such as exceeding a threshold value on a credit attribute, and anonymously report on identified events.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, multiple identifiers are used to obfuscate sensitive data such as personally identifying information or derivatives thereof. A first computing system may hold PII, and use services offered by a second computing system to derive results based on the PII. The PII may be shared in association with a first identifier known to both the computing systems. This first identifier will not be further used by the second computing system unless the results should be revealed under limited circumstances. The second computing system uses a second identifier for internal analysis, which is mapped to the first identifier in a secure database. If the results of the data analysis indicate that the first computing system may deem it appropriate to &#x201c;unmask&#x201d; the result, then the second computing system may generate a third identifier, add the third identifier to the stored mapping, and transmit the third identifier to the first computing system without PII or the other identifiers. Only if the first computing system confirms that the results should be unmasked, will the second computing system use the stored mapping reveal the first identifier which the first computing system can link to the PII.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">One application of these techniques is monitoring a population of target entities such as employees while remaining compliant with regulations. For example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires credit inquiries, such as an employer checking the credit of an employee, to be posted to the employee's credit report. This creates a tension with the need to safeguard such a population. If a particular employee is continuously being monitored, and this shows up on the employee's credit report, bad actors may be able to infer that this employee is likely in an agency that requires security clearances, which is a national security risk.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, multiple identifiers are used to obfuscate the identity of target entities such as employees that are being monitored. When a requesting entity such as an employer sends a request for monitoring, the requesting entity sends an identifier that identifies the target entity to both the requesting entity and the monitoring system. This identifier will not be further used by the monitoring system unless the requesting entity determines, based on anonymized risk information, that the identity of the target entity should be revealed. Only at this point will a hit be put on the credit file of the target entity. Accordingly, because the various target entities are being monitored anonymously, the credit hit will not occur during the monitoring phase, which prevents revealing the monitored population.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">This can be achieved by leveraging a first identifier, a second identifier, and a third identifier for each target entity. The second identifier is generated based on information about the target entity, which may include personally identifying information such as a name, social security number, address, and so forth. The second identifier is used within the monitoring system to keep data associated with the target entity updated. The third identifier is randomly generated with the risk data and used to anonymously report the target entity's results.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The monitoring system gathers information about various target entities. The information may be obtained from periodic reports from credit reporting agencies, employers, courts, and the like. Relevant information may include whether an individual is past due on a credit instrument and how long (e.g., 30 days, 90 days, 120 days, etc.), debt amount, credit score, new credit inquiries, criminal record, and jobs held.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Based on the data about a given target entity, the monitoring system may determine a risk metric. The risk metric may be a defined event or may be determined using a predictive model such as a neural network or regression model. Such a model may be trained on a general population, filtered using characteristic traits, in order to further preserve privacy for the monitored population. Using the trained model, the system can generate a risk metric indicative of insider threat. The risk metric may factor in parameters such as days past due on a credit instrument, total debt, new debt, criminal activity, and/or unexpected changes in funds or employment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the event that a comparison of the risk metric to threshold value generates a result for the target entity which indicates an insider threat, the monitoring system may send a risk report or visualization that anonymously identifies a certain subset of the population as corresponding to different risk levels. The requesting entity can determine which individuals should have their identities revealed, and request the first identifier(s) for those individuals using the third identifier.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Upon receiving a request for the first identifier for a target entity, the monitoring system may transmit the first identifier and the third identifier back to the requesting entity. At this point, and not sooner, the credit file of the target entity may reflect the monitoring. Accordingly, the techniques described herein can limit the pattern of monitoring to those cases where an insider threat is most likely. This avoids unnecessarily exposing the identity of other target entities, protects their privacy, and increases the security and efficiency of the process.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">These illustrative examples are given to introduce the reader to the general subject matter discussed here and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosed concepts. The following sections describe various additional features and examples with reference to the drawings in which like numerals indicate like elements, and directional descriptions are used to describe the illustrative examples but, like the illustrative examples, should not be used to limit the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Operating Environment Example</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram depicting an example of an operating environment <b>100</b> for continuous and anonymous risk evaluation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts examples of hardware components of an operating environment <b>100</b>, according to some aspects. The operating environment <b>100</b> is a specialized computing system that may be used for processing large amounts of data using a large number of computer processing cycles. The numbers of devices depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are provided for illustrative purposes. Different numbers of devices may be used. For example, while each device, server, and system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is shown as a single device, multiple devices may instead be used.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The operating environment <b>100</b> may include a monitoring system <b>106</b>. The monitoring system <b>106</b> may be a specialized computer or other machine that processes the data received within the operating environment <b>100</b>. The monitoring system <b>106</b> may include one or more other systems. For example, the monitoring system <b>106</b> may include systems such as a communications grid (a grid-based computing system for processing large amounts of data).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The operating environment <b>100</b> may include a requesting entity system <b>102</b>. The requesting entity system <b>102</b> may be associated with an entity, such as an employer, that seeks to monitor target entities, such as employees, for insider threats. An insider threat may, for example, correspond to an employee with characteristics which indicate a risk of exposing classified information, stealing, selling secrets, and/or the like. Thus, the requesting entity may use the services of monitoring system <b>106</b> to monitor for such an insider threat. The requesting entity system <b>102</b> may maintain a target entity database <b>102</b>B storing information about one or more such target entities. The information about a target entity may include personally identifying information (PII) such as a social security number, name, address, employment history, and so forth. The target entity database <b>102</b>B may further store a unique identifier of the target entity (&#x201c;first identifier of the target entity&#x201d;), which may be generated and/or assigned to the target entity by the requesting entity system <b>102</b>. For example, the first identifier of the target entity may be a string of numbers and/or letters uniquely identifying the target entity to the requesting entity.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The requesting entity system <b>102</b> may further include a user interface <b>102</b>A. The user interface <b>102</b>A may include elements for receiving user input and displaying information to a user. For example, the user interface <b>102</b>A may include elements to accept user input specifying one or more target entities for which to provide information to the monitoring system <b>106</b>. The user interface <b>102</b>A may further include elements for accepting configuration parameters for risk monitoring of the target entities. The user interface <b>102</b>A may further include functionality to display information to a user (e.g., results of risk monitoring, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The requesting entity system <b>102</b> may include a display element for displaying the user interface <b>102</b>A.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The requesting entity system <b>102</b> may be communicatively coupled to the monitoring system <b>106</b>. For example, the requesting entity system <b>102</b> may send data to the monitoring system <b>106</b> to be processed, may send signals to the monitoring system <b>106</b> to control different aspects of the computing environment or the data it is processing. The requesting entity system <b>102</b> may interact with the monitoring system <b>106</b> via one or more networks <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The requesting entity system <b>102</b> may include network computers, sensors, databases, or other devices that may transmit or otherwise provide data to monitoring system <b>106</b>. For example, the requesting entity system <b>102</b> may include local area network devices, such as routers, hubs, switches, or other computer networking devices.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each communication within the operating environment <b>100</b> (e.g., between client devices, between the requesting entity system <b>102</b> and the monitoring system <b>106</b> may occur over one or more networks <b>104</b>. Networks <b>104</b> may include one or more of a variety of different types of networks, including a wireless network, a wired network, or a combination of a wired and wireless network. Examples of suitable networks include the Internet, a personal area network, a local area network (&#x201c;LAN&#x201d;), a wide area network (&#x201c;WAN&#x201d;), or a wireless local area network (&#x201c;WLAN&#x201d;). A wireless network may include a wireless interface or combination of wireless interfaces. A wired network may include a wired interface. The wired or wireless networks may be implemented using routers, access points, bridges, gateways, or the like, to connect devices in the network <b>104</b>. The networks <b>104</b> can be incorporated entirely within (or can include) an intranet, an extranet, or a combination thereof. In one example, communications between two or more systems or devices can be achieved by a secure communications protocol, such as secure sockets layer (&#x201c;SSL&#x201d;) or transport layer security (&#x201c;TLS&#x201d;). In addition, data or transactional details may be encrypted.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The monitoring system <b>106</b> can include one or more processing devices that execute program code stored on a non-transitory computer-readable medium. The program code can include an identity management module <b>106</b>A, a daily risk trigger module <b>106</b>B, a risk prediction module <b>106</b>C, and a reporting module <b>106</b>D.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The risk prediction module <b>106</b>C may include software configured to, in cooperation with a processor (e.g., processor <b>502</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), generate and apply a predictive risk model to target entity data. The predictive risk model may output a risk metric. The risk metric may be a representation of a risk level associated with a target entity. For example, the risk metric may be a numerical value and/or a yes/no answer. Examples of risk metrics include number of days past due on a credit instrument (e.g., if an employee is 30, 90, 120, or 150 days past due on any credit instrument such as a credit card, mortgage, car payments, etc.). Examples of risk metrics further include an amount of debt and/or an increase in debt. For example, threshold levels of debt or major increases in debt may be indicators of financial distress. As another example, criminal record status may be used as a risk metric (e.g., whether the target entity has been or is likely to be arrested, charged with a crime, and/or convicted of a crime). Another example of a risk metric is employment status, such as whether a target entity is holding multiple jobs. In many cases, a condition of employment is that an employee does not hold additional jobs. Another example of a risk metric is a number of credit instruments held by the target entity (e.g., is the target entity suddenly opening multiple credit cards). As another example, an amount of funds held by the target entity may be used as a risk metric. This can be used to monitor for unexplained wealth, which may be associated with increased risk. For example, if a target entity has been making minimum payments on a mortgage and suddenly pays off the entire mortgage, with no windfall on record, this can be considered unexplained wealth.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the risk metric may be a combination of such factors. For example, a formula, such as a linear combination of factors, may be used to arrive at a risk metric. As a specific example, the risk metric may be</p><p id="p-0035" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Risk=5*(Days Past Due)+3*(New Credit)+100*(New Job)&#x2003;&#x2003;[1]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0036" num="0000">In some cases, the risk prediction module <b>106</b>C may maintain multiple configurable risk metrics. For example, a first requesting entity system may be interested in whether any employees are 120 days past due on any credit instrument, while a second requesting entity system may be interested in a combination of factors, e.g., based on Equation 1 above.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">The risk prediction module <b>106</b>C may maintain one or more threshold values for the risk metric(s). The threshold values may be configured by the requesting entity system <b>102</b>. For example, a user may interact with the user interface <b>102</b>A to specify a threshold, such as 120 days past due on a credit instrument, $30,000 in debt, and so forth. Different requesting entities may establish different thresholds. A given requesting entity may establish different thresholds for different target entities and/or contexts. Alternatively, or additionally, the monitoring system <b>106</b> may establish threshold values(s). For example, based on analysis of historical data, the monitoring system <b>106</b> may determine that 90 days past due is an appropriate threshold given past employee behaviors. In some cases, a threshold determined by the monitoring system <b>106</b> may be used as a default value which may be modified via the user interface <b>102</b>A.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">The risk prediction module <b>106</b>C may also include functionality to execute an automated modeling algorithm (e.g., an algorithm using logistic regression and/or neural networks) that can learn or otherwise identify relationships between predictor variables and response variables. In some aspects, the risk prediction module <b>106</b>C can train or otherwise develop such an algorithm. The risk prediction module <b>106</b>C may receive a variety of different data from the database <b>106</b>E, which may be used to train or refine the models.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036">The daily risk trigger module <b>106</b>B may include those events, defined by the first computing system, as risk rules or thresholds, when satisfied or exceeded respectively, are to generate an anonymized risk report for the first computing system.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037">The database <b>106</b>E can include memory devices for storing data to be processed by the monitoring system <b>106</b>. The database <b>106</b>E may also store a variety of different types of data organized in a variety of different ways and from a variety of different sources. For example, the database <b>106</b>E may include storage other than primary storage located within monitoring system <b>106</b> that is directly accessible by processors located therein. The database <b>106</b>E may include secondary, tertiary, or auxiliary storage, such as large hard drives, servers, virtual memory, among other types. Storage devices may include portable or non-portable storage devices, optical storage devices, and various other mediums capable of storing or containing data. A machine-readable storage medium or computer-readable storage medium may include a non-transitory medium in which data can be stored. Examples of a non-transitory medium may include, for example, a magnetic disk or tape, optical storage media such as compact disk or digital versatile disk, flash memory, memory or memory devices. The database <b>106</b>E may be a secure database. The data stored in the database <b>106</b>E may be secured using measures such as cryptography, network traffic monitoring, and secure hardware elements.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0038">The database <b>106</b>E may store data gathered from computing devices such as credit data computing device <b>108</b>, employment data computing device <b>110</b>, and criminal data computing device <b>112</b> via network <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0039">The credit data computing device <b>108</b> is a computing device configured to generate data related to credit records and financial transactions of a target entity.

The credit data computing device <b>108</b> may gather data about one or more target entities and transmit the data to the monitoring system <b>106</b> periodically or continually. For example, a large number of data can be generated by electronic transactions. This data can be used to generate information such as whether, and by how long, a target entity is past due on a credit instrument, an amount of debt associated with the target entity, and so forth. The data gathered and/or generated by the credit data computing device <b>108</b> may describe prior actions or transactions involving a target entity (e.g., information that can be obtained from credit files or records, financial records, consumer records, or other data about the activities or characteristics of the target entity).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">The employment data computing device <b>110</b> is a computing device configured to generate data related to employment records of a target entity.

In addition to the first identifier established by the requesting entity system <b>102</b>, the identity management module may generate and manage additional identifiers for the target entity. The identity management module <b>106</b>A may generate a second identifier of the target entity, based on the target entity information received from the requesting entity system <b>102</b>. The identity management module <b>106</b>A may generate a third identifier associated with the target entity's risk reports that is not directly linked to any PII.

The processing depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be implemented in software only (e.g., code, instructions, program) executed by one or more processing units (e.g., processors, cores) of the respective systems, in hardware, or combinations thereof. The software may be stored on a non-transitory storage medium (e.g., on a memory device). The method presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and described below is intended to be illustrative and non-limiting. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts the various processing steps occurring in a particular sequence or order, this is not intended to be limiting. In certain alternative embodiments, the steps may be performed in some different order or some steps may also be performed in parallel.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0046">At step <b>202</b>, the server computer receives, from a requesting entity, a request for monitoring of a plurality of target entities. For each target entity, the request includes a first identifier associated with the target entity and sufficient information about the target entity to identify him or her. For example, the requesting entity is an employer with a set of employees subject to security clearances. The requesting entity seeks to receive preemptive notification if some subset of these target entities are in compliance with eligibility requirements for their security clearances. The request may include a list of such target entities.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">The first identifier may be provided by the requesting entity to the server computer for each target entity. The first identifier associated with each respective target entity may be a unique identifier assigned to the target entity by the employer. For example, a first identifier may be a string of letter and/or numbers such as an employee identifier (ID), and may, in special circumstances be a social security number or name. The first identifier may be persistent through adds and deletes which must be periodically coordinated by both parties in order to stay FCRA-compliant for consent-based monitoring. The monitoring system may create a table of first identifiers (e.g., an employee table) for the requesting entity for future reference.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">The information about a given target entity may include personally identifiable information such as name, address, telephone number, hire date, job history, type of security clearance held, and so forth. In some embodiments, some or all of the information about a target entity is stored in a mapping to the corresponding first identifier. For example, a stored table of first identifiers may include one or more columns for PII-based parameters for each of a set of employees.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">At step <b>204</b>, the server computer generates a second identifier associated with each target entity based on the target entity information. The second identifier may be an identity key generated by conducting a search, match, and key process comparing the target entity information received from the requesting entity to target information stored by the monitoring system file in order assign a persistent, system-key to each target entity for monitoring.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">The server computer may import the received set of first identifiers and information associated with the target entities, of the plurality of target entities. Each respective set of target entity information may be keyed. The resulting second identifier may be stored to a credit header file using any of several keying elements. These may include social security number, full name, address, prior address(es), zip code, or other individual characteristics that help uniquely identify individuals. The server computer may generate the second identifier by keying, hashing, or cryptographically modifying some or all of the target entity information. For example, the second identifier may be a hash of a target entity's social security number. As another example, the second identifier is a fuzzy hash of the set of information for a given target entity. The second identifier may uniquely identify the target entity based on the information about the target entity, and may be linked to the credit file of the target entity.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">In some embodiments, the set of target entity information and identifiers received from the requesting entity is housed in a master portfolio associated with that requesting entity. Other portfolios may be maintained for other requesting entities. In cases where target entities may be simultaneously monitored by multiple requesting entities, which may happen if a person is employed by one government agency and seconded to another, the target entity may appear in more than one master portfolio and be monitored with two or more sets of target entities.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">Step <b>204</b> may be performed, in turn or simultaneously, for each target entity monitored. A set of second identifiers for the requesting entity may be loaded on the monitoring system with a set of risk rules used to configure the risk monitoring of the target entities.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">In some embodiments, the second identifier is prevented from being provided to the requesting entity. The server computer may refrain from transmitting the second identifier to the requesting entity or otherwise revealing the second identifier to the requesting entity.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">At step <b>206</b>, the server computer generates a third identifier associated with each target entity. The third identifier is associated with the target entity's risk report, as described below with respect to step <b>212</b>. The third identifier is an identifier which both computer systems can use to reference the specific risk data report. The third identifier is randomly generated and unique. The third identifier may be a smart key that uniquely identifies the target entity. The third identifier may, for example, be a universally unique identifier (UUID).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">The third identifier may be automatically generated when the monitoring system generates a result because a rule is satisfied or a threshold exceeded. Alternatively, in some embodiments, generating the third identifiers may be performed responsive to identifying target entities when events indicate an insider threat at step <b>210</b>. In this case, the server computer may generate the third identifier for those target entities that have indications of an insider threat risk.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">At step <b>208</b>, the server computer stores a mapping of the second identifier to the first identifier and the third identifier to the first identifier and the second identifier in a secure database. The server computer may, for example, store a table of employees for each requesting entity. Such a table may include entries for first identifiers and second identifiers. The table may further include entries for the third identifiers for each target entity, which can be used to link the third identifier to the first and second identifiers. Alternatively, or additionally, the mapping may be established using pointers or otherwise linking the first identifier, second identifier, and third identifier for each respective target entity. Accordingly, the third identifier can be used as an anonymous identifier that links the first identifier to the second identifier, as the third identifier is not directly linked to PII identifying the target entity.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">At step <b>210</b>, the server computer monitors a periodically updated dataset associated with each target entity and compares the risk metric for each target entity to a threshold value to identify a subset of the plurality of target entities with risk indicators of insider threat. The server computer may identify the third identifiers corresponding to those target entities' reports which indicate a risk associated with an insider threat.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">Depending on the risk metric used, a particular target entity may require further inquiry to determine whether the target entity poses an insider threat if the risk metric exceeds a threshold value (e.g., if the risk metric increases with risk such as days past due or debt amount), or if the risk metric is less than a threshold value (e.g., if the risk metric decreases inversely with risk such as credit score). Alternatively, or additionally, a risk metric may be satisfied by definition (e.g., for a binary risk metric, e.g., whether the target entity has been arrested). Each time the server computer determines that for a particular target entity a risk-defined rule has been met this generated result may constitute a &#x201c;risk event&#x201d; indicative of an insider threat.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">The server computer may monitor periodically updated datasets via external computing devices over a network. For example, the server computer may monitor data associated with one or more target entities via credit data computing device <b>108</b>, employment data computing device <b>110</b>, and criminal data computing device <b>112</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, the server computer may monitor a periodically updated dataset associated with each target entity, as stored locally in database <b>106</b>E. Database <b>106</b>E may be periodically updated, e.g., as reports are received from credit data computing device <b>108</b>, employment data computing device <b>110</b>, and criminal data computing device <b>112</b>.

As an example, the predictive model may be a logistic regression model. A logistic regression model can model the probability of an event occurring&#x2014;e.g., the likelihood of a target entity accumulating a certain amount of days past due on a credit instrument, debt value, and so forth.

As a specific example, a regulatory compliant neural network may be implemented. A regulatory compliant predictive model may include an optimized neural network that can allow the neural network to be used for both accurately determining risk metrics and generating explanatory data. The explanatory data can indicate how certain factors impacted the risk metric or other output that is generated using the model. Such a neural network may be trained using data corresponding to credit and financial transactions, employment events, and criminal records. Techniques for implementing a regulatory compliant neural network are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 10,133,980 and 10,558,913 and U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2018/0025273.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0062">In some embodiments, the predictive model is trained on data from a general population of entities segmented based on age and income level to approximate a target population of entities. For example, a group of employees of a particular government agency is monitored. Rather than training the predictive model on data associated with these employees, which could expose the identity of the employees by using only their data for, the predictive model is trained on a general population. The general population may be filtered to more closely approximate the population of target entities. For example, the training data may be filtered to include people that are U.S. citizens and high school graduates over the age of 20. This can result in a population that is statistically similar to those employed by the requesting entity, which can in turn provide more accurate predictions.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0063">In some embodiments, a predetermined threshold value is compared to the risk metric. In some embodiments, the threshold value may be compared to the output of the model. For example, the model outputs a number of days past due and this is compared to the threshold value of 120 days past due. Alternatively, or additionally, the model may directly produce a result of the comparison of the risk metric and the threshold. For example, a logistic regression model may be configured with a certain probability value corresponding to the predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0064">In some embodiments, the model and/or the threshold value may be configured for a requesting entity. The server computer may receive configuration data, including a threshold value for a particular parameter, from a requesting entity. The configuration data may be received, for example, via the user interface, via a message, or via batch files to an API. Based on the threshold value and the particular parameter, the server computer may customize the predictive model for the requesting entity. For example, a first requesting entity may be interested in whether any employees are 90 days or more past due on a credit instrument. A second requesting entity may be interested in whether any employees have a 100% increase in debt in a reporting period. A third requesting entity may be interested in whether a multi-factor risk metric exceeds a value of 90, where the risk metric is computed based on a combination of late payments, debt amount, and employment status changes. Accordingly, the model and/or threshold values can be tailored for different requesting entities. Alternatively, or additionally, a given requesting entity may use different criteria for different populations of target entities (e.g., managers vs. cashiers, or employees with a secret clearance vs. employees with a top secret/sensitive compartmentalized information (TS/SCI) clearance). This results in a standardized rule set across all people with specific clearances while also segmenting the population so all persons in a particular &#x201c;class&#x201d; are treated identically.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0065">The server computer may, simultaneously or in turn, apply one or more risk models to the plurality of target entities to identify a subset of the plurality of the target entities that are likely to pose an insider threat. For example, the server computer may apply a risk model to data corresponding to 1,000 employees, and identify a subset of five employees that are likely to go 120 days past due on a credit product.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0066">In some embodiments, the risk metric is determined on demand. The risk metric may be computed periodically. In some cases the risk metric is determined based on an interval specified by the requesting entity. For example, the interval can be daily, weekly, monthly, or any other desired interval.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0067">At step <b>212</b>, the server computer provides the third identifiers to the requesting entity. The server computer may transmit the third identifiers in association with risk information. The risk information may include a defined event or the risk score. Alternatively, or additionally, the risk information may include underlying data used to generate the risk score. The risk information may include data indicating what is driving the individual score downward the most (using the top four downward drivers). This could include derogatory information on the credit file, unexplained income, criminal activity, and so forth. The server computer may provide the third identifiers for the subset of the plurality of the target entities with risk indicators of insider threat. In some embodiments, the server computer may further provide the third identifiers for additional target entities. For example, the server computer may cause display of a visualization of a set of monitored target entities with corresponding risk metrics, which may be above or below the threshold.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0068">The server computer may provide the third identifiers via a user interface (e.g., similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The user interface can accept user input to manage individual risk reports at the program level consistent with risk tolerance policy and procedures. The server computer may cause display of a user interface including a visualization of risk data for a plurality of target entities that includes the third identifier. Causing display may include transmitting program instructions for rendering interface elements, thereby causing the reporting entity system to display the user interface as specified by the server computer. The visualization of risk data for a plurality of target entities may, for example, include graphs illustrating different risk levels for a set of target entities. User input may be accepted to drill down, revealing the third identifier(s) associated with one or more such target entities.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0069">In some embodiments, the user interface may be in the form of a visualization portal (e.g., the user interface <b>102</b>A) that maps over time the risk profile of an entire employment portfolio (e.g., a set of target entities as specified in the request of step <b>202</b>). The entire employee portfolio being monitored can be assessed in the user interface, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The visualization can be segregated based on risk metrics, or other attributes available.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0070">Providing the third identifier may include transmitting, by the server computer to the requesting entity over a network, an anonymized risk report including the third identifier which is then the transaction ID for reference. Such a risk report may include information such as a list of third identifiers and corresponding risk metrics. The anonymized risk report may contain details of risk metrics and other risk attributes contained in the risk model. Additional information that may be included in the risk model includes employment conflicts and metadata associated with the requesting entity. The server computer may refrain from including any identifying information such as the first identifier, second identifier, or name, at this point.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0071">Within the risk report, or separately, rejected records may be reported back to the requesting entity. For example, if records are not found for a particular target entity, or if a target entity should no longer be monitored (e.g., if a particular target entity is no longer employed by the requesting entity), then the server computer may transmit to the requesting entity an indication such as &#x2018;Records not Found&#x2019; or &#x2018;Invalid Records&#x2019; for review, update, or other action by the requesting entity.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0072">The risk report may be transmitted to the requesting entity via a message, API push/pull, and/or the like. The third identifiers may be provided using a message or visualization, while refraining from including first identifiers, second identifiers, or PII (e.g., target entity information) in the message or visualization.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0073">In some embodiments, risk information is reported to the requesting entity on a periodic basis. For example, on a daily basis, appropriate risk triggers are reported anonymously and aggregated to the requesting entity. Thus, the risk information transmitted at step <b>212</b> may be both anonymous and aggregated, protecting the privacy of the individual target entities and remaining consistent with FCRA and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requirements.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0074">At step <b>214</b>, the server computer receives, from the requesting entity, a request for the first identifier for a particular third identifier (e.g., associated with a particular risk report). The request for the first identifier may be received via the user interface (e.g., a user may click on a particular third identifier or risk metric in the interface). Alternatively, or additionally, the request for the first identifier may be received via a network message and/or API exposed by the server computer. Accordingly, for individual risk decisioning, the requesting entity may request the server computer to &#x201c;unmask&#x201d; the risk report of the target entity. Such a request may include the third identifier, which the server computer can use to identify the requested information.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0075">The requesting entity may request such an unmasking of one or more target entities based on a target entity's risk metric exceeding some defined threshold for credit monitoring (or other monitoring as appropriate). For example, the requesting entity may be interested in all employees trending toward 120 or more days past due on any credit products as defined by the employee going 90 days past due. Such reported behavior could lead to an unmasking request for specific employees.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0076">At step <b>216</b>, the server computer uses the third identifier and the stored mapping to identify the requested first identifier. The server computer may identify the stored mapping for the requesting entity responsive to receiving a request for the first identifier from the requesting entity at step <b>214</b>. The server computer may identify the first identifier from third identifier contained within the request. Alternatively, or additionally, the server computer may identify the third identifier in association with the request, e.g. if the request is received from an interface linked to the third identifier or in response to a notification containing the third identifier. The server computer may use the stored mapping to identify a target entity first identifier corresponding to the specified third identifier.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0077">In some embodiments, the server computer may confirm that rules permit sharing the first identifier corresponding to a risk event given the context. For example, rules may require that unmasking is allowed only within 14 days from run date (e.g., the date of the latest data used to generate the risk metric). For data beyond 14 days old, the result may be out of date and may not be in compliance with FCRA regulations. Alternatively if the unmasking request exceeds 14 days from the date of the trigger report, then a new trigger report may be run and those results used to generate the new report. As another example, the server computer may confirm that the target entity is still employed by the requesting entity.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0078">At step <b>218</b>, the server computer provides the first identifier and the referenced third identifier to the requesting entity as a key pair which allows the requesting entity to match the risk data to their employee. The server computer may provide the first identifier by transmitting the first identifier in a message over the network The server computer may send the first identifier without sending any PII about the target entity. The requesting entity can then use its own records to identify the target entity based on the first identifier when combined with the third identifier. The server computer provides the third identifier and the first identifier to the requesting entity computer together as a key pair for reference to the target identity and the risk data.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0079">At step <b>220</b>, every time the server computer reveals the first identifier associated with a risk event, the server computer may post a &#x201c;soft hit&#x201d; associated with an employer inquiry to a credit file of the target entity. The soft hit may be placed based on the mapping of the identifiers. After conducting the monitoring at step <b>210</b> using the third identifier, the server computer may use the mapping of the third identifier to the second identifier to identify the associated credit file and place the credit inquiry on the file. The techniques described herein avoid the need to post such a credit hit during the monitoring process, as the monitoring is done for groups of target entities in an anonymous fashion, which does not trigger FCRA requirements to post a credit hit until the identity is unmasked at step <b>218</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0080">These techniques integrate the three identifiers, or key sets, in order manage PII risk by separating &#x201c;risk&#x201d; data from &#x201c;identity&#x201d; data in local operations and delivery. This data separation obviates the risk of discovery of PII associated with risk data on either the monitoring system or the requesting entity system. Discovery of PII can be a major privacy and security concern. These techniques provide an FCRA-compliant, employee risk-management solution without creating the unintended consequence of discoverable patterns.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting an example of a method <b>300</b> for requesting and configuring anonymous risk monitoring.

Risk thresholds may be defined by the target entity. For example, the risk metric and the threshold value may be transmitted by the requesting entity to the server computer via batch files, APIs, and/or the customization interface. As a specific example, an administrator associated with the requesting entity may interact with the customization interface to specify the risk metric number of days trending past due on mortgage and the threshold value 120.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0084">When a requesting entity is ready to start portfolio risk monitoring, the requesting entity may initiate an onboarding and configuration setup process.

As an example of the former, while the server computer is monitoring a particular target entity, the requesting entity may receive updated PII related to the target entity (e.g., the target entity changed her name). The requesting entity computer may transmit the updated PII to the server computer, which can be used to update the stored PII and/or keys to obtain more accurate data. As an example of the latter, the requesting entity may terminate employment of a particular target entity, at which point the target entity should no longer be monitored. The requesting entity may transmit a request for the server computer to delete the records for that target entity. In response, the server computer will delete the records stored in association with the target entity and cease monitoring the target entity.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0087">At step <b>306</b>, the requesting entity system receives, from the server computer, the third identifier and risk data.

The risk report may further include risk data such as scores associated with risk attributes contained in the risk model, employment conflicts, and so forth. Alternatively, or additionally, the requesting entity system may retrieve the risk data responsive to user interaction with the interface. For example, a user may click on a third identifier, causing a modal to be displayed listing risk data associated with the corresponding target entity.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0088">At step <b>308</b>, based on the third identifiers and the risk data, the requesting entity system transmits, to the server computer, the request for the first identifier. The requesting entity system may determine, based on the risk data and/or the third identifier, that the corresponding target entity should be identified. For example, the requesting entity system may determine that the identity of the target entity should be revealed based on the risk metric exceeding the threshold value. Alternatively, or additionally, the requesting entity may determine that the identity of the target entity should be revealed based on risk data such as parameters used to identify the risk metric (e.g., the risk metric is based on a combination of factors, one of which prompts the requesting entity to request the first identifier for a target entity).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0089">The requesting entity system may, for example, transmit the request for the first identifier by transmitting a file comprising a set of third identifiers to the monitoring system in a message over a network.

The distribution <b>406</b> is color coded into three regions. The first region <b>408</b> corresponds to a population of target entities that are least likely to default on a credit instrument. In this case, the higher the risk metric, the less risky the target entity. Those target entities with risk metrics over about 880 are considered the least risky. Accordingly, a requesting entity may be less interested in target entities corresponding to the first region <b>408</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0094">The second region <b>410</b> corresponds to a mid-range default population, or target entities that are moderately risky.
