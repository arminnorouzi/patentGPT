id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure generally to semiconductor device packaging, and more particularly to a semiconductor device package with a stress sensitive component.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Stress sensitive components are sometimes packaged with related semiconductor dies. Stress sensitive components are components that have electrical characteristics that are adversely affected by mechanical stress. Examples include precision reference circuits, diodes, filters, sensors, resonators, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), resistors, capacitors, inductors and coils. In one example a bulk acoustic wave (BAW) device used as a resonator is a stress sensitive component. The stress sensitive component can be formed on a first semiconductor die that placed is in proximity to a second semiconductor die. The second semiconductor die can be a driver die or controller die that is coupled with the first die including the stress sensitive component to form a circuit. The first semiconductor die and the second semiconductor die can be packaged together, for example by bonding the two dies to a package substrate and then encapsulating the two semiconductor dies and portions of the package substrate in a dielectric material, such as mold compound.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mold compound is an epoxy resin composition. The mold compound can be filled with particles such as silica or aluminum oxide particles. Filler can comprise over 90% of the mold compound by weight. The mold compound is either a liquid at room temperature or a solid at room temperature. If a solid, it can be heated to a liquid state before being used in molding. The liquid mold compound is injected or otherwise transferred into a mold containing the package substrate and die. After the mold compound cools, the packaged semiconductor device is removed from the mold. During curing and cooling the mold compound shrinks and applies unwanted compressive and/or shear stress to the dies and to the stress sensitive component in the packaged device. Mold compounds can have curing stresses in the range of twenty to several hundred mega (million) pascals (MPa). Stress on the semiconductor die and the stress sensitive component can be amplified when concentrated by points on filler particles within the mold compound that are pressing against the semiconductor device or the stress sensitive component. Larger filler particles concentrate more stress and apply more pressure against the devices.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The stress sensitive component may have electrical properties that are adversely changed by compressive and/or shear stress. Random placement of large filler particles in mold compound can apply force to some stress sensitive components differently from others in the same package process, resulting in non-uniform performance of like devices across completed units in a single lot, or across different lots of the packaged devices. Additional mechanical stress can result from other materials in the package, such as underfill.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a described example, an apparatus includes: a first semiconductor die with a component on a first surface, the first semiconductor die having an opposite second surface; a second semiconductor die mounted on a package substrate and having a third surface facing away from the package substrate; a solder seal bonded to and extending from the first surface of the first semiconductor die which is flip chip mounted to the third surface of the second semiconductor die, the solder seal at least partially surrounding the component; a first solder joint formed between the solder seal and a dielectric material overlying the third surface of the second semiconductor die; a post connect extending from the first surface of the first semiconductor die;

The figures are not necessarily drawn to scale.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the arrangements, unwanted stress on a stress-sensitive component is reduced or eliminated by flip-chip mounting a first semiconductor die including the stress-sensitive component onto a surface of a second semiconductor die, and using a solder seal to form a cavity around the stress-sensitive component. In some arrangements, assembly is done at a wafer scale, prior to forming a package body in an encapsulation process using mold compound. The cavity spaces the stress-sensitive component from other materials such as mold compound, reducing mechanical stress and reducing or eliminating adverse changes in device characteristics of the stress sensitive component due to mold compound stress. In alternative arrangements, a chip scale package (CSP) is formed with the stress sensitive component in a cavity. The cavity reduces mechanical stress on the stress sensitive component and is effective in reducing or eliminating adverse changes in device characteristics due to mechanical stress.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the arrangements described herein, the term &#x201c;package substrate&#x201d; is used. As used herein, a package substrate is a support having a surface suitable for mounting a semiconductor device. In the arrangements, useful package substrates can include: lead frames of copper, copper alloys, stainless steel or other conductive metals (such as Alloy 42); molded interconnect substrates (MIS); pre-molded lead frames (PMLFs) with lead frame conductors and dielectric material in a preformed structure; tape based and film-based substrates carrying conductors; laminate substrates with multiple layers of conductors and insulator layers; and printed circuit board substrates of ceramic, plastic, fiberglass or resin, such as FR4. Lead frames that are &#x201c;half-etched&#x201d; or &#x201c;partially etched&#x201d; to form portions of different thicknesses, or to form openings in metal layers, can be used.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;solder seal&#x201d; is used herein. A solder seal is a structure formed contemporaneously with forming conductive post connects. The solder seal and the conductive post connects end in solder, and the solder can be used in a solder reflow process to form solder joints to a semiconductor die. The solder seal forms a barrier that surrounds a stress sensitive component, protecting it from the mechanical stress, and prevents contamination of the stress sensitive component from downstream processes and in the field. In the arrangements the solder seal can be a continuous structure, alternatively the solder seal can be formed of segmented portions. The solder seal has an interior surface that surrounds the stress sensitive component, and an exterior surface that faces away from the stress sensitive component.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate, in projection views, a semiconductor wafer and a semiconductor die. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a semiconductor wafer includes semiconductor dies <b>110</b> in an array of rows and columns of identical dies. The dies <b>110</b> can be integrated circuits, such as an integrated circuit driver device. The dies <b>110</b> can be a component, such as a passive component, a sensor, a bulk acoustic wave (BAW) device, a resistor, capacitor, inductor or coil. The dies <b>110</b> can be a stress sensitive component that has electrical characteristics that change due to mechanical stress.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Wafer <b>101</b> has scribe lines <b>103</b> arranged in a first direction and <b>105</b> arranged in a second direction that is normal to the first direction. When the dies <b>110</b> are complete, the dies are singulated from the wafer <b>101</b> using dicing tools such as a dicing saw, or using laser cutting tools to cut along the scribe lines. The individual die <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is one die that has been removed from wafer <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates, in a cross sectional view, a packaged device <b>200</b> including a stress sensitive component <b>201</b>. In this example the stress sensitive component <b>201</b> is a BAW device mounted with a driver die <b>203</b> in packaged device <b>200</b>. The driver die <b>203</b> can be an integrated circuit designed to be used with the stress sensitive component and having terminals coupled to the stress sensitive component. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the stress sensitive component <b>201</b> is mounted with an active surface facing away from the active surface of the driver die <b>203</b>, or &#x201c;face up.&#x201d; A low modulus silicone material <b>205</b> covers the stress sensitive device <b>201</b>, this domed shaped material is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;glob top.&#x201d; Glob top <b>205</b> prevents mold compound <b>211</b> from contacting the stress sensitive component <b>201</b> and from placing mechanical stress on the stress sensitive component <b>201</b>. Bond wires <b>214</b> electrically connect the driver die <b>203</b> to leads <b>210</b> on a package substrate <b>208</b>. In this example, the package substrate is a metal lead frame. In another example, ribbon bonds can be used to electrically connect the leads <b>210</b> to the integrated circuit driver die <b>203</b>. A die pad <b>216</b> supports the driver die <b>203</b>. The example package <b>200</b> is a quad flat no-leads (QFN) package. QFN packages have terminals formed of portions of the leads that are exposed from the mold compound, the terminals are coextensive with the package body, so that QFN packages take less board area when mounted (compared to the area of a corresponding leaded package). QFN packages are increasingly used, in part because of the efficient use of board area.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As die sizes and semiconductor package sizes continue to fall, it is desirable to shrink the package for the stress sensitive component. The arrangement in package <b>200</b> is limited in size by the need for the integrated driver die <b>203</b> to have sufficient surface area to allow for the domed &#x201c;glob top&#x201d; material <b>205</b> over the stress sensitive component <b>201</b>, and to allow the edges of the glob top to be spaced from the ball bonds of bond wires <b>214</b> to the bond pads (not shown for clarity) of integrated circuit driver die <b>203</b>. The need for bond wire <b>218</b> and for a site for the bond wire stitch on the active surface of semiconductor device die <b>203</b> also limits the possibility of shrinking package <b>200</b>. A photolithographic pattern step is also needed to pattern a passivation layer such as a polyimide layer on the surface of integrated circuit driver die <b>203</b>, this layer is needed to contain the glob top material <b>205</b> around the stress sensitive component <b>201</b>, so that after deposition it doesn't spread unintentionally over the surface of the integrated circuit driver die <b>203</b> and interfere with wire bonds <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the arrangements, a stress sensitive component is formed on one wafer which is singulated to form a first semiconductor die, and the first semiconductor die including the stress sensitive component is mounted on a second semiconductor die that is formed on another wafer. Both types of semiconductor dies are formed using semiconductor processing, although the two devices are quite different in function. The second semiconductor die can be a controller, or driver, device that is coupled to the stress sensitive component of the first semiconductor die.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> illustrate, in a cross sectional view and plan view, a flip chip structure used in the arrangements. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a first semiconductor die <b>301</b> includes a stress sensitive component <b>305</b> on an active surface. A second semiconductor die <b>203</b>, which may be a related circuit such as a device driver circuit for the stress sensitive component <b>305</b>, is arranged with an active surface facing the active surface of the first semiconductor die <b>301</b>. A passivation layer <b>207</b> is formed over the active surface of the second semiconductor die <b>203</b>. The passivation layer <b>207</b> can be a dielectric material such as a polyimide and may include a protective oxide (PO) layer. Multiple layers of dielectric can be used for passivation layer <b>207</b>, including oxides, nitrides, and oxynitrides. Conductors <b>209</b> are formed over the active surface of the second semiconductor die <b>203</b> and can form a redistribution layer (RDL) for coupling circuitry formed in the second semiconductor die <b>203</b> to the first semiconductor die <b>301</b>, or to bond pads or terminals. A post connect <b>315</b> extends from the first semiconductor die <b>301</b> to the second semiconductor die <b>203</b>. The post connect <b>315</b> is a conductive connector that extends from a land on the active surface of the first semiconductor die <b>301</b> to the conductor <b>209</b> on the second semiconductor die <b>203</b>. Post connect <b>315</b> can be a copper pillar bump, or another conductive material with a solder bump.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A solder seal <b>313</b> extends from the first semiconductor die <b>301</b> and forms a solder joint to the polyimide <b>207</b> on the second semiconductor die <b>203</b>. In this example, the solder seal <b>313</b> forms a continuous barrier that surrounds the stress sensitive component <b>305</b> and includes the post connect <b>315</b>. In the example arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the solder seal <b>313</b> can be formed simultaneously with the post connect <b>315</b>, but does not form an electrical connection to the second semiconductor die <b>203</b>. In this example, the solder seal <b>313</b> is floating. In alternative arrangements, solder seal <b>313</b> can be electrically coupled to ground or to another potential. Post connect <b>315</b> is coupled to a bond pad <b>221</b>, and can be coupled to circuitry on the second semiconductor die <b>203</b>. Alternatively the post connect <b>315</b> can be coupled to the bond pad <b>221</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Post connect <b>315</b> is a conductive connector that extends between a conductive land on the active surface of the first semiconductor die <b>301</b> and the conductor <b>209</b> that is over the active surface of the second semiconductor die <b>203</b>. The post connect <b>315</b> can be formed of a copper column formed by electroplating or electroless deposition, and can be formed simultaneously with the solder seal <b>313</b>. The post connect <b>315</b> ends in a solder portion that is also formed by plating, which can be used in a thermal reflow process to form a solder joint between the post connect <b>315</b> and the conductor <b>209</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The first semiconductor die <b>301</b> is mounted to the second semiconductor die <b>203</b> in a face to face arrangement. Because the first semiconductor die <b>301</b> is mounted face down as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the first semiconductor die <b>301</b> is referred to as &#x201c;flip chip&#x201d; mounted. The solder seal <b>313</b> and the post connect <b>315</b> are connected to the conductors <b>209</b> over the active surface of the second semiconductor die <b>203</b> by solder joints. The flip chip mounted first semiconductor die <b>301</b> and second semiconductor die <b>203</b> form a structure <b>311</b> that is used in forming the arrangements as is further described below. The semiconductor dies <b>301</b> and <b>203</b> can vary in size from about 50 microns&#xd7;50 microns to about 5000 microns&#xd7;5000 microns. The solder seal <b>313</b> can have a thickness in range from about 5 microns to about 100 microns. The spacing between the two dies can vary from about 5 microns to about 100 microns, corresponding to the thickness of the solder seal <b>313</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a plan view of the structure <b>311</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> looking from the backside of the first semiconductor die <b>301</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the active surface of the second semiconductor die <b>203</b> is shown surrounding the first semiconductor die <b>301</b>. The solder seal <b>313</b> surrounds the stress sensitive component <b>305</b> on the first semiconductor die <b>301</b>. As is further described below, the solder seal <b>313</b> can be formed contemporaneously with the post connect <b>315</b> which extends from the first semiconductor die <b>301</b>. The bond pad <b>221</b> is coupled to a conductive land corresponding to the post connect <b>315</b> by the conductor <b>209</b>, which overlies the active surface of the second semiconductor die <b>203</b>. In an example arrangement, the stress sensitive component <b>305</b> on the first semiconductor die <b>301</b> is coupled to the post connect <b>315</b>, and the conductor <b>209</b> further couples the post connect <b>315</b> to the bond pad <b>221</b>. While in this illustrated example, the solder seal <b>313</b> is a rectangular shape, other shapes can be used, such as circular, oval, or diamond shapes. The shape of the solder seal <b>313</b> can be modified to optimize the use of the area of the semiconductor dies. Further, although in the examples of the figures the solder seal <b>313</b> is continuous, in alternative arrangements the solder seal <b>313</b> can be made in sections that are placed adjacent one another.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a cross sectional view of an arrangement using the flip chip mounted structure <b>311</b> to form a packaged device <b>320</b>.

In this example a conductive lead frame is used as a package substrate, such as a copper lead frame. A die attach film <b>337</b> is used to bond the backside surface of the second semiconductor die <b>203</b> to the lead frame <b>329</b>. A ball <b>323</b> on bond wire <b>325</b> couples the bond pad <b>221</b> to a conductive portion of the lead frame <b>329</b>, a ball bond <b>323</b> is formed on the bond pad <b>221</b>, and the bond wire <b>325</b> extends to a stitch bond <b>327</b>.

Solder seal <b>313</b> protects the stress sensitive component <b>305</b> from contact with the mold compound <b>321</b>. The use of the flip chip structure <b>311</b> reduces stress on the stress component <b>305</b> that would occur if the mold compound <b>321</b> was in contact the component. The solder seal <b>313</b>, the active surface of the second semiconductor die <b>203</b> and the active area of the first semiconductor die form a cavity that includes the stress sensitive component <b>305</b> and protects it from the mold compound <b>321</b>.
