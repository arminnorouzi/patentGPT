This embodiment is applicable to a situation where moments posted by a poster are displayed through a communication application in this embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an information management system in this embodiment may include a personal information display module <b>110</b> and a posted information display module <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The personal information display module <b>110</b> is configured to display personal information of a poster; and the posted information display module <b>120</b> is configured to dynamically display a plurality of posted contents contained in a moment posted by the poster at current time.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The communication application in this embodiment is a newly developed chat application program, and display styles of the moments posted by a plurality of posters in a moment space are pre-set during the development of the chat application program; and correspondingly, a personal information display module <b>110</b> and posted information display module <b>120</b> exist in the each display style of moments. In order to learn about information of the posters, in this embodiment, personal information of a poster of each piece of moments may be displayed through the personal information display module <b>110</b>. At the same time, in order to ensure the integrality of displaying a plurality of posted contents in the moment, the plurality of posted contents contained in the moment is dynamically displayed through the posted information display module <b>120</b>. In this embodiment, only moments posted by friends of a current user in the above communication application and strangers having an association relationship with the current user are displayed in a moment space of a client of the current user. For example, the association relationship may be as follows: the current user and a stranger are in the same group or concern about the same topic.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Configuring the communication application to the client of the current user is taken as an example for illustration. After the communication application is enabled on the current user side, when a server receives a moment posted by a friend of the current user and a stranger having an association relationship with the current user, the server issues, personal information of the posters and a plurality of posted contents contained in the moment posted by the posters at the current time to the client of the current user. At this time, a display space corresponding to the posters is generated in a moment space of the client of the current user side, and includes the personal information display module <b>110</b> and the posted information display module <b>120</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the personal information display module <b>110</b> is configured to display the personal information of the posters issued by the server. The personal information may include identifier information of the poster in various dimensions, such as an avatar of the poster, a user name in the communication application, and a login level in the communication application. The posted information display module <b>120</b> is configured to dynamically display the plurality of posted contents issued by the server and contained in the moments posted by the posters at the current time. In this embodiment, the moment posted by each poster at the current time may include various types of posted content such as a text, a picture, a video, and a link.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The posted information display module <b>120</b> for dynamically displaying the plurality of posted contents in this embodiment is illustrated below.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, in order to ensure the uniformity of dynamic displaying of the plurality of posted contents, before the posted information display module <b>120</b> dynamically displays the plurality of posted contents contained in the moments posted by the posters at the current time, the plurality of posted contents are first packaged in an information card in a preset format, so that the plurality of posted contents contained in the moments posted by the posters at the current time are uniformly set to be a uniform format, which improves the regularity of dynamic displaying of the plurality of posted contents, reducing the complexity of a display interface, and achieving the purpose of reducing visual noise.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At the same time, a display order corresponding to the plurality of posted contents is determined based on a post order of the plurality of posted contents within the moment posted at the current time. That is, when the poster posts a corresponding moment, the poster uploads the plurality of posted contents contained in the moment to the server. The post order (an upload order) of the plurality of posted contents within the moment at the current time may be used as the display order of the dynamic displaying of the plurality of posted contents in the information display module <b>120</b>. Correspondingly, the posted information display module <b>120</b> displays the first posted content based on the display order when dynamically displaying the plurality of posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster at the current time. In the subsequent stage, in response to detecting a trigger operation of a user, each of posted contents can be correspondingly displayed in a dynamic changing manner based on the display order.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Exemplarily, in the case that the plurality of posted contents are dynamically displayed in the posted information display module <b>120</b> based on the trigger operation of the user, the trigger operation may be set to be in various forms. In this embodiment, an introduction is made through the following two cases:</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a first case: after the first posted content is initially displayed in the posted information display module <b>120</b>, if the current user needs to read other posted contents, the current user can click or touch a blank position (such as a blank position on the right side of an information card corresponding to the posted content) corresponding to the posted content and displayed in the posted information display module <b>120</b> to instruct a dynamic skip to a next posted content, and the currently displayed posted content is dynamically replaced, based on the display order corresponding to the posted contents, with the next posted content corresponding to the posted content. Therefore, in this embodiment, a plurality of posted contents are displayed by continuous dynamic skips based on the trigger operation of the user.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a second case: the posted content, located at a viewport, in the moment posted by the posted at the current time can be dynamically displayed in the posted information display module <b>120</b> based on a slide operation of a user. The viewport is a viewing area, on which the current user can browse data in multiple interfaces, in the client of the current user. After the plurality of posted contents are packaged in the information card in the preset format, the server can arrange, based on the display order corresponding to the plurality of posted contents, the plurality of packaged posted contents in a manner matched with the sliding manner For example, in the case that the user dynamically displays the plurality of posted contents by sliding in a left-right direction, the plurality of packaged posted contents are arranged left and right; in the case that the user dynamically displays the plurality of posted contents by sliding in an up-down direction, the plurality of packaged posted contents are arranged up and down. The client of the current user determines, based on the slide operation of the user, sliding coordinates of the viewport corresponding to the slide operation, and then uploads the sliding coordinates of the viewport to the server. The server determines a posted content located at the sliding coordinates of the viewport from the plurality of arranged posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster at the current time and then issues the posted content located at the viewport to the client of the current user, so that the posted content issued at this time is displayed in the posted information display module <b>120</b>. Therefore, in this embodiment, the server can continuously issue, based on the slide operation of the user, the posted content located at the viewport of the client to the client of the current user, so that the posted information display module of the client of the current user dynamically displays the plurality of posted contents based on the slide operation of the user.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Exemplarily, when the plurality of posted contents dynamically displayed are determined based on the slide operation of the user, the posted information display module <b>120</b> can be configured to display, at the viewport, an information card corresponding to the current posted content and edges of an information card corresponding to the next posted content, and the user slides a screen from right to left to constantly display the next posted content, instead of displaying all the posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster at the current time. The user reads unlimited posted contents by transverse sliding, thereby avoiding a limitation to the number of posted contents in the moment posted by the poster at each time. The number of posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster is increased on the basis of ensuring a lower information density of displaying moments.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Meanwhile, in this embodiment, each piece of moments displayed in the moment space is a piece of Feed information. In this embodiment, a transverse space used for dynamically displaying a plurality of posted contents in a single piece of Feed information is enlarged. It is ensured that the overall information amount in the single piece of Feed information is not decreased while reducing the information density.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the technical solution provided in this embodiment, the personal information of the poster is specifically displayed through the personal information display module, and the posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster at the current time is displayed through the posted information display module. That is, in the case that the piece of moments posted by the poster at certain time contains a plurality of posted contents, each of posted contents can be displayed in a dynamic changing manner in the posted information display module, without limiting the number of posted contents in the moment posted by the poster. Meanwhile, each of posted contents is displayed in the dynamic changing manner, instead of displaying all the posted contents in the display interface at one time, so that the number of posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster is increased while ensuring a lower information density of displaying moments; and the complexity of the information display layout is reduced by dynamically displaying the plurality of posted contents.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment II</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram of an interface of a communication application in an information management system for the communication application provided in Embodiment II of the present application, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram of an interface of a communication application in another information management system for the communication application provided in Embodiment II of the present application. This embodiment is described on the basis of the above embodiment. This embodiment mainly explains and describes display styles of the personal information display module <b>210</b> and the posted information display module <b>220</b> in the communication application during dynamic displaying of a plurality of posted contents.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the communication application in this embodiment may further include an information stream page <b>200</b>. The information stream page <b>200</b> is configured to display an information post section <b>201</b> of a poster. The information post section <b>201</b> is provided with a personal information display module <b>210</b> and a posted information display module <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Exemplarily, the information stream page <b>200</b> mainly displays Feed information correspondingly indicated by a moment posted, at different time, by a poster having a correspondence relationship with a current user. The Feed information is composed of personal information of the poster and posted contents contained in the moment. Each piece of Feed information constitutes, in the information stream page <b>200</b>, the information post section <b>201</b> in this embodiment. The information post section <b>201</b> packages information displayed by the personal information display module <b>210</b> and the posted information display module <b>220</b> in a unified way, so as to distinguish the same from moments posted by other posters.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this embodiment, in order to ensure the integrality of the personal information of the poster, during setting of a display style of the Feed information, a display area of personal information display module <b>210</b> can be set to be larger than that of the posted information display module <b>220</b> in the information post section <b>201</b>. For example, <b>2</b>/<b>3</b> of the display area on the left side in the information post section <b>201</b> is set to be the personal information display module <b>210</b>. A large enough space is reserved in the information post section <b>201</b> to display the personal information of the poster, and the personal information of the poster in two or more dimensions is displayed in the personal information display module <b>210</b>, such as an avatar of the poster, a user name in the communication application, and a login level in the communication application. Meanwhile, a large blank on the left side in the information post section <b>201</b> also ensures that the personal information of the poster effectively attracts the attention of the current user. The personal information of the poster is fully highlighted while displaying the moment posted by the poster.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Meanwhile, the posted information display module <b>220</b> on the right side in the information post section <b>201</b> can display an information card corresponding to first posted content in the moment posted by the poster at the current time and edges of an information card corresponding to second posted content, so as to prompt the current user that there are a plurality of posted contents in the moment posted by the poster. The current user can make a transverse slide to display, in a dynamic changing manner in the posted information display module <b>220</b>, the plurality of posted contents posted by the poster at the current time. Exemplarily, when the current user transversely slides the posted contents in the posted information display module <b>220</b>, other posted contents are constantly move and appear from the right edge, so that other posted contents are correspondingly displayed within the range of a screen to reduce the information density on the screen, relieve the visual pressure of the current user, and improve the reading efficiency.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, in order to ensure the comprehensiveness of the plurality of posted contents during slide displaying, in this embodiment, if it is detected that a plurality of posted contents are dynamically displayed in the posted information display module <b>220</b>, that is, if a slide operation of the user from right to left is detected, and other posted contents constantly move from the right edge and appear in the viewport for displaying, the personal information of the poster in a target dimension can be zoomed out, and the personal information of the poster in other dimensions is hidden. The personal information display module <b>210</b> can display zoomed-out personal information of the poster in a target dimension and hide the personal information in other dimensions, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. At this time, the posted information display module <b>220</b> dynamically displays the plurality of posted contents in the entire display area of the information post section <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Exemplarily, when the current user executes the transverse slide operation in the information post section <b>201</b>, more information cards packaged with the corresponding posted content move from the right edge of the information post section <b>201</b> to left and appear in the range of the screen, and the personal information of the poster within the personal information display module <b>210</b> is controlled to be appropriately hidden and zoomed out, so as to leave a screen space for more posted contents that appear by sliding, such as zooming out the avatar of the poster and hiding the rest personal information. Since the transverse space is fully used, while reducing the displayed information density, this embodiment ensures that the overall information amount contained in the moment posted by the poster is not decreased.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another aspect, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the information stream page <b>200</b> of this embodiment displays moments posted by a plurality of posters at different time, that is, a plurality of information post sections <b>201</b> are displayed. The moments may be moments posted by the same poster at different time, or may be moments posted by different posters at different time. The information post sections <b>201</b> of the poster are arranged in the information stream page <b>200</b> in sequence based on latest post states of the plurality of information post sections <b>201</b>. The latest post state may refer to post time of comments.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to the technical solution provided in this embodiment, by arranging the personal information display module and the posted information display module at the display area in the information post section, the personal information of the poster is highlighted to effectively attract the attention of the current user. Meanwhile, when the posted information display module in the information post section dynamically displays a plurality of posted contents, the personal information display module displays the zoomed- out personal information of the poster in the target dimension and hides the personal information in other dimensions, so as to fully use the transverse space for displaying the posted content, without limiting the number of posted contents in the moment posted by the poster. Each of posted contents is displayed in a dynamic changing manner through the transverse sliding, instead of displaying all the posted contents at one time in the display interface, thus increasing the number of posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster while ensuring a lower information density of displaying moments. The complexity of an information display layout is reduced by dynamically displaying a plurality of posted contents.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Embodiment III</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of an information management method for a communication application provided in Embodiment III of the present application.

The device may be any user terminal configured with the communication application, such as a mobile phone, a flat computer, or a palmtop.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the method may include the following steps which are not executed in order:</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In S<b>310</b>, an information post section of a poster is displayed in an information stream page.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">After the communication application is enabled on a current user side, when a server receives a moment posted by a friend of the current user and a stranger having an association relationship with the current user, the server issues, to a client of the current user, personal information of the posters and a plurality of posted contents contained in the moments posted by the posters at the current time. Correspondingly, in order to display the personal information and moment of the poster at corresponding moment display positions, the client of the current user interposes, to a preset information stream page in the communication application, an information post section configured to display the moments posted by the posters at this time. A personal information display module and a posted information display module corresponding to the poster are present in the information post section, so as to subsequently display corresponding content at specified positions.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In S<b>320</b>, personal information of the poster is stored in a personal information display module of the information post section.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Optionally, after receiving the personal information of the poster and the plurality of posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster at the current time issued by the server, the client of the current user screens out the personal information of the poster and correspondingly store the screened personal information of the poster to the personal information display module of the information post section. The personal information of the poster may include personal information in two or more dimensions, such as the avatar of the poster, the user name in the communication application, and the login level in the communication application.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In S<b>330</b>, a plurality of posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster at the current time is dynamically stored in a posted information display module of the information post section.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Optionally, after receiving the personal information of the poster and the plurality of posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster at the current time issued by the server, the client of the current user screens out the posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster at the current time and dynamically store the posted content to the posted information display module of the information post section. At this time, the moment posted by the poster at the current time may include a text, a picture, a video, a link, and other various types of posted content.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this embodiment, the dynamically storing posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster at the current time to the posted information display module of the information post section may include: packaging the plurality of posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster at the current time in an information card in a preset format; and determining in real time, in response to a slide operation of the user, a posted content at a viewport in the moment, and dynamically storing the posted content at the viewport to the posted information display module of the information post section.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this embodiment, in order to ensure the uniformity of dynamic displaying of the plurality of posted contents, after the plurality of posted contents contained in the moments posted by the posters at the current time are screened out, the plurality of posted contents are first packaged in the information card in the preset format, so that each of posted contents contained in the moments posted by the posters at the current time is uniformly set to be one uniform format, which improves the regularity of dynamic displaying of the plurality of posted contents, reducing the complexity of a display interface, and achieving the purpose of reducing visual noise. In addition, a display order corresponding to the posted content is determined based on a post order of the posted content within the moment posted at the current time, that is, when the poster posts a corresponding moment, the poster uploads the plurality of posted contents contained in the moment to the server. The client of the current user may take the post order (an upload order) of the plurality of posted contents within the moment at the current time as the display order of the dynamic displaying of the plurality of posted contents. The server can arrange, based on the display order corresponding to the plurality of posted contents, the plurality of packaged posted contents in a manner matched with the sliding manner For example, in the case that the user dynamically displays the plurality of posted contents by sliding in a left-right direction, the plurality of packaged posted contents are arranged left and right; in the case that the user dynamically displays the plurality of posted contents by sliding in an up-down direction, the plurality of packaged posted contents are arranged up and down. The client of the current user determines, based on the slide operation of the user, sliding coordinates of the corresponding viewport, and then uploads the sliding coordinates of the viewport to the server. The server determines posted content located at the sliding coordinates of the viewport from the plurality of arranged posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster at the current time, and then issues the posted content located at the viewport to the client of the current user. The client of the current user stores the posted content at the viewport to the posted information display module of the information post section. Therefore, the server can continuously issue, based on the slide operation of the current user, the posted content at the viewport of the client to the client of the current user, so that the posted information display module of the client of the current user dynamically stores the plurality of posted contents based on the slide operation of the user.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition, in order to ensure full use of the transverse space, this embodiment may further include: if it is detected based on the slide operation of the user that a plurality of posted contents are dynamically stored in the posted information display module, the personal information of the poster in a target dimension is zoomed out, and the personal information of the poster in other dimensions are hidden. The posted content, at the viewport, in the moment posted by the poster at the current time is dynamically displayed in the entire display area of the information post section.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this embodiment, if it is detected that the posted information display module dynamically displays the plurality of posted contents in the information post section, that is, the rest posted content constantly moves from the right edge and appear at the viewport for displaying in response to detecting a slide operation of the user from right to left, the personal information of the poster in the target dimension in the personal information display module is controlled to be zoomed out, and the personal information in other dimensions is hided. At this time, the posted information display module can dynamically display the posted content, at the viewport, in the moment posted by the poster at the current time in the entire display area of the information post section.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Exemplarily, when the current user executes the transverse slide operation in the information post section, more information cards packaged with the corresponding posted content move from the right edge of the information post section to left and appear in the range of the screen, and the personal information of the poster within the personal information display module is controlled to be appropriately hidden and zoomed out, so as to leave a screen space for more posted contents that appear by sliding, such as zooming out the picture of the poster and hiding the rest personal information. Since the transverse space is fully used, while reducing the displayed information density, this embodiment ensures that the overall information amount contained in the moment posted by the poster is not decreased.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to the technical solution provided in this embodiment, the personal information of the poster is specifically displayed through the personal information display module, and the posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster at the current time is displayed through the posted information display module. That is, in the case that the moment posted by the poster at a certain time contains a plurality of posted contents, each of posted contents can be displayed in a dynamic changing manner in the posted information display module, without limiting the number of posted contents in the moment posted by the poster. Meanwhile, each of posted contents is displayed in the dynamic changing manner, instead of displaying all the posted contents in the display interface at one time, so that the number of posted contents contained in the moment posted by the poster is increased while ensuring a lower information density of displaying moments; and the complexity of the information display layout is reduced by dynamically displaying the plurality of posted contents.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Embodiment IV</heading><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a communication system provided in Embodiment IV.
