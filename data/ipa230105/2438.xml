In the case of crystalline forms, molecules are positioned in three-dimensional lattice sites. When a compound recrystallizes from a solution or slurry, it may crystallize with different spatial lattice arrangements, and the different crystalline forms are sometimes referred to as &#x201c;polymorphs.&#x201d; The different crystalline forms of a given substance may differ from each other with respect to one or more chemical properties (e.g., dissolution rate, solubility), biological properties (e.g., bioavailability, pharmacokinetics), and/or physical properties (e.g., mechanical strength, compaction behavior, flow properties, particle size, shape, melting point, degree of hydration or solvation, caking tendency, compatibility with excipients). The variation in properties among different crystalline forms usually means that one crystalline form may be more useful than other forms.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vamorolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid corticosteroid, also known as VB-15, VBP-15, 16&#x3b1;-methyl-9,11-dehydroprednisolone, or 17&#x3b1;,21-dihydroxy-16&#x3b1;-methylpregna-1,4,9(11)-triene-3,20-dione:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="34.54mm" wi="44.62mm" file="US20230002439A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0007" num="0000">Pre-clinical data have shown that vamorolone binds potently to the glucocorticoid receptor and has anti-inflammatory effects similar to traditional glucocorticoid drugs.

As used herein, the terms &#x201c;polymorphs&#x201d; and &#x201c;polymorphic forms&#x201d; and related terms herein refer to crystalline forms of the same molecule. Different polymorphs may have different physical properties such as, for example, melting temperatures, heats of fusion, solubilities, dissolution rates, and/or vibrational spectra because of the arrangement or conformation of the molecules in the crystal lattice. The differences in physical properties exhibited by polymorphs affect pharmaceutical parameters such as storage stability, compressibility and density (important in formulation and product manufacturing), and dissolution rates (an important factor in bioavailability). Differences in stability can also result from changes in chemical reactivity (e.g., differential oxidation, such that a dosage form discolors more rapidly when comprised of one polymorph than when comprised of another polymorph) or mechanical property (e.g., tablets crumble on storage as a kinetically favored polymorph converts to thermodynamically more stable polymorph) or both (e.g., tablets of one polymorph are more susceptible to breakdown at high humidity). As a result of solubility/dissolution differences, in the extreme case, some polymorphic transitions may result in a lack of potency or, at the other extreme, toxicity. In addition, the physical properties of the crystal may be important in processing. For example, one polymorph might be more likely to form solvates or might be difficult to filter and wash free of impurities (i.e., particle shape and size distribution might differ between polymorphs).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0026">Polymorphs of a molecule can be obtained by several methods, as known in the art. Such methods include, but are not limited to, melt recrystallization, melt cooling, solvent recrystallization, desolvation, rapid evaporation, rapid cooling, slow cooling, vapor diffusion, and sublimation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0027">Techniques for characterizing polymorphs include, but are not limited to, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD), single-crystal X-ray diffractometry, vibrational spectroscopy, e.g., IR and Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR, hot stage optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron crystallography and quantitative analysis, particle size analysis (PSA), surface area analysis, solubility studies, and dissolution studies.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0028">To &#x201c;characterize&#x201d; a solid form of a compound, one may, for example, collect XRPD data on solid forms of the compound and compare the XRPD peaks of the forms. For example, when only three solid forms, e.g., Forms X and Y and Material N, are compared. The Form X pattern shows a peak at an angle where no peaks appear in the Form Y or Material N pattern, then that peak, for that compound, distinguishes Form X from Form Y and Material N and further acts to characterize Form X. The collection of peaks that distinguish, e.g., Form X from the other known forms is a collection of peaks that characterize Form X. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that there are often multiple ways, including multiple ways using the same analytical technique, to characterize solid forms. Additional peaks could also be used, but are not necessary, to characterize the form up to and including an entire diffraction pattern. Although all the peaks within an entire XRPD pattern may be used to characterize such a form, a subset of that data may be, and typically is, used to characterize the form.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0029">An XRPD pattern is an x-y graph with a diffraction angle (typically &#xb0; 2&#x3b8;) on the x-axis and intensity on the y-axis. The peaks within this pattern may be used to characterize a crystalline solid form. As with any data measurement, there is variability in XRPD data. The data are often represented solely by the diffraction angle of the peaks rather than including the intensity of the peaks because peak intensity can be particularly sensitive to sample preparation (for example, particle size, moisture content, solvent content, and preferred orientation effects influence the sensitivity), so samples of the same material prepared under different conditions may yield slightly different patterns; this variability is usually greater than the variability in diffraction angles. Diffraction angle variability may also be sensitive to sample preparation. Other sources of variability come from instrument parameters and processing of the raw X-ray data: different X-ray instruments operate using different parameters. These may lead to slightly different XRPD patterns from the same solid form, and similarly, different software packages process X-ray data differently. This also leads to variability. These and other sources of variability are known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. Due to such sources of variability, it is usual to assign a variability of &#xb1;0.2&#xb0; 2&#x3b8; to diffraction angles in XRPD patterns.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0030">ABOUT: As used herein, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is intended to qualify the numerical values it modifies, denoting such a value as a variable within a margin of error.

This amount will achieve the goal of reducing or eliminating the disease or disorder.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0041">TREATMENT: As used herein, &#x201c;treating,&#x201d; &#x201c;treatment,&#x201d; and the like means ameliorating a disease to reduce or eliminate its cause, its progression, its severity, or one or more of its symptoms, or otherwise beneficially alter the disease in a subject. Treatment may also be preemptive, i.e., it may include prophylaxis of disease in a subject exposed to or at risk for the disease. Prevention of a disease may involve complete protection from disease, such as prevention of infection with a pathogen, or may involve prevention of disease progression, for example, from prediabetes to diabetes. For example, prevention of a disease may not mean complete foreclosure of any effect related to the disease at any level. Instead, it may mean preventing the symptoms of a disease to a clinically significant or detectable level. Prevention of diseases may also mean prevention of the progression of a disease to a later stage of the disease.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0042">Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word &#x201c;comprise,&#x201d; or variations such as &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; or &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated step or element or integer or group of steps or elements or integers but not the exclusion of any other step or element or integer or group of elements or integers.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0043">Throughout this specification, unless specifically stated otherwise or the context requires otherwise, reference to a single step, composition of matter, group of steps, or group of compositions of matter shall be taken to encompass one and a plurality (i.e., one or more) of those steps, compositions of matter, groups of steps, or groups of compositions of matter.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0044">Each embodiment described herein is to be applied mutatis mutandis to each and every other embodiment unless specifically stated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0045">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention(s) described herein is susceptible to variations and modifications other than those specifically described.

Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated to provide a slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, Carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings to identify or characterize different combinations of active compound doses.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0089">The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing, and/or dispersing agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampoules and vials. They may be stored in powder form or in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or sterile pyrogen-free water, immediately before use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0090">Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous (oily) sterile injection solutions of the active compounds, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions, which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the suspension's viscosity, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the compounds' solubility to prepare highly concentrated solutions.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0091">For oral or parenteral use, the compounds may be formulated as nanoparticle preparations. Such nanoparticle preparations can include, for example, nanosphere encapsulations of active compounds, inactive nanoparticles to which active compounds can be tethered, or nanoscale powders of active compounds. Nanoparticle preparations can be used to increase the bioavailability of the active compounds, control the rate of release of the active compounds, or deliver active compounds to a location in the body.

Dove, &#x201c;An Easy Pill to Swallow,&#x201d; <i>Drug Discovery </i>&#x26; <i>Development Magazine: </i>11(11), November 2008, pp. 22-24.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0092">In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long-acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0093">For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, pastilles, or gels formulated conventionally. Such compositions may comprise the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0094">The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, or other glycerides.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0095">Vamorolone may be administered topically, that is, by non-systemic administration. This includes applying vamorolone externally to the epidermis or the buccal cavity and installing such a compound into the ear, eye, and nose. The compound does not significantly enter the bloodstream. In contrast, systemic administration refers to oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intramuscular administration.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0096">Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site of inflammation, such as gels, liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, and drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear, or nose. The active ingredient for topical administration may comprise, for example, from 0.001% to 10% w/w (by weight) of the formulation. In some embodiments, the active ingredient may comprise as much as 10% w/w. In other embodiments, it may comprise less than 5% w/w. In some embodiments, the active ingredient may comprise from 2% w/w to 5% w/w. In other embodiments, it may comprise from 0.1% to 1% w/w of the formulation.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0097">Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example, buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0098">For administration by inhalation, compounds may be conveniently delivered from an insufflator, nebulizer pressurized packs, or other convenient means of delivering an aerosol spray. Pressurized packs may comprise a suitable propellant such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Alternatively, for administration by inhalation or insufflation, the compounds, according to the disclosure, may take the form of a dry powder composition, for example, a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The powder composition may be presented in unit dosage form, such as capsules, cartridges, gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder may be administered with the aid of an inhalator or insufflator.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0099">Unit dosage formulations contain an effective dose, as herein below recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0100">In addition to the ingredients mentioned above, the formulations described above may include other agents conventional in the art regarding the type of formulation in question. For example, those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0101">Compounds may be administered orally or via injection at a dose of from 0.1 to 500 mg/kg per day. The dose range for adult humans is generally from 5 mg to 2 g/day. In some embodiments, the dose range is 0.25 to 6.0 mg/kg/day, such as 0.25 mg/kg/day, 0.75 mg/kg/day, 2.0 mg/kg/day, or 6.0 mg/kg/day. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete units may conveniently contain one or more compounds that are effective at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 5 mg to 500 mg, usually around 10 to 200 mg.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0102">The amount of active ingredient combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0103">The compounds can be administered in various modes, e.g., orally, topically, or by injection. The precise amount of compound administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician. The specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diets, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the precise disorder being treated, and the severity of the indication or condition being treated. Also, the route of administration may vary depending on the condition and its severity.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0104">In certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer at least one compound described herein (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or prodrug thereof) combined with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one side effect experienced by a patient upon receiving one compound herein is hypertension, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-hypertensive agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one compound described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself, the adjuvant may only have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one compound described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. By way of example only, in a treatment for diabetes involving administration of one compound described herein, increased therapeutic benefit may result by also providing the patient with another therapeutic agent for diabetes. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder, or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents, or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0105">In any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (at least one of which is vamorolone) may be administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneous, the multiple therapeutic agents may be provided in a single, unified form or multiple forms (by example only, either as a single pill or two separate pills). One therapeutic agent may be given in multiple doses, or both may be given multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may be any duration of time ranging from a few minutes to four weeks.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Methods of Use</heading><p

The reaction was held for approximately 20 h (HPLC showed 75% Cmpd 3, Cmpd 2 1.5%, 6% diastereomer; 5% epoxide). Starting at &#x2212;10&#xb0; C., a 20% aqueous sodium bisulfite solution (920 mL, 10 vol) was added carefully via the addition funnel, keeping the temperature below 10&#xb0; C. Trifluoroacetic acid (16 mL, 202 mmol, 1 eq) was added, and the mixture was held for 3 h at 0-5&#xb0; C. to complete desilylation (endpoint by HPLC). The lower aqueous layer was drained, and the organic layer was washed with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate (3&#xd7;250 mL), followed by water (1&#xd7;250 mL) and brine (1&#xd7;150 mL). The organic layer was then dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, filtered, and concentrated to a pasty solid (89 g). The residue was taken up in 1.5 vol of EtOAc and transferred to neat heptane (19 vol) to precipitate crude Cmpd 3 as an off-white solid (50 g, 62.5% yield; HPLC 79% Cmpd 3, 5.6% epoxide, 1.7% diastereomer). The crude Cmpd 3 (48.5 g) was triturated in hot acetonitrile (2 vol) at 60&#xb0; C. for 4 h and then gradually cooled to ambient temperature overnight. The mixture was filtered using the recycled filtrate to rinse and wash the wet cake. After drying, the recovery was 64.3% (31.2 g; HPLC 93.5% Cmpd 3, 3.3% epoxide).
