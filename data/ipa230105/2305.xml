These poly (alkyl 2-haloacrylates) can be used as films, in plastics, and as medicaments.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The literature discloses various processes for preparing alkyl 2-haloacrylates. However, these processes suffer from a number of drawbacks, including low product yield and/or the need to isolate intermediates as well as the use of highly toxic reagents.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A process for the preparation of methyl &#x3b1;-fluoroacrylate comprising admixing dimethyl oxalate with methyl fluoroacetate in the presence of sodium methoxide is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,262,968 (Example 1). The reported conversion of methyl fluoroacetate was 89%. However, the process used an excess of solvents (greater than 170 parts tetrahydrofuran and 650 parts methylene chloride) and the product mixture contained significant residual methyl fluoroacetate (classified as &#x201c;extremely hazardous&#x201d; by the World Health Organization).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A process for preparing 2-fluoroacrylic esters involving the hydrolysis of hydroxymethyl-fluoromalonic esters followed by decarboxylation and re-esterification is described in Gassen et al., J. Fluorine Chemistry, 55, (1991) 149-162. A process for the synthesis of fluoroacrylic acid esters (e.g., methyl &#x3b1;-fluoroacrylate), involving hydroxymethylation of dialkyl malonate with formaldehyde, isolation of an intermediate, acid hydrolysis and further purification is described in CA1280118C. The reported yield was 58%. A process for preparing 2-haloacrylic esters involving the hydroxylmethylation of dialkyl malonate with formaldehyde, isolation of an intermediate, followed by nucleophilic halogenation and decarboxylation is described in WO 2015/193392. The reported yield was less than 70%. The additional processing steps and low yields make these processes undesirable for many applications.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present description provides a process for the synthesis of alkyl 2-haloacrylates that occurs in the same vessel and/or reaction mixture, does not require the isolation of an intermediate, does not require the use of extremely toxic reagents, reduces synthetic steps, and provides an improved yield compared to methods used in the art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Disclosed herein is a process for preparing a haloacrylate compound comprising contacting a malonate compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 1</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="18.80mm" wi="56.13mm" file="US20230002306A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0010" num="0000">with an aldehyde to form a reaction mixture, wherein each R<sub>1 </sub>group is independently alkyl or aryl and X is fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo;

The process does not require isolation of an intermediate. Thus, for a batch process, the conversion of a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 1 to a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 2, or the conversion of a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 3 to a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 4, occurs in the same reaction mixture, typically in the same vessel. For a continuous process, the conversion of a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 1 to a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 2, or a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 3 to a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 4, occurs in the same reaction mixture.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0015">The process described herein are more efficient than methods described in the prior art in terms of use of reagents and manufacturing steps because the synthesis can occur in one reaction vessel without transfer or isolation of an intermediate. Further, the product yield is improved over methods described in the prior art for preparing the alkyl 2-haloacrylates.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0016">The production of methyl 2-fluoroacrylate (MFA) from dimethyl fluoromalonate (DMFM) can be accomplished in high yields in a simplified one-pot batch process. A formaldehyde source (e.g., paraformaldehyde and formalin) can be used as reactants with an excess of 10 mol % being sufficient.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0017">A solvent is typically used for this process. Usually, a polar aprotic solvent is used, and typically a high boiling point, polar aprotic solvent. Typical solvents include dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methyl pyrrolidone, and sulfolane; more typically, the solvent is sulfolane.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0018">The concentration of DMFM can be in the range of 10 to 60 wt. %, 20 to 50 wt. %, 30 to 40 wt. %. Typically, the concentration of DMFM is in the range of 35 to 40 wt. %; more typically, the concentration of DMFM is about 37 wt. %.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0019">A base is typically used as a catalyst in this process. Organic bases, such as triethylamine, pyridine, pyrrolidine, morpholine, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, and (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, are capable of promoting the reaction. Inorganic bases, such as aluminum oxide, calcium oxide, and potassium carbonate, are also capable of promoting the reaction. Typically, potassium and cesium carbonate were used, with cesium carbonate producing higher yields.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0020">The process starting temperature can range from 10 to 120&#xb0; C. Dosing the aldehyde reagent to the reaction mixture produces a rapid exotherm. This exotherm is considered to be the condensation reaction leading to an intermediate. Accordingly, the temperature for dosing formaldehyde is controlled below 30&#xb0; C. After the exotherm, the temperature of the reaction mixture is typically increased and reaction proceeds to form the desired product. This is considered to be a decarboxylation reaction.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0021">The temperature for the reactive distillation (e.g., a decarboxylation and distillation) can range from 60 to 150&#xb0; C., 70 to 140&#xb0; C., 80 to 135&#xb0; C., 90 to 130&#xb0; C., or 100 to 140&#xb0; C.; preferably, a temperature of about 110 to 130&#xb0; C. is used, or about 120&#xb0; C. Lower temperatures can be used, but may slow down the reaction and produce MFA at low yields.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0022">Pressure for reactive distillation can range from 50 to 1000 mbar, 70 to 750 mbar, 90 to 500 mbar, or 100 to 300 mbar; typically, the pressure is about 200 mbar. At lower pressures, more distillate may be collected at a faster rate; however, more solvent may also be collected.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0023">Overall yields can be 75% or greater, 80% or greater, 85% or greater, 90% or greater, 95% or greater, or 97% or greater, in relation to amounts of a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 1 (or a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 3). Overall yields may be up to 75%, up to 80%, up to 85%, up to 90%, up to 95%, or up to 97%, in relation to the amounts of a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 1 (or a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 3). Overall yields can range from 75 to 97%, 80 to 95%, 85 to 97%, or 85 to 90%, in relation to the amounts of a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 1 (or a compound corresponding to the structure of Formula 3).

The organic phase typically contains a polymerization initiator, a fluoroacrylate of Formula 2A, 1,7-octadiene, and divinyl benzene. The aqueous phase generally contains a polymerization suspension stabilizer, a water soluble salt, water, and optionally a buffer. The organic phase and the aqueous phase are then combined and stirred under nitrogen.

Additionally, an aqueous phase of water, polyvinyl alcohol, phosphates, sodium chloride, and sodium nitrite is prepared. Under nitrogen and while keeping the temperature below about 30&#xb0; C., the aqueous and organic phases are mixed together. Once mixed completely, the reaction mixture is gradually heated with continuous stirring. After the polymerization reaction is initiated, the temperature of the reaction mixture is allowed to rise up to about 95&#xb0; C. Once the polymerization reaction is complete, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and the aqueous phase is removed. The solid can be isolated by filtration once water is added to the mixture. The filtered solid is washed with water and then with a methanol/water mixture. The resulting product is a crosslinked (methyl 2-fluoroacrylate)-divinylbenzene-1,7-octadiene terpolymer.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0062">As discussed herein, after polymerization, the product may be hydrolyzed or otherwise deprotected by methods known in the art. For hydrolysis of the polymer having ester groups to form a polymer having carboxylic acid groups, preferably, the polymer is hydrolyzed with a strong base (e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, or calcium hydroxide) to remove the alkyl (e.g., methyl) group and form the carboxylate salt. Alternatively, the polymer can be hydrolyzed with a strong acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid) to form the carboxylate salt. Preferably, the (methyl 2-fluoroacrylate)-divinylbenzene-1,7-octadiene terpolymer is hydrolyzed with an excess of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at a temperature from about 30&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C. to yield (sodium 2-fluoroacrylate)-divinylbenzene-1,7-octadiene terpolymer. Typically, the hydrolysis reaction is carried out for about 15 to 25 hours. After hydrolysis, the solid is filtered and washed with water and/or an alcohol.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0063">The cation of the polymer salt formed in the hydrolysis reaction or other deprotection step depends on the base used in that step. For example, when sodium hydroxide is used as the base, the sodium salt of the polymer is formed. This sodium ion can be exchanged for another cation by contacting the sodium salt with an excess of an aqueous metal salt to yield an insoluble solid of the desired polymer salt. After the desired ion exchange, the product is washed with an alcohol and/or water and dried directly or dried after a dewatering treatment with denatured alcohol; preferably, the product is washed with water and dried directly. For example, the sodium salt of the cation exchange polymer is converted to the calcium salt by washing with a solution that substitutes calcium for sodium, for example, by using calcium chloride, calcium acetate, calcium lactate gluconate, or a combination thereof. And, more specifically, to exchange sodium ions for calcium ions, the (sodium 2-fluoroacrylate)-divinylbenzene-1,7-octadiene terpolymer is contacted with an excess of aqueous calcium chloride to yield an insoluble solid of crosslinked (calcium 2-fluoroacrylate)-divinylbenzene-1,7-octadiene terpolymer.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0064">Using this suspension polymerization process, cross-linked polyMeFA polymer is isolated in good yield, generally above about 85%, more specifically above about 90%, and even more specifically above about 93%.

Examples #1 and 9 show when equivalent ratios of reactants and reaction conditions are used, the yield of MFA is not greatly affected by the change in the formaldehyde source. Therefore, the added water and methanol in formalin did not seem to affect reaction kinetics and yield (Example #1). However, water in the reaction system caused a two-phase partition in the distillate receiver resulting in a loss of MFA from the organic phase to the methanol rich aqueous phase. The addition of the formaldehyde source led to a rapid exotherm. When formaldehyde was charged all at once, the reaction temperature increased quickly from 25&#xb0; C. to about 60&#xb0; C. For paraformaldehyde, no benefit was noticed from increasing the amount of formaldehyde in the system from 10% to 70% excess, as seen in Example #7 and 12.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Base Catalyst</heading><p id="p-0112" num="0081">Base catalysts such as potassium and cesium carbonate demonstrated high yields. Cesium carbonate at a molar ratio of 0.1 was found to be most effective (Example #21). Reducing the molar equivalence to 0.05 caused a minor decrease in yield, as shown in Example #10. Example #12 showed the increase in molar equivalence of catalyst did not improve the overall reaction yield. Potassium carbonate produced slightly lower yields relative to cesium carbonate; this may be due to the increased solubility of cesium carbonate in aprotic polar solvents (Example #17).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Solvent</heading><p id="p-0113" num="0082">The most effective solvents for the synthesis were polar aprotic solvents with high boiling points, e.g., N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), sulfolane, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Polarity of the solvents helped increase the solubility of the carbonate catalyst and high boiling points reduced the amount of solvent collected in the distillate receiver. As shown in Table 1, sulfolane was the most effective solvent in terms of yield (Example #21). Additionally, sulfolane produced the purest distillate, likely due to the large boiling point difference between the solvent and the product. The solvent, NMP, produced good yields of MFA when the DMFM concentration was 43 wt. % (Example #4). When the concentration of DMFM was decreased to 30 wt. %, the yield dropped slightly (Example #5). The experiment using DMSO as solvent was produced a lower yield of MFA than when NMP or sulfolane was used as the solvent (Example #6).</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Temperature</heading><p id="p-0114" num="0083">Decarboxylation took place in a temperature range of 60 to 150&#xb0; C. Since the decarboxylation reaction required heat, at lower temperature (e.g., less than 70&#xb0; C.) very little conversion was observed (Examples #2, 3, 16), while the best yields were obtained at 120&#xb0; C. (Examples #18-24). If the reaction temperature reached 150&#xb0; C. (Example #15), it is possible that side reactions occurred, including MFA self-polymerization, and more solvent was collected during distillation (Example #15).</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Pressure</heading><p id="p-0115" num="0084">While the temperature was increased for decarboxylation, the pressure was reduced to remove CO<sub>2 </sub>and distill the products. During the optimization, the reaction pressure was varied from 50 mbar to atmospheric pressure (1 bar). From the data presented in the table, it appears that the system pressure had little or no affect the decarboxylation kinetics, but it did affect the amount of product that distilled from the reaction mixture. Higher yields were obtained with pressures of about 200 mbar (Examples #18-24). The more the pressure decreased, the more solvent was detected in the distillate (Examples #14 and 15). At higher pressure, 800 mbar (80 kPa), the yield fell significantly as shown in Example #13.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 2: Patiromer Calcium Sorbitex (i.e., Sorbitol-loaded, Crosslinked (calcium 2-fluoroacrylate)-divinylbenzene-1,7-octadiene copolymer)</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0085">Methyl 2-fluoroacrylate (MeFA) is prepared as above in Example 1.
