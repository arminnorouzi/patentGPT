The second heat dissipation unit includes a second cooling fan cabinet <b>501</b>, a heat exchanger and a water-cooling plate <b>502</b>, wherein the second cooling fan cabinet <b>501</b> is installed on an upper part of the inverter unit <b>400</b> with an upward airflow, the heat exchanger (not shown in the drawings) is installed in the second cooling fan cabinet <b>501</b>, and the water-cooling plate <b>502</b> is installed close to a side of the inverter unit <b>400</b>.

The water pipe and the water-cooling plate are full of water as a medium.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the second heat dissipation unit starts, water circulates between the water pipe and the water-cooling plate <b>502</b> by a water pump. During a process when water flows in the water-cooling plate <b>502</b>, water at a lower temperature absorbs and takes away heat generated by the inverter unit <b>400</b> for cooling, then flowing back to the water pipe after heat exchange. The heat exchanger further removes heat from the heated water and the removed heat is taken away by the second cooling fan cabinet <b>501</b> to the ambient. Then water at a higher temperature turns into water at a lower temperature again and the next heat exchange cycle starts.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The second cooling fan cabinet <b>501</b> in the present invention is installed on the upper part of the inverter unit <b>400</b>. Compared with a lateral arrangement of the container body in the prior art, especially in the cooling part for the inverter unit <b>400</b>, a lateral air outlet structure is upgraded as an upward air outlet structure, which could further reduce the length of the variable-frequency skid and limit the overall size, much more suitable for vehicle-mounted conditions.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the second accommodation space <b>102</b> is provided with a first heat dissipation unit to cool the power transformation unit <b>300</b>.

The upward airflow removes heat from the power transformation unit <b>300</b> to lower its temperature.
