It should be appreciated that other embodiments may be derived with changes in mechanical component, structure, electrical, and operation without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description is not intended to limit the present disclosure, and the scope of embodiments of the present disclosure is limited by the claims.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">All directional indications (such as upper, lower, left, right, front, rear, etc.) in embodiments of the present disclosure are used only to explain relative positional relationships, motion situations, etc., between components under a particular posture (as shown in the drawings), and will change accordingly if the particular posture changes.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In that present disclosure, expressions concerning &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; etc., are for descriptive purposes only and cannot be understood as indicating or implying their relative importance or implying the number of technical features indicated. Thus, features defined with &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second&#x201d; may explicitly or implicitly include at least one of such features.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In that present disclosure, unless otherwise specified and defined, the terms &#x201c;connect,&#x201d; &#x201c;fix&#x201d; and the like should be understood broadly, for example, the expression concerning &#x201c;connect&#x201d; may be referred to a fixed connection, a detachable connection, or an integral form, may be a mechanical connection or an electrical connection, may be a direct connection or an indirect connection with an intermediate component, may be a communication between interiors of two components or an interaction between two components. For those skilled in the art, the specific meaning of the above terms in the present disclosure may be understood by case.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the technical solutions in the various embodiments of the present disclosure may be combined with each other on the basis of practicability for those skilled in the art. The combination which causes conflicts should be considered as nonexistent and does not fall within the protection scope as claimed by the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Typically, for pitching movement of an end effector of the robotic arm, the end effector is fixed to a pulley at a joint which the end effector rotates about. The pulley is driven to rotate under control of a strap connected thereto and wrapping thereon and the end effector rotates with the pulley to complete the pitching movement.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a typical design, as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an inner lug <b>120</b>&#x2032; is provided on the end effector <b>200</b>, and includes two tabs spaced from each other. The pulley <b>110</b>&#x2032; is sandwiched between the two tabs with both end surfaces of the pulley being fixed to the two tabs, respectively. The pulley <b>110</b>&#x2032; is hold by the two tabs and spaced from the end effector <b>200</b> for allowing straps <b>300</b> to wrap on the pulley <b>110</b>&#x2032;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in which the inner lug <b>120</b>&#x2032; is omitted, shows how the straps <b>300</b> wraps on the pulley <b>110</b>&#x2032;. The straps <b>300</b> each has an end fixed to the pulley <b>110</b>&#x2032;. Then, the inner lug <b>120</b>&#x2032; together with the pulley <b>110</b>&#x2032; is inserted into an outer lug (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) provided on a link of the robotic arm connected to the end effector <b>200</b>. The inner lug <b>120</b>&#x2032; is pivotally connected to the outer lug by a pin to form the joint at which the end effector <b>200</b> and the link are connected. Thus, the thickness of the joint in the typical design is at least the sum of the thicknesses of the pulley <b>110</b>&#x2032;, the inner lug <b>120</b>&#x2032;, and the outer lug, resulting in a large size of the joint.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Hence, it is necessary to reduce the size of the joint and meanwhile ensure the reliability of the connections at the joint (e.g., the connection between the pulley and the end effector, the connection between the strap and the pulley, etc.) for normal operation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a pulley <b>100</b> including a wheel portion <b>110</b> and a lug portion <b>120</b>. The wheel portion <b>110</b> is substantially cylindrical and includes two opposite circular end surfaces <b>114</b> and a side surface connecting the two circular end surfaces <b>114</b>. The side surface includes a main arc face <b>111</b> and at least one branch arc face <b>112</b>. The branch arc face <b>112</b> has a head end connected to the main arc face <b>111</b>. In an axial direction of the wheel portion, the branch arc face <b>112</b> has a width smaller than that of the main arc face <b>111</b>, The branch arc face <b>112</b> and the main arc face <b>111</b> form a continuous circular arc surface. The lug portion <b>120</b> is fixed to the wheel portion <b>110</b> and is disposed at a position adjacent to the branch arc face <b>112</b> along the width of the main arc face <b>111</b> and extends to protrude beyond the branch arc face <b>112</b> in a radial direction of the wheel portion <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in the pulley <b>100</b>, the branch arc face <b>112</b> further includes a tail end configured to connect a strap <b>300</b> which rides on the continuous circular arc surface formed by the branch arc face <b>112</b> and the main arc face <b>111</b>. The lug portion <b>120</b> is configured to connect the pulley <b>100</b> to a driven unit <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this embodiment, the main arcuate surface <b>111</b> and the branch arc face <b>112</b> forms the continuous circular arc surface for wrapping of the strap <b>300</b>. Compared with the typical pulley which is merely shaped as a wheel, the pulley according to the embodiment of the present disclosure includes, not only the wheel portion <b>11</b> which is substantially cylindrical and has the main arcuate surface <b>111</b> and the branch arc face <b>112</b>, but also the lug portion <b>120</b> which protrudes from the wheel portion <b>11</b> and configured to be fixed to the driven unit. Compared with the existing technology, the present disclosure provides an integrally formed pulley which is simpler in structure, in which the wheel portion <b>110</b> is improved for wrapping of the strap <b>300</b> and an additional lug portion <b>120</b> is provided on the wheel portion <b>110</b>, the pulley is fixed to the driven unit <b>200</b> through the lug portion <b>120</b> integrally formed with the wheel portion <b>110</b>, so that components such as the tabs <b>120</b>&#x2032; of the inner lug as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can be omitted. In this way, the thickness of the connection of the pulley <b>100</b> is reduced, and a compact structure including the pulley <b>100</b> and the driven unit <b>200</b> is achieved, resulting in a smaller size and a lower weight of the robotic arm and thus improving operative accuracy during the surgeries.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an embodiment, the lug portion <b>120</b> includes a first end surface <b>121</b> adjacent to and perpendicular to the branch arc face <b>112</b>, a second end surface <b>122</b> opposite to the first end surface <b>121</b>, a first side surface <b>123</b> connecting the first end surface <b>121</b> and the second end surface <b>122</b> and extending from the main arc face <b>111</b>, a top surface <b>124</b> connecting the first end surface <b>121</b> and the second end surface <b>122</b> and disposed at a top of the pulley <b>100</b>, and a second side surface <b>125</b> disposed above the branch arc face <b>112</b> and connecting the top surface <b>124</b>. The top surface <b>124</b> is, for example, flat and is configured to be attached to a surface (for example, which is also flat) of the driven unit <b>200</b>, so that the pulley <b>100</b> is fixed to the driven unit <b>200</b>. As an example, the top surface <b>124</b> is fixed to the flat surface of a main arm of the driven unit <b>200</b> by mechanical connection or welding, or is integrally formed with the main arm of the driven unit <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this embodiment, with the reasonable design of the lug portion <b>120</b>, the pulley <b>100</b> is connected to the driven unit <b>200</b> through the connection of two flat surfaces. While in the existing technology, the connection between the pulley and the driven unit is realized by inserting the pulley between tabs of the driven unit, which may become loose during a long-term operation. The solution provided in the embodiment of the present disclosure avoids such problems during the long-term operation, and thus improves the reliability.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, a connector chamber <b>113</b> is provided at the tail end of the branch arc face <b>112</b> and configured to receive and hold a strap connector <b>301</b> which is connected to the strap <b>300</b>. For example, the strap connector <b>301</b> is matched in shape with the connector chamber <b>113</b>. The connector chamber <b>113</b> may be located in the wheel portion <b>110</b>, or in the lug portion <b>120</b>, or at a position where the wheel portion <b>110</b> and the lug portion <b>120</b> connected. The connector chamber <b>113</b> includes an abdomen and a mouth sized smaller than the abdomen, and the mouth opens to the branch arc face <b>112</b>. In a specific application, the strap connector <b>301</b> is received in the connector chamber <b>113</b>, and the strap <b>300</b> extends out of the connector chamber <b>113</b> through the mouth and further extends along and rides on the branch arc face <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, the connector chamber <b>113</b> with a large abdomen and a small mouth is provided to connect the strap connector <b>301</b> without requiring any additional fastener such as screws, which simplifies the connection of the strap connector, and contributes to the reasonable design of the lug portion <b>120</b> on the wheel portion <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an embodiment, the mouth of the connector chamber <b>113</b> has a top connecting the second side surface <b>125</b>, and the top surface <b>124</b> is disposed above the connector chamber <b>113</b> and spaced from the connector chamber <b>113</b>. In this way, with such a simple structure, it is effectively ensured that no interference occurs between the strap connector and the robotic arm or the driven unit <b>200</b> during operation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment, the pulley <b>100</b> is rotated-symmetrical about the radial direction of the wheel portion <b>110</b> (i.e., the broken line L as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Each of the left and right sides of the pulley <b>100</b> includes a branch arc face <b>112</b>, a connector chamber <b>113</b> and a lug portion <b>120</b>, so that the two straps <b>300</b> are connected to the pulley and run in opposite directions. Specifically, the first end surfaces <b>121</b> (i.e., a first end surface <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> on the left and a first end surface <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> on the right as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), the second end surfaces <b>122</b> (i.e., a second end surface <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> on the left and a second end surface <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> on the right as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) and the second side surfaces <b>125</b> (not indicated with separate reference numerals) of the two lug portions <b>120</b> are also rotated-symmetrical. The rotated-symmetrical structure makes it possible to connect the straps <b>300</b> at both sides.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an embodiment, each of the two branch arc faces <b>112</b> has a central angle larger than 90&#xb0;, so that the pulley <b>100</b> is driven by the straps <b>300</b> to rotate both clockwise and anticlockwise by over 90&#xb0;. In an embodiment, the main arc face <b>111</b> has a central angle of 180&#xb0;. The width of each of the two branch arc faces <b>112</b> is half that of the main arc face <b>111</b>. Alternatively, the width of each of the two branch arc faces <b>112</b> may be less than a half of the width of the main arc face <b>111</b>. The two branch arc faces <b>112</b> partly overlap in the axial direction of the wheel portion <b>110</b> and share the main arc face <b>111</b>. In this way, the wheel portion <b>110</b> has a simple structure. In an embodiment, the first side surface <b>123</b> of the lug portion <b>120</b> transitions smoothly to the main arc face <b>111</b> and extends in a direction away from the main arc face <b>111</b> to be lifted from a plane that is tangent to the main arc face <b>111</b> at the connection between the main arc face <b>111</b> and the first side surface <b>123</b>. In this way, the pulley <b>100</b> has a smooth outline, and the connection area between the pulley <b>100</b> and the driven unit <b>200</b> is increased. In an embodiment, the top surface <b>124</b> includes a main connection surface <b>1241</b> on each side and an intermediate connection surface <b>1242</b> connecting the main connection surfaces <b>1241</b>. In an embodiment, a wiring hole <b>1243</b> is provided and opens at the top surface <b>124</b> for allowing wires to pass therethrough and enter the driven unit <b>200</b>. The wiring hole <b>1243</b> penetrates through an inner wall of the wheel portion <b>110</b> to communicate a mounting hole <b>115</b> defined by the inner wall. In an embodiment, the mounting hole <b>115</b> penetrates through the two circular end surfaces in the axial direction of the wheel portion <b>110</b>. The mounting hole <b>115</b> allows a rotary shaft of the robotic arm to be inserted therein.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the above embodiments, with cooperation of the lug portion <b>120</b> and the connector, the pulley <b>100</b> can achieve the connection between the connector and the lug portion <b>120</b> and the normal wrapping of the strap, and the driven unit <b>200</b> is rotatable by a large angle with driven of the pulley <b>100</b>. Meanwhile, the thickness of the robotic arm is reduced and the reliability of the connection between the robotic arm and the end effector is ensured. Further, no interference with the robotic arm occurs in the subsequent installation.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a structure including a pulley and a driven unit connected to each other. The pulley <b>100</b> is connected to the driven unit <b>200</b> through the lug portion <b>120</b>. For example, the lug portion <b>120</b> is fixed to the driven unit <b>200</b> by mechanical connection or welding, or is integrally formed with the driven unit <b>200</b>. For example, the top surface <b>124</b> of the lug portion <b>120</b> is attached to a flat surface of the driven unit <b>200</b>. The driven unit <b>200</b> may be an end effector for a robotic arm, particularly an end instrument holder of a surgical robot. The strap connector <b>301</b> at the end of the strap <b>300</b> is held in the connector chamber <b>113</b> below the top surface <b>124</b>, and the second side surface <b>125</b> provides a safe distance for avoiding interference between the strap connector and the driven unit <b>200</b>. The pulley <b>100</b> is fixed to the driven unit <b>200</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, and then the strap connector <b>301</b> is inserted into the connector chamber <b>113</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, and then a rotary shaft is inserted into the mounting hole <b>115</b>, and the pulley <b>100</b> is sandwiched by the robotic arm housing <b>400</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.

The robotic arm may be used in a surgical robot.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this structure, the connection of the driven unit <b>200</b> and the pulley <b>100</b> are &#x201c;half-connected,&#x201d; that is, two straps <b>300</b> each wraps about a half of the pulley <b>100</b> on the left side or right side, and the lug portion <b>120</b> without strap <b>300</b> wrapping thereon is connected to the driven unit <b>200</b>. In this way, the thickness of the connection is greatly reduced as the tabs of the end effector used in the existing surgical robot is omitted, resulting in a reduced thickness of the end link of the robotic arm and a compact connection with higher rigidity.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the pulley is rotated-symmetrical about the radial direction of the wheel portion <b>110</b> with being hollowed at the front upper left and the rear upper right, or at the front upper right and the rear upper left. The straps <b>300</b> are connected to the lug portion and extend to ride on the wheel portion within the hollows. In this way, the thickness of the link of the robotic arm is greatly reduced. The rigidity of connection is increased as the connection area between the lug portions and the end effector.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an embodiment, the strap <b>300</b> may include a steel strap, or other flexible transmission mechanisms such as belts, ropes, or the like. During running of the strap, the pulley rotates by less than a round. The lug portion for connection with the driven unit is disposed at a same level in the width of the pulley as the strap, resulting an improved efficiency in space utilization.

In this way, the thickness of the connection of the pulley <b>100</b> is reduced, and a compact structure including the pulley <b>100</b> and the driven unit <b>200</b> is achieved, resulting in a smaller size and a lower weight of the robotic arm and thus improving operative accuracy during the surgeries.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The description above is merely some embodiments of the present disclosure, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.
