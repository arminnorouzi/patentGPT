The measurement of the electrical activity present on the cardiac walls is called mapping. For this purpose, a multiple electrode mapping catheter may be positioned within the heart such that multiple potentials can be simultaneously measured at different locations on the wall of the cardiac chamber without having direct wall contact (non-contact mapping). The cardiac chamber is visualized as a three dimensional structure, either directly by moving one or more mapping electrodes within the corresponding heart chamber or by importing an anatomical geometry of the cardiac chamber from an imaging device (e.g. Computed Tomography, MRI, or ultrasound). The electrical activity within the heart can be measured with the multi-electrode mapping catheter, which may be able to simultaneously measure potentials at different points in three dimensional space. In the current systems, the measured potentials from the non-contact multi-electrode mapping catheter do not directly correspond to the electrical activity on the cardiac wall as measured with an electrode with direct wall contact (contact mapping). The measured potentials of the non-contact mapping system have to be converted with computer programs and extrapolated into virtual electrograms projected on the heart chamber of the mapping system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 5,297,549 (Beatty, et al.) discloses a method of generating a three-dimensional map of electrical activity in a heart chamber as well as a two-dimensional map of the electrical activity within the endocardial surface. Beatty generates the information via an array of electrodes placed in a heart chamber utilizing impedance plethysmography, while one electrode serves as a reference.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The current conversion methods suffer various instabilities, and further processing, termed regularization, must be applied to maintain stability. Regularization decreases spatial resolution. Another limitation of the current methods is that the provided potentials represent only the mean electrical activity summed across a large region of tissue, with cells consisting of membranes separating electrical dipoles.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the localization of cardiac arrhythmias by the use of potentials is imprecise, the successful treatment of cardiac arrhythmias has been difficult and has demonstrated limited success and reliability. There is, therefore, a need for improved methods of localizing cardiac arrhythmias.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention discloses devices and methods for real time, non-contact imaging and distance measurements using ultrasound for dipole density mapping, as well as methods for diagnosing tissue health. In one aspect, the present invention includes a device comprising one or more catheters, each catheter comprising a shaft. The shaft may include a lumen and may be steerable. The shaft may include, typically near its distal end, one or more components selected from group consisting of: electrodes, such as electrodes configured to record electrical activity of tissue; transducers such as ultrasound transducers; sensors, such as ultrasound sensors; ultrasound crystals configured to both transmit and sense ultrasound waves; and combinations of these. The device is constructed and arranged to produce continuous, real-time images of a patient's tissue, as well as information related to electrical activity present in the tissue. For example, a user, such as a clinician may image a patient's cardiac chamber, including the cardiac walls. The device is also capable of providing tissue information, for example, tissue movement and tissue thickness. Additionally, the device is configured to produce distance measurements by analyzing at least one of the sensors recorded angles or frequency changes. Non-limiting examples of distance measurements include: distance between the multiple electrodes and the wall of the cardiac chamber and distance between the multiple electrodes and the transducer and/or sensor. The device may be configured to provide a tissue diagnostic through an analysis of both tissue motion information and cell electrical signals. The cell electrical signals may be recorded by the multiple electrodes, while tissue motion information may be gathered by the multiple electrodes and/or the sensor. The device is configured to provide exact foci and conduction-gap position information, such that ablation is performed with an increased level of precision. Small conduction paths, including &#x201c;gaps&#x201d; in a line, are equally relevant as foci. The device may include an ablation catheter, such as an ablation catheter that can be precisely delivered through an open lumen of a second device catheter, or through a sheath.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the device may include a catheter which is further configured as a delivery sheath. For example, a first catheter may comprise a lumen, such that a separate ablation catheter may be slidingly received by the first catheter. Additionally, a single sheath may be provided to allow the first catheter and the ablation catheter to pass there though. This construction would eliminate the need for multiple sheath devices.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, one or more catheters of the device may be steerable. For example, a user may determine the ablation site via real-time tissue analysis and imaging, and subsequently a catheter may be steered to the desired location. Steering of one or more catheters may be achieved via cables, such as cables which may be housed in a lumen of a delivery sheath.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The device comprises a transducer, preferably an ultrasound transducer configured to produce sound waves, typically at a frequency between 5 and 18 MHz. The sound waves may be at a constant rate or provided in a pulsed manner. The device may comprise multiple transducers. One or more transducers may be positioned on one or more catheters of the device, such as on or near a distal portion of a catheter. One or more transducers may be further configured as sensors, such as ultrasound crystals that both record and emit sound waves.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The device comprises a sensor, preferably an ultrasound sensor configured to receive the sound waves produced by the ultrasound transducer. The device may comprise multiple sensors. One or more sensors may be positioned on one or more catheters of the device, such as on or near a distal portion of a catheter. One or more sensors may be further configured as transducers, such as ultrasound crystals that both record and emit sound waves.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The sensors, transducers, or combination sensor/transducers may be positioned on the device in various locations including but not limited to: attached to the shaft of the catheter; housed within the shaft of the catheter, for example, the sensor and/or transducer may be slidingly received by the shaft; at the geometric center of each of the multiple electrodes; proximate to at least one of the multiple electrodes; mounted to a multiple arm assembly; and combinations of these. The device may include one or more electrodes configured to record electrical activity in the tissue of cells. Various ratios of electrodes to sensors, transducers, or combination sensor/transducers may be included. In one embodiment, a ratio of two electrodes to one ultrasound crystal is provided, such as a single component with one ultrasound crystal and an electrode positioned at each end of the crystal. In another embodiment, a ratio of five electrodes to two sensor/transducers is provided, such as a catheter shaft including two assemblies and a single electrode. Each assembly includes an ultrasound crystal with an electrode positioned at each end.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The transducer and/or the sensor may be rotated, which may include a partial rotation or a full 360&#xb0; rotation.

Additionally, this threshold will be different for each chamber of the heart as well as from smaller to larger patients.

Surface charge density or dipole densities represent precise and sharp information of the electric activity with a good spatial resolution, whereas potentials resulting from integration of charge densities provide only a diffuse picture of electric activity. The electric nature of cardiac cell membranes comprising ionic charges of proteins and soluble ions can be precisely described by surface charge and dipole densities. The surface charge densities or dipole densities cannot be directly measured in the heart, but instead must be mathematically and accurately calculated starting from measured potentials. In other words, the information of voltage maps obtained by current mapping systems can be greatly refined when calculating surface charge densities or dipole densities from these.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0219">The surface charge density means surface charge (Coulombs) per unit area (cm<sup>2</sup>). A dipole, as such, is a neutral element, wherein a part comprises a positive charge and the other part comprises the same but negative charge. A dipole might represent the electric nature of cellular membranes better, because in biological environment ion charges are not macroscopically separated.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0220">In order to generate a map of surface charge densities (surface charge density distribution) according to the '380 patent application, the geometry of the given heart chamber must be known. The 3D geometry of the cardiac chamber is typically assessed by currently available and common mapping systems (so-called locator systems) or, alternatively, by integrating anatomical data from CT/MRI scans. For the measurement of potentials the non-contact mapping method a probe electrode was used. The probe electrode may be a multi-electrode array with elliptic or spherical shape. The spherical shape has certain advantages for the subsequent data analysis. But also other types or even several independent electrodes could be used to measure V<sub>e</sub>. For example, when considering the ventricular cavity within the endocardium and taking a probe electrode with a surface SP, which is located in the blood, it is possible to measure the potential V(x,y,z) at point x,y,z on the surface SP.
