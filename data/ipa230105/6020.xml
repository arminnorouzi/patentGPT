It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the &#x201c;lower&#x201d; side of other elements would then be oriented on &#x201c;upper&#x201d; sides of the other elements. The term &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; can therefore, encompasses both an orientation of &#x201c;lower&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; depending on the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements. The terms &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">&#x201c;About&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; as used herein is inclusive of the stated value and means within an acceptable range of deviation for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, considering the measurement in question and the error associated with measurement of the particular quantity (i.e., the limitations of the measurement system). For example, &#x201c;about&#x201d; can mean within one or more standard deviations, or within &#xb1;30%, 20%, 10% or 5% of the stated value.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs.

As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments described herein should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions as illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region illustrated or described as flat may, typically, have rough and/or nonlinear features. Moreover, sharp angles that are illustrated may be rounded. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region and are not intended to limit the scope of the present claims.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Illustrative, non-limiting embodiments will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> are plan views illustrating embodiments of a display device <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating the display device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line I-I&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Accordingly, the connection failure between the first pad part <b>170</b> and the lead part <b>220</b> due to the massing of the conductive balls <b>414</b> or the connection failure between the second pad part <b>180</b> and the bump part <b>320</b> due to the massing of the conductive balls <b>424</b> may be prevented or reduced.

Accordingly, the protrusion of the second adhesive layer <b>520</b> may be easily removed since the circuit board <b>200</b> is not attached to the display panel <b>100</b>.
