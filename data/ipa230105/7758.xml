Sonos then filed one of its first patent applications in 2003, entitled &#x201c;Method for Synchronizing Audio Playback between Multiple Networked Devices,&#x201d; and began offering its first media playback systems for sale in 2005. The Sonos Wireless Home Sound System enables people to experience music from many sources via one or more networked playback devices. Through a software control application installed on a controller (e.g., smartphone, tablet, computer, voice input device), one can play what she wants in any room having a networked playback device. Media content (e.g., songs, podcasts, video sound) can be streamed to playback devices such that each room with a playback device can play back corresponding different media content. In addition, rooms can be grouped together for synchronous playback of the same media content, and/or the same media content can be heard in all rooms synchronously.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Features, aspects, and advantages of the presently disclosed technology may be better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings, as listed below.

Overview</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments described herein relate to methods for a control device (such as a remote) that is moveable throughout a media playback system environment. Further embodiments relate to system architectures of networked devices and control devices.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">An example media playback system may comprise one or more areas or zones, each including one or more networked devices. For example, networked devices associated with different areas or zones may be physically located in different locations, such as in the different rooms of a house. For example, a media playback system may include a living room zone, a dining room zone, a kitchen zone, a bathroom zone, a hallway zone, an office zone, and/or a bedroom zone, in which networked devices are located. A control device may control some or all of the networked devices in the playback system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some examples, one or more networked devices comprise an illumination device (such as a light) and a playback device. In certain examples, the control device can operate in at least two modes. In a first mode, the control device is configured to control the illumination device of the networked device and in the second mode, the control device is configured to control the playback device of the networked device. A user can switch between modes by operating one or more input interfaces (such as buttons) of the control device.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Accordingly, in some embodiments, a method for a control device comprises configuring the control device to control a first networked device. While controlling the first networked device and while operating in a first mode, the method comprises receiving, via the control device, first input data, the first input data indicative of a command to control an illumination device of the first networked device. In response to (or after), receiving the first input data, the method comprises controlling the illumination device of the first networked device. While controlling the first networked device and while operating in a second mode, the method comprises receiving, via the control device, second input data, the second input data indicative of a command to control a playback device of the first networked device. In response to (or after) receiving the second input data, the method comprises controlling the playback device of the first networked device. Controlling the playback device and/or illumination device may comprise transmitting one or more commands to the playback device and/or illumination device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">To operate the control device in a particular mode, a user may operate one or more input interfaces of the control device. The user can therefore cause the control device to switch between different modes. Accordingly, in some examples, the method comprises receiving, via the control device, third input data, the third input data indicative of a command to operate the control device in the first mode. In response to (or after) receiving the third input data, the method comprises operating the control device in the first mode. The method may further comprise receiving, via the control device, fourth input data, the fourth input data indicative of a command to operate the control device in the second mode. In response to (or after) receiving the fourth input data, the method comprises operating the control device in the second mode.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, the control device can provide a notification or indication of the particular mode in which it is operating. Thus, in some examples, the control device comprises an indicator assembly, and operating the control device in the first mode comprises generating, by the indicator assembly, at least one of an audio indication and a visual indication to indicate that the control device is operating in the first mode and operating the control device in the second mode comprises generating, by the indicator assembly, at least one of an audio indication and a visual indication to indicate that the control device is operating in the second mode.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a particular example, the indicator assembly comprises a first indicator and a second indicator, and operating the control device in the first mode comprises generating, by the first indicator, at least one of an audio indication and a visual indication to indicate that the control device is operating in the first mode and operating the control device in the second mode comprises generating, by the second indicator, at least one of an audio indication and a visual indication to indicate that the control device is operating in the second mode. Accordingly, the control device may have a separate indicator for each mode. The first and second indicators may be of the same type or of different types. For example, the first indicator and the second indicator can both be audio indicators (such as different audio tones), both be visual indicators (such as different icons), or one be a visual indicator and the other be an audio indicator.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some examples, the control device may operate in a hybrid (or third) mode, which is a combination of the first and second modes. When operating the hybrid mode, the control device can therefore be used to control the illumination device or playback device, without needing to switch between modes. Certain input interfaces of the control device may control the illumination device and other input interfaces of the control device may control the playback device. In other examples, certain types of input to an input interface of the control device may control the illumination device and other types of input to the same input interface of the control device may control the playback device. Accordingly, the method may comprise receiving, via the control device, fifth input data, the fifth input data indicative of a command to operate the control device in the first and second modes simultaneously. In response to (or after) receiving the fifth input data, the method comprises operating the control device in a hybrid mode, wherein in the hybrid mode, the control device is configured to receive input data indicative of commands to control the playback device and commands to control the illumination device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, as the control device is moved throughout the playback system, the control device detects the presence of one or more networked devices within a proximity of the control device. The control device may therefore be configured to control a networked device that is within a proximity of the control device. Accordingly, in some examples, the method comprises, before configuring the control device to control the first networked device, detecting that the first networked device is within a proximity of the control device. Detecting that the first networked device is within a proximity of the control device corresponds to detecting that the control device is within a proximity of the first networked device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, networked devices can be grouped together in zones (also known as networked zones) and be controlled in unison. Accordingly, in some examples, the method further comprises determining that the first networked device forms part of a first networked zone, wherein the first networked zone comprises the first networked device and a second networked device, and wherein the first networked device and the second networked device each comprise an illumination device and a playback device. The first input data is therefore indicative of a command to control the illumination devices of the first and second networked devices and controlling the illumination device therefore comprises controlling the illumination devices of the first and second networked devices. Similarly, the second input data is therefore indicative of a command to control the playback devices of the first and second networked devices and controlling the playback device therefore comprises controlling the playback devices of the first and second networked devices.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Determining that the first networked device forms part of a first playback zone may comprise receiving a state variable from the first networked device or another networked device (such as the second networked device), where the state variable indicates that the first and second networked devices are members of the first networked zone. In some examples, the method comprises detecting that the first networked device is within a proximity of the control device. In some examples, the method comprises detecting that the first networked device and the second networked device are within a proximity of the control device.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some examples, the first and second networked devices are not part of the same networked zone. In such an example, even though the devices are not grouped, it may be useful to control the illumination devices of the networked devices at the same time using the control device. Accordingly, in some examples, the method comprises detecting that the first networked device and a second networked device are both within a proximity of the control device, wherein the first networked device and the second networked device each comprise an illumination device and a playback device, and determining that the first networked device forms at least part of a first networked zone and the second networked device forms at least part of a second networked zone. Accordingly, while operating in the first mode, the method may comprise receiving, via the control device, sixth input data. In response to (or after) receiving the sixth input data, the method comprises controlling both the illumination devices of the first and second networked devices. In contrast, while operating in the second mode, the method comprises receiving, via the control device, seventh input data. In response to (or after) receiving the seventh input data, the method comprises controlling a playback device of one of the first networked device and the second networked device. For example, only the playback device of the &#x201c;nearest&#x201d; networked device may be controlled.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As mentioned above, the particular zone grouping can be determined through the use of state variables. In some examples, it is further detected that the first and second networked devices are located within a particular room or area.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another example, the method comprises determining that the first networked device is within a proximity of the control device and determining that the first networked device and a second networked device are located within a particular room or area. The method further comprises determining that the first networked device forms at least part of a first networked zone and that the second networked device forms at least part of a second networked zone. The first networked device and the second networked device each comprise an illumination device and a playback device. While operating in the first mode, the method comprises receiving, via the control device, sixth input data. In response to (or after) receiving the sixth input data, the method comprises controlling both the illumination devices of the first and second networked devices. While operating in the second mode, the method comprises receiving, via the control device, seventh input data. In response to (or after) receiving the seventh input data, the method comprises controlling a playback device of one of the first networked device and the second networked device. Accordingly, in some examples, only the proximity to the first networked device is detected, and the control device determines the presence of the second networked device via other means, such as through the use of state variables which indicate that the first networked device is within a room or area with a second networked device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As the control device is moved throughout the playback environment, the control device can detect the presence of new networked devices and move out of range/proximity of other networked devices. Accordingly, the method may further comprise detecting that the first networked device is no longer within a proximity of the control device and detecting that a second networked device is within a proximity of the control device. The method further comprises configuring the control device to control the second networked device. In some examples, the method further comprises, while controlling the second networked device and while operating in the first mode, receiving, via the control device, eighth input data, the eighth input data indicative of a command to control an illumination device of the second networked device. In response to (or after) receiving the eighth input data, the method comprises controlling the illumination device of the second networked device. While controlling the second networked device and while operating in the second mode, the method comprises receiving, via the control device, ninth input data, the ninth input data indicative of a command to control a playback device of the second networked device. In response to (or after) receiving the ninth input data, the method further comprises controlling the playback device of the second networked device. Accordingly, as the control device moves throughout the playback system, the control device is updated to control the second networked device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some examples, the control device can notify a user when the control device is within (or no longer within) a proximity of a particular networked device. Accordingly, in an example, the control device comprises an indicator assembly and the indicator assembly is configured to generate at least one of an audio indication and a visual indication in response to (or after) at least one of: (i) detecting that the first networked device is no longer within a proximity of the control device, and (ii) detecting that the second networked device is within a proximity of the control device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some examples, the control device comprises a plurality of input interfaces (such as buttons), which when operated, generate input data which is therefore received by the control device. Depending upon which device the control device is controlling and which mode the device is operating in, a single button may control different functions of different devices. Accordingly, the control device comprises at least a first button, and wherein: operation of the first button at a first time generates the first input data, operation of the first button at a second time generates the second input data, operation of the first button at a third time generates the eighth input data and operation of the first button at a fourth time generates the ninth input data.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Various methods of detecting whether a networked device is within a proximity of the control device are possible. In a first example, detecting that the first networked device is within a proximity of the control device comprises receiving, from a computing device, a signal and in response to (or after) receiving the signal, determining that the first networked device is within a proximity of the control device. The computing device may be a beacon, such as a Bluetooth Beacon. The computing device may comprise an NFC module or transponder. The signal may identify a location (which is used to obtain one or more device identifiers of networked devices associated with that location), or may comprise one or more device identifiers of networked devices associated with a location, or may comprise an identifier of the computing device itself (which is used to obtain one or more device identifiers of networked devices associated with a location).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, the first networked device comprises the computing device. In other examples, the computing device is separate to the first networked device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a second example, as the control device moves throughout the environment, motion of the control device is detected. The control device may comprise one or more motion sensors, such as an accelerometer. Based on the detected motion, a location of the control device can be determined or inferred. Accordingly, in the second example, detecting that the first networked device is within a proximity of the control device comprises detecting motion of the control device and, based on the detected motion, determining a location of the control device. The method further comprises determining that the first networked device is associated with the location. The location may be a &#x201c;final&#x201d; location of the control device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some examples, before detecting the motion, the method comprises determining an initial location of the control device. The method comprises detecting motion of the control device from the initial location. In some examples, detecting the initial location comprises determining which networked device the control device is currently controlling. Determining the final location of the control device may therefore be based on the initial location.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a third example, the location of the control device can be determined based on the strength of signals received from one or more devices (such as one or more networked devices). Accordingly, detecting that the first networked device is within a proximity of the control device comprises receiving, from the first networked device, a first signal having a first signal strength, receiving, from a second networked device, a second signal having a second signal strength and determining, based on the first and second signal strengths, that the control device is closer to the first networked device than the second networked device, wherein the first signal strength is stronger than the second signal strength. In other examples, a received signal can be compared to a threshold to determine proximity. For example, a received signal may be compared to a predetermined signal strength threshold, such as a predetermined Received Signal Strength Indication, RSSI. Alternatively or additionally, the received signal may be compared to a predetermined signal quality threshold such as a Bit Error Rate, BER, threshold or a RSSI threshold. (RSSI can indicate a strength of a signal above a noise floor and also give an indication of signal quality.)</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a fourth example, the control device comprises a microphone, and the location is determined by receiving data transmitted in an acoustic signal from one or more networked devices. Accordingly, detecting that the first networked device is within a proximity of the control device comprises receiving, by a microphone of the control device, an acoustic signal from the first networked device and based on the acoustic signal, determining that the first networked device is within a proximity of the control device. Data transmitted in an acoustic signal may be audible, such as below about 18 kHz or substantially inaudible (sometimes referred to as an &#x201c;ultrasonic chirp&#x201d;) with a frequency above about 18 kHz or above about 20 kHz. The signal comprises data, and the data may identify a location or comprise one or more device identifiers.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some examples, a control device may be configured to operate with a different networked device by associating the control device with a docking station, and receiving data from the docking station that identifies the networked device. Accordingly, in some examples, a method comprises detecting that the control device is associated with a docking station and while the control device is associated with the docking station, receiving, from the docking station, data associated with a second networked device. In response to (or after) receiving the data, the method comprises configuring the control device to control the second networked device.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some examples, the playback system comprises a plurality of control devices including a first control device and a second control device. The first control device is configured to control only a first networked device and the second control device can be configured to control the first networked device and a second networked device at different times. For example, at a particular moment in time the second control device may control the networked device that is closest to the second control device. In some examples, by placing the second control device in a first docking station associated with the first networked device, the second control device can be configured to control the first networked device. Similarly, by placing the second control device in a second docking station associated with the second networked device, the second control device can be configured to control the second networked device. The first control device can be considered to be a static control device, because it always controls the same networked device, and the second control device can be considered to be a roaming control device, because it can control the first and/or second networked devices. The first control device may therefore only control the first networked device even if it is placed in the second docking station. The second control device may be associated with the second docking station (and/or second networked device) by default. For example, when the control device is turned on, it may be initially configured to control the second networked device even if it had previously been controlling the first networked device.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some examples, the control device can be used to group together one or more networked devices (as part of a grouping procedure) by moving the control device throughout the playback environment to group particular devices. Accordingly, a method comprises detecting that the first networked device is within a proximity of the control device and receiving tenth input data, the tenth input data indicative of a command to start a grouping procedure to group the first networked device with at least one other networked device. During the grouping procedure, the method comprises detecting that a second networked device is within a proximity of the control device. The method further comprises receiving eleventh input data, the eleventh input data indicative of a command to end the grouping procedure. After receiving the eleventh input data, the method comprises causing the first and second networked devices to form a group. If the first networked device is initially playing back media content, such as music, the music may, in effect, follow the user as the user carries the control device between the two networked devices.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some examples, before receiving the tenth input data, the playback device of the first networked device is playing back media content. In response to (or after) grouping the first and second networked devices, the method further comprises causing the second networked device to play back media content in synchrony with the playback device of the first networked device.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some examples the second networked device comprises a playback device and an illumination device. Accordingly, if the illumination device of the first networked device is outputting light before receiving the tenth input data, then in response to (or after) grouping the first and second networked devices, the illumination device of the second networked device is caused to output light.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another embodiment, a control device comprises a network interface configured to transmit commands to at least a first networked device, the first networked device comprising a playback device and an illumination device. The control device further comprises at least one input interface configured to generate input data in response to (or after) operation of the at the least one input interface. The control device further comprises a storage and a processing system. The storage comprises non-transitory computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the processing system, instruct the control device to: operate in a first mode and in response to (or after) operation of the at least one input interface, generate first input data, the first input data indicative of a command to control an illumination device of the first networked device. In response to (or after) generating the first input data, the instructions instruct the control device to transmit via the network interface, a command to control the illumination device of the first networked device. The instructions further instruct the control device to: operate in a second mode and in response to (or after) operation of the at least one input interface, generate second input data, the second input data indicative of a command to control a playback device of the first networked device. In response to (or after) generating the second input data, the instructions instruct the control device to transmit via the network interface, a command to control the playback device of the first networked device. The commands transmitted to at least the first networked device may be transmitted directly or indirectly, such as via one or more of a gateway, access point or another networked device.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In further examples, the instructions instruct the control device to perform any or all of the other method steps described above or herein.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a further embodiment, a control device comprises a network interface configured to transmit commands to at least a first networked device, the first networked device comprising a playback device and an illumination device.

The control device further comprises a storage and a processing system. The storage comprises non-transitory computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the processing system, instruct the control device to perform any of the method steps described above or herein.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In another embodiment, there is provided a non-transitory computer-readable medium having computer program instructions embodied thereon, wherein the computer program instructions, when executed by a processing system of a control device, instruct the control device to: operate in a first mode and in response to (or after) operation of at least one input interface of the control device, generate first input data, the first input data indicative of a command to control an illumination device of a first networked device. In response to (or after) generating the first input data, the instructions instruct the control device to transmit a command to control the illumination device of the first networked device. The instructions further instruct the control device to: operate in a second mode and in response to (or after) operation of the at least one input interface of the control device, generate second input data, the second input data indicative of a command to control a playback device of the first networked device. In response to (or after) generating the second input data, the instructions instruct the control device to transmit a command to control the playback device of the first networked device.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some examples, the control device comprises at least one network interface, such as an interface compliant with IEEE 802.15.4, such as ZigBee, or Bluetooth, such as Bluetooth or Bluetooth Low Energy, BLE, to communicate with a networked device via a particular communication protocol. The networked device comprises a corresponding network interface. Commands received by the networked device from the control device can be transmitted to a playback device and/or an illumination device within the networked device so that the commands can be executed. In some examples, the control device comprises two network interfaces and can transmit data to the networked device using at least one of these network interfaces. For example, the networked device may comprise only a single network interface, so the control device selects a corresponding network interface to transmit the data.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">While some examples described herein may refer to functions performed by given actors such as &#x201c;users,&#x201d; &#x201c;listeners,&#x201d; and/or other entities, it should be understood that this is for purposes of explanation only.

The playback device <b>110</b><i>r </i>optionally includes an integrated control device <b>130</b><i>c</i>. The control device <b>130</b><i>c </i>can comprise, for example, a user interface (e.g., the user interface <b>113</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) configured to receive user input (e.g., touch input, voice input) without a separate control device. In other embodiments, however, the playback device <b>110</b><i>r </i>receives commands from another control device (e.g., the control device <b>130</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0091">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>, the microphones <b>115</b> are configured to acquire, capture, and/or receive sound from an environment (e.g., the environment <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and/or a room in which the NMD <b>120</b><i>a </i>is positioned. The received sound can include, for example, vocal utterances, audio played back by the NMD <b>120</b><i>a </i>and/or another playback device, background voices, ambient sounds, etc. The microphones <b>115</b> convert the received sound into electrical signals to produce microphone data. The voice processing <b>124</b> receives and analyzes the microphone data to determine whether a voice input is present in the microphone data. The voice input can comprise, for example, an activation word followed by an utterance including a user request. As those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, an activation word is a word or other audio cue that signifying a user voice input. For instance, in querying the AMAZON&#xae; VAS, a user might speak the activation word &#x201c;Alexa.&#x201d; Other examples include &#x201c;Ok, Google&#x201d; for invoking the GOOGLE&#xae; VAS and &#x201c;Hey, Siri&#x201d; for invoking the APPLE&#xae; VAS.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0092">After detecting the activation word, voice processing <b>124</b> monitors the microphone data for an accompanying user request in the voice input. The user request may include, for example, a command to control a third-party device, such as a thermostat (e.g., NEST&#xae; thermostat), an illumination device (e.g., a PHILIPS HUE&#xae; lighting device), or a media playback device (e.g., a Sonos&#xae; playback device). For example, a user might speak the activation word &#x201c;Alexa&#x201d; followed by the utterance &#x201c;set the thermostat to 68 degrees&#x201d; to set a temperature in a home (e.g., the environment <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). The user might speak the same activation word followed by the utterance &#x201c;turn on the living room&#x201d; to turn on illumination devices in a living room area of the home.

In some aspects, for example, the control device <b>130</b><i>a </i>is configured as a playback device (e.g., one of the playback devices <b>110</b>). Similarly, in some embodiments the control device <b>130</b><i>a </i>is configured as an NMD (e.g., one of the NMDs <b>120</b>), receiving voice commands and other sounds via the one or more microphones <b>135</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0098">The one or more microphones <b>135</b> can comprise, for example, one or more condenser microphones, electret condenser microphones, dynamic microphones, and/or other suitable types of microphones or transducers.

In other embodiments, however, the control device <b>130</b><i>a </i>omits the one or more speakers <b>134</b> and/or the one or more microphones <b>135</b>. For instance, the control device <b>130</b><i>a </i>may comprise a device (e.g., a thermostat, an IoT device, a network device) comprising a portion of the electronics <b>132</b> and the user interface <b>133</b> (e.g., a touch screen) without any speakers or microphones.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0000">e. Suitable Playback Device Configurations</p><p id="p-0105" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>I through <b>1</b>M</figref> show example configurations of playback devices in zones and zone groups. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>, in one example, a single playback device may belong to a zone. For example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>g </i>in the second bedroom <b>101</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) may belong to Zone C. In some implementations described below, multiple playback devices may be &#x201c;bonded&#x201d; to form a &#x201c;bonded pair&#x201d; which together form a single zone. For example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>l </i>(e.g., a left playback device) can be bonded to the playback device <b>110</b><i>m </i>(e.g., a right playback device) to form Zone B. Bonded playback devices may have different playback responsibilities (e.g., channel responsibilities). In another implementation described below, multiple playback devices may be merged to form a single zone. For example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>h </i>(e.g., a front playback device) may be merged with the playback device <b>110</b><i>i </i>(e.g., a subwoofer), and the playback devices <b>110</b><i>j </i>and <b>110</b><i>k </i>(e.g., left and right surround speakers, respectively) to form a single Zone D. In another example, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>can be merged to form a merged group or a zone group <b>108</b><i>b</i>. The merged playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>may not be specifically assigned different playback responsibilities. That is, the merged playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>may, aside from playing audio content in synchrony, each play audio content as they would if they were not merged.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0100">Each zone in the media playback system <b>100</b> may be provided for control as a single user interface (UI) entity. For example, Zone A may be provided as a single entity named Master Bathroom. Zone B may be provided as a single entity named Master Bedroom. Zone C may be provided as a single entity named Second Bedroom.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0101">Playback devices that are bonded may have different playback responsibilities, such as responsibilities for certain audio channels. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref>, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>l </i>and <b>110</b><i>m </i>may be bonded so as to produce or enhance a stereo effect of audio content. In this example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>l </i>may be configured to play a left channel audio component, while the playback device <b>110</b><i>m </i>may be configured to play a right channel audio component. In some implementations, such stereo bonding may be referred to as &#x201c;pairing.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0108" num="0102">Additionally, bonded playback devices may have additional and/or different respective speaker drivers. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>J</figref>, the playback device <b>110</b><i>h </i>named Front may be bonded with the playback device <b>110</b><i>i </i>named SUB. The Front device <b>110</b><i>h </i>can be configured to render a range of mid to high frequencies and the SUB device <b>110</b><i>i </i>can be configured render low frequencies. When unbonded, however, the Front device <b>110</b><i>h </i>can be configured render a full range of frequencies. As another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>K</figref> shows the Front and SUB devices <b>110</b><i>h </i>and <b>110</b><i>i </i>further bonded with Left and Right playback devices <b>110</b><i>j </i>and <b>110</b><i>k</i>, respectively. In some implementations, the Right and Left devices <b>110</b><i>j </i>and <b>102</b><i>k </i>can be configured to form surround or &#x201c;satellite&#x201d; channels of a home theater system. The bonded playback devices <b>110</b><i>h</i>, <b>110</b><i>i</i>, <b>110</b><i>j</i>, and <b>110</b><i>k </i>may form a single Zone D (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0103">Playback devices that are merged may not have assigned playback responsibilities, and may each render the full range of audio content the respective playback device is capable of. Nevertheless, merged devices may be represented as a single UI entity (i.e., a zone, as discussed above). For instance, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>in the master bathroom have the single UI entity of Zone A. In one embodiment, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>may each output the full range of audio content each respective playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>are capable of, in synchrony.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0104">In some embodiments, an NMD is bonded or merged with another device so as to form a zone. For example, the NMD <b>120</b><i>b </i>may be bonded with the playback device <b>110</b><i>e</i>, which together form Zone F, named Living Room. In other embodiments, a stand-alone network microphone device may be in a zone by itself. In other embodiments, however, a stand-alone network microphone device may not be associated with a zone. Additional details regarding associating network microphone devices and playback devices as designated or default devices may be found, for example, in previously referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/438,749.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0105">Zones of individual, bonded, and/or merged devices may be grouped to form a zone group. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>, Zone A may be grouped with Zone B to form a zone group <b>108</b><i>a </i>that includes the two zones. Similarly, Zone G may be grouped with Zone H to form the zone group <b>108</b><i>b</i>. As another example, Zone A may be grouped with one or more other Zones C-I. The Zones A-I may be grouped and ungrouped in numerous ways. For example, three, four, five, or more (e.g., all) of the Zones A-I may be grouped. When grouped, the zones of individual and/or bonded playback devices may play back audio in synchrony with one another, as described in previously referenced U.S. Pat. No. 8,234,395. Playback devices may be dynamically grouped and ungrouped to form new or different groups that synchronously play back audio content.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0106">In various implementations, the zones in an environment may be the default name of a zone within the group or a combination of the names of the zones within a zone group. For example, Zone Group <b>108</b><i>b </i>can have be assigned a name such as &#x201c;Dining+Kitchen&#x201d;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>. In some embodiments, a zone group may be given a unique name selected by a user.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0107">Certain data may be stored in a memory of a playback device (e.g., the memory <b>112</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>) as one or more state variables that are periodically updated and used to describe the state of a playback zone, the playback device(s), and/or a zone group associated therewith. The memory may also include the data associated with the state of the other devices of the media system, and shared from time to time among the devices so that one or more of the devices have the most recent data associated with the system.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0108">In some embodiments, the memory may store instances of various variable types associated with the states. Variables instances may be stored with identifiers (e.g., tags) corresponding to type. For example, certain identifiers may be a first type &#x201c;al&#x201d; to identify playback device(s) of a zone, a second type &#x201c;b1&#x201d; to identify playback device(s) that may be bonded in the zone, and a third type &#x201c;c1&#x201d; to identify a zone group to which the zone may belong. As a related example, identifiers associated with the second bedroom <b>101</b><i>c </i>may indicate that the playback device is the only playback device of the Zone C and not in a zone group. Identifiers associated with the Den may indicate that the Den is not grouped with other zones but includes bonded playback devices <b>110</b><i>h</i>-<b>110</b><i>k</i>. Identifiers associated with the Dining Room may indicate that the Dining Room is part of the Dining+Kitchen zone group <b>108</b><i>b </i>and that devices <b>110</b><i>b </i>and <b>110</b><i>d </i>are grouped (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>L</figref>). Identifiers associated with the Kitchen may indicate the same or similar information by virtue of the Kitchen being part of the Dining+Kitchen zone group <b>108</b><i>b</i>. Other example zone variables and identifiers are described below.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0109">In yet another example, the media playback system <b>100</b> may store variables or identifiers representing other associations of zones and zone groups, such as identifiers associated with Areas, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>. An area may involve a cluster of zone groups and/or zones not within a zone group. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref> shows an Upper Area <b>109</b><i>a </i>including Zones A-D, and a Lower Area <b>109</b><i>b </i>including Zones E-I. In one aspect, an Area may be used to invoke a cluster of zone groups and/or zones that share one or more zones and/or zone groups of another cluster. In another aspect, this differs from a zone group, which does not share a zone with another zone group. Further examples of techniques for implementing Areas may be found, for example, in U.S. application Ser. No. 15/682,506 filed Aug. 21, 2017 and titled &#x201c;Room Association Based on Name,&#x201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 8,483,853 filed Sep. 11, 2007, and titled &#x201c;Controlling and manipulating groupings in a multi-zone media system.&#x201d; Each of these applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the media playback system <b>100</b> may not implement Areas, in which case the system may not store variables associated with Areas.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">III.

For example, if a networked zone comprises two networked devices, each having an illumination device and a playback device, then the networked devices in that group can all be controlled at the same time. For example, the networked devices in the networked zones can play back audio synchronously with each other. User input indicative of a command to control a playback device would control all playback devices within the networked zone, and user input indicative of a command to control an illumination device would control all illumination devices within the networked zone.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0144">In a particular example, the second and third networked devices <b>404</b>, <b>406</b> are grouped together as part of a first networked zone.

The remote <b>414</b> may therefore only control one of the playback devices of the nearby (ungrouped) networked devices, such as the closest playback device.

Some example location determination methods are described below. It will be appreciated that other methods may be used.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0000">a. Location Determination Method 1</p><p id="p-0165" num="0158">In a first example, the remote <b>214</b>, <b>414</b> receives a signal from a computing device (such as a Bluetooth (BLE) beacon or an NFC module) that is located at a particular location within the playback system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C, <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B, and <b>5</b></figref> depict an example computing device <b>224</b> located within the playback system. There may be multiple computing devices located throughout the playback system, each associated with a different location. When brought into proximity of a computing device, the remote receives a signal, and based on the signal determines one or more networked devices that are associated with that computing device and/or location. For example, based on the signal the remote determines one or more &#x201c;nearby&#x201d; networked devices.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0159">In some examples, the signal comprises data indicative of a location/room/area, such as &#x201c;Room #1&#x201d;, &#x201c;Area #1&#x201d; or &#x201c;Living Room&#x201d;. The location data can then be used to retrieve a list of one or more networked devices associated with that location. A database may store an association between networked devices and their locations.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0160">In some examples, the signal comprises data indicative of one or more device identifiers, which may identify the computing device and/or a one or more networked devices associated with the computing device and/or location. For example, the signal may contain an identifier of the computing device, which is then used to retrieve a location and/or one or more networked devices associated with the computing device and/or location. In examples where the signal comprises one or more networked device identifiers, the signal may also comprise one or more state variables associated with the networked devices (including any of the state variables described above). In a particular example, the state variables associated with the networked device identify a room or area in which the networked device is located, and networked zones and/or playback zones and/or illumination zones that the networked device is part of. In other examples, the networked device identifiers are used to obtain state variables associated with the networked device.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0161">As an example, referring to any of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, the remote <b>214</b> receives a signal from a BLE beacon <b>224</b>, and the signal comprises a device identifier identifying the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>. Based on this signal, the remote <b>214</b> determines that it is located within a proximity of the ceiling speaker <b>202</b>. In another example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the remote <b>414</b> receives a signal from a BLE beacon <b>224</b>, and the signal identifies the second and third networked devices <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>. Based on this signal, the remote <b>414</b> determines that it is located within a proximity of the second and third networked devices <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>. In some examples, the signal also comprises one or more of the state variables described above. The state variables can identify the networked zones, playback zones and/or illumination zones associated with the second and third networked devices <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>.

The remote <b>414</b> may then determine that the second networked device <b>404</b> forms part of a networked zone with the third networked device <b>406</b> via other means, such as receipt of state variables from another device within the playback system.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0162">In some examples, the computing device is separate to the networked device, but in other examples the networked device may comprise the computing device. For example, the ceiling speaker <b>202</b> may itself comprise a BLE beacon <b>224</b>.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0000">b. Location Determination Method 2</p><p id="p-0171" num="0163">In a second example, as the remote <b>214</b>, <b>414</b> moves throughout the environment, motion of the remote is detected. The remote may comprise one or more motion detection sensors, such as an accelerometer, gyroscope, and/or altimeter, for example. Based on the detected motion, a location of the remote can be determined or inferred. For example, based on a characteristic of the motion (such as a duration, estimated distance travelled, atmospheric pressure changes and/or type of motion), it may be determined that the remote has moved up a flight of stairs, and so it may be determined that the remote is now located &#x201c;upstairs&#x201d;. Based on this location, it may be determined that the remote is within a proximity of one or more networked devices. For example, a database or one or more state variables may identify one or more networked devices associated with the determined location.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0164">In another example, if an initial location of the remote is known, the motion is known to begin from this initial location. Again, based on a characteristic of the motion, it may be determined that the remote has moved to a final location. In some examples, based on the detected motion, a distance can be determined. Using the initial location and the distance, a final location may be determined, for example using dead-reckoning techniques.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0165">In some examples, a database stores an association between a plurality of &#x201c;motion signatures&#x201d; and one or more locations. For example, a first motion signature may be generated by the motion sensor when the remote is moved between a first location and a second location, and a second motion signature may be generated by the motion sensor when the remote is moved between the second location and a third location. Based on a comparison of a detected motion with the motion signatures in a database, a location of the remote can be determined. For example, the detected motion may correspond to the second motion signature in the database, so it may be determined that the remote is located in the third location. The detected motion may comprise one or more motion signatures. For example, if the remote is moved from the first to the third location, the detected motion may comprise the first motion signature followed by the second motion signature. The first, second and third locations may be predetermined, such as docking station locations.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0166">The database may be initially populated during a calibration procedure. For example, a user may be required to move the remote between several locations (such as between different networked devices and/or rooms) during a setup procedure.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0167">In some examples, the location may be determined using machine learning techniques. Entries in the database may be updated over time based on machine learning algorithms.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0000">c. Location Determination Method 3</p><p id="p-0177" num="0168">In a third example, the location of the remote can be determined based on the strength of signals received from one or more devices (such as one or more networked devices). In one example, a remote may be determined to be within a proximity of a first networked device by receiving from the first networked device a signal having a signal strength and determining that the signal strength is above a threshold. If the signal strength above the threshold, it may be assumed that the remote is near to the first networked device, thus the location of the remote can be determined. In some examples, the signal is a radio signal, such as a WiFi, Bluetooth or ZigBee signal, and the threshold can be based on signal strength and/or quality measure such as RSSI or BER. In other examples, the signal is an acoustic signal emitted by a playback device. The signal strength of an acoustic signal can therefore be the acoustic intensity of the acoustic signal. In certain examples, the acoustic signal is near ultrasonic (e.g., in the frequency range of 19 kHz to 20 kHz) or ultrasonic (e.g., greater than about 20 kHz).</p><p id="p-0178" num="0169">In another example, a remote may be determined to be within a proximity of a first networked device by receiving from the first networked device a first signal having a first signal strength and receiving from a second networked device a second signal having a second signal strength. When the first signal strength is stronger/greater than the second signal strength, it can then be determined that the remote is closer to the first networked device than the second networked device. Thus, based on the first and second signal strengths, the location of the remote can be determined. In some examples, the first and second signals are radio signals, such as WiFi, Bluetooth or ZigBee signals. In other examples, the first and second signals are acoustic signals emitted by the playback devices of the networked devices.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0170">The signal received from the networked device comprises data or a characteristic associated with a particular networked device and/or a location. For example, an electromagnetic signal (such as a radio signal) may comprise data indicative of the networked device from which it was transmitted and/or a location. Certain techniques also allow data to be carried by acoustic signal. Accordingly, an acoustic signal may also comprise data indicative of a networked device and/or a location. Alternatively, an acoustic signal may comprise a particular acoustic characteristic associated with the networked device and/or location. For example, different devices may transmit acoustic signals using different frequencies, which are used to identify the networked device and/or location. The remote may comprise a microphone to detect the acoustic signals.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0171">As an example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the remote <b>414</b> receives two signals; a first signal from the second networked device <b>404</b> and a second signal from the third networked device <b>406</b>. Each signal comprises data associated with the playback device from which it was transmitted. Upon receipt of both signals, the remote <b>414</b> determines that the first signal has a signal strength that is stronger than the signal strength of the second signal. Accordingly, the remote <b>414</b> determines that it is located closer to the second networked device <b>404</b> than the third networked device <b>406</b>. The remote <b>414</b> is therefore located in location 2, for example. Other examples for determining the location of a device are described in U.S. Patent Publication 2021/009829 published Apr. 1, 2021, and titled &#x201c;SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DEVICE LOCALIZATION,&#x201d; which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0000">d. Location Determination Method 4</p><p id="p-0182" num="0172">In a fourth example, the location of the remote can be determined based on data encoded within an acoustic signal. In an example, the remote comprises a microphone to detect acoustic signals. A networked device may transmit data within an acoustic signal, such as a near ultrasonic or an ultrasonic signal, which is then received by the microphone of the remote. The acoustic signal may comprise data indicative of a location/room/area (which can be used to retrieve a list of one or more networked devices associated with that location) and/or data indicative of one or more device identifiers associated with one or more networked devices. Accordingly, based on the signal, and in particular the data transmitted by the signal, it can be determined that the remote is within a proximity of one or more networked devices. Acoustic signals may be transmitted periodically by some or all of the networked devices within a playback system so that the remote's location can be updated as it moves throughout the playback environment. Acoustic signals emitted from devices that are further away from the remote, or are located within other rooms, may not be detected by the microphone of the remote. Examples for determining that the remote is within proximity of one or more networked devices and/or a nearest network device to the remote are described in U.S. Patent Publication 2020/0401365 published Dec. 24, 2020, and titled &#x201c;Ultrasonic Transmission for Presence Detection,&#x201d; which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0000">e. Location Determination Method 5</p><p id="p-0184" num="0173">In a fifth example, the location of the remote can be determined based on data received from a docking station into which a remote may be placed by a user. A docking station may hold or store the remote when not in use, and in some examples allows a battery of the remote to be recharged. Typically, a docking station remains in a particular location for an extended period of time, and so may be associated with that location. A user may configure the docking station to be associated with a location during a setup procedure, for example. When coupled to the docking station, via one or more wired or wireless interfaces, it can be determined that the remote is located in the docking station and so is associated with that location. Accordingly, it may be detected that the remote is associated with (i.e. docked in) a docking station. While docked, the remote can receive data from the docking station (such as an identifier of the docking station, one or more networked device identifiers, or a location identifier, for example). Based on the received data, it may be determined that the control device is within a proximity of a particular networked device.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0174">In a particular example, at a first instance, the remote is initially configured to control a first networked device. After this, a user places the remote in a docking station, and the remote receives data from the docking station associated with (or identifying) a second networked device. Accordingly, it may be assumed that the remote is now within a proximity of the second networked device, and in response, the remote is configured to control the second networked device instead of the first networked device.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Grouping Devices</heading><p id="p-0186" num="0175">In some examples, the remote can be used to group together one or more networked devices by moving the remote throughout the playback environment to group particular devices. In an example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, if a user wants to group together the first, second, third and fourth networked devices <b>402</b>-<b>408</b> (to form a first networked zone, for example), the user can provide a first input to the remote <b>414</b> (such as pressing and holding a particular button) while moving the remote <b>414</b> from location 1 to location 4, via locations 2 and 3. As the remote <b>414</b> is moved, it is detected that the remote is moved within a proximity of each of the four networked devices. When a second input to the remote is detected (such as the user releases the button), the detected networked devices are grouped together.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0176">In another example, a user wishing to group together the second and third networked devices <b>404</b>, <b>406</b> can provide a first input to the remote <b>414</b> (such as a double or triple tap of a particular button on the remote <b>414</b>) to indicate the start of a grouping procedure, move the remote <b>414</b> from location 2 to location 3, and can provide a second input to the remote <b>4141</b> (such as a double or triple tap of a particular button on the remote <b>414</b>) to indicate an end of the grouping procedure. As the remote <b>414</b> is moved between locations, it is detected that the remote is within a proximity of both networked devices. At the end of the grouping procedure, the two networked devices are grouped together.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0177">In yet another example, a user can save a scene, settings, or preferences that specify actions to take, or a response based on events or context. For example, a user can select a setting to control all networked devices within proximity or in the same room as the remote <b>414</b> as grouped devices even though the networked devices may not have been grouped. In this instance, the networked devices may be temporarily grouped when the remote <b>414</b> is within proximity.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0178">Accordingly, a method of grouping together one or more networked devices using a remote comprises: detecting that the first networked device is within a proximity of the remote and receiving input data indicative of a command to start a grouping procedure to group the first networked device with at least one other networked device. In response to (or after) the input data, a grouping procedure is initiated, and during the grouping procedure, it is detected that a second networked device is within a proximity of the remote (as the remote is moved to a different location). The method further comprises receiving input data indicative of a command to end the grouping procedure, and after receiving the input data, the method comprises causing the first and second networked devices to form a group. For example, the remote (or another device) transmits a command to one or both of the first networked devices to join a particular zone, such as a first networked zone.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0179">In an example, detecting the input data indicative of a command to start the grouping procedure may comprise detecting that a button of the remote is being pressed and held down. Detecting the input data indicative of a command to end the grouping procedure may comprise detecting that the button of the remote is released. The button may be held down for a duration of time, during which time the remote is moved between a plurality of networked devices.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0180">In some examples, before the grouping procedure starts, a first networked device is playing back media content and a second networked device is not playing back media content. In response to (or after) grouping the first and second networked devices, the method may further comprise causing the second networked device to play back media content in synchrony with the first networked device. Thus, once grouped, both grouped devices play back media content in synchrony as members of the group.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">Remote Interface</heading><p id="p-0192" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref> depict a remote <b>214</b> useable in any or all of the examples described above. In this particular example, the remote <b>214</b> comprises a plurality of input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>(e.g., one or more buttons, knobs, dials, touch-sensitive surfaces, displays, touchscreens). A user can operate an input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>to control various functions of a networked device. For example, if a user operates input interface <b>602</b><i>c</i>, input data is generated (and therefore received by the remote <b>214</b>) and in response, one or more commands are transmitted by the remote to a particular networked device currently being controlled. Upon receipt of the command, a playback device of the networked device may begin playing back a media item or an illumination device of the networked device may turn on, for example.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0182">In this example, the remote <b>214</b> is configurable in at least two modes, such as a first mode and a second mode. When operating in a particular mode, commands associated with the input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>are configured to control a particular device of a networked device. In an example, when operating in a first mode (also known as a light mode), the remote is configured to control an illumination device of at least one networked device. Thus, when an input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>is operated, a command to control an illumination device is generated. Similarly, when operating in a second mode (also known as an audio mode, a sound mode or a music mode), the remote is configured to control a playback device of at least one networked device. Thus, when an input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>is operated, a command to control a playback device is generated.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0183">In some examples, the remote <b>214</b> is configurable in three modes (such as the first mode, the second mode and a third mode). The first and second modes are the same as described above, but when operating in the third mode (also known as a hybrid mode), the remote is configured to control an illumination device and a playback device of at least one networked device. For example, some input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>may control the illumination device and other input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>may control the playback device. Additionally, or alternatively, some or all input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>have dual functionality and control either the playback device or illumination device depending upon the type of input to the input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g</i>. For example, if a user presses a particular input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>it may control the illumination device, and if a user double taps the same input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>it may control the playback device. Thus, depending upon the type of input to the input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>(e.g. a single or double tap), different input data and commands are generated and transmitted by the remote.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0184"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> depicts the remote <b>214</b> operating in the light mode (i.e. the first mode). At this moment, the remote <b>214</b> is in proximity to a first networked device and is thus configured to control the first networked device. The first networked device in this example comprises an illumination device and a playback device. When configured to control the first networked device, commands generated by the remote <b>214</b> (in response to (or after) receipt of input data as the input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>are operated), are addressed/transmitted to the first networked device. In some examples, the remote <b>214</b> is configured to control the first networked device and a second networked device as part of a networked zone. Thus, commands generated by the remote <b>214</b> (in response to (or after) receipt of input data as the input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>are operated), are addressed/transmitted to the first and second networked devices.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0185">While controlling the first networked device and while operating in the light mode, a user may operate a particular input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g</i>, which causes input data to be generated (and therefore received by the remote <b>214</b>). Depending upon which input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<b>602</b><i>g </i>is operated, the input data is indicative of a command to control a particular aspect of the illumination device, such as light on/off, brightness up/down, or change light colour. In response to (or after) receiving the input data, the remote <b>214</b> controls the illumination device by transmitting a command to the first networked device, which is then executed/acted upon by the illumination device.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0186">Similarly, while controlling the first networked device and while operating in the sound mode, a user may operate a particular input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g</i>, which causes input data to be generated (and therefore received by the remote <b>214</b>). Depending upon which input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<b>602</b><i>g </i>is operated, the input data is indicative of a command to control a particular aspect of the playback device, such as pause, play, volume up/down, or skip forward/back. Accordingly, at least some of the input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>correspond to transport controls while the remote is operating in the sound mode. In response to (or after) receiving the input data, the remote <b>214</b> controls the playback device by transmitting a command to the first networked device, which is then executed/acted upon by the playback device.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0187">In some examples, the remote <b>214</b> comprises a motion sensor to detect certain motions or gestures. These gestures may control certain functions of a networked device. For example, a gesture such as turning over the remote <b>214</b> may generate input data indicative of a command to control a particular aspect of the playback device or the illumination device.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0188">In some examples, the command to control the illumination device or playback device (that is transmitted to the first networked device) explicitly indicates that the command is to control the illumination device or playback device (depending upon which mode the remote <b>214</b> is currently operating in). For example, the command may indicate &#x201c;volume up&#x201d;, or &#x201c;button <b>602</b><i>d</i>, sound mode&#x201d;, both of which would indicate that the command is for the playback device. In other examples however, the command to control the illumination device or playback device does not indicate that the command is to control the illumination device or playback device. Instead, the command may indicate which input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g </i>has been pressed, such as &#x201c;button <b>602</b><i>d</i>&#x201d;. To execute the command as intended, the first networked device would therefore need to know which mode the remote <b>214</b> is currently operating in. This information may therefore have been transmitted to the first networked device prior to receipt of the command, and the first networked device retrieves this information from memory before executing the intended command. For example, if the command indicates that button <b>602</b><i>d </i>has been pressed, it may execute a volume up command if the remote <b>214</b> is determined to be operating in the sound mode or may execute a brightness up command if the remote <b>214</b> is determined to be operating in the light mode. Thus, in some examples, the remote <b>214</b> may transmit to one or more devices, such as one or more networked devices, data indicating the mode in which it is currently operating. The mode may be stored in one or more state variables which are shared amongst devices in the playback system. The remote <b>214</b> may transmit this information when the remote <b>214</b> changes between different modes, for example.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0189">To change between modes, a user may operate at least one input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<i>g</i>. For example, to cause the remote <b>214</b> to operate in the light mode the user operates input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>, and to cause the remote <b>214</b> to operate in the sound mode the user operates input interface <b>602</b><i>b</i>. To cause the remote <b>214</b> to operate in the hybrid mode, the user may operate both input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a </i>and <b>602</b><i>b </i>at the same time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows the remote <b>214</b> operating in the light mode, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows the remote <b>214</b> operating in the sound mode, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> shows the remote <b>214</b> operating in the hybrid mode. In some examples, there is a single input interface that causes the remote to cycle from one mode to another or switch between modes.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0190">Accordingly, while operating in the sound mode (or hybrid mode), a user may operate input interface <b>602</b><i>a</i>, which causes input data to be generated (and therefore received by the remote <b>214</b>). The input data is indicative of a command to operate the remote <b>214</b> in the light mode, and in response, the remote <b>214</b> begins to operate in the light mode. As mentioned above, operating in the light mode may comprise transmitting data indicating that the remote is operating in the light mode, to at least a first networked device. In some examples, operating in the light mode comprises the remote <b>214</b> associating input data with the light mode.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0191">Similarly, while operating in the light mode (or hybrid mode), a user may operate input interface <b>602</b><i>b</i>, which causes input data to be generated (and therefore received by the remote <b>214</b>). The input data is indicative of a command to operate the remote <b>214</b> in the sound mode, and in response, the remote <b>214</b> begins to operate in the sound mode. As mentioned above, operating in the sound mode may comprise transmitting data indicating that the remote is operating in the sound mode, to at least a first networked device. In some examples, operating in the sound mode comprises the remote <b>214</b> associating input data with the sound mode.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0192">Similarly, while operating in the light mode or sound mode, a user may operate input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a </i>and <b>602</b><i>b </i>at the same time, which causes input data to be generated (and therefore received by the remote <b>214</b>). The input data is indicative of a command to operate the remote <b>214</b> in the light and sound mode simultaneously (i.e. operate the remote <b>214</b> in the hybrid mode), and in response, the remote <b>214</b> begins to operate in the hybrid mode. As mentioned above, operating in the hybrid mode may comprise transmitting data indicating that the remote is operating in the hybrid mode, to at least the first networked device. Operating in the hybrid mode may comprise associating input data with the hybrid mode and/or one of the light and sound modes.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0193">As an example implementation, the remote <b>214</b> is initially operating in the light mode and is controlling a first networked device (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). A user first turns on the illumination device (thereby causing a light to turn on) by pressing input interface <b>602</b><i>c</i>. The user then decreases the brightness of the illumination device by pressing input interface <b>602</b><i>g</i>, and changes the colour of the light from white to red to blue by pressing input interface <b>602</b><i>d </i>twice. The user then switches to the sound mode by pressing input interface <b>602</b><i>b </i>(as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>), and causes the playback device to start playing back media by pressing input interface <b>602</b><i>c</i>. The user then skips backward in the playback queue by pressing input interface <b>602</b><i>g</i>, and increases the volume by pressing input interface <b>602</b><i>d </i>several times. Accordingly, the same input interfaces (operated at different times) can control different aspects of the first networked device based on the mode in which the remote <b>214</b> is operating. In some examples, skipping forward or back using the remote causes a cross-fade of music.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0194">The user may also operate the remote in a hybrid mode by pressing input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a </i>and <b>602</b><i>b </i>at the same time (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>). In this example, in the hybrid mode, input interfaces <b>602</b><i>c</i>-<i>g </i>have dual functionality and control either the playback device or illumination device depending upon the type of input to the input interface <b>602</b><i>c</i>-<i>g</i>. For example, at a later time the user decides to pause playback, so presses input interface <b>602</b><i>c</i>. The user also decides to turn off the illumination device, so double presses input interface <b>602</b><i>c</i>. Accordingly, the same input interfaces can control different devices of the first networked device based on the type of input to the input interface.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0195">In some examples, the remote <b>214</b> may be configured to operate in a particular mode by default. For example, when the remote <b>214</b> is turned on, it may default operation to the first or second mode. The remote <b>214</b> may be configured to operate in a particular mode at different times of the day. For example, the remote may default to operating in the sound mode during the daytime (when lights are less likely to be required) and default to operating in the light mode or hybrid mode during the nighttime (when lights are more likely to be required). Daytime and nighttime may be set according to certain time ranges, such as daytime=7 am-6 pm, nighttime=6 pm-7 am. Daytime/nighttime may be automatically determined via reference to sunrise and sunset timetables, or by use of a light sensor in the remote <b>214</b> or in another device. For example, if the light sensor indicates that it is dark, the remote may default to operating in the light mode.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0196">In some examples, the remote <b>214</b> includes input interfaces <b>602</b> for scenes. The selection of the scene input interface <b>602</b> can send a command to a networked device to activate a scene. A scene may be a saved playback setting or content setting and/or a saved lighting setting. One example scene includes an &#x201c;all off&#x201d; setting which stops all music playback and turns off all lighting. Another example scene can be a &#x201c;relax&#x201d; setting which dims the light to, for example, 50%, lowers the volume to 10%, and changes the content being played back to a particular genre (e.g., jazz). Other examples are possible.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">Indicator Assembly</heading><p id="p-0208" num="0197">In some arrangements, the remote <b>214</b> comprises an indicator assembly to generate at least one of an audio indication or a visual indication to indicate various events. For example, the indicator assembly can generate an indication to indicate at least one of: (i) that the remote is operating in the first mode, second mode or third mode, (ii) that the remote is within a proximity of a particular networked device, (iii) that the remote is no longer within a proximity of a particular networked device, (iv) that the remote is controlling a particular networked device, or (v) that the remote is not controlling any networked device.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0198">The indicator assembly may comprise one or more indicators, such as one or more visual indicators (such as LEDs or other light emitting devices) and/or one or more audio indicators (such as an acoustic transducer).</p><p id="p-0210" num="0199"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref> depict a first visual indicator <b>604</b><i>a </i>and a second visual indicator <b>604</b><i>b</i>. In this particular example, the visual indicators <b>604</b><i>a</i>, <b>604</b><i>b </i>both comprise an LED located below the input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a </i>and <b>602</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Light emitted by the LED is visible through a transparent or translucent surface of the input interfaces <b>602</b><i>a</i>, <b>602</b><i>b</i>. The first visual indicator <b>604</b><i>a </i>is configured to generate a visual indication to indicate that the remote is operating in the light mode. The second visual indicator <b>604</b><i>b </i>is configured to generate a visual indication to indicate that the remote is operating in the sound mode. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the first visual indicator <b>604</b><i>a </i>is generating a visual indication by outputting light, and the second visual indicator <b>604</b><i>b </i>is not generating a visual indication. In this example, the indication is in the shape of a sun or star, to more clearly identify its relationship with the light mode. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the second visual indicator <b>604</b><i>b </i>is generating a visual indication by outputting light, and the first visual indicator <b>604</b><i>a </i>is not generating a visual indication. In this example, the indication is in the shape of a musical note, to more clearly identify its relationship with the sound mode.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0200">Accordingly, in examples where the indicator assembly is configured to generate an indication to indicate that the remote <b>214</b> is operating in a particular mode, operating the remote <b>214</b> in the particular mode further comprises generating the indication. In some examples, the indication is generated throughout the entire period the remote <b>214</b> is operating in the particular mode, as in the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref>, but in other examples, the indication is generated for a portion of less than all the period the remote <b>214</b> is operating in the particular mode. For example, the indication may be generated when the remote <b>214</b> first begins to operate in the particular mode.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0201">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, the remote <b>214</b> is operating in the third, hybrid mode. In this particular example, to indicate that the remote <b>214</b> is operating in the first and second modes simultaneously (i.e. the hybrid mode), the indicator assembly generates an indication that the remote <b>214</b> is operating in the first and second modes simultaneously by having the first visual indicator <b>604</b><i>a </i>and the second visual indicator <b>604</b><i>b </i>generate simultaneous indications. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> depicts both visual indicators <b>604</b><i>a</i>, <b>606</b><i>b </i>outputting light.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0202">In some examples, the remote <b>214</b> comprises a light sensor configured to detect an intensity of light, such as artificial light or sunlight. The remote <b>214</b> may be configured to control the indicator assembly, such as a brightness of LEDs, based on the detected intensity. Thus, in some examples, the brightness of the first and second visual indicators <b>604</b><i>a</i>, <b>604</b><i>b </i>may be varied according to the detected intensity.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0203">As mentioned, the indicator assembly of the remote <b>214</b> can additionally or alternatively generate indications to indicate: (i) that the remote is within a proximity of a particular networked device, (ii) that the remote is no longer within a proximity of a particular networked device, (iii) that the remote is controlling a particular networked device, or (iv) that the remote is not controlling any networked device.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0204">As an example, and by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, as the remote <b>414</b> moves from location 1 to location 2, it may be detected that the second networked device <b>404</b> is within a proximity of the remote <b>414</b>. In response, the indicator assembly may output an indication to indicate that the presence of a new networked device has been detected. In some examples, the second networked device <b>404</b> also comprises an indicator assembly that generates a corresponding indication. For example, a visual indicator (such as an LED) on the second networked device <b>404</b> and remote <b>414</b> both flash to indicate that the remote <b>414</b> is in proximity to the second networked device <b>404</b>, and is now controlling the second networked device <b>404</b>. In some examples, the second networked device <b>404</b> outputs an audio indication to indicate that it is being controlled by the remote <b>414</b>.
