The basin has a base wall and lateral walls adjoining the base wall. The basin has a receiving area delimited by the walls. Moreover, the sink has an insert plate which is separate from the basin and which is inserted into the receiving area.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such sinks are known. Thus a sink which has a basin is disclosed, for example, in US 2005/0067747 A1. A base which is configured in one piece with the basin bottom and which extends upwardly is configured on the basin bottom. A plate may be attached to this base. As a result, a cutting board is formed on which objects, such as food, may be chopped. Such an embodiment is disadvantageous in that the integrated base is always present and thus a basic embodiment of the basin is complex in terms of shape and is configured such that the receiving area is restricted over the periphery. Moreover, it is always the case that the plate which is able to be positioned on the base is arranged only at one height level. The plate is only able to be positioned or removed by a user.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A sink is also disclosed in DE 362 1151 A1. Various inserts which may be inserted into the receiving area are provided separately from the basin. The inserts may be plates or further basin-like containers. These inserts may be positioned on the upper edge of the basin. The usability of a sink is also significantly restricted thereby and the inserts have to be attached or removed by a user, and it is always the case that the inserts are able to be positioned only at one individual position.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is the object of the present invention to provide a sink with a basin and a separate insert plate, in which a lifting device for the insert plate is able to be protected from media in the basin of the sink.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This object is achieved by a sink as claimed in claim <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the invention relates to a sink with a basin. The basin has a base wall and lateral walls adjoining the base wall. The basin also has a receiving area delimited by the base wall and the lateral walls. The receiving area is open at the top. The sink has an insert unit, in particular an insert plate, in particular a contiguous and non-perforated insert plate, which is separate from the basin. This insert plate is able to be inserted into the receiving area or is inserted therein. The sink also has a lifting device, by means of which the insert plate can be moved relative to the basin in the vertical direction of the sink. This is made possible by a physical lifting device of the sink. Thus a sink is provided in which in principle the possibility is provided to arrange the insert unit at different vertical positions. This is also made possible by a lifting device and does not have to be carried out manually by the user himself. In principle, it is possible that a continuous vertical adjustment of the insert plate is made possible by the lifting device. Thus it is possible to approach and set many different height levels of the insert plate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The lifting device has at least one lifting unit. Moreover, the sink has an elastic sealing sleeve which is separate from the lifting unit and surrounds the lifting unit. The sealing sleeve is deformable in all spatial directions. It is configured as a sheath having a flexible shape. By means of a sealing sleeve, a specific sub-element of the lifting device, namely the actual lifting unit, is protected by this sealing sleeve. Since this sealing sleeve extends, in particular, at least in some regions into the receiving area of the basin, a seal is particularly advantageous in this regard. Due to this sealing sleeve entirely surrounding the lifting unit over the periphery at least in the receiving area of the basin, it is possible to avoid the situation where media located in the basin pass directly into the lifting unit. As a result, the lifting unit is permanently protected from such negative effects. Thus the functionality thereof may be permanently maintained.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an advantageous embodiment it is provided that the sealing sleeve of the lifting device at least entirely surrounds the lifting unit over the periphery, at least over the partial region which extends into the receiving area. This is provided, in particular, in all of the different positions of the lifting unit when viewed in the vertical direction. Thus even with a corresponding change in the height of the lifting unit, and thus in the retracted or extended state, full protection may always be ensured by the sealing sleeve in an unrestricted manner.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In particular, it is provided that the sealing sleeve is configured to be longitudinally adjustable, when viewed in the vertical direction of the sink. This is a very advantageous embodiment. As a result, an adaptation to the length may be carried out corresponding to the change in the length of the lifting unit when the lifting unit is moved upwardly or moved downwardly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an exemplary embodiment it is provided that the sealing sleeve is of hollow-cylindrical configuration. In particular, the sealing sleeve is configured without edges and corners in the peripheral direction, when viewed around the vertical direction and thus around the longitudinal axis of the lifting unit. As a result, wear and tear may be kept low. Thus with continuous folding and unfolding of the sealing sleeve, it is possible to avoid undesired kinks which could otherwise arise in this regard in the peripheral direction around this longitudinal axis, which is oriented in the vertical direction. When viewed in the vertical direction the sealing sleeve has folds. In particular, it is provided that this hollow-cylindrical shape is also advantageous when the lifting unit also has a corresponding geometry. In particular, this may relate to a housing of the lifting unit. This housing may be configured from a plurality of dimensionally rigid hollow cylinders which are guided into one another in the vertical direction and which may be moved relative to one another in this vertical direction. Thus the housing is preferably configured as a telescopic housing consisting of a plurality of hollow cylinders. The lifting apparatus of the lifting unit may be arranged in this specific housing of the lifting unit. The housing segments of the housing of the lifting unit, which are mentioned by way of example, may be respectively dimensionally stable or dimensionally rigid in each case.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The lifting apparatus may be, for example, a feed chain or a spindle drive.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular, if this housing of the lifting unit is of cylindrical configuration, this lifting unit is also preferably advantageously surrounded by a corresponding geometric embodiment of the sealing sleeve. In particular, a space-saving embodiment is made possible thereby.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, it is provided that the sealing sleeve is configured at least in some regions as a folding bellows. This is an advantageous embodiment since in this regard at least a corresponding vertical elasticity is present, which permits a particularly advantageous compression and pulling apart in the vertical direction of the sink. On the other hand, a particularly advantageous and predetermined folding behavior is also formed by the embodiment of a folding bellows. As a result, it is possible to move together and pull apart the sealing sleeve in a very uniform manner. Preferably, it is provided that the sealing sleeve is arranged spaced apart from an outer face of the lifting unit, when viewed in the direction perpendicular to the vertical direction of the sink. In particular, in this context the sealing sleeve is arranged spaced apart from an outer face of the housing of the lifting unit. With such a free space or volume space between this lifting unit and the sealing sleeve, these two components may be moved independently of one another. Thus these two components do not bear directly against one another and thus are not able to impede one another in an undesired manner when the height is changed. In particular, rubbing against one another or jamming against one another is avoided thereby.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, it is provided that the sealing sleeve is clamped with a lower edge between the base wall of the basin and an adapter of the sink. The adapter is, in particular, a separate component from the sealing sleeve and a separate component from the base wall. A mechanically particularly stable and positionally fixed arrangement of the upper edge of the sealing sleeve may be achieved by such an adapter. An undesired release of the sealing sleeve in this upper region may be avoided by the clamping, when the sealing sleeve is pulled apart when the lifting unit is moved upwardly and is compressed when the lifting unit is moved downwardly. The adapter is, in particular, an adapter ring. It may be provided that the adapter ring is connected to the base wall by a non-destructive and releasable connection. For example, screw connections may be provided here. As a result, the lower edge of the sealing sleeve may also be clamped in a very appropriate manner.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an advantageous embodiment it is provided that a seal is also formed at the same time by the lower edge of the sealing sleeve. Thus a feedthrough in the base wall of the basin, through which the lifting unit extends, is sealed by this seal. As a result, at least one partial region of the sealing sleeve is used in a multi-functional manner. Thus not only is the actual seal formed relative to the receiving area in the peripheral surroundings of the lifting unit, but a seal is also created by this feedthrough in the base wall. In particular, it may be achieved thereby that the lower edge is tightly pressed directly against the inner face of the base wall. This is achieved, in particular, by a corresponding mechanical connection between the adapter and the base wall. It may also be provided that this lower edge of the sealing sleeve has a thickened portion. An integrated sealing ring may be configured, as it were, in the sealing sleeve by such a thickened portion. For example, a corresponding channel or groove may thus be configured in the base wall and/or the adapter, this thickened portion, which may also be denoted as a bead, being able to be incorporated therein and a corresponding sealing behavior for the feedthrough is thus achieved in this regard.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an advantageous embodiment it is provided that the sealing sleeve is clamped with an upper edge between a plate receiver and an upper face of an upper lifting segment of the lifting unit. In particular, the plate receiver is a separate component. In particular, this component is positioned from above onto the upper lifting segment. The plate receiver is preferably provided to receive support vanes. The insert plate is directly positioned on these support vanes. A mechanically stable fastening may also be achieved by this arrangement of the upper edge of the sealing sleeve. A positionally fixed seat of the sealing sleeve is achieved thereby. This is also advantageous regarding the dynamic movement of the sealing sleeve when folded up and pulled apart. It may also be provided that this upper edge is also clamped here so as to form a seal between the plate receiver and the upper face of the upper lifting segment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an advantageous embodiment it is provided that, in the pulled-apart state in the vertical direction, the sealing sleeve is tapered, when viewed from top to bottom.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In particular, it is provided that in the fully pulled-apart state the sealing sleeve is smooth on the outer face. In particular, when the sealing sleeve has folds in some regions in this vertical direction, these folds are pulled apart in this maximum possible lifting position or extended position of the lifting unit. Thus a particularly advantageous cleaning of the outer face of the sealing sleeve may be permitted in the removed state of the insert plate and in the fully upwardly moved state of the lifting unit.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition to its relevant protective function, the sealing sleeve is also configured as a protection against inadvertent contact. Contact with the lifting unit by the user is also avoided thereby.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In particular, as an alternative to a one-piece folding bellows, the sealing sleeve may also be configured from a plurality of sleeve segments. For example, a telescopic sleeve may be configured in this case. Thus a plurality of sealing sleeve segments are guided in one another and may be moved relative to one another in the vertical direction. Other types of extension elements which are elastic in the vertical direction may also be provided.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, it is provided that the sealing sleeve is configured in one piece. For example, the sealing sleeve may be configured from an elastomer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, it is provided that at least the lifting unit has at least one ventilation opening. Air which is in a volume space between the sealing sleeve and the lifting unit may be conducted through the ventilation opening into the interior of the lifting unit. In particular, this may take place when the insert plate is moved downwardly in the receiving area and the volume space between the sealing sleeve and the lifting unit is thereby reduced. Specifically in such movement scenarios, it is necessary to remove the air from this volume space so as not to hinder a downward movement of the insert plate. This is also against the background of not generating a large undesired air pressure build-up in this volume space and thereby impeding the downward movement of the insert plate.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">By removing the air into the interior of the lifting unit, it is possible to discharge the air out of the volume space in a very advantageous manner. On the one hand, therefore, the air may be conducted thereby below the basin of the sink. This is because the lifting unit advantageously extends through a feedthrough in the base wall. In particular, therefore, this air may be conducted out of this specific volume space downwardly out of the sink. In this case the discharge is not disruptive, so that an undesired airflow would not flow toward a user looking into the basin from above. Moreover, by discharging the air in such a manner it is advantageously also achieved that the sealing sleeve itself requires no such ventilation opening. Thus it is also possible to avoid the situation where media in the receiving area of the basin could pass into this volume space through such an opening in the sealing sleeve. In particular, therefore, the sealing sleeve may be configured entirely without holes.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A plurality of ventilation openings may also be provided. In particular, it is provided that the at least one ventilation opening is able to be closed by a closure element. Thus the design may be even further improved, since even if media were to be able to penetrate undesirably into the volume space, for example, the media would not pass via the ventilation opening into the interior of the lifting unit. Preferably, the volume space is configured between the sealing sleeve and a housing of the lifting unit. In this regard, a lifting apparatus of the lifting unit is in turn arranged in the interior of the housing of the lifting unit. Thus preferably this lifting apparatus is protected by a double sleeve, as it were. On the one hand, this is the housing of the lifting unit which is provided with sealing elements and, on the other hand, this is the sealing sleeve which is separate therefrom and which additionally surrounds this housing of the lifting unit over the periphery.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In particular, the ventilation opening is configured in the housing of the lifting unit. The air is thus discharged through the interior of the housing of the lifting unit in which the lifting apparatus is arranged. This closure element for closing the ventilation opening may be, for example, a flap or a slide. It is also possible that the ventilation opening is closed by a diaphragm. This diaphragm may be permeable to gaseous media and impermeable to liquid and solid media.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one advantageous embodiment it is provided that the sink has at least one detector. A medium in the volume space between the sealing sleeve and the lifting unit may be detected by this detector. In particular, liquid media such as water may be detected by this detector. Leakages in the sealing sleeve may also be rapidly identified by means of such a detection and corresponding measures may be taken immediately.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In particular, it is provided that the closure element for closing the at least one ventilation opening is closed when the insert plate has reached the fully lowered state or the fully downwardly moved position. If the insert plate is moved upwardly again by the lifting unit, the closure element and also the ventilation opening are opened. As a result, air may pass through the interior of the lifting unit into the volume space between the sealing sleeve and the lifting unit. As a result, it is possible to avoid the situation where an undesired negative pressure is produced in this volume space which would hinder the upwardly moving lifting unit.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In particular, a plate receiver for the insert plate is configured on the upper region of the upper lifting segment. For example, this plate receiver may be implemented as an injection-molded component, in particular as a <b>2</b>K injection-molded component. It may be provided that at least one through-hole is located in this plate receiver. An actuating element may extend through this through-hole from below. A support vane positioned on the plate receiver may be lifted thereby. In particular, a pivoting about a horizontal pivot axis may be carried out by this lifting so that a support vane may be positioned obliquely and thus in a tilted manner. Preferably, such a hole or a feedthrough in the plate receiver is covered in the upper region by an elastic component. As a result, it is possible to avoid the situation where media could pass from above into this hole in the plate receiver. Since this cover is configured in an elastic manner, the actuating element may act on this elastic element and bulge it upwardly. Thus a corresponding actuating force may also be transmitted to the support vane and this may be tilted.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an advantageous embodiment it is provided that an upper face of the insert plate has a surface which is at least 80 percent, in particular at least 90 percent, in particular at least 95 percent, of the surface of the receiving area in a horizontal plane. The surface of the upper face of the insert plate, however, is less than 99 percent of this surface of the receiving area. By such a dimensioning, the insert plate is configured over virtually the entire surface area relative to the clear width of the receiving area between the lateral walls, and thus fills up this receiving area virtually entirely when viewed in the horizontal plane. On the other hand, however, a small gap, in particular of between 3 mm and 15 mm, in particular of between 3 mm and 10 mm, is permitted over the periphery so that, on the one hand, the relative movement of the insert plate may be carried out unhindered when setting the position or changing the position. In particular, as a result, this avoids direct contact and a side edge of the insert plate potentially scraping along the inner faces of the lateral walls. Thus, on the one hand, damage to the lateral walls is avoided and, on the other hand, damage to the insert plate and also to the lifting device is avoided. Last but not least, it is also advantageously achieved by this embodiment that liquid which is present on the upper face of the insert plate may be drained in a simple manner into the receiving area through this gap between the edge of the insert plate and the inner faces of the lateral walls.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, the basin has a drain, in particular on the base wall. As a result, a medium which is arranged in the basin and collects therein may drain out easily via the drain.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In particular, the basin is configured in one piece with the base wall and the lateral walls. In particular, the basin is configured from metal.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The base wall may be flat or slightly inclined or slightly bulged. In particular, it is provided that the point of the base wall at which an outlet for a drain of the sink is configured is offset furthest toward the bottom relative to the vertical position.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It may be provided that the upper face of the plate is configured to be entirely flat. However, the upper face may also be slightly bulged. It is also possible that the upper face of the insert plate is structured at least in some regions. As a result, a certain roughness may be generated. As a result, it is possible to avoid in an improved manner undesired slippage of objects positioned thereon. For example, this is advantageous when a change in the position of the insert plate occurs and objects are still arranged on the upper face of the insert plate. It is also possible that the upper face has specific positioning regions. These may be recesses. However, such recesses may be configured to be relatively small, for example. This is advantageous in order to be able to position, for example, vessels such as a glass or the like more securely. In particular, this is advantageous when a change in the position is tilting and/or rotating. An undesired slippage of such vessels is thus avoided. Moreover, it is also achieved by such predetermined positioning regions, for example, that when vessels are positioned on the upper face of the insert plate and, for example, are designed to be filled via the faucet, the water running out of the faucet flows accurately into the vessels with a rotational movement and does not run over the circumference of the vessels onto the insert plate.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The lifting device may have a lifting unit and a motor. The lifting unit may be moved by the motor at least in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The positions and orientations provided when the sink is used as intended and arranged as intended are specified by the terms &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d;, &#x201c;front&#x201d; &#x201c;rear&#x201d; &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d;, &#x201c;vertical&#x201d;, &#x201c;depth direction&#x201d;, &#x201c;width direction&#x201d;, &#x201c;vertical direction&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further features of the invention emerge from the claims, the figures and the description of the figures.

The lifting unit <b>28</b> may be moved in the direction of the axis A. In this context, the lifting unit <b>28</b> has a plurality of lifting segments. The lifting unit <b>28</b> is shown in the fully moved-together state or in a defined lowered position of the normal mode in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.
