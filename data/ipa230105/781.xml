Glatiramer acetate is a random polymer composed of four amino acids that are found in myelin basic protein. Glatiramer acetate comprises the acetate salts of polypeptides containing L-glutamic acid, L-alanine, L-tyrosine and L-lysine. The average molar fractions of the amino acids are 0.141, 0.427, 0.095 and 0.338, respectively, and the average molecular weight of copolymer-1 is between 5,000 and 9,000 daltons. Chemically, glatiramer acetate is designated L-glutamic acid polymer with L-alanine, L-lysine and L-tyrosine, acetate (salt). Its structural formula is: (Glu, Ala, Lys, Tyr)xCH<sub>3</sub>COOH, approx. ratio Glu<sub>14</sub>Ala<sub>43</sub>Tyr<sub>10</sub>Lyz<sub>34</sub>x(CH<sub>3</sub>COOH)<sub>20</sub>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Copaxone&#xae; is manufactured as a solution for subcutaneous injection. Each 1 mL of Copaxone&#xae; solution contains 20 mg or 40 mg of glatiramer acetate and 40 mg of mannitol. The 20 mg/mL strength is indicated for daily injection, while the 40 mg/mL strength is indicated for injection three times per week. Side effects generally include a lump at the injection site (injection site reaction), aches, fever, and chills.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,377,885 and 8,796,226 describe long acting parenteral compositions of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of glatiramer, including glatiramer acetate, in depot form suitable for subcutaneous or intramuscular implantation or injection. The long acting compositions provide equal or superior therapeutic efficacy compared with daily injectable Copaxone&#xae; formulations, with reduced incidence and/or severity of side effects such as injection site irritation, due to the reduced frequency of administration. The compositions are prepared by a &#x201c;double emulsification&#x201d; process. An aqueous solution of glatiramer acetate is dispersed in a solution of a biodegradable polymer (PLGA) in a volatile water-immiscible organic solvent. The obtained &#x201c;water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion&#x201d; is dispersed in a continuous external water phase containing surfactant to form &#x201c;water-in oil-in water (w/o/w) double emulsion&#x201d; droplets. The organic solvent is slowly evaporated by stirring the double emulsion in a fume hood. The resulting microparticles are collected by filtration or centrifugation, washed with water and lyophilized. The solvents used in the aforementioned process are halogenated hydrocarbons, particularly chloroform or dichloromethane, which act as solvents for the polymer. The presence of residual, but detectable, halogenated hydrocarbon solvents in the final product, however, is undesirable, because of their general toxicity and possible carcinogenic activity. To address this, regulatory agencies have imposed limitations on the amount of residual organic solvents present in pharmaceutical compositions intended for human and veterinary uses.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need in the art for an improved and reliable process for preparing microparticles containing glatiramer acetate having low levels of residual organic solvent(s), in particular halogenated organic solvents.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides an improved process for preparing microparticles containing glatiramer acetate having low levels of residual organic solvent(s), in particular halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane. Unexpectedly it has been discovered that organic solvent levels may be reduced to regulatory-acceptable levels (e.g., less than about 600 ppm for dichloromethane) by altering the organic solvent evaporation step in the double emulsification process previously described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,377,885 and 8,796,226. A main challenge in modifying said process was to keep the microparticle's morphology, the binding percentage and the release profile of the glatiramer acetate active ingredient intact, despite the process modifications. It has now been discovered that application of vacuum and/or air stream to the double water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion results in a product having reduced levels of organic solvent, while still maintaining intact microparticles of glatiramer acetate. In particular, by careful adjustment of the mixing, air bubbling and/or vacuum intensities, microparticles were achieved having desired morphological and therapeutic properties (e.g., drug release profile), while at the same time minimizing the level of organic solvent to regulatory acceptable levels. For example, for chlorinated organic solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM, also referred to interchangeably as methylene chloride), the regulatory limits according to ICH guidelines are 600 ppm.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, the present invention provides a process for preparing microparticles comprising glatiramer acetate, the process comprising the steps of: (a) preparing an internal aqueous phase comprising glatiramer acetate and water; (b) preparing an organic phase comprising a biodegradable or non-biodegradable polymer and a water-immiscible volatile organic solvent; (c) preparing an external aqueous phase comprising water and a surfactant; (d) mixing the internal aqueous phase obtained in step (a) and the organic phase obtained in step (b) to form a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion; (e) mixing the water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion obtained in step (d) with the external water phase obtained in step (c) to obtain a water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double emulsion; (f) removing the organic solvent by mixing the water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double emulsion obtained in step (e), and applying an air stream and/or a vacuum; and (g) drying to obtain microparticles of glatiramer acetate, the microparticles comprising less than about 1,000 ppm of residual organic solvent. In one embodiment, step (f) is conducted under conditions sufficient to reduce the level of organic solvent to less than about 1,000 ppm, preferably less than about 600 ppm.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As contemplated herein, the process of the present invention results in a product having reduced levels of residual organic solvent(s), thereby being compliant with regulatory imposed limitations.

The mixing, application of air stream and/or vacuum are conducted under suitable conditions that will not affect that integrity of the final product (e.g., its morphology, GA binding percentage or release profile), while still giving rise to a product having low levels of organic solvent, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the w/o/w double emulsion may be mixed using a homogenizer, preferably at a speed of at least about 2,500 rounds per minute (RPM), preferably at least about 2,750 RPM.

Preferably, the vacuum is applied for at least about 3 hours, or at least about 5 hours. In other embodiments, step (f) comprises mixing of the w/o/w double emulsion in combination with applying a compressed air stream to the w/o/w double emulsion at a pressure of about 0.1 to 1 bar, preferably about 0.5 bar or any value inbetween. In yet other embodiments, step (f) comprises mixing of the w/o/w double emulsion together with applying a combination of compressed air stream and vacuum as described above.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">After solvent evaporation, the glatiramer acetate microparticles are isolated by drying (step (g)).

The microparticles are in the form of a depot formulation which may be administered by parenteral administration (e.g., intramuscularly or subcutaneously), and affords equal or superior therapeutic efficacy compared with daily Copaxone&#xae; injections and thus result in improved patient compliance. In addition to providing similar therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects, the long acting depot compositions contain low levels or residual organic solvent (e.g., dichloromethane), thereby complying with regulatory requirements regarding permitted residual amounts of such solvents.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The microparticulate compositions of the present invention comprise a water-in oil-in water (w/o/w) double emulsion. The double emulsion comprises an internal aqueous phase comprising glatiramer acetate, an oil phase or water-immiscible organic phase comprising a biodegradable or non-biodegradable polymer and a water-immiscible organic solvent, and an external aqueous phase comprising a surfactant and optionally a tonicity modifier. The terms &#x201c;oil phase&#x201d; and &#x201c;water-immiscible organic phase&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Preparation of Microparticles</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The compositions of the present invention can be prepared in the form of injectable microparticles by a process known as a &#x201c;double emulsification&#x201d; process, which represents an improvement of the process described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,377,885 and 8,796,226. According to the principles of the present invention, a solution of glatiramer acetate is dispersed in a solution of a biodegradable or non-biodegradable polymer in water-immiscible volatile organic solvent. The thus obtained &#x201c;water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion&#x201d; is then dispersed in a continuous external water phase containing surfactant to form &#x201c;water-in oil-in water (w/o/w) double emulsion&#x201d; droplets. The organic solvent is then removed (i.e., evaporated) by mixing the water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double emulsion and applying an air stream and/or a vacuum, under conditions sufficient to reduce the amount of organic solvent to levels acceptable for pharmaceutical applications (e.g., compliance with ICH guidelines). The process described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,377,885 and 8,796,226 does not contemplate application of an air stream or a vacuum during the solvent evaporation step. In some embodiments, the level of residual organic solvent is reduced to less than the maximal residual solvent permitted according to regulatory agencies. Generally, the level of residual organic solvent is reduced to less than about 1,000 ppm. When halogenated organic solvents (e.g., dichloromethane) are used, the level is preferably reduced to less than about 600 ppm, which is the maximal regulatory allowed level.
