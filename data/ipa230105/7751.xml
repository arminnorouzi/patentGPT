level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Options for accessing and listening to digital audio in an out-loud setting were limited until in 2002, when SONOS, Inc. began development of a new type of playback system. Sonos then filed one of its first patent applications in 2003, entitled &#x201c;Method for Synchronizing Audio Playback between Multiple Networked Devices,&#x201d; and began offering its first media playback systems for sale in 2005. The Sonos Wireless Home Sound System enables people to experience music from many sources via one or more networked playback devices. Through a software control application installed on a controller (e.g., smartphone, tablet, computer, voice input device), one can play what she wants in any room having a networked playback device. Media content (e.g., songs, podcasts, video sound) can be streamed to playback devices such that each room with a playback device can play back corresponding different media content. In addition, rooms can be grouped together for synchronous playback of the same media content, and/or the same media content can be heard in all rooms synchronously.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Given the ever-growing interest in digital media, there continues to be a need to develop consumer-accessible technologies to further enhance the listening experience.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Features, aspects, and advantages of the presently disclosed technology may be better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings, as listed below.

Overview</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Throughout one's day, different types of listening moments can occur. Some activities call for personal listening moments while other moments are centered around room-filling sound. Sound helps to create and/or support different listening moments or moods and foster a more personal, meaningful, and targeted interaction with one's environment. The directionality of sound, layering of sound, or types of sound can be selected to create particular listening moments or moods. Listening experiences can be further enhanced when accompanied by corresponding lighting effects that add a lighting component to create a more immersive and comprehensive audiovisual experience. Accordingly, disclosed herein are various modes of operation, techniques, and embodiments for creating sound and light experiences.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">While some examples described herein may refer to functions performed by given actors such as &#x201c;users,&#x201d; &#x201c;listeners,&#x201d; and/or other entities, it should be understood that this is for purposes of explanation only. The claims should not be interpreted to require action by any such example actor unless explicitly required by the language of the claims themselves.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Moreover, some functions are described herein as being performed &#x201c;based on&#x201d; or &#x201c;in response to&#x201d; another element or function. &#x201c;Based on&#x201d; should be understood that one element or function is related to another function or element. &#x201c;In response to&#x201d; should be understood that one element or function is a necessary result of another function or element. For the sake of brevity, functions are generally described as being based on another function when a functional link exists; however, such disclosure should be understood as disclosing either type of functional relationship.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the figures, identical reference numbers identify generally similar, and/or identical, elements.

Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a partial cutaway view of MPS <b>100</b> distributed in an environment <b>101</b> (e.g., a house) is shown. The MPS <b>100</b> as shown is associated with an example home environment having a plurality of rooms and spaces. The MPS <b>100</b> comprises one or more playback devices <b>110</b> (identified individually as playback devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>o</i>), one or more network microphone devices (&#x201c;NMDs&#x201d;) <b>120</b> (identified individually as NMDs <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>), and one or more control devices <b>130</b> (identified individually as control devices <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b</i>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein the term &#x201c;playback device&#x201d; can generally refer to a network device configured to receive, process, and output data of a media playback system. For example, a playback device can be a network device that receives and processes audio content. In some embodiments, a playback device includes one or more transducers or speakers powered by one or more amplifiers. In other embodiments, however, a playback device includes one of (or neither of) the speaker and the amplifier. For instance, a playback device can comprise one or more amplifiers configured to drive one or more speakers external to the playback device via a corresponding wire or cable.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Moreover, as used herein the term NMD (i.e., a &#x201c;network microphone device&#x201d;) can generally refer to a network device that is configured for audio detection. In some embodiments, an NMD is a stand-alone device configured primarily for audio detection. In other embodiments, an NMD is incorporated into a playback device (or vice versa).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The term &#x201c;control device&#x201d; can generally refer to a network device configured to perform functions relevant to facilitating user access, control, and/or configuration of the MPS <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each of the playback devices <b>110</b> is configured to receive audio signals or data from one or more media sources (e.g., one or more remote servers, one or more local devices) and play back the received audio signals or data as sound. The one or more NMDs <b>120</b> are configured to receive spoken word commands, and the one or more control devices <b>130</b> are configured to receive user input. In response to the received spoken word commands and/or user input, the MPS <b>100</b> can play back audio via one or more of the playback devices <b>110</b>. In certain embodiments, the playback devices <b>110</b> are configured to commence playback of media content in response to a trigger. For instance, one or more of the playback devices <b>110</b> can be configured to play back a morning playlist upon detection of an associated trigger condition (e.g., presence of a user in a kitchen, detection of a coffee machine operation). In some embodiments, for example, the MPS <b>100</b> is configured to play back audio from a first playback device (e.g., the playback device <b>100</b><i>a</i>) in synchrony with a second playback device (e.g., the playback device <b>100</b><i>b</i>).

In some embodiments, each remote computing device <b>106</b> may take the form of one or more cloud servers. The remote computing devices <b>106</b> may be configured to interact with computing devices in the environment <b>101</b> in various ways. For example, the remote computing devices <b>106</b> may be configured to facilitate streaming and/or controlling playback of media content, such as audio, in the environment <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some implementations, the various playback devices <b>110</b>, NMDs <b>120</b>, and/or control devices <b>130</b> may be communicatively coupled to at least one remote computing device associated with a voice assistant service (&#x201c;VAS&#x201d;) and/or at least one remote computing device associated with a media content service (&#x201c;MCS&#x201d;). For instance, in the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, remote computing devices <b>106</b><i>a </i>are associated with a VAS <b>190</b> and remote computing devices <b>106</b><i>b </i>are associated with an MCS <b>192</b>. Although only a single VAS <b>190</b> and a single MCS <b>192</b> are shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> for purposes of clarity, the MPS <b>100</b> may be coupled to any number of different VASes and/or MCSes. In some embodiments, the various playback devices <b>110</b>, NMDs <b>120</b>, and/or control devices <b>130</b> may transmit data associated with a received voice input to a VAS configured to (i) process the received voice input data and (ii) transmit a corresponding command to the MPS <b>100</b>. In some aspects, for example, the computing devices <b>106</b><i>a </i>may comprise one or more modules and/or servers of a VAS. In some implementations, VASes may be operated by one or more of SONOS&#xae;, AMAZON&#xae;, GOOGLE&#xae; APPLE&#xae;, MICROSOFT&#xae;, NUANCE&#xae;, or other voice assistant providers. In some implementations, MCSes may be operated by one or more of SPOTIFY, PANDORA, AMAZON MUSIC, YOUTUBE MUSIC, APPLE MUSIC, GOOGLE PLAY, or other media content services.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the local network <b>160</b> comprises a dedicated communication network that the MPS <b>100</b> uses to transmit messages between individual devices and/or to transmit media content to and from MCSes. In certain embodiments, the local network <b>160</b> is configured to be accessible only to devices in the MPS <b>100</b>, thereby reducing interference and competition with other household devices. In other embodiments, however, the local network <b>160</b> comprises an existing household communication network (e.g., a household WIFI network). In some embodiments, the MPS <b>100</b> is implemented without the local network <b>160</b>, and the various devices comprising the MPS <b>100</b> can communicate with each other, for example, via one or more direct connections, PANs, telecommunication networks (e.g., an LTE network or a 5G network, etc.), and/or other suitable communication links.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, audio content sources may be regularly added and/or removed from the MPS <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, for example, the MPS <b>100</b> performs an indexing of media items when one or more media content sources are updated, added to, and/or removed from the MPS <b>100</b>. The MPS <b>100</b> can scan identifiable media items in some or all folders and/or directories accessible to the various playback devices and generate or update a media content database comprising metadata (e.g., title, artist, album, track length) and other associated information (e.g., URIs, URLs) for each identifiable media item found. In some embodiments, for example, the media content database is stored on one or more of the various playback devices, network microphone devices, and/or control devices of MPS <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the remote computing devices <b>106</b> further include remote computing device(s) <b>106</b><i>c </i>configured to perform certain operations, such as remotely facilitating media playback functions, managing device and system status information, directing communications between the devices of the MPS <b>100</b> and one or multiple VASes and/or MCSes, among other operations. In one example, the remote computing devices <b>106</b><i>c </i>provide cloud servers for one or more SONOS Wireless HiFi Systems.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In various implementations, one or more of the playback devices <b>110</b> may take the form of or include an on-board (e.g., integrated) network microphone device configured to receive sound, including voice utterances from a user. For example, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>c</i>-<b>110</b><i>h</i>, and <b>110</b><i>k </i>include or are otherwise equipped with corresponding NMDs <b>120</b><i>c</i>-<b>120</b><i>h</i>, and <b>120</b><i>k</i>, respectively. A playback device that includes or is equipped with an NMD may be referred to herein interchangeably as a playback device or an NMD unless indicated otherwise in the description. In some cases, one or more of the NMDs <b>120</b> may be a stand-alone device. For example, the NMD <b>1201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) may be a stand-alone device. A stand-alone NMD may omit components and/or functionality that is typically included in a playback device, such as a speaker or related electronics. For instance, in such cases, a stand-alone NMD may not produce audio output or may produce limited audio output (e.g., relatively low-quality audio output).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The various playback and network microphone devices <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> of the MPS <b>100</b> may each be associated with a unique name, which may be assigned to the respective devices by a user, such as during setup of one or more of these devices. For instance, as shown in the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a user may assign the name &#x201c;Bookcase&#x201d; to playback device <b>110</b><i>e </i>because it is physically situated on a bookcase. Similarly, the NMD <b>1201</b> may be assigned the named &#x201c;Island&#x201d; because it is physically situated on an island countertop in the Kitchen <b>101</b><i>h </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Some playback devices may be assigned names according to a zone or room, such as the playback devices <b>110</b><i>g</i>, <b>110</b><i>d</i>, and <b>110</b><i>f</i>, which are named &#x201c;Bedroom,&#x201d; &#x201c;Dining Room,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Office,&#x201d; respectively. Further, certain playback devices may have functionally descriptive names. For example, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>k </i>and <b>110</b><i>h </i>are assigned the names &#x201c;Right&#x201d; and &#x201c;Front,&#x201d; respectively, because these two devices are configured to provide specific audio channels during media playback in the zone of the Den <b>101</b><i>d </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). The playback device <b>110</b><i>c </i>in the Patio may be named &#x201c;Portable&#x201d; because it is battery-powered and/or readily transportable to different areas of the environment <b>101</b>. Other naming conventions are possible.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As discussed above, an NMD may detect and process sound from its environment, including audio output played by itself, played by other devices in the environment <b>101</b>, and/or sound that includes background noise mixed with speech spoken by a person in the NMD's vicinity. For example, as sounds are detected by the NMD in the environment, the NMD may process the detected sound to determine if the sound includes speech that contains voice input intended for the NMD and ultimately a particular VAS. For example, the NMD may identify whether speech includes a wake word (also referred to herein as an activation word) associated with a particular VAS.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the NMDs <b>120</b> are configured to interact with the VAS <b>190</b> over the local network <b>160</b> and/or the router <b>109</b>. Interactions with the VAS <b>190</b> may be initiated, for example, when an NMD identifies in the detected sound a potential wake word. The identification causes a wake-word event, which in turn causes the NMD to begin transmitting detected-sound data to the VAS <b>190</b>. In some implementations, the various local network devices <b>105</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, and <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and/or remote computing devices <b>106</b><i>c </i>of the MPS <b>100</b> may exchange various feedback, information, instructions, and/or related data with the remote computing devices associated with the selected VAS. Such exchanges may be related to or independent of transmitted messages containing voice inputs. In some embodiments, the remote computing device(s) and the MPS <b>100</b> may exchange data via communication paths as described herein and/or using a metadata exchange channel as described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,499,146, issued Nov. 13, 2019, and titled &#x201c;Voice Control of a Media Playback System,&#x201d; which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Upon receiving the stream of sound data, the VAS <b>190</b> may determine if there is voice input in the streamed data from the NMD, and if so the VAS <b>190</b> may also determine an underlying intent in the voice input. The VAS <b>190</b> may next transmit a response back to the MPS <b>100</b>, which can include transmitting the response directly to the NMD that caused the wake-word event. The response is typically based on the intent that the VAS <b>190</b> determined was present in the voice input. As an example, in response to the VAS <b>190</b> receiving a voice input with an utterance to &#x201c;Play Hey Jude by The Beatles,&#x201d; the VAS <b>190</b> may determine that the underlying intent of the voice input is to initiate playback and further determine that intent of the voice input is to play the particular song &#x201c;Hey Jude.&#x201d; After these determinations, the VAS <b>190</b> may transmit a command to a particular MCS <b>192</b> to retrieve content (i.e., the song &#x201c;Hey Jude&#x201d; by The Beatles), and that MCS <b>192</b>, in turn, provides (e.g., streams) this content directly to the NIPS <b>100</b> or indirectly via the VAS <b>190</b>. In some implementations, the VAS <b>190</b> may transmit to the NIPS <b>100</b> a command that causes the MPS <b>100</b> itself to retrieve the content from the MCS <b>192</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In certain implementations, NMDs may facilitate arbitration amongst one another when voice input is identified in speech detected by two or more NMDs located within proximity of one another. For example, the NMD-equipped playback device <b>110</b><i>e </i>in the environment <b>101</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>A) is in relatively close proximity to the NMD-equipped Living Room playback device <b>120</b><i>b</i>, and both devices <b>110</b><i>e </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>may at least sometimes detect the same sound. In such cases, this may require arbitration as to which device is ultimately responsible for providing detected-sound data to the remote VAS. Examples of arbitrating between NMDs may be found, for example, in previously referenced U.S. Pat. No. 10,499,146.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In certain implementations, an NMD may be assigned to, or otherwise associated with, a designated or default playback device that may not include an NMD. For example, the Island NMD <b>1201</b> in the Kitchen <b>101</b><i>h </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) may be assigned to the Dining Room playback device <b>110</b><i>d</i>, which is in relatively close proximity to the Island NMD <b>1201</b>. In practice, an NMD may direct an assigned playback device to play audio in response to a remote VAS receiving a voice input from the NMD to play the audio, which the NMD might have sent to the VAS in response to a user speaking a command to play a certain song, album, playlist, etc. Additional details regarding assigning NMDs and playback devices as designated or default devices may be found, for example, in previously referenced U.S. Pat. No. 10,499,146.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further aspects relating to the different components of the example MPS <b>100</b> and how the different components may interact to provide a user with a media experience may be found in the following sections.

More specifically, each microphone <b>115</b> is configured to detect sound and convert the sound into a digital or analog signal representative of the detected sound, which can then cause the voice processing component to perform various functions based on the detected sound, as described in greater detail below. In some implementations, the microphones <b>115</b> may be arranged as an array of microphones (e.g., an array of six microphones). In some implementations the playback device <b>110</b><i>r </i>may include fewer than six microphones or more than six microphones.

The voice processing components <b>124</b> may include one or more analog-to-digital converters, an acoustic echo canceller (&#x201c;AEC&#x201d;), a spatial processor (e.g., one or more multi-channel Wiener filters, one or more other filters, and/or one or more beam former components), one or more buffers (e.g., one or more circular buffers), one or more wake-word engines, one or more voice extractors, and/or one or more speech processing components (e.g., components configured to recognize a voice of a particular user or a particular set of users associated with a household), among other example voice processing components. In example implementations, the voice processing components <b>124</b> may include or otherwise take the form of one or more DSPs or one or more modules of a DSP. In this respect, certain voice processing components <b>124</b> may be configured with particular parameters (e.g., gain and/or spectral parameters) that may be modified or otherwise tuned to achieve particular functions. In some implementations, one or more of the voice processing components <b>124</b> may be a subcomponent of the processor <b>112</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some implementations, the voice-processing components <b>124</b> may detect and store a user's voice profile, which may be associated with a user account of the MPS <b>100</b>. For example, voice profiles may be stored as and/or compared to variables stored in a set of command information or data table. The voice profile may include aspects of the tone of frequency of a user's voice and/or other unique aspects of the user's voice, such as those described in previously-referenced U.S. Patent Publication No. 10,499,146.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>, the microphones <b>115</b> are configured to acquire, capture, and/or receive sound from an environment (e.g., the environment <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and/or a room in which the NMD <b>120</b><i>a </i>is positioned. The received sound can include, for example, vocal utterances, audio played back by the NMD <b>120</b><i>a </i>and/or another playback device, background voices, ambient sounds, etc. The microphones <b>115</b> convert the received sound into electrical signals to produce microphone data. The NMD <b>120</b><i>a </i>may use the microphone data (or transmit the microphone data to another device) for calibrating the audio characteristics of one or more playback devices <b>110</b> in the MPS <b>100</b>. As another example, one or more of the playback devices <b>110</b>, NMDs <b>120</b>, and/or control devices <b>130</b> of the MPS <b>100</b> may transmit audio tones (e.g., ultrasonic tones, infrasonic tones) that may be detectable by the microphones <b>115</b> of other devices, and which may convey information such as a proximity and/or identity of the transmitting device, a media playback system command, etc. As yet another example, the voice processing components <b>124</b> may receive and analyze the microphone data to determine whether a voice input is present in the microphone data. The voice input can comprise, for example, an activation word followed by an utterance including a user request. As those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, an activation word is a word or other audio cue that signifying a user voice input. For instance, in querying the AMAZON&#xae; VAS, a user might speak the activation word &#x201c;Alexa.&#x201d; Other examples include &#x201c;Ok, Google&#x201d; for invoking the GOOGLE&#xae; VAS and &#x201c;Hey, Siri&#x201d; for invoking the APPLE&#xae; VAS.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">After detecting the activation word, voice processing components <b>124</b> monitor the microphone data for an accompanying user request in the voice input. The user request may include, for example, a command to control a third-party device, such as a thermostat (e.g., NEST&#xae; thermostat), an illumination device (e.g., a PHILIPS HUE&#xae; lighting device), or a media playback device (e.g., a Sonos&#xae; playback device). For example, a user might speak the activation word &#x201c;Alexa&#x201d; followed by the utterance &#x201c;set the thermostat to 68 degrees&#x201d; to set a temperature in a home (e.g., the environment <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). The user might speak the same activation word followed by the utterance &#x201c;turn on the living room&#x201d; to turn on illumination devices in a living room area of the home.

In some embodiments, the network interface <b>132</b><i>d </i>is configured to operate according to one or more suitable communication industry standards (e.g., infrared, radio, wired standards including IEEE 802.3, wireless standards including IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.12, 802.11ac, 802.15, 4G, LTE). The network interface <b>132</b><i>d </i>can be configured, for example, to transmit data to and/or receive data from the playback devices <b>110</b>, the NMDs <b>120</b>, other ones of the control devices <b>130</b>, one of the computing devices <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, devices comprising one or more other media playback systems, etc. The transmitted and/or received data can include, for example, playback device control commands, state variables, playback zone and/or zone group configurations. For instance, based on user input received at the user interface <b>133</b>, the network interface <b>132</b><i>d </i>can transmit a playback device control command (e.g., volume control, audio playback control, audio content selection) from the control device <b>130</b><i>a </i>to one or more of the playback devices <b>110</b>. The network interface <b>132</b><i>d </i>can also transmit and/or receive configuration changes such as, for example, adding/removing one or more playback devices <b>110</b> to/from a zone, adding/removing one or more zones to/from a zone group, forming a bonded or consolidated player, separating one or more playback devices from a bonded or consolidated player, among other changes. Additional description of zones and groups can be found below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>J through <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The user interface <b>133</b> is configured to receive user input and can facilitate control of the MPS <b>100</b>. The user interface <b>133</b> includes media content art <b>133</b><i>a </i>(e.g., album art, lyrics, videos), a playback status indicator <b>133</b><i>b </i>(e.g., an elapsed and/or remaining time indicator), media content information region <b>133</b><i>c</i>, a playback control region <b>133</b><i>d</i>, and a zone indicator <b>133</b><i>e</i>. The media content information region <b>133</b><i>c </i>can include a display of relevant information (e.g., title, artist, album, genre, release year) about media content currently playing and/or media content in a queue or playlist. The playback control region <b>133</b><i>d </i>can include selectable (e.g., via touch input and/or via a cursor or another suitable selector) icons to cause one or more playback devices in a selected playback zone or zone group to perform playback actions such as, for example, play or pause, fast forward, rewind, skip to next, skip to previous, enter/exit shuffle mode, enter/exit repeat mode, enter/exit cross fade mode, etc. The playback control region <b>133</b><i>d </i>may also include selectable icons to modify equalization settings, playback volume, and/or other suitable playback actions. In the illustrated embodiment, the user interface <b>133</b> comprises a display presented on a touch screen interface of a smartphone (e.g., an iPhone&#x2122;, an Android phone, etc.). In some embodiments, however, user interfaces of varying formats, styles, and interactive sequences may alternatively be implemented on one or more network devices to provide comparable control access to a media playback system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref> shows two additional example user interface displays <b>133</b><i>f </i>and <b>133</b><i>g </i>of user interface <b>133</b>. Additional examples are also possible.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The one or more speakers <b>134</b> (e.g., one or more transducers) can be configured to output sound to the user of the control device <b>130</b><i>a</i>. In some embodiments, the one or more speakers comprise individual transducers configured to correspondingly output low frequencies, mid-range frequencies, and/or high frequencies. In some aspects, for example, the control device <b>130</b><i>a </i>is configured as a playback device (e.g., one of the playback devices <b>110</b>). Similarly, in some embodiments the control device <b>130</b><i>a </i>is configured as an NMD (e.g., one of the NMDs <b>120</b>), receiving voice commands and other sounds via the one or more microphones <b>135</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The one or more microphones <b>135</b> can comprise, for example, one or more condenser microphones, electret condenser microphones, dynamic microphones, and/or other suitable types of microphones or transducers. In some embodiments, two or more of the microphones <b>135</b> are arranged to capture location information of an audio source (e.g., voice, audible sound) and/or configured to facilitate filtering of background noise. Moreover, in certain embodiments, the control device <b>130</b><i>a </i>is configured to operate as playback device and an NMD. In other embodiments, however, the control device <b>130</b><i>a </i>omits the one or more speakers <b>134</b> and/or the one or more microphones <b>135</b>. For instance, the control device <b>130</b><i>a </i>may comprise a device (e.g., a thermostat, an IoT device, a network device, etc.) comprising a portion of the electronics <b>132</b> and the user interface <b>133</b> (e.g., a touch screen) without any speakers or microphones.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">e. Suitable Playback Device Configurations</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>J, <b>1</b>K, <b>1</b>L, <b>1</b>M, and <b>2</b></figref> show example configurations of playback devices in zones and zone groups. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in one example, a single playback device may belong to a zone. For example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>g </i>in the Second Bedroom <b>101</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) may belong to Zone C. In some implementations described below, multiple playback devices may be &#x201c;bonded&#x201d; to form a &#x201c;bonded pair&#x201d; which together form a single zone. For example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>l </i>(e.g., a left playback device) can be bonded to the playback device <b>110</b><i>m </i>(e.g., a right playback device) to form Zone B. Bonded playback devices may have different playback responsibilities (e.g., channel responsibilities), as will be described in more detail further below. In other implementations, multiple playback devices may be merged to form a single zone. As one example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>a </i>can be bonded to the playback device <b>110</b><i>n </i>and the NMD <b>120</b><i>c </i>to form Zone A. As another example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>h </i>(e.g., a front playback device) may be merged with the playback device <b>110</b><i>i </i>(e.g., a subwoofer), and the playback devices <b>110</b><i>j </i>and <b>110</b><i>k </i>(e.g., left and right surround speakers, respectively) to form a single Zone D. In yet other implementations, one or more playback zones can be merged to form a zone group (which may also be referred to herein as a merged group). As one example, the playback zones Zone A and Zone B can be merged to form Zone Group <b>108</b><i>a</i>. As another example, the playback zones Zone G and Zone H can be merged to form Zone Group <b>108</b><i>b</i>. The merged playback zones Zone G and Zone H may not be specifically assigned different playback responsibilities. That is, the merged playback zones Zone G and Zone H may, aside from playing audio content in synchrony, each play audio content as they would if they were not merged and operating as independent zones.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Each zone in the MPS <b>100</b> may be provided for control as a single user interface (UI) entity represented in the UI. For example, Zone A may be provided as a single entity named Master Bathroom. Zone B may be provided as a single entity named Master Bedroom. Zone C may be provided as a single entity named Second Bedroom.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some implementations, as mentioned above playback devices that are bonded may have different playback responsibilities, such as responsibilities for certain audio channels. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>J</figref>, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>l </i>and <b>110</b><i>m </i>may be bonded so as to produce or enhance a stereo effect of audio content. In this example, the playback device <b>110</b><i>l </i>may be configured to play a left channel audio component, while the playback device <b>110</b><i>k </i>may be configured to play a right channel audio component. In some implementations, such stereo bonding may be referred to as &#x201c;pairing.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Additionally, bonded playback devices may have additional and/or different respective speaker drivers. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>K</figref>, the playback device <b>110</b><i>h </i>named Front may be bonded with the playback device <b>110</b><i>i </i>named SUB. The Front device <b>110</b><i>h </i>can be configured to render a range of mid to high frequencies and the SUB device <b>110</b><i>i </i>can be configured to render low frequencies. When unbonded, however, the Front device <b>110</b><i>h </i>can be configured to render a full range of frequencies. As another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>L</figref> shows the Front and SUB devices <b>110</b><i>h </i>and <b>110</b><i>i </i>further bonded with Left and Right playback devices <b>110</b><i>j </i>and <b>110</b><i>k</i>, respectively. In some implementations, the Right and Left devices <b>110</b><i>j </i>and <b>110</b><i>k </i>can be configured to form surround or &#x201c;satellite&#x201d; channels of a home theater system. The bonded playback devices <b>110</b><i>h</i>, <b>110</b><i>i</i>, <b>110</b><i>j</i>, and <b>110</b><i>k </i>may form a single Zone D (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In other implementations, playback devices that are merged may not have assigned playback responsibilities and may each render the full range of audio content of which the respective playback device is capable of. Nevertheless, merged devices may be represented as a single UI entity (i.e., a zone, as discussed above). For instance, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>in the Master Bathroom have the single UI entity of Zone A. In one embodiment, the playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>may each output the full range of audio content of which each respective playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>is capable, in synchrony.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some embodiments, an NMD may be bonded or merged with one or more other devices so as to form a zone. As one example, the NMD <b>120</b><i>c </i>may be merged with the playback devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n </i>to form Zone A. As another example, the NMD <b>120</b><i>b </i>may be bonded with the playback device <b>110</b><i>e</i>, which together form Zone F, named Living Room. In other embodiments, a stand-alone network microphone device may be in a zone by itself. In other embodiments, however, a stand-alone network microphone device may not be associated with a zone. Additional details regarding associating network microphone devices and playback devices as designated or default devices may be found, for example, in previously referenced U.S. Pat. No. 10,499,146.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">As mentioned above, in some implementations, zones of individual, bonded, and/or merged devices may be grouped to form a zone group. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>N</figref>, Zone A may be grouped with Zone B to form a zone group <b>108</b><i>a </i>that includes the two zones, and Zone G may be grouped with Zone H to form the zone group <b>108</b><i>b</i>. However, other zone groupings are also possible. For example, Zone A may be grouped with one or more other Zones C-I. The Zones A-I may be grouped and ungrouped in numerous ways. For example, three, four, five, or more (e.g., all) of the Zones A-I may be grouped at any given time. When grouped, the zones of individual and/or bonded playback devices may play back audio in synchrony with one another, as described in previously referenced U.S. Pat. No. 8,234,395. Playback devices may be dynamically grouped and ungrouped to form new or different groups that synchronously play back audio content.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In various implementations, the zone groups in an environment may be named by according to a name of a zone within the group or a combination of the names of the zones within a zone group. For example, Zone Group <b>108</b><i>b </i>can be assigned a name such as &#x201c;Dining+Kitchen&#x201d;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In other implementations, a zone group may be given a unique name selected by a user.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Certain data may be stored in a memory of a playback device (e.g., the memory <b>112</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>) as one or more state variables that are periodically updated and used to describe the state of a playback zone, the playback device(s), and/or a zone group associated therewith. The memory may also include the data associated with the state of the other devices of the media system and shared from time to time among the devices so that one or more of the devices have the most recent data associated with the system.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some embodiments, the memory may store instances of various variable types associated with the states. Variables instances may be stored with identifiers (e.g., tags) corresponding to type. For example, certain identifiers may be a first type &#x201c;al&#x201d; to identify playback device(s) of a zone, a second type &#x201c;b<b>1</b>&#x201d; to identify playback device(s) that may be bonded in the zone, and a third type &#x201c;c<b>1</b>&#x201d; to identify a zone group to which the zone may belong. As a related example, identifiers associated with the Second Bedroom <b>101</b><i>c </i>may indicate (i) that the playback device <b>110</b><i>g </i>is the only playback device of the Zone C and (ii) that Zone C is not in a zone group. Identifiers associated with the Den <b>101</b><i>d </i>may indicate that the Den <b>101</b><i>d </i>is not grouped with other zones but includes bonded playback devices <b>110</b><i>h</i>-<b>110</b><i>k</i>. Identifiers associated with the Dining Room <b>101</b><i>g </i>may indicate that the Dining Room <b>101</b><i>g </i>is part of the Dining+Kitchen Zone Group <b>108</b><i>b </i>and that devices <b>110</b><i>d </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>(Kitchen <b>101</b><i>h</i>) are grouped (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>). Identifiers associated with the Kitchen <b>101</b><i>h </i>may indicate the same or similar information by virtue of the Kitchen <b>101</b><i>h </i>being part of the Dining+Kitchen Zone Group <b>108</b><i>b</i>. Other example zone variables and identifiers are described below.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In yet another example, the MPS <b>100</b> may include variables or identifiers representing other associations of zones and zone groups, such as identifiers associated with Areas, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. An area may involve a cluster of zone groups and/or zones not within a zone group. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an Upper Area <b>109</b><i>a </i>including Zones A-D, and a Lower Area <b>109</b><i>b </i>including Zones E-I. In one aspect, an Area may be used to invoke a cluster of zone groups and/or zones that share one or more zones and/or zone groups of another cluster. In another aspect, this differs from a zone group, which does not share a zone with another zone group. Further examples of techniques for implementing Areas may be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 10,712,997 filed Aug. 21, 2017, issued Jul. 14, 2020, and titled &#x201c;Room Association Based on Name,&#x201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 8,483,853, filed Sep. 11, 2007, issued Jul. 9, 2013, and titled &#x201c;Controlling and manipulating groupings in a multi-zone media system.&#x201d; Each of these applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the MPS <b>100</b> may not implement Areas, in which case the system may not store variables associated with Areas.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example housing <b>330</b> of the playback device <b>110</b> that includes a user interface in the form of a control area <b>332</b> at a top portion <b>334</b> of the housing <b>330</b>. The control area <b>332</b> includes buttons <b>336</b><i>a</i>, <b>336</b><i>b</i>, and <b>336</b><i>c </i>for controlling audio playback, volume level, and other functions. The control area <b>332</b> also includes a button <b>336</b><i>d </i>for toggling one or more microphones (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of the playback device <b>110</b> to either an on state or an off state. The control area <b>332</b> is at least partially surrounded by apertures formed in the top portion <b>334</b> of the housing <b>330</b> through which the microphones receive the sound in the environment of the playback device <b>110</b>.

Light Source</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In general, a &#x201c;light source&#x201d; as used herein may refer to any artificial lighting element that is capable of providing light. Nonlimiting examples of a lighting element may include a light bulb, a light emitting diode (&#x201c;LED&#x201d;), an LED panel, matrix, array, or some other grouping of LEDs, a lamp, a projector, and a television. A light source may also be, for example, a set of one or more smart light devices or a smart light system (e.g., PHILIPS HUE&#xae; smart light system) that can communicate with the at least one playback device of a media playback system to produce a visual output. A light source may include other examples as well. A light source may also be referred to herein as a lighting device or a lighting element.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Light sources may produce various types of lighting experiences. As one example, the term &#x201c;lighting effect&#x201d; or &#x201c;light effect&#x201d; as used herein may refer to a lighting experience that creates a particular ambience by causing one or more light sources to produce a given color and/or brightness level. As another example, the term &#x201c;lighting scene&#x201d; or &#x201c;light scene&#x201d; as used herein may refer to a lighting experience that creates a visual scene by causing one or more light sources to produce light that mimics a particular scene, such as ocean waves, sunrise or sunset, the northern lights, underwater, among other possibilities. As yet another example, the term &#x201c;animation&#x201d; as used herein may refer to a lighting experience that creates high fidelity graphics by causing one or more light sources to produce light that collectively forms specific shapes, images, and/or patterns. As will be explained in more detail further below, animations may be created dynamically (e.g., smart animations) or based on a predefined set of selectable animation options including colors, shapes, images, and/or patterns. The predefined set of animation options may be available to a user in the form of a software tool for designing a predetermined audiovisual experience that is displayed via a graphical user interface (&#x201c;GUI&#x201d;) on a controller device that is communicatively coupled to a playback device that is configured to communicate with one or more light source to create a lighting experience. Using the GUI, the user may select, for given audio content, corresponding animation options and indicate when each animation option should occur with respect to the given audio content. For example, the user may drag animation options from an option panel and drop the animation options at desired times within a graphical display of the given audio content. The user may additionally preview the audiovisual experience via the GUI and make additional modifications as desired. In this way, a lighting experience can be designed and customized with respect to given audio content, for both personal and public use (e.g., a concert or other performance event). Further, the user may interact with the GUI generally to adjust one or more aspects of lighting experiences as described herein, such as to modify the intensity and/or the sensitivity of a lighting effect, scene, and/or animation.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In general, producing light to create a given lighting experience may be referred to herein as &#x201c;lighting behavior&#x201d; or &#x201c;light behavior.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The type of light source(s) may dictate the type of lighting experience that may be produced. For instance, some light sources&#x2014;such as light bulbs, lamps, or light strips, etc.&#x2014;may not have the ability to produce high fidelity lighting output such as specific shapes or images and may thus be used to create a lighting effect and/or a lighting scene, whereas some light sources&#x2014;such as an LED assembly&#x2014;may have the ability to produce high fidelity lighting output and may thus be used to create any type of lighting experience, including a lighting effect, a lighting scene, and an animation. Further, each type of lighting experience may additionally incorporate lighting transitions such that the one or more light sources may begin and/or cease producing light at a given time in order to create the desired lighting experience.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">b. Example System Configuration</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">A media playback system that may implement the modes, operations, and techniques to create sound and lighting experiences as disclosed herein may take various forms. As one example, the media playback system may take the form of MPS <b>100</b> described above that is configured to communicate with and/or is integrated with a lighting system that comprises one or more lighting devices (e.g., a third-party lighting system such as the PHILIPS HUE&#xae; smart light system). As another possibility, the media playback system may comprise at least one playback device that is configured to communicate with at least one light source over at least one data network. Further, the at least one playback device and at least one light source may be bonded so as to produce audio and lighting in coordination with each other. In this regard, the playback device and the light source may be configured to communicate via a local area network (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.) or via a wide area network (e.g., a cloud network). In some implementations, each of the at least one playback device and the at least one light source may be configured to communicate via their respective cloud networks. For example, the at least one playback device may be configured to send a command comprising a lighting instruction to a first remote computing device, which may then transmit the command to a second remote computing device that is configured to communicate with the at least one light source. As another possibility, the media playback system may comprise at least one playback device that bodily incorporates a light source. Such a playback device may take the form of a table lamp speaker or a lightbulb speaker, among other possibilities. As yet another possibility, the media playback system may comprise a combination of playback devices without incorporated light sources and playback devices with incorporated light sources. Other system configurations are also possible.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Disclosed herein are various embodiments and techniques for providing light experiences based on sound. In this regard, the sound may be sound that is detected or sound that is outputted by a playback device of a media playback system, such as the MPS <b>100</b> discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, that is configured to communicate with one or more lighting devices. Sound that is detected may comprise a voice input (e.g., a voice input comprising a command to play audio content) and/or ambient sound (e.g., people talking, running water, etc.) that is detected via a microphone of the playback device, and sound that is outputted may comprise audio content that is played back by the playback device (e.g., music, podcast, movie soundtrack, etc.).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">c. Lighting Behavior Based on Audio Frequencies</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In one aspect, lighting behavior may be based on different frequencies of the audio spectrum, which is referred to herein as the range of frequencies audible to humans. A playback device that is configured to communicate with at least one lighting device may analyze given audio content to identify frequency ranges present in the given audio content and monitor audio activity in the given audio content. Then, based on the identified frequency ranges and/or the monitored audio activity, the playback device may determine lighting behavior that is to be implemented by the lighting device(s) and then cause the lighting device(s) to implement the determined lighting behavior.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The playback device may analyze the given audio content based on detecting the audio content via a microphone of the playback device (e.g., while playing back the given audio content), based on information about the given audio content that is received over a data network (e.g., received over a WAN from a remote computing device or over a wireless LAN from another device of the media playback system), or a combination of the two. Further, the frequency ranges that are present in the audio content may be identified using an algorithm, such as a Fast Fourier transform to convert the audio content from the time domain to the frequency domain to identify frequencies present in the audio content. For instance, the audio spectrum, which spans 20 Hz to 20 kHz, is broken down generally into low frequencies (approximately 20-300 Hz), medium frequencies (approximately 300 Hz to 5 kHz), and high frequencies (approximately 5-20 kHz) and more specifically into seven primary frequency bands: (i) sub-bass (&#x2dc;20-60 Hz), (ii) bass (&#x2dc;60-250 Hz), (iii) low midrange (&#x2dc;250-500 Hz), (iv) midrange (&#x2dc;500 Hz-2 kHz), (v) upper midrange (&#x2dc;2-4 kHz), (vi) presence (&#x2dc;4-6 kHz), and (vii) brilliance (&#x2dc;6-20 kHz). Based on analyzing the given audio content (e.g., Fast Fourier analysis), the playback device may identify one or more frequency ranges present in the given audio content, including the fundamental frequency of the given audio content.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The playback device may then associate each identified frequency range with a given lighting experience (e.g., a given lighting effect, scene, and/or animation) that is to be produced by the at least one lighting device. In this regard, the playback device may use a lighting algorithm to facilitate association of a given frequency range with given lighting behavior. As one possibility, the lighting algorithm may dynamically associate each identified frequency range with a given lighting behavior as the frequency range is identified. The given lighting behavior may be selected from a set of one or more lighting behaviors that may be based on the capability of the lighting device(s) with which the playback device is configured to communicate. The given lighting behavior may be selected randomly or based on a given order, such as sequentially or alphabetically. For instance, information about the lighting device(s) (which may be received by the playback device from the lighting device(s), from a remote computing device associated with the lighting device(s), or based on user input provided via a controller device communicatively coupled to the playback device), may indicate a set of one or more available lighting behaviors based on the capabilities of the lighting device(s). For example, if the lighting device(s) comprises a smart light bulb, the set of one or more available lighting behaviors may comprise lighting effects that the smart light bulb is capable of producing, which may include a given set of colors and brightness levels. As another example, if the lighting device(s) comprises an LED panel, the set of one or more available lighting behaviors may comprise lighting animations that the LED panel is capable of producing, which may include a given set of shapes, images, and/or patterns. As the playback device identifies frequency ranges in the given audio content, the playback device may associate each frequency range with a given lighting behavior. Further, the playback device may transmit a message to the lighting device(s) that includes (i) an instruction to implement the given lighting behavior and (ii) timing information regarding when to implement the given lighting behavior.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">As another possibility, the lighting algorithm may associate each identified frequency range with given lighting behavior based on a predetermined selection of corresponding sets of frequency range and lighting behavior. For instance, via a controller device that is communicatively coupled to the playback device, a user may have defined given lighting behavior for each possible frequency range, such as a first lighting effect for a first frequency range, a second lighting effect for a second frequency range, a given animation for a third frequency range, and a given scene for a fourth frequency range. When the playback device identifies a given frequency range, it may associate the given frequency range with its corresponding given lighting behavior as indicated by the predetermined selection. In some instances where the given audio content is to be played back in a loop, given lighting behavior may specified such that the lighting behavior is also produced in a loop corresponding with the looped audio content. Other examples are also possible.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Furthermore, the playback device may monitor audio activity within each identified frequency range and then associate given audio activity with a given lighting behavior. For instance, a given frequency range may include one or more lines (i.e., a melodic statement), that may be human vocals and/or instrumental. Each line may be associated with a given lighting behavior. In some instances, a given line may comprise more than one vocals or instruments. In such instances, the given lighting behavior may reflect the vocals or instruments visually by associating different lighting characteristics for each distinct vocal or instrument. For example, the lighting behavior may include an animation of a single shape in different colors that represent each distinct vocal or instrument, or a single shape with multiple points that represent each distinct vocal or instrument, or distinct patterns that represent each distinct vocal or instrument. Other examples are also possible.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In some implementations, the playback device may associate each frequency of visible light with a given ambient sound that has been detected by the playback device, and upon detecting the given ambient sound, cause the light source to produce a lighting effect that corresponds with the associated frequency. For example, the playback device may associate the color yellow with the sound of birds chirping and the color green with the sound of a lawnmower. Thereafter, whenever the playback device detects the sound of birds chirping or the sound of the lawnmower, the playback device may cause the light source to produce a lighting effect that displays the color yellow and the color green, respectively. Other examples are also possible.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Still, in some implementations, the playback device may cause the light source to perform given lighting behavior based on data-over-sound transmissions comprising one or more commands. For instance, the playback device may receive from a computing device (e.g., a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, another playback device, or any other device that includes a speaker, etc.) an ultrasonic or near-ultrasonic sound signal (e.g., 19-20 kHz or higher) that comprises data indicating a command for given lighting behavior. The playback device, upon receiving the sound signal, may decode the data indicating the command and then cause the light source to perform lighting behavior based on the command. In this way, the playback device may cause the light source to engage in lighting behavior independent of or in addition to frequency band-associated lighting behavior as described above and/or sound that is audible to users in proximity of the playback device and/or the light source. Additional information about transmitting data using sound can be found in U.S. Pub. No. 2019/0237091 titled &#x201c;A Method and System for Acoustic Communication of Data&#x201d; and U.S. Pub. No. 2019/0253154 titled &#x201c;Method and System for Acoustic Communication of Data,&#x201d; each of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Other examples are also possible.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">d. Lighting Behavior Based on Types of Audio &#x26; Context</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In another aspect, lighting behavior may be based on one or more of (i) foreground audio, (ii) background audio, or (iii) contextual information. Foreground audio as referred to herein may be audio content that is played back by a playback device. Such audio may include, as some non-limiting examples, music (e.g., an audio track, a playlist, etc.), a podcast, an audio soundtrack accompanying video content, among other possibilities. Background audio as referred to herein may be ambient noise that is detected by the playback device. Such background audio may include, as some non-limiting examples, people talking, water running, dishes clanking, among other possibilities. Contextual information as referred to herein may be general information that is available to the playback device. Such information may include, as some non-limiting examples, a time of day, weather information (e.g., the weather forecast in a geographical location, such as the geographical location of the playback device), calendar information (e.g., meetings, appointments, and/or other calendar events available from a calendar service that is integrated with or otherwise accessible to the playback device), ambient lighting information (e.g., information about light source(s) in proximity of the playback device and/or light source(s) about which the playback device has information or is otherwise able to communicate with), task lists (e.g., to-do lists, grocery lists, etc.), among other possibilities. In some instances, contextual information may include background audio, such as ambient noise (e.g., presence of people based on detecting the sound of people talking, presence of animals based on detecting animal sounds, etc.) ambient audio (e.g., detecting music or television input in the background, etc.). Further, contextual information may be received and/or transmitted in various ways, including via a wired connection, over a local area network, over a wide area network, over a Bluetooth connection, via cloud-based integration, or via ultrasonic transmission, among other possibilities. Based on detecting the (i) foreground audio, (ii) background audio, and/or (iii) contextual information, the playback device may determine given lighting behavior that is to be implemented by one or more lighting device(s) and then cause the lighting device(s) to implement the determined lighting behavior.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Lighting behavior based on foreground audio may take various forms. As one possibility, lighting behavior may be based on the type of audio content that is being played back. For example, audio content that is identified as music (e.g., a playlist, an audio track) may be associated with a given animation, whereas audio content that is identified as a podcast may be associated with a given lighting effect or scene that creates a particular mood based on the genre of the podcast. As another possibility, lighting behavior may be based on the audio characteristics of the audio content. For example, different colors, graphic patterns, and/or rhythmic patterns may be produced based on the tempo or beats per minute of the audio content. Further, the speed of transitions between lighting behaviors (e.g., transitioning from one brightness level to another brightness level, transitioning from one color to another color, transitioning from one type of animation to another type of animation, etc.) may also match or otherwise correspond to the audio characteristics of the audio content.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In this regard, different transition modes may dictate different levels or degrees at which lighting behavior transitions are synced with, delayed by, or responsive to audio characteristics. As one example, lighting behavior transitions may be synced with audio characteristics, such as the beats per minute or tempo of the audio content. As another example, lighting behavior transitions may be based on a range of responsiveness to audio characteristics. The range of responsiveness may be predetermined based on default settings or may be selected based on user input received via a controller device. As one possibility, transitions may be set to a first mode, such as a &#x201c;vibrant&#x201d; mode, where the lighting behavior is lively and highly responsive to the audio characteristics. For instance, the lighting behavior may match the rhythm of the audio content. Lighting behavior in this mode may produce vibrant colors, high levels of brightness, and/or quick transitions. As another possibility, transitions may be set to a second mode, such as a &#x201c;relaxed&#x201d; mode, where the lighting behavior is tranquil and less responsive to the audio characteristics. For instance, the lighting behavior may respond at a reduced rhythm level (e.g., if the audio content has a rhythm of 90 beats per minute, the lighting behavior may respond as if the audio content had a rhythm of 45 beats per minute). Lighting behavior in this mode may produce softer, muter colors, lower levels of brightness, and/or slower transitions (e.g., cross-fade).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In some implementations, each mode of responsiveness may be associated with a playlist of lighting behaviors that dictates the level of sync, delay, and/or responsiveness to audio characteristics. In some implementations, the range of responsiveness may be adjusted using a spectrum or sliding scale (e.g., adjusted based on user input provided via a controller device). Lighting behavior based on foreground audio may take other forms as well.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Lighting behavior based on background audio may take various forms. As one possibility, the vibrancy of the lighting behavior may be based on the activity level of the background audio. For example, if the background audio is loud and indicates high activity, the lighting behavior may be lively and energetic, producing vibrant colors, higher brightness levels, and/or fast animations and transitions, whereas if the background audio is soft and indicates low activity, the lighting behavior may be tranquil, producing muted colors, lower brightness levels, and/or slower animations and transitions. Furthermore, the presence of background audio may be reflected by specific lighting behavior. For instance, when background audio is detected (e.g., detected by a microphone of the playback device), the lighting behavior may include a given effect or animation that specifically indicates background audio, such as a given shape, color, and/or animation that may respond to changes in the background audio. For example, such lighting behavior may take the form of a blue circle animation that speeds up or slows down in response to a detected increase or decrease in the background audio. Lighting behavior based on background audio may take other forms as well.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Lighting behavior based on contextual information may take various forms. As one possibility, lighting behavior may be based on timing information. For instance, lighting behavior may be directly correlated to the time of day. For example, based on detecting timing indicating sunrise, corresponding lighting behavior may take the form of displaying bright (or increasingly brightening) lighting effects, scenes, and/or animations. As another example, based on detecting nighttime, lighting behavior may take the form of displaying soft lighting effects, scenes, and/or animations. Conversely, lighting behavior may be indirectly correlated to the time of day. For example, based on detecting sunrise, lighting behavior may take the form of decreasing any ongoing lighting effects, scenes, and/or animations, and based on detecting sundown, lighting behavior may take the form of displaying bright lighting effects, scenes, and/or animations. Timing information may be further informed via a sensor component of the playback device, such as a daylight sensor that correlates to a generative music engine. Additional information about generative music engines may be found in U.S. Nonprovisional application Ser. No. 17/140,361, filed Jan. 4, 2021, and titled &#x201c;Generative Music Based on User Location,&#x201d; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/198,866, filed Nov. 18, 2020, and titled &#x201c;Algorithmically Generated Media Content Playback via one or more Devices,&#x201d; each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">As another possibility, lighting behavior may be based on a current operation mode or audio scene of the playback device. For example, if the playback device is set to a &#x201c;sleep&#x201d; mode or is implementing a sleep-related audio scene, lighting behavior may comprise softer colors, tranquil scenes, and/or slow animations. Additional information regarding scene systems and operation modes may be found in U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/114,931 entitled, &#x201c;Playback Roles for Layering of Audio,&#x201d; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/190,638 entitled, &#x201c;Dedicated Controls for Targeted Audio Experience,&#x201d; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In such instances, lighting behavior may further be adjusted based on user input. For example, using a controller device, user input may be provided to restrict lighting behavior to a given color pallet, given scene options, and/or given animation speeds when reacting to a given operation mode or audio scene. Additional information regarding scene systems may be found in U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/114,931 entitled, &#x201c;Playback Roles for Layering of Audio,&#x201d; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/190,638 entitled, &#x201c;Dedicated Controls for Targeted Audio Experience,&#x201d; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">As yet another possibility, lighting behavior may be based on information about a light source. For example, the type of light source, the light source's respective color temperature, and/or the light source's respective location may indicate a given use/purpose, and lighting behavior may be based on such an indicated use/purpose (e.g., a multi-bulb floor lamp in the living room may indicate the need for bright light, whereas a single-bulb reading lamp in the bedroom may indicate a need for ambient, localized light).</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Still, as another possibility, lighting behavior may be based on a combination of audio and contextual information. As one example, based on detecting audio content playback and/or background audio such as running water in the sink and cooking sounds at a playback device located in the kitchen, the playback device may infer that a user is cooking in the kitchen. Accordingly, the playback device may, in addition to playing back audio content, cause one or more light sources located in the kitchen to turn on and/or engage in other lighting behavior to facilitate visibility in the kitchen. Additional information about inferring activity based on noise detection can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 10,871,943 titled &#x201c;Noise Classification for Event Detection,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As another example, based on detecting playback of an alarm, lighting behavior may take the form of displaying bright (or increasingly brightening) lighting effects, scenes, and/or animations or displaying certain lighting effects, scenes, and/or animations that correspond to the alarm. As yet another example, lighting behavior may be based on user location and intensity of sound (e.g., audio playback and/or ambient audio) that is detected in the user's proximity. For example, if a playback device is playing back audio and determines that a user is not within close proximity, the playback device may infer that the user is not within the location of the playback device and/or the light source and may thus cause lighting behavior to take the form of softer light, whereas if the playback device determines that the user is within close proximity, the playback device may infer that the user is within the location of the playback device and/or the light source and may thus cause lighting behavior to take the form of brighter light. Other examples are also possible.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">e. Activity-Focused Lighting Behavior</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In some implementations, certain aspects of lighting behavior may each be based on different types of audio and/or contextual information. As one possibility, certain aspects of lighting behavior may be adjusted based on a user command. For example, while a light source (e.g., an LED grid, a set of multiple lights distributed throughout a room) is engaged in given lighting behavior (e.g., displaying a given brightness level, color, and animation) based on audio playback, a user may issue a command (e.g., a voice input command or a command input via a controller device) to focus lights on the user. The command may be detected by a playback device that is configured to communicate with the light source. Based on detecting the command to focus lights on the user and the location of the user relative to the playback device, the playback device may cause the light source to adjust its light coverage to focus in on the user, such as by brightening those lights closer to the user and dimming those lights further away from the user and/or by orienting the lights toward the user's direction. Notably, other lighting behavior, such as animations, that was previously being displayed may continue uninterrupted.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">As another possibility, certain aspects of lighting behavior may be adjusted in response to contextual information. For instance, while a light source (e.g., an LED grid, a set of multiple lights distributed throughout a room) is performing given lighting behavior (e.g., displaying a given brightness level, color, and animation) based on audio playback, a playback device may detect contextual information and adjust certain lighting behavior accordingly. For example, a user may be engaged in a virtual performance (e.g., live streaming a concert) whereby audio content is playing and corresponding lighting behavior is being displayed in the user's background (e.g., a playback device associated with the user is playing audio content and causing a light source to display given lighting behavior based on the audio playback). The playback device may detect incoming chats on the livestream platform via a communicatively coupled controller device. Based on detecting keywords, reactions, and/or metadata in the incoming chats, the playback device may cause the light source to adjust certain aspects of its lighting behavior in response to the detected keywords, reactions, and/or metadata while continuing to display the other aspects of its lighting behavior uninterrupted.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">As yet another possibility, while operating in a first mode (e.g., a default playback mode), the playback device may monitor for voice input and/or background audio in order to take action to adjust lighting behavior in accordance with the detected voice input and/or background audio. For example, while playing back audio content, a playback device in the kitchen may detect sounds corresponding to a fridge door opening and closing and dinnerware being taken out of a cabinet. The playback device may thus infer that a user plans to eat and may thus cause one or more kitchen lights to turn on. As another example, a playback device in a hallway leading to a bedroom may detect a voice command to turn on the hallway light. Thus, the playback device may cause the hallway light to turn on and may further cause additional lights, such as the bedroom lights, to turn on as well in anticipation of the user walking through the hallway and into the bedroom.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">f. Lighting Behavior Based on Connected Devices</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some implementations, lighting behavior may be based on settings of a computing device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc.) that is communicatively coupled to a playback device that is configured to communicate with a light source. As one possibility, lighting behavior may be based on one or more settings of the computing device. For example, the playback device may determine that a blue light filter setting of the computing device is turned on and may thus cause the light source to display a blue-hued lighting effect.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some implementations, lighting behavior may be based on media content that is being played back on a computing device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc.) that is communicatively coupled to a playback device that is configured to communicate with a light source. As one possibility, lighting behavior may be based on media content that is being played back on the computing device. For example, the playback device may detect that a user is streaming media content (e.g., watching a movie or listening to a song) on the computing device and may determine one or more colors associated with the media content (e.g., colors based on art associated with the movie or album art associated with the song) based on, for example, available metadata associated with the media content, among other possibilities. In turn, the playback device may cause the light source to display a lighting effect and/or animation based on the determined colors associated with the media content.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">As another possibility, lighting behavior may be based on different audio channels of audio content that is being played back on the computing device. For instance, a user may be watching an instructional video on the computing device, such as a yoga video. The playback device may monitor the audio stream associated with the video to detect certain keywords and/or determine certain audio channels of the audio stream. Additionally, or alternatively, the playback device may obtain information about the video and associated audio stream via available metadata, separate protocol, and/or a sub-band including information regarding control signals that the playback device may use to implement lighting behavior. Based on the detected keywords and/or determined audio channels, the playback device may cause the light source to implement given lighting behavior. For example, the playback device may detect that the audio stream directs the user to &#x201c;look to your left&#x201d; and may thus cause the light source to direct light toward the user's left side, such as by brightening lights on the user's left side and dimming all other lights. As another example, the playback device may detect keywords that depict certain scenes and cause the light source to implement given lighting behavior to mimic the scene. For instance, the playback device may detect the word &#x201c;sunshine&#x201d; in the audio stream and thus cause the light source to produce a lighting effect reflecting colors associated with sunshine and/or morning, and may additionally play back morning sounds, such as birds chirping. As yet another example, the playback device may detect action trigger words&#x2014;such as &#x201c;inhale&#x201d; and &#x201c;exhale&#x201d;&#x2014;and cause the light source to implement lighting behavior that mimics or guides the action. For example, based on the &#x201c;inhale&#x201d; action trigger word, the playback device may cause the light source to display a brightening lighting effect and/or a &#x201c;rising&#x201d; animation, and based on the &#x201c;exhale&#x201d; action trigger word, the playback device may cause the light source to display a dimming lighting effect and/or a &#x201c;lowering&#x201d; animation. In this way, the playback device may control, customize, and/or adapt lighting experiences within a user's home either in real-time or based on pre-determined information. Other examples are also possible.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">As yet another possibility, lighting and/or listening experiences may be shared across different households, either live or asynchronously. This may be done using a streaming service that enables sharing of not only audiovisual content (e.g., music, exercise classes, concerts, grouped video watching, etc.), but also lighting experience. For example, a streaming service (e.g., Sonos HD Radio) that can communicate with a remote computing device associated with the playback device may be able to access information about lighting behavior of one or more light sources with which the playback device is configured to communicate. A user of the playback device may then be able to broadcast, via a GUI displayed on a controller device associated with the playback device, a given listening and lighting experience with other users of the streaming service in different households such that users in different homes can participate in a same audiovisual experience.
