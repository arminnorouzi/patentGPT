No. 16/606,706, filed Oct. 18, 2019, which is a U.S. National Phase Application under 35 U. S.C. &#xa7; 371 of International Application No. PCT/GB2018/051031, filed on Apr. 19, 2018, which claims the benefit of priority to GB Patent Application No. 1706390.0, filed on Apr. 21, 2017, which are each incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for any and all purposes.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for assembling a wind turbine and a wind turbine system. The invention also relates to a vessel, such as a ship, that can be used to transport a rotor-nacelle assembly; an elevator carriage for a wind turbine; and a method for servicing a wind turbine.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Installing wind turbines is a high risk, high cost element of every wind energy project, particularly offshore wind projects. How this is carried out, the equipment used, the processes and the planning are key to meeting project programmes and budgets.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Offshore wind projects are now being developed at greater capacities on sites further away from shore and in deeper waters, using larger turbines. These developments pose additional technical challenges for their cost effective installation as well as for servicing and replacing major components during the operational life of the project.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To date the development trajectory for the installation of offshore turbines has been to deploy ever larger jack up crane vessels with the capacity to operate in deeper waters, but they are very expensive and there is a limit to the maximum water depth which is technically and commercially feasible. In some areas now being developed, coastal water depths quickly exceed the current 60 m limit for jack up vessels and it is impractical to use this method of installation. The alternative solution of using a large semi-submersible crane vessel is even more expensive than jack up vessels and less available.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also, due to changeable weather conditions offshore, and the impact of wind and waves on the installation process, there is often a relatively short period of time available for installing wind turbines. Wind and waves in particular can cause difficulties when transferring a rotor-nacelle assembly from the vessel to the tower and shortens further the window of opportunity for installation. Accordingly it is desirable to have an improved means for transferring the rotor-nacelle assembly to the tower that mitigates the effect of wind and waves on the vessel to some extent.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Similar problems occur for installing wind turbines on land. Larger towers can make it difficult to raise and mount the rotor-nacelle assembly on to the tower and there is a strong desire to increase the speed with which a wind turbine is installed to improve the economics of the windfarm. There are also difficulties in accessing turbines for the purposes of maintenance and repair.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly a new approach is needed for the transport, installation and servicing of the turbines.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To address some of these issues, it has been proposed to use an elevator system to raise a rotor-nacelle assembly from the base of a tower to the top of the tower and rotate the rotor-nacelle assembly into position, for example see U.S. Pat. No. 6,888,264 and US2012/0328442. These arrangements are intended for land based wind turbines, however an integrated transfer system from the delivery vehicle to the top of the tower has not been satisfactorily resolved. In these examples an elevator carriage is attached to rails at the base of the tower. A nacelle is attached to the elevator carriage, a rotor is mounted on top of the nacelle to complete the rotor-nacelle assembly. The rotor hub faces generally upwards. Thus the nacelle has a generally vertical orientation. The rotor blades have a generally horizontal orientation. The elevator then lifts the rotor-nacelle assembly to the top of the tower and rotates the rotor-nacelle assembly through approximately 90 degrees. The turbine is fixed in place to the top of the tower. This method has been proposed in the context of onshore towers since it is possible to deliver component parts by lorry, and provide cranes to undertake an on-site assembly process to construct the rotor-nacelle assembly, however the method is less suitable for use in the context of offshore towers where it is much more difficult to undertake an on-site assembly process. Also, due to the effect of wind and waves and poor weather conditions, there is usually a very limited time frame for assembling wind turbines and therefore the elevator concept needs to be recast in order to make the general approach better suited to offshore contexts.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further problem with the known systems, is the manner in which the rotor-nacelle assembly is supported by the elevator carriage. The manner in which the rotor-nacelle assembly is supported by the elevator carriage has a significant effect in the magnitude of driving force required in order to rotate the nacelle from a vertical orientation to a horizontal orientation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further problem with known systems, is that the majority of towers have a narrower top than base. Accordingly elevator rails mounted on to the tower may have a larger gap between them towards the base of the tower and a smaller gap between them at the top of the tower. Any drive system used by the elevator may account for this issue.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Of course, while any such refinements are mainly directed to the offshore context, it will be appreciated by the skilled person that the refinements may also be applicable to onshore wind farms.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly the present invention seeks to provide a method for assembling a wind turbine and wind turbine system that mitigates at least one of the aforementioned problems, or at least provides an alternative to existing systems.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method for assembling a wind turbine, including: attaching an elevator carriage to a nacelle to form a carriage-nacelle assembly; and mounting the carriage-nacelle assembly on to the tower.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention provides a pre-assembled carriage-nacelle assembly (with or without a rotor), that is mounted on to the side of the tower as a unit. That is, the nacelle is mounted on to the tower after the elevator carriage is attached to the nacelle. This speeds up the assembly process on site. The invention can be used for onshore and offshore wind turbines. The invention is particularly applicable to offshore wind turbines since there is often a limited window of opportunity for assembling wind turbines due to changeable weather conditions. The invention provides a new solution not only for transporting and installing rotor-nacelle assemblies, but also facilitates servicing wind turbines, with the purpose making both the installation and servicing faster, safer and more economic than both present crane systems and any proposed elevator system. It allows the rotor-nacelle assembly of the turbine to be installed and removed without the requirement for a large crane vessel and within short weather windows. The invention is particularly competitive where turbines are installed in deep waters and/or in locations far from shore. This matches the current growth in offshore wind development in many parts of the world which is increasingly moving towards both deeper water and further offshore. The invention is increasingly desirable as turbines become larger and are mounted on taller towers. This is because larger turbines require special equipment to install them, such as taller cranes, larger vessels, etc. This special equipment requires more investment to install the wind farm, which increases risk. It also means that there is likely to be less specialist equipment available to install wind farms.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The method can include transporting the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly to the tower as a unit. For example, the carriage-nacelle assembly can be assembled at a manufacturing site and is then transported as a unit to the wind turbine tower. Alternatively, the nacelle, a rotor hub, rotor blades and elevator carriage can be transported as separate component parts to the tower. For a land based tower, the nacelle, rotor hub, rotor blades and elevator carriage can be transported to the tower by lorry. At least the carriage and nacelle are preassembled into a carriage-nacelle assembly prior to attaching to the tower.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The method can include attaching a rotor to the nacelle, and mounting the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly to the tower. Thus the method provides for mounting a carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly to the tower as a unit. That is, the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly is manufactured prior to mounting the assembly to the tower. This is the preferred method for offshore installations.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The tower can be located offshore, and the method includes transporting the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, by a vessel, such as a ship, to the tower, and transferring the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, from the vessel to the tower. In preferred embodiments the vessel is essentially a conventional ship that has been modified to transport at least one assembly. That is, according to the invention, the vessel does not have to be a jack up crane vessel or a large semi-submersible crane vessel.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The vessel can include a platform system for transferring the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, from the vessel to an offshore wind turbine tower. In preferred embodiments the platform system, includes: a movable platform, a control system, at least one actuator and at least one sensor, wherein the control system is arranged to automatically control operation of the at least one actuator to adjust the orientation of the movable platform in response to signals received from the at least one sensor. The control system is arranged to account for movement of the vessel, for example caused by wind and waves during a transfer. Thus the platform system automatically adjusts the orientation of the movable platform while transferring the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, from the vessel to the offshore tower. The movable platform control system controls positioning of the platform such that the platform is held substantially motionless relative to the tower irrespective of the motion of the vessel to which it is attached. This accounts for motion of the vessel during a transfer.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The method can include mounting the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, on a movable support located on the vessel, using the movable support to move the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, from a storage position to the movable platform, and transferring the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, from the movable platform to the tower. The movable support is mounted on rails. In preferred embodiments the movable support is movable along the vessel in a longitudinal direction. The movable platform can be mounted towards one end of the vessel, and preferably towards the stern of the vessel. In some embodiments the movable platform can be mounted towards a longitudinal side of the vessel, for example towards the port or starboard side of the vessel. The movable platform can be arranged as a gang plank such that it overhangs an edge of the vessel. A ramp or elevator can be provided for raising the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, to the height of the platform.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The method can include mounting the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly on the vessel on a movable support. Preferably the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly is mounted on the movable support such that the rotor hub faces downwards towards the hull of the vessel. The rotor blades protrude substantially horizontally outwards from the hub. The movable support supports the hub. The movable support can include a wheeled undercarriage. The wheeled undercarriage is mounted on rails attached to the vessel deck. The movable support can include a slidable uppercarriage support. The uppercarriage support is mounted on the wheeled undercarriage. The uppercarriage support is arranged to slide on rails attached to the undercarriage. The uppercarriage support includes a base and upwardly protruding arms that are arranged to receive and support the rotor hub.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The method can include supporting ends of rotor blades with straps. The straps are fixed to an upper most end of the nacelle and are tensioned. The straps prevent undue movement of the rotors during transport and increase the clearance between blade tips and the sea surface when mounted on the vessel.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The method can include initially mounting the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, on to a first side of the tower at a first position. Preferably the first position is located towards a lower end of the tower.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The method can include mounting the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly on to the tower at the first position in an orientation wherein the rotor hub faces generally downwards towards the ground or sea. The rotor blades protrude substantially horizontally outwards from the hub. Mounting the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly to the tower in this orientation is advantageous when it is necessary to pivot the nacelle into position at the top of the tower since the carriage is able to support the nacelle closer to its centre of gravity, which makes the pivoting process easier.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The tower can include at least one support formation. The carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, can include at least one support formation. The method includes engaging the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, support formation(s) with the tower support formation(s), thereby supporting the weight of the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, on the first side of the tower. In preferred embodiments the tower includes a plurality of support formations and the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, includes a plurality of support formations. Preferably the support formations are located towards a lower end of the tower. Preferably the support formations are located on the first side of the tower. It will be appreciated that the support formations can comprise many shapes and arrangements, for example lugs, locating pins, hooks, male and female recessed mating members. The purpose of the support formations is to provide an initial engagement between the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, and the tower, and to support the weight of the carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, until the elevator carriage engages with rails formed on the tower.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, can be mounted to the tower with approximately zero acceleration. The carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, is very heavy, typically in the region of 400 to 700 tons. The carriage-nacelle assembly, or carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly, is therefore mounted on to the tower at very low speed and at minimal acceleration.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The tower can include at least one elevator rail arranged along the length of the tower. The rails can be included in newly manufactured towers. The rails can be retro-fitted to existing wind turbine towers for example for maintenance purposes, or for replacing an existing rotor-nacelle assembly with a new rotor-nacelle assembly.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The elevator carriage can include means for releasably engaging the rail(s).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The means for releasably engaging the rail(s) can include at least one adjustable bearing arranged to selectively engage the rail(s).

Two sets of the roller bearings <b>41</b> engage a first rail <b>21</b><i>a </i>and two sets of the roller bearings <b>41</b> engage a second rail <b>21</b><i>b</i>. The roller bearings <b>41</b> are located on an underside <b>43</b> of the chassis, that is, a side that faces towards the tower <b>3</b> when the carriage <b>27</b> is attached to the tower. The roller bearings <b>41</b> engage an outermost surface <b>45</b> of the rails. The rail attachment system <b>31</b> includes four sets of adjustable roller bearings <b>47</b> for selectively engaging the rails <b>21</b>. Two sets of the adjustable roller bearings <b>47</b> selectively engage the first rail <b>21</b><i>a </i>and two sets of the adjustable roller bearings <b>47</b> selectively engage the second rail <b>21</b><i>b</i>. The adjustable roller bearings <b>47</b> are located on the underside <b>43</b> of the chassis. Each adjustable roller bearing <b>47</b> comprises a pair of curved arms <b>51</b>. Each arm <b>51</b> is pivotally attached to the chassis <b>29</b> towards one end. Sets of rollers <b>53</b> are located towards a free end of each arm <b>51</b>.

The drive source <b>55</b> is arranged to rotate the gears <b>57</b> either directly or via a transmission. As the gears <b>57</b>,<b>59</b> rotate the carriage <b>27</b> moves along the rails <b>21</b><i>a</i>,<b>21</b><i>b</i>. The drive system <b>33</b> includes a ratchet arrangement to prevent the carriage <b>27</b> from falling down the tower <b>3</b>, for example in the event of a power failure. The ratchet is releasable to enable the carriage <b>27</b> to move down the tower. In preferred arrangements, the drive system <b>33</b> is arranged to selectively engage the rails <b>21</b><i>a</i>,<b>21</b><i>b</i>. For example, the drive system <b>33</b> can include a controller and actuators for controlling operation of the first and second drive units <b>56</b>. The actuators are arranged to move the gears <b>57</b>,<b>59</b> into and out of engagement with their respective teeth <b>23</b><i>a</i>,<b>25</b><i>a</i>,<b>23</b><i>b</i>,<b>25</b><i>b</i>, in response to control signals from the controller. Thus the gears <b>57</b>,<b>59</b> can be in a disengaged position as the carriage <b>27</b> is mounted onto the tower <b>3</b> and can be moved into an engaged position to drive the carriage along the rails <b>21</b><i>a</i>,<b>21</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The carriage <b>27</b> includes carriage support formations <b>39</b>. The carriage support formations <b>39</b> are arranged to engage with the support formations <b>20</b> on the tower <b>3</b>, when the carriage-turbine assembly is initially attached to the tower <b>3</b>. The tower support formations <b>20</b> are arranged to support the weight of the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>9</b>,<b>11</b> until the rail attachment system <b>31</b> engages the rails and the drive system <b>33</b> is engaged.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The connector assembly <b>35</b> includes arms <b>58</b> that protrude upwards from the chassis <b>29</b>. The arms <b>58</b> are inclined to the plane of the chassis. The arms <b>59</b> protrude beyond a leading edge <b>61</b> of the chassis. A pivot pin <b>63</b> connects arms <b>58</b> with receiving formations <b>65</b> on the nacelle casing, or on a separate adaptor plate (not shown), which can be secured between a yaw bearing and a tower top flange. Thus the rotor-nacelle assembly <b>11</b>,<b>9</b> is pivotally attached to the carriage chassis <b>29</b>. Preferably the receiving formations <b>65</b> are located at approximately the centre of gravity of the rotor-nacelle assembly <b>11</b>,<b>9</b>. This reduces the force required in order to pivot the rotor-nacelle assembly <b>11</b>,<b>9</b> with respect to the chassis <b>27</b>. The driver <b>37</b> preferably comprises a linear driver, for example a hydraulic ram. The length of the linear driver <b>37</b> is adjustable, and is typically telescopically adjustable. A controller is provided to controllably adjust the length of the linear driver, for example a hydraulic controller. The driver <b>37</b> is pivotally attached to the chassis <b>27</b> towards a first end <b>67</b> of the linear driver. The second end <b>69</b> of the linear driver is arranged to engage with the nacelle <b>9</b> or hub <b>13</b> in order to pivot the rotor-nacelle assembly <b>11</b>,<b>9</b> with respect to the chassis <b>27</b>. This is achieved by adjusting the length of the linear driver <b>37</b> at the appropriate time.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The carriage <b>27</b> is attached to the rotor-nacelle assembly <b>11</b>,<b>9</b> prior to mounting the assembly <b>11</b>,<b>9</b> on to a side of the tower <b>3</b>. This enables a fast assembly time, which is particularly important for offshore wind farms where changeable weather can provide limited windows of opportunity for assembling the wind turbines. In particular, the carriage <b>27</b> is releasably attached to the nacelle <b>9</b> by means of the pivot pin <b>63</b>. By removing the pivot pin <b>63</b>, either manually or by means of an actuator, the carriage <b>27</b> is separable from the rotor-nacelle assembly <b>11</b>,<b>9</b> when the nacelle <b>9</b> is located at the top <b>19</b> of the tower. This enables the carriage <b>27</b> to return to the bottom of the tower for reuse.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The carriage <b>27</b> also includes alignment sensors to assist with mounting the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>11</b>,<b>9</b> on to the tower <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">For offshore wind farms, the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>11</b>,<b>9</b> is transported to the tower <b>3</b> by ship <b>71</b>. The ship <b>71</b> is essentially a conventional ship that has been modified to transport at least one, and typically two or three, carriage-rotor-nacelle assemblies <b>27</b>,<b>11</b>,<b>9</b>. That is, according to the invention, the ship does not have to be a crane vessel type ship that is capable of raising its hull out of the water or a semi-submersible crane vessel.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Each carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>11</b>,<b>9</b> is mounted on an individual movable support <b>73</b> on the deck of the ship. The carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>11</b>,<b>9</b> is supported by the movable support <b>73</b> in a manner such that the rotor hub <b>13</b> faces generally downwards towards the ship deck and the rotors <b>11</b> are arranged substantially horizontally. The movable support <b>73</b> supports the hub <b>13</b>. The nacelle <b>9</b> protrudes upwardly from the hub <b>13</b>. The movable support <b>73</b> is mounted on rails <b>75</b>. The movable support <b>73</b>, and hence the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>11</b>,<b>9</b> mounted thereon, is movable along the rails <b>75</b>. The rails <b>75</b> guide the movable support <b>73</b> and the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>11</b>,<b>9</b> to a transfer site.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The movable support <b>73</b> includes a wheeled undercarriage <b>74</b>.

The platform system <b>77</b> includes a movable platform <b>79</b>, a control system, actuators <b>83</b> such as hydraulic rams, and sensors. The control system is arranged to automatically control operation of the actuators <b>83</b> to adjust the orientation of the movable platform <b>79</b> in response to signals received from the sensors to account for movement of the ship caused by wind and waves while transferring the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>11</b>,<b>9</b> from the ship <b>71</b> to the tower <b>3</b>. The control system adjusts the orientation of the movable platform <b>79</b> seeking to maintain the platform <b>79</b> in a substantially horizontal orientation, irrespective of the orientation of the ship's deck. The movable platform control system controls positioning of the platform such that the platform is held substantially motionless relative to the tower irrespective of the motion of the vessel to which it is attached. This accounts for motion of the vessel during a transfer. Typically the system includes 3 to 6 actuators <b>83</b>.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The movable platform <b>79</b> can be located towards one end of the ship <b>71</b>, and preferably towards the stern of the ship.

As the carriage <b>27</b> moves up the rails <b>21</b><i>a</i>,<b>21</b><i>b </i>the blade <b>15</b> enters into the aperture <b>93</b>. The carriage <b>27</b> can be locked off at the appropriate height along the rails to enable maintenance workers to inspect the rotor. The platform can be used to provide personnel access to the nacelle and for the transport of equipment and spare parts. With a suitable arrangement of the nacelle this could be used as a working platform to replace major components. Preferably the platform includes a safety rail <b>98</b>.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The platform can include maintenance equipment such as a crane <b>94</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b><i>b </i>and <b>14</b><i>c</i></figref>). Carriage supports <b>96</b> are provided to hold the platform in place.

This will lower risk and costs over the operational lifetime of a typical project.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0155">Improved safety: reduced number of complex lifting operations and simplifies operations and maintenance on major components.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0153" num="0156">Overall, these factors combine to result in a substantial saving in the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCoE) for a typical offshore wind farm, as well as a more efficient and safer installation and maintenance operations.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0157">Although the present invention has been described in connection with specific preferred embodiments, it should be understood that the invention as claimed should not be unduly limited to such specific embodiments. Furthermore, it will be apparent to the skilled person that modifications can be made to the above embodiment that fall within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0158">For example, the carriage <b>27</b> can be used to transfer the rotor-nacelle assembly <b>11</b>,<b>9</b> on to the ship <b>71</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0156" num="0159">The ship <b>71</b> can include an elevator <b>95</b> for lifting the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>11</b>,<b>9</b> to the level of the movable platform <b>79</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>). The elevator <b>95</b> can be used in addition, or as an alternative, to the ramp <b>85</b>.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0160">The movable platform <b>79</b> can be mounted at the side of the ship, for example to a port or starboard side of the ship (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0161">The rails <b>21</b><i>a</i>,<b>21</b><i>b </i>on the tower can be arranged and fixed to the tower wall in various ways to optimise manufacturing and to have minimum effect on the dynamics and long-term operation of the tower. For example, the pair of rails <b>21</b><i>a</i>,<b>21</b><i>b </i>can be replaced with a single rail. The single rail can have a T-shaped cross-section. The carriage <b>27</b> can include stabilizers for maintaining the orientation of the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>11</b>,<b>9</b> with respect to the tower <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0162">A tripod lattice tower can be used rather than the more conventional tubular tower. T-shaped rails can be fixed onto each leg of the tower and the three &#x2018;faces&#x2019; of the tower provide increased flexibility for the vessel to offload the carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>11</b>,<b>9</b> depending upon weather conditions.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0163">For some towers the distance between the first and second rails <b>21</b><i>a</i>,<b>21</b><i>b </i>is not constant. For example, the distance between the rails <b>21</b><i>a</i>,<b>21</b><i>b </i>may decrease close to the top <b>19</b> of the tower. To allow for the varying distance between the tower rails, the drive units <b>101</b> on the carriage <b>27</b> can be supported on sliding bearings <b>103</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>), so that the distance between the drive units <b>101</b> is adjustable while the carriage moves along the rails. For example, the distance between drive gears <b>105</b> associated with the first rail <b>21</b><i>a </i>and drive gears <b>105</b> associated with the second rail <b>21</b><i>b </i>is adjustable. The distance can be adjusted automatically by an actuator while the carriage moves along the rails. The carriage <b>27</b> can include an arrangement of rods <b>107</b>. The rods <b>107</b> are arranged transversely to the direction of motion of the carriage. The drive units <b>101</b> include the sliding bearings <b>103</b>. The sliding bearings <b>103</b> are mounted on to the rods <b>107</b>. The position of the drive units <b>101</b> with respect to the rods is adjustable.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0164">The drive system <b>33</b> shown is one of many alternative arrangements for a geared linear drive. The drive motors can be hydraulic or electric, transmitting drive torque to the pinion gears either directly or via a step-down transmission system.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0165">Other types of driver <b>37</b> can be used. For example, the driver <b>37</b> for rotating the rotor-nacelle assembly <b>11</b>,<b>9</b> can include at least one electric linear actuator.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0166">The bearings <b>41</b>,<b>47</b> that allow linear movement of the carriage <b>27</b> along the tower rails <b>21</b><i>a</i>,<b>21</b><i>b </i>under load can be sliding bearings, for example PTFE pads.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0167">For onshore wind turbine assembly, the main components of the rotor-nacelle assembly <b>11</b>,<b>9</b> (nacelle <b>9</b>, hub <b>13</b>, and blades <b>15</b>) are generally transported to a site as separate components.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0168">The carriage <b>27</b> can also be transported to site separately.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0169">A carriage-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>9</b> can be assembled on site, by attaching the carriage <b>27</b> to the nacelle <b>9</b>. The carriage-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>9</b> can be mounted onto the tower <b>3</b> with or without the rotor <b>11</b> being attached to the nacelle <b>9</b>. In the latter case, the rotor <b>11</b> is attached to the nacelle <b>9</b> while the carriage-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>9</b> is mounted on the tower to produce a carriage-rotor-nacelle assembly <b>27</b>,<b>11</b>,<b>9</b>.
