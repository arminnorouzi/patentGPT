HPV associated aerodigestive precancerous lesions and malignancies may occur in the oropharynx, larynx, and upper respiratory tract. While the role of HPV6 in the etiology of a majority of aerodigestive malignancies remains unclear, its role is widely accepted as being causally implicated in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) (Mounts et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. </i>1982; 79(17):5425-9; Gissmann et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. </i>1983; 80(2):560-3; Bonagura et al., <i>APMIS. </i>2010; 118(6-7):455-70), the most common benign tumor of the laryngeal epithelium. RRP is rare, with an incidence rate estimated at 1.8 per 100,000 adults in the United States (Winton et al., <i>The New England journal of medicine. </i>2005; 352(25):2589-97). Although most lesions are benign, some undergo malignant transformation, and patients with RRP have a higher risk of developing laryngeal neoplasias and carcinomas (Omland et al., <i>PloS one. </i>2014; 9(6):e99114).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The clinical course of RRP can vary widely amongst affected individuals. Selection of treatment, including active monitoring without treatment, surgery, radiation therapy, or a combination, depends on a number of factors. Usually, repeated surgical removal of papillomas for symptomatic management remains the mainstay of treatment (Derkay et al., <i>Otolaryngol Clin North Am. </i>2019; 52(4):669-79). In a few cases, malignant transformation may occur, which is usually associated with a dismal prognosis. A few such patients with malignant disease may be candidates for salvage therapies, including potentially definitive surgery (Richey et al., <i>Otolaryngology&#x2014;head and neck surgery: official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology</i>-<i>Head and Neck Surgery. </i>2007; 136(1):98-103). Selected patients in this setting may benefit from radiation although the morbidity of this approach is substantial (Mendenhall et al., <i>American journal of clinical oncology. </i>2008; 31(4):393-8). Recently, a Phase II study of pembrolizumab in patients with RRP demonstrated a response rate of 43%, and supports a rationale for immunotherapeutic management of RRP (Pai et al., <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology. </i>2019; 37(15_suppl):2502).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a need in the art for improved compositions and methods for treatment or prevention of RRP. The present invention satisfies this unmet need.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects of the invention provide compositions comprising at least one nucleotide sequence comprising an HPV6 E6-E7 fusion antigen, and uses thereof for the treatment or prevention of RRP.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect provides compositions comprising one or more nucleotide sequences encoding an HPV6 E6-E7 fusion antigen selected from the group consisting of: nucleotide sequence that encodes SEQ ID NO:2; a nucleotide sequence that is at least 95% homologous to a nucleotide sequence that encodes SEQ ID NO:2; a nucleotide sequence that is at least 95% homologous to a fragment of a nucleotide sequence that encodes SEQ ID NO:2.

Stringent Hybridization Conditions</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">&#x201c;Stringent hybridization conditions&#x201d; as used herein may mean conditions under which a first nucleic acid sequence (e.g., probe) will hybridize to a second nucleic acid sequence (e.g., target), such as in a complex mixture of nucleic acids. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Stringent conditions may be selected to be about 5 10&#xb0; C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength pH. The Tm may be the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH, and nucleic concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium (as the target sequences are present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium). Stringent conditions may be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, such as about 0.01-1.0 M sodium ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30&#xb0; C. for short probes (e.g., about 10-50 nucleotides) and at least about 60&#xb0; C. for long probes (e.g., greater than about 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. For selective or specific hybridization, a positive signal may be at least 2 to 10 times background hybridization. Exemplary stringent hybridization conditions include the following: 50% formamide, 5&#xd7;SSC, and 1% SDS, incubating at 42&#xb0; C., or, 5&#xd7;SSC, 1% SDS, incubating at 65&#xb0; C., with wash in 0.2&#xd7;SSC, and 0.1% SDS at 65&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">m.

Variant may also mean a protein with an amino acid sequence that is substantially identical to a referenced protein with an amino acid sequence that retains at least one biological activity. A conservative substitution of an amino acid, i.e., replacing an amino acid with a different amino acid of similar properties (e.g., hydrophilicity, degree and distribution of charged regions) is recognized in the art as typically involving a minor change. These minor changes can be identified, in part, by considering the hydropathic index of amino acids, as understood in the art. Kyte et al., J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-132 (1982). The hydropathic index of an amino acid is based on a consideration of its hydrophobicity and charge. It is known in the art that amino acids of similar hydropathic indexes can be substituted and still retain protein function. In one aspect, amino acids having hydropathic indexes of &#xb1;2 are substituted. The hydrophilicity of amino acids can also be used to reveal substitutions that would result in proteins retaining biological function. A consideration of the hydrophilicity of amino acids in the context of a peptide permits calculation of the greatest local average hydrophilicity of that peptide, a useful measure that has been reported to correlate well with antigenicity and immunogenicity. U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101, incorporated fully herein by reference. Substitution of amino acids having similar hydrophilicity values can result in peptides retaining biological activity, for example immunogenicity, as is understood in the art. Substitutions may be performed with amino acids having hydrophilicity values within &#xb1;2 of each other. Both the hyrophobicity index and the hydrophilicity value of amino acids are influenced by the particular side chain of that amino acid. Consistent with that observation, amino acid substitutions that are compatible with biological function are understood to depend on the relative similarity of the amino acids, and particularly the side chains of those amino acids, as revealed by the hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, charge, size, and other properties.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">p.

Current treatment of HPV6 related RRP and invasive malignant diseases could potentially be improved with the addition of HPV-specific immunotherapy. Available preventive HPV vaccines can generate neutralizing antibodies against the HPV major capsid protein L1, but they have not demonstrated therapeutic effects on HPV infection or existing lesions and are unlikely to engender a cytolytic T-cell response (Lin et al., <i>Immunologic research. </i>2010; 47(1-3):86-112). HPV-specific immunotherapy, on the other hand, may have therapeutic potential to eliminate preexisting lesions and infections by generating immunity against the HPV virus itself and HPV infected cells. HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins represent ideal targets for this type of therapeutic intervention because of their constitutive expression in HPV associated tumors and their crucial role in the induction and maintenance of HPV associated diseases (Lin et al., <i>Immunologic research. </i>2010; 47(1-3):86-112).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The experiments presented herein examine the efficacy of INO-3106, a DNA plasmid-based immunotherapy targeting E6 and E7 proteins of HPV6, in order to create a robust immune T cell response in order to treat RRP.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In this study, experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of INO-3106, a novel HPV6-specific immunotherapy consisting of synthetic consensus DNA sequences encoding for HPV6 E6 and E7 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), proteins necessary for HPV6 induced transformation of cancers and tumor maintenance. Synthetic DNA plasmids offer several potential advantages as a immunotherapy platform, including the ability to elicit potent immune responses without evidence of genome integration, a favorable safety profile, stability and relative ease in manufacturing (Saha et al., <i>Recent Pat DNA Gene Seq. </i>2011; 5(2):92-6). Preclinical studies of INO-3106 have demonstrated strong and specific immune response to HPV6 in animal models (Shin et al., <i>Human vaccines </i>&#x26; <i>immunotherapeutics. </i>2012; 8(4):470-8). HPV16/18-specific therapy (VGX-3100, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) designed and evaluated based on the same synthetic consensus platform, has demonstrated cellular immune responses that correlated with clinical benefit in the form of dysplastic lesion regression and elimination of HPV16/18 infection and now support late-phase clinical trials targeting HPV16 and 18 associated diseases (Bagarazzi et al., <i>Sci Transl Med. </i>2012; 4(155):155ra38).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Preclinical studies have shown that the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines can be substantially increased by the use of cytokine adjuvants (Chattergoon et al., <i>Vaccine. </i>2004; 22(13-14):1744-50; Hanlon et al., <i>J Virol. </i>2001; 75(18):8424-33; Kim et al., <i>J Interferon Cytokine Res. </i>1998; 18(7):537-47; Kim et al., <i>Eur J Immunol. </i>1998; 28(3):1089-103; Operschall et al., <i>J Clin Virol. </i>1999; 13(1-2):17-27).

As subject 601 was not an RRP patient and has limited data due to death related to non-treatment events, immunology information related to this subject can be found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Cellular immune responses were first addressed by performing an overnight IFN&#x3b3; ELISpot without the addition of supportive cytokines on isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained prior to and following INO-3106 dosing. Results of this assessment suggest that patient 603 showed very low baseline activity to HPV6 E6 and E7 antigens in the form of antigen specific IFN&#x3b3; secretion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Specifically, less than 20 spots per 10<sup>6 </sup>PBMC were noted for the E6 or E7 antigen, whereas patient 604 showed reasonably robust cellular responses against these antigens at study entry, with E6 spot forming units per 10<sup>6 </sup>PBMC approaching 150 spots and E7 exceeding 50 spots (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0156">Treatment with INO-3106 increased HPV6 E6 and E7 specific cellular responses above baseline in patient 603, including total response to HPV6 antigens exceeding 50 spots. Patient 604 did not show an elevation in IFN&#x3b3; spots in response to treatment but (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Of the responding patients, time to peak response varied and was difficult to accurately assess. Specifically, death occurred in patient 601 due to non-treatment related events after the fourth dose of INO-3106, thus no post-treatment follow-up was available and peak response was noted after the third dose. Patient 603 showed a peak response 6 months following their final dose of INO-3106, which may be related to changes in viral activation/antigenic target expression during that time or may reflect the kinetics of the patient's immune system to continue to build and support a large pool of HPV6 specific T cells.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0157">It has been shown previously that the production of IFN&#x3b3; is suggestive of a Th1 immune response but does not correlate 1:1 with lytic activity (Morrow et al., <i>Molecular therapy: the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy. </i>2015; 23(3):591-601, Morrow et al., <i>Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. </i>2017; DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-2335; Trimble et al., <i>Lancet. </i>2015; 386(10008):2078-88; Migueles et al., <i>PLoS pathogens. </i>2011; 7(2):e1002002; Varadarajan et al., <i>The Journal of clinical investigation. </i>2011; 121(11):4322-31). It is understood that a cytolytic response by CD8+ T cells is a key component of an immune response that will control and eliminate virally infected cells. Therefore, flow cytometry was performed on PBMCs from patients 603 and 604 with sufficient sample isolated prior to and after dosing with INO-3106 to assess the ability of HPV6 specific CD8+ T cells to load granzymes and perforin in response to treatment. To that end, the CD8+ T cell compartment was analyzed for immune activation via antigen-specific expression of cell surface markers such as CD38, CD69, CD137 and Ki67 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) as well as for lytic potential as determined by the presence of granulysin (Gnly), granzyme A (GrzA), granzyme B (GrzB) and perforin (Prf) after in vitro stimulation with cognate antigens. Table 2 shows antigen specific regulation of these markers prior to and following treatment with INO-3106. Consistent with ELISpot responses, patient 603 exhibited robust elevations of a variety of CD8+ T cells expressing activation markers concomitant with lytic proteins. Most notably, expression of CD38 and/or Ki67 in combination with markers of lytic potential such as granzyme A, granzyme B and perforin increase dramatically after treatment with INO-3106, reaching values surpassing 3% of total CD8+ T cells being specific to HPV6 E6 and E7 antigens (Table 2A, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Conversely, and consistent with the ELISpot results suggesting the lack of a robust T cell expansion, patient 604 (Table 2B, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) showed smaller elevations in CD8+ T cell responses from a magnitude perspective when compared to patient 603. Interestingly, while smaller in magnitude than patient 603, the phenotypes of the putative CTLs induced in patient 604 suggest the possibility of a more highly active CD8+ T cell, as the populations that were most likely to be increased after treatment consisted of three (CD38, CD137, Ki67) activation markers or concomitant expression of all four (CD69 in addition to the previous three). Co-expression of this number of activation markers concomitantly is far more rare (Tebas et al., <i>The New England journal of medicine. </i>2017; Bagarazzi et al., <i>Sci Transl Med. </i>2012; 4(155):155ra38; Morrow et al., <i>Molecular therapy oncolytics. </i>2016; 3(16025; Trimble et al., <i>Lancet. </i>2015; 386(10008):2078-88; vMorrow et al., <i>Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. </i>2018; 24(2):276-94; Aggarwal et al., <i>Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. </i>2019; 25(1):110-24) and previous interrogation of CD8+ T cells expressing multiple activation markers has suggested these cells expresses granzymes and can effectively induce apoptosis in targets expressing cognate antigen (Duhen et al., <i>Nat Commun. </i>2018 Jul. 13; 9(1):2724. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-05072-0). Indeed, this last idea is further supported when one notes that patient 604 showed increases in expression not just in granzymes and perforin, but in granulysin as well. While the limitations of this small sample size need to be taken into context, the results of this assessment suggests that INO-3106 potentially led to the induction of CD8+ T cells capable of activation in the context of antigenic exposure and that these cells were capable of granzyme, perforin and granulysin synthesis, thus exhibiting a clear HPV6 specific CTL phenotype.</p><p id="p-0161"

num="0158">Short-term stimulations of patient PBMCs (24 hours) was performed, followed by an analysis of immune gene transcripts that were found to be specifically regulated in response to stimulation with HPV6 E6 and E7-derived peptide pools. Data from patient 601 can be found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. For patients 603 and 604, gene transcription was mostly associated with upregulation of a pro-inflammatory signature post immunotherapy. Patient 603 exhibited only modest differential gene expression at dose 2 compared to baseline. However, at the 2-week follow-up visit, a pronounced upregulation of genes associated with innate immune responses (CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL7, CCL8), genes associated with the IFN&#x3b3; pathway (GBP1, GBP5), cell-cell interaction (CD209, MRC1) and B cell help (CXCL13) was observed in cells stimulated with peptide pool compared to unstimulated cells. Patient 604 also exhibited gene upregulation at the 2-week follow-up visit, with a similar signature as was observed in patient 603 (CXCL10, CXCL9, Stat1, GBP1, GBP5, CCL8). In addition, for patient 604, upregulation of markers indicative of adaptive cell activation (CD274, TNFSF13B) was observed. While gene upregulation in patient 603 was transient, patient 604 largely maintained this signature at the late follow up visits, three and six months post dose 4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, Table 3). Moreover, notably for patient 604, expression of IDO1, a molecule expressed by antigen presenting cells, increased rapidly over time, exhibiting a &#x2dc;4-fold difference at baseline that increased to 8-fold at dose 2, 10-fold at 2 week follow-up, almost 13-fold at 3 months follow up, and peaking at 65-fold increase at 6 months follow up (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, Table 3).</p><p id="p-0164" num="0159">In vitro culture for 11 days followed by 24 h antigen-restimulation allowed for a look at the antigen-specific T cells. The stimulation conditions favor T cell expansion above all other cell types including B cells and other APCs. Analysis revealed reduced levels of differential gene expression compared to after ex vivo stimulation. Overall, both RRP patients showed similar patterns of gene upregulation with few genes upregulated at baseline (patient 603-0 genes and patient 604-7 genes), but increased differential expression at post-immunotherapy time points (patient 603-4 genes at dose 4, 7 genes at 2-week follow-up, 3 genes at 3 and 6 months follow-up, respectively; patient 604-12 genes at dose 2, 9 genes at 2-week follow-up, 10 genes at 3 months and 22 genes 6 months follow-up) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). For both RRP patients, upregulated gene expression profiles in stimulated cells from post immunotherapy samples were primarily associated with T cell activation and functionality (CD276, TNFRSF8, TNFRSF9, GZMB) as well as B cell help (IL-21, CXCL13). See Table 4 for a full list of differentially expressed genes for each subject enrolled in the trial. Increased expression of CXCL10 and CXCL9 was also observed post immunotherapy for all subjects, however in patient 604 these markers were already increased at baseline.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">INO-3106 Reduces the Need for Surgical Intervention for the Treatment of RRP</heading><p id="p-0165" num="0160">Prior to entry into the study, subjects 603 and 604 required surgical intervention to remove respiratory papillomas approximately every 180 days. Assuming this pattern were to continue, the expected number of required surgical interventions over the course of the study would be four for subject 603 and two for subject 604. However, over the entirety of the study neither subject required surgical intervention for the removal of airway papillomas, constituting a clinical change in the need for intervention in the treatment of this disease. Post-study follow up of these subjects reveals that subject 603 has not required surgical intervention in the treatment of disease at the time of this publication, totaling more than 915 days without surgery. After 584 days subject 604 had a recurrence of disease that did require surgical intervention to appropriately treat, an overall reduction in surgery frequency great than 3-fold (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The difference in the outcomes of these patients prompted examination if any of the immunology data generated while on study would have suggested a differential clinical response to treatment. Assessment of flow cytometry indicated that subject 604 had more robust immune activity in the form of HPV6-specific CTLs than subject 603 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is therefore possible that the difference in both the magnitude of response and pattern of activation marker expression on subject CTLs could associated with the durability of clinical impact.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0161">Reported herein are the results of a phase I safety and immunology clinical trial of a HPV6 E6/E7 specific targeted DNA immunotherapy with and without IL-12 DNA adjuvant administered intramuscularly and delivered via electroporation by the CELLECTRA&#xae; device in three patients with HPV6 associated aerodigestive precancerous lesions and malignancies. Administration of the immunotherapy was well-tolerated. There were no treatment-related SAEs and the most frequent treatment-emergent AEs were injection site reactions. All patients showed induction of cellular responses to the HPV6 E6 and E7 antigens as demonstrated by at least one immunological assessment. Notably, both evaluable RRP patients derived clinical benefit from treatment with INO-3106, mainly in the form of delayed treatment intervention (e.g., surgery) relative to their pre-study surgery frequencies. Moreover, the fact that the patient whom exhibited more robust cellular activity after INO-3106 treatment remains surgery free while the patient with less robust cellular activity delayed but did not completely avoid surgery suggests a possible causal relationship between the induction of an HPV6-specific cellular response and the type/duration of clinical benefit. These results are encouraging and present the idea that, in certain instances, additional dosing to continue to boost the cellular response may be preferable in this treatment setting. Treatment with INO-3106 resulted in the induction of HPV6-specific cellular responses across a variety of immunoassays. The confirmation of production of IFN&#x3b3; using ELISpot as well as the confirmation of expression of activation markers concomitant with synthesis of granzyme and perforin on CD8+ T cells via flow cytometry suggests that INO-3106 drove the induction of a proinflammatory immune response that included T cells with hallmarks of highly activated cytotoxic lymphocytes. These results are further underscored by the observation of dynamic regulation of pro-inflammatory as well as regulatory gene transcripts in PBMCs after completion of treatment. Specifically, genes associated with the IFN&#x3b3; pathway such as CXCL10 and GBP1 were upregulated after both short and long-term stimulation. A recent study in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck reported that a composite score based on IFN&#x3b3;, CXCL9, CXCL10, IDO1 HLA-DRA and STAT1 significantly correlated with treatment response rate, indicating that an IFN&#x3b3;-based signature is associated with treatment benefit (Ahn et al., <i>Laryngoscope. </i>2018; 128(1):E27-E32). Moreover, increased expression of Granzyme B and TNFRSF9 was observed, confirming the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes on the transcriptomic level. The necessity for a T cell response of this nature in combating HPV-driven disease has been exemplified in two previous clinical trials for DNA-based immunotherapy, both of which were delivered using the CELLECTRA&#xae; device. In the context of HPV-associated cervical dysplasia, clinical response to treatment with VGX-3100 (DNA immunotherapy for HPV16/18) in the form of regression of lesions concomitant with elimination of HPV infection was statistically associated with the presence of a robust cellular response that included IFN&#x3b3; and CD8+ T cells exhibiting phenotypic markers of cytoxicity (Trimble et al., <i>Lancet. </i>2015; 386(10008):2078-88). Additionally, in another trial investigating treatment of HPV-associated squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx, a patient with metastatic cancer who achieved a complete response to treatment with nivolumab after treatment with MEDI0457 (DNA immunotherapy for HPV16/18 with plasmid encoded IL-12 adjuvant) was noted as having a therapy-driven robust expansion of PD1+ cytotoxic T cells (Aggarwal et al., <i>Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. </i>2019; 25(1):110-24). Thus, the current study provides further evidence that HPV-specific immunotherapies delivered by the CELLECTRA&#xae; device induce the generation of potent T cell responses that have the potential to clinically impact HPV-associated tumorigenesis.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0162">The data collected from this study are the first to suggest that an HPV specific immunotherapy may be able to impact the clinical status of patients with HPV6 associated recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and act as an additional or alternative adjuvant therapy. These findings are complementary to data presented earlier this year, where administration of pembrolizumab was associated with a reduced need for routine surgical interventions (Pai et al., <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology. </i>37. 2502-2502. 10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_supp1.2502). Together these findings offer early data to support the use of immunotherapeutic approaches in the management of these patients. The standard of care for treatment for this disease is repeated surgical intervention, which presents a number of complications and is unlikely to completely eradicate lesion recurrence as latent virus may reside in adjacent tissue (Chow et al., <i>APMIS. </i>2010; 118(6-7):422-49). Other non-surgical adjuvant interventions are indicated in patients with rapid regrowth of lesions or aggressive disease, but such therapies also carry inherent risks and require further evaluation to determine optimal treatment regimens (Derkay et al., <i>Otolaryngol Clin North Am. </i>2019; 52(4):669-79). Current treatment limitations highlight the need to identify non-invasive and immune mediated approaches to treating patients with HPV positive areodigestive disease. Indeed, preventive HPV vaccines have been reported to reduce papilloma growth and extend time between interventions, however, determination of therapeutic efficacy requires continued evaluation (Makiyama et al., <i>J Voice. </i>2017; 31(1):104-6). Similarly, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition represents a rational approach to treating RRP, but expression and impact on clinical outcome is less characterized (Ahn et al., <i>Laryngoscope. </i>2018; 128(1):E27-E32).</p><p id="p-0168" num="0163">The data generated from the present study suggests that immunotherapy with INO-3106 and IL-12 adjuvant as a non-invasive immune mediated approach may provide an option to address existing treatment deficiencies for RRP.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230000969A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
