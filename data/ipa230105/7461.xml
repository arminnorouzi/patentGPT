These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include a number of base stations (BSs), each simultaneously supporting communications for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet the growing demands for expanded mobile broadband connectivity, wireless communication technologies are advancing from the long term evolution (LTE) technology to a next generation new radio (NR) technology, which may be referred to as 5<sup>th </sup>Generation (5G). For example, NR is designed to provide a lower latency, a higher bandwidth or a higher throughput, and a higher reliability than LTE. NR is designed to operate over a wide array of spectrum bands, for example, from low-frequency bands below about 1 gigahertz (GHz) and mid-frequency bands from about 1 GHz to about 6 GHz, to high-frequency bands such as millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. NR is also designed to operate across different spectrum types, from licensed spectrum to unlicensed and shared spectrum. Spectrum sharing enables operators to opportunistically aggregate spectrums to dynamically support high-bandwidth services. Spectrum sharing can extend the benefit of NR technologies to operating entities that may not have access to a licensed spectrum.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a wireless communication network, a BS may communicate with a UE in an uplink direction and a downlink direction. Sidelink was introduced in LTE to allow a UE to send data to another UE without tunneling through the BS and/or an associated core network. The LTE sidelink technology had been extended to provision for device-to-device (D2D) communications, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, and/or cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications. Similarly, NR may be extended to support sidelink communications for D2D, V2X, and/or C-V2X over a dedicated spectrum, a licensed spectrum, and/or an unlicensed spectrum.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF SOME EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following summarizes some aspects of the present disclosure to provide a basic understanding of the discussed technology.

In various embodiments, the techniques and apparatus may be used for wireless communication networks such as code division multiple access (CDMA) networks, time division multiple access (TDMA) networks, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) networks, orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA) networks, single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) networks, LTE networks, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks, 5<sup>th </sup>Generation (5G) or new radio (NR) networks, as well as other communications networks. As described herein, the terms &#x201c;networks&#x201d; and &#x201c;systems&#x201d; may be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An OFDMA network may implement a radio technology such as evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11, IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.20, flash-OFDM and the like. UTRA, E-UTRA, and GSM are part of universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS). In particular, long term evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA. UTRA, E-UTRA, GSM, UMTS and LTE are described in documents provided from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project&#x201d; (3GPP), and cdma2000 is described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project 2&#x201d; (3GPP2). These various radio technologies and standards are known or are being developed. For example, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is a collaboration between groups of telecommunications associations that aims to define a globally applicable third generation (3G) mobile phone specification. 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) is a 3GPP project which was aimed at improving the UMTS mobile phone standard. The 3GPP may define specifications for the next generation of mobile networks, mobile systems, and mobile devices. The present disclosure is concerned with the evolution of wireless technologies from LTE, 4G, 5G, NR, and beyond with shared access to wireless spectrum between networks using a collection of new and different radio access technologies or radio air interfaces.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">5G networks contemplate diverse deployments, diverse spectrum, and diverse services and devices that may be implemented using an OFDM-based unified, air interface. In order to achieve these goals, further enhancements to LTE and LTE-A are considered in addition to development of the new radio technology for 5G NR networks. The 5G NR will be capable of scaling to provide coverage (1) to a massive Internet of things (IoTs) with a ultra-high density (e.g., &#x2dc;1M nodes/km<sup>2</sup>), ultra-low complexity (e.g., &#x2dc;10s of bits/sec), ultra-low energy (e.g., &#x2dc;10+ years of battery life), and deep coverage with the capability to reach challenging locations; (2) including mission-critical control with strong security to safeguard sensitive personal, financial, or classified information, ultra-high reliability (e.g., &#x2dc;99.9999% reliability), ultra-low latency (e.g., &#x2dc;1 ms), and users with wide ranges of mobility or lack thereof; and (3) with enhanced mobile broadband including extreme high capacity (e.g., &#x2dc;10 Tbps/km<sup>2</sup>), extreme data rates (e.g., multi-Gbps rate, 100+ Mbps user experienced rates), and deep awareness with advanced discovery and optimizations.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The 5G NR may be implemented to use optimized OFDM-based waveforms with scalable numerology and transmission time interval (TTI); having a common, flexible framework to efficiently multiplex services and features with a dynamic, low-latency time division duplex (TDD)/frequency division duplex (FDD) design; and with advanced wireless technologies, such as massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO), robust millimeter wave (mmWave) transmissions, advanced channel coding, and device-centric mobility. Scalability of the numerology in 5G NR, with scaling of subcarrier spacing, may efficiently address operating diverse services across diverse spectrum and diverse deployments. For example, in various outdoor and macro coverage deployments of less than 3 GHz FDD/TDD implementations, subcarrier spacing may occur with 15 kHz, for example over 5, 10, 20 MHz, and the like bandwidth (BW). For other various outdoor and small cell coverage deployments of TDD greater than 3 GHz, subcarrier spacing may occur with 30 kHz over 80/100 MHz BW. For other various indoor wideband implementations, using a TDD over the unlicensed portion of the 5 GHz band, the subcarrier spacing may occur with 60 kHz over a 160 MHz BW. Finally, for various deployments transmitting with mmWave components at a TDD of 28 GHz, subcarrier spacing may occur with 120 kHz over a 500 MHz BW.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The scalable numerology of the 5G NR facilitates scalable TTI for diverse latency and quality of service (QoS) requirements. For example, shorter TTI may be used for low latency and high reliability, while longer TTI may be used for higher spectral efficiency. The efficient multiplexing of long and short TTIs to allow transmissions to start on symbol boundaries. 5G NR also contemplates a self-contained integrated subframe design with UL/downlink scheduling information, data, and acknowledgement in the same subframe. The self-contained integrated subframe supports communications in unlicensed or contention-based shared spectrum, adaptive UL/downlink that may be flexibly configured on a per-cell basis to dynamically switch between UL and downlink to meet the current traffic needs.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Various other aspects and features of the disclosure are further described below. It should be apparent that the teachings herein may be embodied in a wide variety of forms and that any specific structure, function, or both being disclosed herein is merely representative and not limiting. Based on the teachings herein one of an ordinary level of skill in the art should appreciate that an aspect disclosed herein may be implemented independently of any other aspects and that two or more of these aspects may be combined in various ways. For example, an apparatus may be implemented, or a method may be practiced using any number of the aspects set forth herein. In addition, such an apparatus may be implemented, or such a method may be practiced using other structure, functionality, or structure and functionality in addition to or other than one or more of the aspects set forth herein. For example, a method may be implemented as part of a system, device, apparatus, and/or as instructions stored on a computer readable medium for execution on a processor or computer. Furthermore, an aspect may comprise at least one element of a claim.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Sidelink communications refer to the communications among user equipment devices (UEs) without tunneling through a base station (BS) and/or a core network. Sidelink communications can be communicated over a physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH) and a physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH). The PSCCH and PSSCH are analogous to a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) and a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) in downlink (DL) communication between a BS and a UE. For instance, the PSCCH may carry sidelink control information (SCI) and the PSSCH may carry sidelink data (e.g., user data). Each PSCCH is associated with a corresponding PSSCH, where SCI in a PSCCH may carry reservation and/or scheduling information for sidelink data transmission in the associated PSSCH. Use cases for sidelink communication may include V2X, enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), industrial IoT (IIoT), and/or NR-lite.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, the term &#x201c;sidelink UE&#x201d; can refer to a user equipment device performing a device-to-device communication or other types of communications with another user equipment device independent of any tunneling through the BS (e.g., gNB) and/or an associated core network. As used herein, the term &#x201c;sidelink transmitting UE&#x201d; can refer to a user equipment device performing a sidelink transmission operation. As used herein, the term &#x201c;sidelink receiving UE&#x201d; can refer to a user equipment device performing a sidelink reception operation. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;anchor UE&#x201d; or &#x201c;sidelink anchor UE&#x201d; refer to a sidelink UE designated as an anchor node with a stand-alone sidelink configuration that can initiate sidelink operations autonomously (e.g., independent of any cell and/or associated core network), and the terms are interchangeable without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The deployment of NR over an unlicensed spectrum is referred to as NR-unlicensed (NR-U). Some studies have been conducted for NR-U deployment over 5 gigahertz (GHz) unlicensed bands. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) are working on regulating 6 GHz as a new unlicensed band for wireless communications. The addition of 6 GHz bands allows for hundreds of megahertz (MHz) of bandwidth (BW) available for unlicensed band communications. Additionally, NR-U can also be deployed over 2.4 GHz unlicensed bands, which are currently shared by various radio access technologies (RATs), such as IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN) or WiFi and/or license assisted access (LAA). Sidelink can benefit from utilizing the additional bandwidth available in an unlicensed spectrum. However, channel access in a certain unlicensed spectrum may be regulated by authorities. For instance, regulations in a 2.4 GHz band allows a node to transmit without performing an LBT when the node applies frequency-hopping to transmissions and satisfies a transmission sequence or on/off pattern with a maximum transmission duration of about 5 ms and a minimum silent or gap duration of about 5 ms between transmissions.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">NR supports two modes of radio resource allocations (RRA), a mode-1 RRA and a mode-2 RRA, for sidelink over a licensed spectrum. The mode-1 RRA supports network controlled RRA that can be used for in-coverage sidelink communication. For instance, a serving BS (e.g., gNB) may determine a radio resource on behalf of a sidelink UE and transmit an indication of the radio resource to the sidelink UE. In some aspects, the serving BS grants a sidelink transmission with downlink control information (DCI). For this mode, however, there is significant base station involvement and is only operable when the sidelink UE is within the coverage area of the serving BS. The mode-2 RRA supports autonomous RRA that can be used for out-of-coverage sidelink UEs or partial-coverage sidelink UEs. For instance, an out-of-coverage sidelink UE or a partial-coverage UE may be preconfigured with a sidelink resource pool and may select a radio resource from the preconfigured sidelink resource pool for sidelink communication. For this mode, it may be possible for V2X systems, CV2X systems, or other sidelink communication systems to operate independent of the serving BS. However, the mode-2 RRA relies on sidelink settings across different UEs and/or environments. Accordingly, for mode-2 RRA the sidelink settings may be coordinated so that each sidelink UE can communicate with one another. As a result, UE vendors (e.g., different automotive manufacturers or other UE manufacturers) may need to coordinate and implement common sidelink settings. This may pose a substantial burden on the UE vendors to develop and implement uniform sidelink settings so that all NR-U sidelink UE devices can communicate via respective sidelink connections. As such, the present disclosure describes methods, devices, and systems for facilitating the deployment of an NR-U sidelink system as a stand-alone system.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, the present application describes mechanisms for transmitting and receiving discovery signals in a sidelink communication scenario. The mechanisms described in this application allow for the transmission and reception of a discovery signal integrated with a synchronization signal, such as a synchronization signal block (SSB). In particular, a first sidelink UE may transmit, to a second sidelink UE, a discovery signal that is aligned in time with the SSB, and that occupies a plurality of resource blocks (RBs) in the subband that is contiguous with the RBs used to transmit the synchronization signal. Further, the first sidelink UE may transmit the discovery signal such that it is quasi co-located (QCL) with the synchronization signal. The discovery signal may include configuration information associated with the sidelink communication scheme between the UEs, such as resource pool configurations, UE identity, a UE's network service information, and/or any other suitable sidelink configuration information. In some aspects, the structure of the discovery signal may be similar or identical to the structure of a remaining minimum system information (RMSI).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Aspects of the present disclosure provide several benefits. For example, because the mechanisms described herein use time/frequency resources (e.g., RBs) that are associated with a configured synchronization signal, the discovery signal indication schemes advantageously allow for the transmission and reception of sidelink discovery information such that UEs from a variety of manufacturers and/or operators can receive the discovery information without additional cooperation or agreement for specific discovery signal settings and transmission structures. Further, transmitting the discovery signal in an otherwise unused portion of the subband in which the synchronization signal is transmitted makes efficient use of network resources, improving throughput, reducing power consumption of the UE devices, and increasing user satisfaction with the wireless network. Further, control information and/or parameters for decoding and using the discovery information can be indicated in system information carried by the synchronization signal, such as a master information block (MIB) carried in the physical broadcast channel (PBCH) of a SSB. In this way, more of the RBs in the subband that are not designated for the synchronization communication can be used to transmit the discovery signal, further improving the efficiency of the sidelink communications, improving throughput, reducing power consumption, and increasing user satisfaction with the wireless network.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a wireless communication network <b>100</b> according to some aspects of the present disclosure. The network <b>100</b> may be a 5G network. The network <b>100</b> includes a number of base stations (BSs) <b>105</b> (individually labeled as <b>105</b><i>a</i>, <b>105</b><i>b</i>, <b>105</b><i>c</i>, <b>105</b><i>d</i>, <b>105</b><i>e</i>, and <b>105</b><i>f</i>) and other network entities. A BS <b>105</b> may be a station that communicates with UEs <b>115</b> and may also be referred to as an evolved node B (eNB), a next generation eNB (gNB), an access point, and the like. Each BS <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In 3GPP, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; can refer to this particular geographic coverage area of a BS <b>105</b> and/or a BS subsystem serving the coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A BS <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage for a macro cell or a small cell, such as a pico cell or a femto cell, and/or other types of cell. A macro cell generally covers a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscriptions with the network provider. A small cell, such as a pico cell, would generally cover a relatively smaller geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscriptions with the network provider. A small cell, such as a femto cell, would also generally cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a home) and, in addition to unrestricted access, may also provide restricted access by UEs having an association with the femto cell (e.g., UEs in a closed subscriber group (CSG), UEs for users in the home, and the like). A BS for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro BS. A BS for a small cell may be referred to as a small cell BS, a pico BS, a femto BS or a home BS. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the BSs <b>105</b><i>d </i>and <b>105</b><i>e </i>may be regular macro BSs, while the BSs <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>105</b><i>c </i>may be macro BSs enabled with one of three dimension (3D), full dimension (FD), or massive MIMO. The BSs <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>105</b><i>c </i>may take advantage of their higher dimension MIMO capabilities to exploit 3D beamforming in both elevation and azimuth beamforming to increase coverage and capacity. The BS <b>105</b><i>f </i>may be a small cell BS which may be a home node or portable access point. A BS <b>105</b> may support one or multiple (e.g., two, three, four, and the like) cells.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The network <b>100</b> may support synchronous or asynchronous operation. For synchronous operation, the BSs may have similar frame timing, and transmissions from different BSs may be approximately aligned in time. For asynchronous operation, the BSs may have different frame timing, and transmissions from different BSs may not be aligned in time.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The UEs <b>115</b> are dispersed throughout the wireless network <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>115</b> may be stationary or mobile. A UE <b>115</b> may also be referred to as a terminal, a mobile station, a subscriber unit, a station, or the like. A UE <b>115</b> may be a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, or the like. In one aspect, a UE <b>115</b> may be a device that includes a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC). In another aspect, a UE may be a device that does not include a UICC. In some aspects, the UEs <b>115</b> that do not include UICCs may also be referred to as IoT devices or internet of everything (IoE) devices. The UEs <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<b>115</b><i>d </i>are examples of mobile smart phone-type devices accessing network <b>100</b>. A UE <b>115</b> may also be a machine specifically configured for connected communication, including machine type communication (MTC), enhanced MTC (eMTC), narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) and the like. The UEs <b>115</b><i>e</i>-<b>115</b><i>h </i>are examples of various machines configured for communication that access the network <b>100</b>. The UEs <b>115</b><i>i</i>-<b>115</b><i>k </i>are examples of vehicles equipped with wireless communication devices configured for communication that access the network <b>100</b>. A UE <b>115</b> may be able to communicate with any type of the BSs, whether macro BS, small cell, or the like. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a lightning bolt (e.g., communication links) indicates wireless transmissions between a UE <b>115</b> and a serving BS <b>105</b>, which is a BS designated to serve the UE <b>115</b> on the downlink (DL) and/or uplink (UL), desired transmission between BSs <b>105</b>, backhaul transmissions between BSs, or sidelink transmissions between UEs <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In operation, the BSs <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>105</b><i>c </i>may serve the UEs <b>115</b><i>a </i>and <b>115</b><i>b </i>using 3D beamforming and coordinated spatial techniques, such as coordinated multipoint (CoMP) or multi-connectivity. The macro BS <b>105</b><i>d </i>may perform backhaul communications with the BSs <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>105</b><i>c</i>, as well as small cell, the BS <b>105</b><i>f</i>. The macro BS <b>105</b><i>d </i>may also transmits multicast services which are subscribed to and received by the UEs <b>115</b><i>c </i>and <b>115</b><i>d</i>. Such multicast services may include mobile television or stream video, or may include other services for providing community information, such as weather emergencies or alerts, such as Amber alerts or gray alerts.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The BSs <b>105</b> may also communicate with a core network. The core network may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. At least some of the BSs <b>105</b> (e.g., which may be an example of a gNB or an access node controller (ANC)) may interface with the core network through backhaul links (e.g., NG-C, NG-U, etc.) and may perform radio configuration and scheduling for communication with the UEs <b>115</b>. In various examples, the BSs <b>105</b> may communicate, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through core network), with each other over backhaul links (e.g., X1, X2, etc.), which may be wired or wireless communication links.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The network <b>100</b> may also support mission critical communications with ultra-reliable and redundant links for mission critical devices, such as the UE <b>115</b><i>e</i>, which may be a drone. Redundant communication links with the UE <b>115</b><i>e </i>may include links from the macro BSs <b>105</b><i>d </i>and <b>105</b><i>e</i>, as well as links from the small cell BS <b>105</b><i>f</i>. Other machine type devices, such as the UE <b>115</b><i>f </i>(e.g., a thermometer), the UE <b>115</b><i>g </i>(e.g., smart meter), and UE <b>115</b><i>h </i>(e.g., wearable device) may communicate through the network <b>100</b> either directly with BSs, such as the small cell BS <b>105</b><i>f</i>, and the macro BS <b>105</b><i>e</i>, or in multi-step-size configurations by communicating with another user device which relays its information to the network, such as the UE <b>115</b><i>f </i>communicating temperature measurement information to the smart meter, the UE <b>115</b><i>g</i>, which is then reported to the network through the small cell BS <b>105</b><i>f</i>. The network <b>100</b> may also provide additional network efficiency through dynamic, low-latency TDD/FDD communications, such as V2V, V2X, C-V2X communications between a UE <b>115</b><i>i</i>, <b>115</b><i>j</i>, or <b>115</b><i>k </i>and other UEs <b>115</b>, and/or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications between a UE <b>115</b><i>i</i>, <b>115</b><i>j</i>, or <b>115</b><i>k </i>and a BS <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some implementations, the network <b>100</b> utilizes OFDM-based waveforms for communications. An OFDM-based system may partition the system BW into multiple (K) orthogonal subcarriers, which are also commonly referred to as subcarriers, tones, bins, or the like. Each subcarrier may be modulated with data. In some instances, the subcarrier spacing between adjacent subcarriers may be fixed, and the total number of subcarriers (K) may be dependent on the system BW. The system BW may also be partitioned into subbands. In other instances, the subcarrier spacing and/or the duration of TTIs may be scalable.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some aspects, the BSs <b>105</b> can assign or schedule transmission resources (e.g., in the form of time-frequency resource blocks (RB)) for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions in the network <b>100</b>. DL refers to the transmission direction from a BS <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>, whereas UL refers to the transmission direction from a UE <b>115</b> to a BS <b>105</b>. The communication can be in the form of radio frames. A radio frame may be divided into a plurality of subframes or slots, for example, about 10. Each slot may be further divided into mini-slots. In a FDD mode, simultaneous UL and DL transmissions may occur in different frequency bands. For example, each subframe includes a UL subframe in a UL frequency band and a DL subframe in a DL frequency band. In a TDD mode, UL and DL transmissions occur at different time periods using the same frequency band. For example, a subset of the subframes (e.g., DL subframes) in a radio frame may be used for DL transmissions and another subset of the subframes (e.g., UL subframes) in the radio frame may be used for UL transmissions.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The DL subframes and the UL subframes can be further divided into several regions. For example, each DL or UL subframe may have pre-defined regions for transmissions of reference signals, control information, and data. Reference signals are predetermined signals that facilitate the communications between the BSs <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b>. For example, a reference signal can have a particular pilot pattern or structure, where pilot tones may span across an operational BW or frequency band, each positioned at a pre-defined time and a pre-defined frequency. For example, a BS <b>105</b> may transmit cell specific reference signals (CRSs) and/or channel state information&#x2014;reference signals (CSI-RSs) to enable a UE <b>115</b> to estimate a DL channel. Similarly, a UE <b>115</b> may transmit sounding reference signals (SRSs) to enable a BS <b>105</b> to estimate a UL channel Control information may include resource assignments and protocol controls. Data may include protocol data and/or operational data. In some aspects, the BSs <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may communicate using self-contained subframes. A self-contained subframe may include a portion for DL communication and a portion for UL communication. A self-contained subframe can be DL-centric or UL-centric. A DL-centric subframe may include a longer duration for DL communication than for UL communication. A UL-centric subframe may include a longer duration for UL communication than for UL communication.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some aspects, the network <b>100</b> may be an NR network deployed over a licensed spectrum. The BSs <b>105</b> can transmit synchronization signals (e.g., including a primary synchronization signal (PSS) and a secondary synchronization signal (SSS)) in the network <b>100</b> to facilitate synchronization. The BSs <b>105</b> can broadcast system information associated with the network <b>100</b> (e.g., including a master information block (MIB), remaining minimum system information (e.g., RMSI), and other system information (OSI)) to facilitate initial network access. In some instances, the BSs <b>105</b> may broadcast the PSS, the SSS, and/or the MIB in the form of synchronization signal block (SSBs) over a physical broadcast channel (PBCH) and may broadcast the RMSI and/or the OSI over a physical downlink shared channel (e.g., PDSCH).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some aspects, a UE <b>115</b> attempting to access the network <b>100</b> may perform an initial cell search by detecting a PSS from a BS <b>105</b>. The PSS may enable synchronization of period timing and may indicate a physical layer identity value. The UE <b>115</b> may then receive a SSS. The SSS may enable radio frame synchronization, and may provide a cell identity value. The cell identity value may be combined with the physical layer identity value to identify the cell. The PSS and the SSS may be located in a central portion of a carrier or any suitable frequencies within the carrier.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">After receiving the PSS and SSS, the UE <b>115</b> may receive a MIB. The MIB may include system information for initial network access and scheduling information for RMSI and/or OSI. After decoding the MIB, the UE <b>115</b> may receive RMSI and/or OSI. The RMSI and/or OSI may include radio resource control (RRC) information related to random access channel (RACH) procedures, paging, control resource set (CORESET) for physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) monitoring, physical UL control channel (PUCCH), physical UL shared channel (PUSCH), power control, and SRS.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">After obtaining the MIB, the RMSI and/or the OSI, the UE <b>115</b> can perform a random access procedure to establish a connection with the BS <b>105</b>. In some examples, the random access procedure may be a four-step random access procedure. For example, the UE <b>115</b> may transmit a random access preamble and the BS <b>105</b> may respond with a random access response. The random access response (RAR) may include a detected random access preamble identifier (ID) corresponding to the random access preamble, timing advance (TA) information, a UL grant, a temporary cell-radio network temporary identifier (C-RNTI), and/or a backoff indicator. Upon receiving the random access response, the UE <b>115</b> may transmit a connection request to the BS <b>105</b> and the BS <b>105</b> may respond with a connection response. The connection response may indicate a contention resolution. In some examples, the random access preamble, the RAR, the connection request, and the connection response can be referred to as message 1 (MSG1), message 2 (MSG2), message 3 (MSG3), and message 4 (MSG4), respectively. In some examples, the random access procedure may be a two-step random access procedure, where the UE <b>115</b> may transmit a random access preamble and a connection request in a single transmission and the BS <b>105</b> may respond by transmitting a random access response and a connection response in a single transmission.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">After establishing a connection, the UE <b>115</b> and the BS <b>105</b> can enter a normal operation stage, where operational data may be exchanged. For example, the BS <b>105</b> may schedule the UE <b>115</b> for UL and/or DL communications. The BS <b>105</b> may transmit UL and/or DL scheduling grants to the UE <b>115</b> via a PDCCH. The scheduling grants may be transmitted in the form of DL control information (DCI). The BS <b>105</b> may transmit a DL communication signal (e.g., carrying data) to the UE <b>115</b> via a PDSCH according to a DL scheduling grant. The UE <b>115</b> may transmit a UL communication signal to the BS <b>105</b> via a PUSCH and/or PUCCH according to a UL scheduling grant.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some aspects, the BS <b>105</b> may communicate with a UE <b>115</b> using HARQ techniques to improve communication reliability, for example, to provide a URLLC service. The BS <b>105</b> may schedule a UE <b>115</b> for a PDSCH communication by transmitting a DL grant in a PDCCH. The BS <b>105</b> may transmit a DL data packet to the UE <b>115</b> according to the schedule in the PDSCH. The DL data packet may be transmitted in the form of a transport block (TB). If the UE <b>115</b> receives the DL data packet successfully, the UE <b>115</b> may transmit a HARQ ACK to the BS <b>105</b>. Conversely, if the UE <b>115</b> fails to receive the DL transmission successfully, the UE <b>115</b> may transmit a HARQ NACK to the BS <b>105</b>. Upon receiving a HARQ NACK from the UE <b>115</b>, the BS <b>105</b> may retransmit the DL data packet to the UE <b>115</b>. The retransmission may include the same coded version of DL data as the initial transmission. Alternatively, the retransmission may include a different coded version of the DL data than the initial transmission. The UE <b>115</b> may apply soft-combining to combine the encoded data received from the initial transmission and the retransmission for decoding. The BS <b>105</b> and the UE <b>115</b> may also apply HARQ for UL communications using substantially similar mechanisms as the DL HARQ.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some aspects, the network <b>100</b> may operate over a system BW or a component carrier (CC) BW. The network <b>100</b> may partition the system BW into multiple BWPs (e.g., portions). A BS <b>105</b> may dynamically assign a UE <b>115</b> to operate over a certain BWP (e.g., a certain portion of the system BW). The assigned BWP may be referred to as the active BWP. The UE <b>115</b> may monitor the active BWP for signaling information from the BS <b>105</b>. The BS <b>105</b> may schedule the UE <b>115</b> for UL or DL communications in the active BWP. In some aspects, a BS <b>105</b> may assign a pair of BWPs within the CC to a UE <b>115</b> for UL and DL communications. For example, the BWP pair may include one BWP for UL communications and one BWP for DL communications.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some aspects, the network <b>100</b> may operate over a shared channel, which may include shared frequency bands and/or unlicensed frequency bands. For example, the network <b>100</b> may be an NR-U network operating over an unlicensed frequency band. In such an aspect, the BSs <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may be operated by multiple network operating entities. To avoid collisions, the BSs <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may employ a listen-before-talk (LBT) procedure to monitor for transmission opportunities (TXOPs) in the shared channel A TXOP may also be referred to as COT. For example, a transmitting node (e.g., a BS <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b>) may perform an LBT prior to transmitting in the channel. When the LBT passes, the transmitting node may proceed with the transmission. When the LBT fails, the transmitting node may refrain from transmitting in the channel.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">An LBT can be based on energy detection (ED) or signal detection. For an energy detection-based LBT, the LBT results in a pass when signal energy measured from the channel is below a threshold. Conversely, the LBT results in a failure when signal energy measured from the channel exceeds the threshold. For a signal detection-based LBT, the LBT results in a pass when a channel reservation signal (e.g., a predetermined preamble signal) is not detected in the channel Additionally, an LBT may be in a variety of modes. An LBT mode may be, for example, a category 4 (CAT4) LBT, a category 2 (CAT2) LBT, or a category 1 (CAT1) LBT. A CAT1 LBT is referred to a no LBT mode, where no LBT is to be performed prior to a transmission. A CAT2 LBT refers to an LBT without a random backoff period. For instance, a transmitting node may determine a channel measurement in a time interval and determine whether the channel is available or not based on a comparison of the channel measurement against a ED threshold. A CAT4 LBT refers to an LBT with a random backoff and a variable contention window (CW). For instance, a transmitting node may draw a random number and backoff for a duration based on the drawn random number in a certain time unit.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some aspects, the network <b>100</b> may support sidelink communication among the UEs <b>115</b> over a shared radio frequency band (e.g., in a shared spectrum or an unlicensed spectrum).

For instance, the BS <b>205</b><i>a </i>and the UEs <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>-<b>215</b><i>a</i><b>4</b> of the first network operating entity may utilize NR-U technology while the BS <b>205</b><i>b </i>and the UEs <b>215</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>-<b>215</b><i>b</i><b>2</b> of the second network operating entity may utilize WiFi or LAA technology.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the network <b>200</b>, some of the UEs <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>-<b>215</b><i>a</i><b>4</b> may communicate with each other in peer-to-peer communications. For example, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> may communicate with the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> over a sidelink <b>252</b>, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> may communicate with the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>4</b> over another sidelink <b>251</b>, and the UE <b>215</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> may communicate with the UE <b>215</b><i>b</i><b>2</b> over yet another sidelink <b>254</b>. The sidelinks <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, and <b>254</b> are unicast bidirectional links. Some of the UEs <b>215</b> may also communicate with the BS <b>205</b><i>a </i>or the BS <b>205</b><i>b </i>in a UL direction and/or a DL direction via communication links <b>253</b>. For instance, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>, and <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>4</b> are within a coverage area <b>210</b> of the BS <b>205</b><i>a</i>, and thus may be in communication with the BS <b>205</b><i>a</i>. The UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> is outside the coverage area <b>210</b>, and thus may not be in direct communication with the BS <b>205</b><i>a</i>. In some instances, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> may operate as a relay for the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> to reach the BS <b>205</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the UE <b>215</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> is within a coverage area <b>212</b> of the BS <b>205</b><i>b</i>, and thus may be in communication with the BS <b>205</b><i>b </i>and may operate as a relay for the UE <b>215</b><i>b</i><b>2</b> to reach the BS <b>205</b><i>b</i>. In some aspects, some of the UEs <b>215</b> are associated with vehicles (e.g., similar to the UEs <b>115</b><i>i</i>-<i>k</i>) and the communications over the sidelinks <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, and <b>254</b> may be C-V2X communications. C-V2X communications may refer to communications between vehicles and any other wireless communication devices in a cellular network.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As discussed above, NR supports a stand-alone sidelink communication mechanism. In some aspects, a first user equipment (UE) includes a processor configured to determine system parameter information to initiate a sidelink communication, and a transceiver configured to transmit, in one or more first subbands of a plurality of subbands within a shared radio frequency during a first time period, the system parameter information, and communicate, with a second UE in a second subband of the plurality of subbands during a second time period different from the first time period, sidelink data based on the system parameter information.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may serve as the sidelink anchor UE and UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> may serve as a sidelink receiving UE, where UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> transmits system parameter information including timing synchronization signals over a sidelink broadcast channel (e.g., PSBCH) such that the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> can receive and recover resource allocation and timing information to facilitate a sidelink communication with the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. For purposes of explanation and brevity of discussion, the remaining description for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> will be discussed in reference to UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> (e.g., sidelink receiving UE) and UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> (e.g., sidelink anchor UE).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Sidelink discovery of other sidelink transmitting UEs, such as other anchor nodes, can be facilitated through the use of a transport channel referred to as a transport sidelink discovery channel (SL-DCH), and its physical counterpart, the physical sidelink discovery channel (e.g., PSDCH). In some aspects, a sidelink transmitting UE can transmit one or more announcement messages that are generated using physical layer transport blocks with zero media access control overhead. For example, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> can broadcast an announcement message over the PSDCH to announce its status as an anchor node.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In various embodiments, the sidelink anchor UE may utilize the sidelink discovery procedure to: 1) announce its presence as the anchor UE to potentially proximal sidelink UEs by transmitting a message containing its application information or other useful information fields (e.g., GPS coordinates, time, and the like), and 2) monitor the presence of other proximal sidelink UEs by detecting and decoding the corresponding discovery messages, and respond to the sidelink transmitting UEs using similar discovery messages. In some instances, the discovery message may include information about the type of discovery being performed and/or the type of content (e.g., announcement, query) provided by the sidelink transmitting UE. For example, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may broadcast a discovery message over the PSDCH, in which the discovery message includes an indication that the discovery message pertains to an announcement of its anchor node status.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some aspects, UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may perform a sensing operation on one or more of a discovery channel, such as the PSDCH, or a sidelink broadcast channel, such as the PSBCH, depending on implementation. If the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> does not detect an existing anchor UE on the discovery channel, then the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may configure itself as an anchor UE and broadcast an announcement indicating itself to be the anchor UE. If the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> detects an existing anchor UE, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may determine whether there is a need for it to become an anchor node within the wireless communication network <b>200</b> or not.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some instances, there may be multiple anchor nodes in the wireless communication network <b>200</b>. A sidelink anchor UE, such as UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, may perform sensing operations on the sidelink discovery channel. In some aspects, when two anchor UEs sense each other, one anchor UE can adopt the system parameters of the other anchor UE to maintain local consistency of system parameters in the wireless communication network <b>200</b>. In some instances, an in-coverage anchor UE (e.g., a sidelink anchor UE within the coverage area of an existing cell) may have priority in determining the system parameters. For example, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> may be configured as an anchor node such that the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> sensed the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> as an anchor node and determines that it is an in-coverage anchor UE based on its location being within a coverage area of BS <b>205</b><i>a</i>. In some embodiments, the anchor UE that adopted the new system parameters may broadcast its updated system parameters to other sidelink receiving UE over the sidelink broadcast channel. For example, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may adopt the system parameters of the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, and in turn, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may broadcast its updated system parameters to other neighboring sidelink receiving UEs (e.g., <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>, <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>4</b>, <b>215</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>). In other embodiments, the sidelink anchor UE may actively communicate with other sidelink receiving UEs via unicast or multicast transmissions to indicate the change in system parameters.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">For in-coverage sidelink operation, where both transmitting and sidelink receiving UEs reside in the same coverage area of a BS, time synchronization is provided by the BS and there may be no need for the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> to become an anchor UE to initiate sidelink operations by performing sidelink-specific synchronization. However, there may be several scenarios where there may be a need for the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> to become an anchor UE to perform sidelink-specific operations: (i) in multi-cell in-coverage, where the sidelink receiving UE resides in a different asynchronous cell with respect to the sidelink transmitting UE; (ii) in partial-coverage, where the sidelink receiving UE is out of coverage and may need to acquire synchronization from the in-coverage sidelink transmitting UE; and/or (iii) out of coverage, where both sidelink UEs are outside the coverage of a cell and the sidelink transmitting UE decides to act as a reference synchronization source (referred to as the anchor UE).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some aspects, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may evaluate other factors, including but not limited to, a transmission priority level of the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, an application type of the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, number of sidelink UE participants within synchronization range of the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, and/or a network congestion level within a sidelink coverage area of the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some aspects, if the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> determines that one or more of the above-mentioned factors are satisfied through a quantitative and/or qualitative analysis, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may determine that it can become an anchor node. In this respect, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> can adopt the system parameters and any associated timing parameters of the detected anchor UE (e.g., UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>). In some aspects, the detected anchor UE may propagate its system parameters to the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. This would allow multiple anchor UEs to coexist in the network <b>200</b> while the anchor UEs have corresponding system parameters to maintain local consistency of the sidelink system operation.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In various embodiments, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> as the anchor node may autonomously form mode-specific time and frequency radio resource pools. The UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may allocate specific resources for control and data from these radio resource pools to other sidelink receiving UEs. In some instances, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may form a radio resource pool for discovery communication (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;sidelink discovery resource pool&#x201d;). In other instances, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may form radio resource pools for control and data communications, such as a control channel resource pool (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;PSCCH resource pool&#x201d;) and a data channel resource pool (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;PSSCH resource pool&#x201d;). In various embodiments, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may provide a transmission resource pool configuration that includes configuration information for a discovery resource pool configuration and a control/data communication resource pool configuration.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Sidelink receiving UEs (e.g., UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>) may monitor multiple resources to listen for discovery announcements communicated by anchor UEs (e.g., UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>) to minimize and/or avoid sidelink UE interference. In some embodiments, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may autonomously determine a sidelink discovery resource pool that contains certain subframes that carry sidelink control signals, whereas the remainder of subframes may carry the sidelink data. In this respect, sidelink receiving UEs may be assigned time and frequency resources for sending and/or monitoring discovery messages to other sidelink receiving UEs from the sidelink discovery resource pool. In selecting the resources from the pool, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may attempt to avoid the assignment of common time/frequency resources to different sidelink receiving UEs. In some embodiments, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may select the time and frequency resources from the resource pool using a randomization parameter to minimize (or at least reduce) the number of resource allocation conflicts.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, the discovery resource pool configuration may indicate which RBs are available for discovery transmissions, whether broadcast synchronization signals can be triggered in response to the discovery message, whether such broadcast synchronization signals are to be transmitted at once or periodically, and/or indication of how sidelink radio resources can be allocated to different discovery transmissions (e.g., autonomously by the sidelink anchor UE or sidelink transmitting UE). The discovery resource pool configuration may include additional parameter information that indicates which resources the sidelink receiving UE can monitor for identifying potential discovery announcement messages and other parameter information used for tuning channel estimation and channel decoding operations at the sidelink receiving UE. In operation of the discovery mode, the discovery messages may follow transmission of the broadcast synchronization signals in accordance with the time/frequency resource allocations defined in the discovery resource pool configuration.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In a stand-alone sidelink communication, the radio resource pools for PSCCH and PSSCH may be separate. In some instances, the PSSCH radio resource pool may begin at a fixed time-offset with respect to the PSCCH radio resource pool. In some embodiments, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> as the anchor node may autonomously select a time/frequency resource from the PSCCH radio resource pool based on a randomization parameter to allocate resources for the sidelink control channel, PSCCH. The UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may also autonomously select a time/frequency resource from the PSSCH radio resource pool based on a UE-specific subframe bitmap to allocate resources for the sidelink shared channel, PSSCH. In various embodiments, sidelink communication between sidelink UEs can be facilitated through the use of a transport channel, transport sidelink shared channel (SL-SCH), and its physical counterpart, the PSSCH.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The timing synchronization and system information acquisition by sidelink receiving UEs (e.g., <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>) may be facilitated by a sidelink broadcast transport channel, SL-BCH, and its physical counterpart, PSBCH. These channels may be used for broadcasting a set of preambles and system parameter information within proximity of the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. The set of primary and secondary preambles, PSS and SSS, can be used for synchronization of the sidelink receiving UEs (e.g., <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>). As described herein, the sidelink master information block, SL-MIB, can carry the sidelink system parameter information. Through the acquisition of the PSS/SSS preambles, a proximal sidelink receiving UE (e.g., UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>) may acquire time synchronization with the sidelink anchor UE (e.g., UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>) and obtain its physical identity. The SL-MIB may include system information for initial network access and scheduling information for the RMSI. The SL-MIB may also include one or more predefined sets of initial BWP configurations and/or an initial transmission resource pool configuration. In some aspects, the S-SSB is transmitted within the bandwidth defined in an initial BWP configuration.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">After decoding the SL-MIB, the sidelink receiving UE (e.g., UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>) may recover the RMSI based on a pointer included in a repurposed bit field of the SL-MIB. The RMSI may include additional system parameters. In some aspects, the RMSI includes intra-cell guard band information for NR-U systems for use by the sidelink receiving UE (e.g., UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>) to derive resource block sets. In various embodiments, the RMSI includes transmit resource pool configuration information and/or receive resource pool configuration information. The transmit resource pool configuration information may define a subset of available subframes and resource blocks for sidelink transmission from the sidelink anchor UE (e.g., <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>). The receive resource pool configuration information may define a subset of available subframes and resource blocks for sidelink reception by the sidelink anchor UE. In some aspects, the RMSI includes transmission pattern information, such as S-SSB transmission patterns for rate matching purposes and/or RMSI transmission patterns for monitoring purposes.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some aspects, the RMSI may include an active sidelink BWP configuration to assign an active sidelink BWP to a sidelink receiving UE. The sidelink anchor UE may dynamically assign a sidelink receiving UE to operate over a certain sidelink BWP (e.g., a certain portion of the system BW) using the active sidelink BWP configuration included in the RMSI. The sidelink receiving UE may monitor for signaling information from the sidelink anchor UE in an active sidelink BWP. The active sidelink BWP configuration may correspond to the initial sidelink BWP configuration in some embodiments, or the active sidelink BWP configuration may be different from the initial sidelink BWP configuration in other embodiments. In some aspects, the active sidelink BWP configuration and the initial sidelink BWP configuration may include separate numerologies. In this respect, the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may schedule the UE <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> for a sidelink communication in the active sidelink BWP.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a sidelink communication scheme <b>300</b> according to some aspects of the present disclosure. The scheme <b>300</b> may be employed by UEs such as the UEs <b>115</b> and/or <b>215</b> in a network such as the networks <b>100</b> and/or <b>200</b>. In particular, sidelink UEs may employ the scheme <b>300</b> to communicate sidelink over a shared radio frequency band (e.g., in a shared spectrum or an unlicensed spectrum). The shared radio frequency band may be shared by multiple RATs as discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the x-axis represents time in some arbitrary units, and the y-axis represents frequency in some arbitrary units.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the scheme <b>300</b>, a shared radio frequency band <b>301</b> is partitioned into a plurality of subchannels or frequency subbands <b>302</b> (shown as <b>302</b><sub>S0</sub>, <b>302</b><sub>S1</sub>, <b>302</b><sub>S2</sub>, . . . ) in frequency and a plurality of sidelink frames <b>304</b> (shown as <b>304</b><i>a</i>, <b>304</b><i>b</i>, <b>304</b><i>c</i>, <b>304</b><i>d</i>, . . . ) in time for sidelink communication.

The frequency band <b>301</b> may have any suitable BW and may be partitioned into any suitable number of frequency subbands <b>302</b>. The number of frequency subbands <b>302</b> can be dependent on the sidelink communication BW requirement. The frequency band <b>301</b> may be at any suitable frequencies. In some aspects, the frequency band <b>301</b> is a 2.4 GHz unlicensed band and may have a bandwidth of about 80 megahertz (MHz) partitioned into about fifteen 5 MHz frequency subbands <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">A sidelink UE (e.g., the UEs <b>115</b> and/or <b>215</b>) may be equipped with a wideband receiver and a narrowband transmitter. For instance, the UE may utilize the narrowband transmitter to access a frequency subband <b>302</b><sub>S2 </sub>for sidelink transmission utilizing a frame structure <b>304</b>. The frame structure <b>304</b> is repeated in each frequency subband <b>302</b>. In some instances, there can be a frequency gap or guard band between adjacent frequency subbands <b>302</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, for example, to mitigate adjacent band interference. Thus, multiple sidelink data may be communicated simultaneously in different frequency subbands <b>302</b> (e.g., FDM). The frame structure <b>304</b> is also repeated in time. For instance, the frequency subband <b>302</b><sub>S2 </sub>may be time-partitioned into a plurality of frames with the frame structure <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The frame structure <b>304</b> includes a sidelink resource <b>306</b> in each frequency subband <b>302</b>. A legend <b>305</b> indicates the types of sidelink channels within a sidelink resource <b>306</b>. The sidelink resource <b>306</b> may have a substantially similar structure as an NR sidelink resource. For instance, the sidelink resource <b>306</b> may include a number of subcarriers or RBs in frequency and a number of symbols in time. In some instances, the sidelink resource <b>306</b> may have a duration between about one millisecond (ms) to about 20 ms. Each sidelink resource <b>306</b> may include a PSCCH <b>310</b> and a PSSCH <b>320</b>. The PSCCH <b>310</b> and the PSSCH <b>320</b> can be multiplexed in time and/or frequency. In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, for each sidelink resource <b>306</b>, the PSCCH <b>310</b> is located during the beginning symbol(s) (e.g., about 1 symbol or about 2 symbols) of the sidelink resource <b>306</b> and occupies a portion of a corresponding frequency subband <b>302</b>, and the PSSCH <b>320</b> occupies the remaining time-frequency resources in the sidelink resource <b>306</b>. In some instances, a sidelink resource <b>306</b> may also include a physical sidelink feedback channel (PSFCH), for example, located during the ending symbol(s) of the sidelink resource <b>306</b>. In general, a PSCCH <b>310</b>, a PSSCH <b>320</b>, and/or a PSFCH may be multiplexed in any suitable configuration within a sidelink resource <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As discussed above, the subject technology provides for a sidelink UE configured as a sidelink anchor UE (e.g., <b>115</b><i>j</i>, <b>215</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>) for configuring resource allocations to other sidelink receiving UEs. As such, the sidelink anchor UE can configure the sidelink receiving UE with a resource pool configuration indicating resources in the frequency band <b>301</b> and/or the subbands <b>302</b> and/or timing information associated with the sidelink frames <b>304</b>. For instance, the sidelink anchor UE can provide resource allocation information to sidelink receiving UEs. In some aspects, the sidelink anchor UE can communicate a transmit resource pool configuration in the RMSI, in which the transmit resource pool configuration indicates which radio resources are allocated to the sidelink anchor UE for the sidelink anchor UE to transmit a sidelink communication. In some aspects, the sidelink anchor UE can communicate a receive resource pool configuration in the RMSI, in which the receive resource pool configuration indicates which radio resources are allocated to the sidelink anchor UE for the sidelink anchor UE to receive a sidelink communication. In this respect, sidelink receiving UEs can receive and decode the physical communication channels (e.g., PSCCH <b>310</b>, PSSCH <b>320</b>) from the sidelink anchor UE based on the transmit resource pool configuration, and encode and transmit the PSCCH <b>310</b> and PSSCH <b>320</b> to the sidelink anchor UE based on the receive resource pool configuration.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In sidelink communication, in order for the sidelink receiving UEs to successfully decode the PSCCH <b>310</b> and PSSCH <b>320</b>, information describing the specific resources assigned by the sidelink anchor UE for transmission and the transmission configuration can be carried in the sidelink control information, SCI. In this respect, control information for sidelink communication may be communicated in the form of SCI messages. The SCI message may be transmitted over the PSCCH <b>310</b>, which carries the information related to the transmission of data over the PSSCH <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The SCI may inform the sidelink receiving UEs about a resource reservation interval, a frequency location of initial transmission and retransmission, a time gap between initial transmission and retransmission, and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) used to modulate the data transmitted over the PSSCH <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The SCI messages may be populated based on the modes of radio resource allocations (e.g., mode-1 RRA or mode-2 RRA). For mode-1 RRA, the SCI may be populated using higher layer information carried by L3 control signaling (e.g., RRC, and L1 control signaling configured at a cell, such as BS <b>215</b><i>a</i>). For mode-2 RRA, the SCI may be populated based on autonomous decisions taken by each sidelink anchor UE. The structure of the SCI message may include a frequency hopping flag field, a resource block assignment and hopping resource allocation field, a time resource pattern field, MCS field, a time advance field and a group destination identifier field. The structure of the SCI message may include other additional fields that are suitable to support V2X control signaling. The frequency hopping flag field and the resource block assignment and hopping resource allocation field may provide information for the sidelink receiving UEs to identify the RBs where the data channel (e.g., PSSCH <b>320</b>) resides. The sidelink anchor UE may autonomously configure each of these two fields. The identified RBs may belong to a sidelink communication resource pool (e.g., PSSCH resource pool). The time resource pattern field may provide the time-domain resource allocation for the data channel (e.g., PSSCH <b>320</b>), and in particular the potential subframes used for PSSCH transmission. The MCS field may provide the MCS used for the PSSCH <b>320</b>, which may be autonomously selected by the sidelink anchor UE. The timing advance field may provide a sidelink time adjustment for mode-2 RRA or other applicable mode. The group destination identifier field may indicate a group of sidelink receiving UEs that are potentially interested in the transmitted message from the sidelink anchor UE. This may be used by the sidelink receiving UE to ignore messages destined to other groups of sidelink UEs.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some aspects, the SCI messages may be processed with transport channel encoding to generate SCI message transport blocks, which are then followed with physical channel encoding to generate corresponding PSCCH blocks. The PSCCH blocks are carried on respective subframe resource units for transmission. The sidelink receiving UE may receive one or more resource units over respective subframes to recover the control signaling information, and can extract the data channel allocation and transmission configuration.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The PSCCH <b>310</b> can be used for carrying SCI <b>330</b>. The PSSCH <b>320</b> can be used for carrying sidelink data. The sidelink data can be of various forms and types depending on the sidelink application. For instance, when the sidelink application is a V2X application, the sidelink data may carry V2X data (e.g., vehicle location information, traveling speed and/or direction, vehicle sensing measurements, etc.). Alternatively, when the sidelink application is an IIoT application, the sidelink data may carry IIoT data (e.g., sensor measurements, device measurements, temperature readings, etc.). The PSFCH can be used for carrying feedback information, for example, HARQ ACK/NACK for sidelink data received in an earlier sidelink resource <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some aspects, the scheme <b>300</b> is used for synchronous sidelink communication. In other words, the sidelink UEs are synchronized in time and are aligned in terms of symbol boundary, sidelink resource boundary (e.g., the starting time of sidelink frames <b>304</b>). The sidelink UEs may perform synchronization in a variety of forms, for example, based on sidelink SSBs received from a sidelink UE and/or NR-U SSBs received from a BS (e.g., the BSs <b>105</b> and/or <b>205</b>) while in-coverage of the BS. In some aspects, the sidelink UE may be preconfigured with the resource pool <b>308</b> in the frequency band <b>301</b>, for example, while in a coverage of a serving BS according to a mode-1 RRA configuration. The resource pool <b>308</b> may include a plurality of sidelink resources <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In an NR sidelink frame structure, the sidelink frames <b>304</b> in a resource pool <b>308</b> may be contiguous in time. A sidelink receiving UE (e.g., the UEs <b>115</b> and/or <b>215</b>) may include, in SCI <b>330</b>, a reservation for a sidelink resource <b>306</b> in a later sidelink frame <b>304</b>. Thus, another sidelink UE (e.g., a UE in the same NR-U sidelink system) may perform SCI sensing in the resource pool <b>308</b> to determine whether a sidelink resource <b>306</b> is available or occupied. For instance, if the sidelink UE detected SCI indicating a reservation for a sidelink resource <b>306</b>, the sidelink UE may refrain from transmitting in the reserved sidelink resource <b>306</b>. If the sidelink UE determines that there is no reservation detected for a sidelink resource <b>306</b>, the sidelink UE may transmit in the sidelink resource <b>306</b>. As such, SCI sensing can assist a UE in identifying a target frequency subband <b>302</b> to reserve for sidelink communication and to avoid intra-system collision with another sidelink UE in the NR sidelink system. In some aspects, the UE may be configured with a sensing window for SCI sensing or monitoring to reduce intra-system collision.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some aspects, the sidelink UE may be configured with a frequency hopping pattern. In this regard, the sidelink UE may hop from one frequency subband <b>302</b> in one sidelink frame <b>304</b> to another frequency subband <b>302</b> in another sidelink frame <b>304</b>. In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, during the sidelink frame <b>304</b><i>a</i>, the sidelink UE transmits SCI <b>330</b> in the sidelink resource <b>306</b> located in the frequency subband <b>302</b><sub>S2 </sub>to reserve a sidelink resource <b>306</b> in a next sidelink frame <b>304</b><i>b </i>located at the frequency subband <b>302</b><sub>S1 </sub>Similarly, during the sidelink frame <b>304</b><i>b</i>, the sidelink UE transmits SCI <b>332</b> in the sidelink resource <b>306</b> located in the frequency subband <b>302</b><sub>S1 </sub>to reserve a sidelink resource <b>306</b> in a next sidelink frame <b>304</b><i>c </i>located at the frequency subband <b>302</b><sub>S1</sub>.

Thus, a sidelink UE may monitor SCI transmitted by other sidelink UEs. Upon detecting SCI in a sidelink resource <b>306</b>, the sidelink UE may determine whether the sidelink UE is the target receiver based on the destination ID. If the sidelink UE is the target receiver, the sidelink UE may proceed to receive and decode the sidelink data indicated by the SCI. In some aspects, multiple sidelink UEs may simultaneously communicate sidelink data in a sidelink frame <b>304</b> in different frequency subband (e.g., via FDM). For instance, in the sidelink frame <b>304</b><i>b</i>, one pair of sidelink UEs may communicate sidelink data using a sidelink resource <b>306</b> in the frequency subband <b>302</b><sub>S2 </sub>while another pair of sidelink UEs may communicates sidelink data using a sidelink resource <b>306</b> in the frequency subband <b>302</b><sub>S1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The sidelink mechanisms described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> allow for a group of sidelink UEs to communicate in a shared frequency band (e.g., NR-U). In some aspects, these mechanisms may be used for standalone communications, including scenarios in which one or more of the UEs is not associated with a subscription. In some aspects, the mechanisms described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may involve a dynamic sidelink discovery and communication process, which may involve significant coordination and/or standardization between the UEs. In some instances, it may be difficult or impractical to have such coordination between the sidelink UEs. For example, the UEs may be provided by different manufacturers and/or may be associated with different service providers. Accordingly, designating and indicating time/frequency resources for the PSSCH <b>320</b> and PSCCH <b>310</b> may be difficult. The present disclosure describes schemes and methods for indicating sidelink discovery information based on periodic synchronization communications, such as a sidelink synchronization signal block (S-SSB). For example, aspects of the present disclosure provide mechanisms for communicating a discovery signal, which may include RMSI as discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, in an unoccupied portion of a subband carrying a synchronization communication, and time-aligned with the synchronization communication. Thus, a first sidelink UE (e.g., an anchor UE) may indicate discovery information to other sidelink UEs in a way that makes efficient use of resources associated with predefined synchronization signaling. In addition to improving network efficiency, these mechanisms may reduce or eliminate the concern for coordination between manufacturers and/or service providers to agree to standards for sidelink communication in shared frequency bands.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a sidelink communication scheme <b>400</b> according to some aspects of the present disclosure.

Thus, the sidelink connection configuration may provide configuration information that can be used by a plurality of sidelink UEs to self-organize and coordinate transmissions, use of sidelink channel resources, detect and sync with other UEs, designate a coordinating or anchor UE, set up resource pools, and/or any other sidelink function.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some aspects, transmitting the discovery signal <b>420</b> includes transmitting a physical shared channel. For example, the physical shared channel may be similar or identical to the PSSCH, in some aspects. In some aspects, the physical shared channel transmitted by the first sidelink UE may differ from a PSSCH in that control information (e.g., SCI) may be carried in the synchronization communication. For example, an MIB of a PBCH may carry the control information, as explained above. In some aspects, the first sidelink UE <b>415</b><i>a </i>may transmit multiple repetitions of the discovery signal <b>420</b> in a period of time. For example, the first sidelink UE <b>415</b><i>a </i>may transmit multiple repetitions of the discovery signal <b>420</b> within 80 ms intervals, or any other suitable interval.

For example, the first sidelink UE <b>415</b><i>a </i>may transmit the discovery signal <b>420</b> in a second plurality of RBs that is contiguous with a first plurality of RBs used to transmit the synchronization communication. In some aspects, the number of RBs used by the first sidelink UE to transmit the discovery signal <b>420</b> may depend on the subcarrier spacing of the shared frequency band. For example, if the shared frequency band is associated with a subcarrier spacing of 30 kHz, the first sidelink UE <b>415</b><i>a </i>may transmit the discovery signal <b>420</b> in a contiguous group of 36 RBs, and may transmit the synchronization communication in a contiguous group of 11 RBs. In another example, if the shared frequency band is associated with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz, the first sidelink UE may transmit the discovery signal <b>420</b> in a contiguous group of 72 RBs.

Further, transmitting the discovery signal <b>420</b> in this way may provide a flexible and inclusive discovery signal <b>420</b>ing scheme that can be used by devices associated with a variety of network service providers and equipment manufacturers.

As explained above, the second portion of the subband may be contiguous with the first portion of the subband. For example, the first sidelink UE may transmit the discovery signal in a second plurality of RBs that is contiguous with a first plurality of RBs used to transmit the synchronization communication. In some aspects, the number of RBs used by the first sidelink UE to transmit the discovery signal may depend on the subcarrier spacing of the shared frequency band. For example, if the shared frequency band is associated with a subcarrier spacing of 30 kHz, the first sidelink UE may transmit the discovery signal in a contiguous group of 36 RBs, and may transmit the synchronization communication in a contiguous group of 11 RBs. In another example, if the shared frequency band is associated with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz, the first sidelink UE may transmit the discovery signal in a contiguous group of 72 RBs. However, it will be understood that these values are examples, and that the first sidelink UE may transmit the discovery sidelink in any suitable number of RBs.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Further, as mentioned above, the first sidelink UE transmits the discovery signal in the first slot, which is the same slot used to transmit the synchronization communication. In some aspects, the first sidelink UE may transmit, and the second sidelink UE may receive, the discovery signal in the same 13 OFDM symbols used to transmit the synchronization communication, where the 14<sup>th </sup>symbol is an idle symbol, or gap symbol. Accordingly, the discovery signal and the synchronization communication may be aligned in the time domain.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some aspects, the first sidelink UE transmits the discovery signal such that it is quasi co-located (QCL) with the synchronization communication. Further, in some aspects, the first sidelink UE may transmit the discovery signal using an antenna port that is the same antenna portion used to transmit the synchronization communication. In some aspects, by transmitting the discovery signal such that it is aligned in time and QCL with the synchronization communication, and such that the discovery signal occupies a portion of the subband that is not occupied by the synchronization communication (e.g., S-SSB), the first sidelink UE may use network resources efficiently to send sidelink configuration information for sidelink coordination. Further, transmitting the discovery signal in this way may provide a flexible and inclusive discovery signaling scheme that can be used by devices associated with a variety of network service providers and equipment manufacturers.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">For example, the method <b>800</b> may be used by UEs that have no network subscription, in some aspects.

The synchronization communication may indicate a location of a discovery signal in a second portion of the subband of the shared frequency band. In some aspects, receiving the synchronization communication includes receiving a synchronization signal block (SSB), which includes a physical broadcast channel (PBCH), a primary synchronization signal (PSS), and a secondary synchronization signal (SSS). The SSB may be a sidelink SSB (S-SSB), for example. In some aspects, the first sidelink UE may receive a PBCH carrying a master information block (MIB). The MIB may have a structure similar or identical to the structure of the MIB <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. For example, the MIB may include a sidelink resource configuration that includes or indicates a modulation coding scheme, a resource block (RB) allocation, a transport block (TB) size, a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) pattern, and/or any other suitable parameter associated with the discovery signal. In some aspects, the first sidelink UE receives a PBCH including an indication of a first RB of the discovery signal and a size (e.g., in RBs) of the discovery signal. In some aspects, the first sidelink UE may also receive an indication of the location and/or periodicity of reference signals carried in the discovery signal. The synchronization information may include any suitable parameter or information to assist the first UE in detecting and decoding the discovery signal.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The first portion of the subband may include one or more contiguous RBs in the subband. In some aspects, the subband may be described as a channel having a bandwidth of 20 MHz, 80 MHz, 10 MHz, or any other suitable bandwidth, both greater or smaller. The bandwidth of the subband may also be described or defined in terms of RBs. For example, the subband may include 50 RBs, 100 RBs, or any other suitable number of RBs, both greater or smaller. The first sidelink UE may receive the synchronization communication in the first portion of the plurality of RBs in the subband. In one aspect, the first portion of the subband includes 11 RBs. In some aspects, at least one of the RBs may be at or near an edge (e.g., lowest frequency or highest frequency) of the subband. For example, a first RB of the first portion of the subband may be a first RB of the subband. In other aspects, the first RB of the first portion may not the be first RB of the subband. For example, the subband may include one or more RBs on either side of the first portion of the subband, where the synchronization communication is transmitted in the first portion of the subband. In some instances, the first sidelink UE may utilize one or more components, such as the processor <b>702</b>, the sidelink configuration module <b>708</b>, the transceiver <b>710</b>, the modem <b>712</b>, and the one or more antennas <b>716</b>, to perform the actions of block <b>910</b>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">At block <b>920</b>, the first sidelink UE receives, from the second sidelink UE in the first slot and in the second portion of the subband of the shared frequency band, the discovery signal. The first sidelink UE may receive the discovery signal based on a waveform similar or identical to a PSSCH communication. Accordingly, the first sidelink UE may detect or decode the discovery signal based on a DMRS pattern, MCS, RB allocation, TB size, and/or any other waveform parameter based on the respective parameters of a PSSCH waveform. In some aspects, the information carried in the discovery signal may be similar or identical to remaining minimum system information (RMSI). The discovery signal may include or indicate one or more sidelink communication parameters. For example, the discovery signal may provide configuration information that can be used by a plurality of sidelink UEs to self-organize and coordinate transmissions, use of sidelink channel resources, detect and sync with other UEs, provide a coordinating or anchor UE, set up resource pools, and/or any other sidelink function.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In some aspects, receiving the discovery signal includes transmitting a physical shared channel. For example, the physical shared channel may be similar or identical to the physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH), in some aspects. The physical shared channel received by the first sidelink UE may differ from a PSSCH in that control information (e.g., SCI) may be carried in the synchronization communication. For example, the MIB of the PBCH may carry the control information, as explained above. In some aspects, the first sidelink UE may receive multiple repetitions of the discovery signal in a period of time. For example, the first sidelink UE may receive multiple repetitions of the discovery signal within 80 ms intervals, or any other suitable interval.
