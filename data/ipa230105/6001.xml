The micro lens array includes a plurality of micro lenses corresponding to the sub-pixels one-to-one. The plurality of micro lenses is arranged above the corresponding sub-pixels. The light effect of a front viewing angle refers to a light output efficiency of a unit area of the display panel in a normal direction of the plane where the display panel is located. Because a micro lens converges a light emitted from the sub-pixels at a large angle to a small angle, an intensity of the emitted light at the large angle is weaker and causes a color shift.

In the first dimming area A<b>1</b>, a proportion of refraction is greater than the proportion of reflection in an outgoing light. In the second dimming area, the reflection ratio is greater than the refraction ratio, so that an area dominated by the reflection ratio and an area dominated by the refraction ratio in the display module are mixed to strike a balance between the light effect of the front viewing angle and the brightness of the large viewing angle and ensure the light effect of the front viewing angle, the brightness of the large viewing angle and chromaticity characteristics at a same time.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">When the second dimming layer <b>12</b> and the fourth dimming layer <b>14</b> are made of the same high refractive index material, and the first dimming layer <b>11</b> and the third dimming layer <b>13</b> are two different low refractive index materials.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Due to factors such as a using or forming process of the display module, light effects of the front viewing angle of the first display area and the second display area of the display module are greatly different, resulting in different brightness of different display areas of the display module.

In the direction perpendicular to the display panel <b>10</b>, in the first display area, an area ratio of the first dimming area is greater than an area ratio of the second dimming area, in the second display area, an area ratio of the first dimming area is smaller than an area ratio of the second dimming area, which is used to reduce an absolute value of the difference between the light effects of the front viewing angle of the first display area and the second display area. Since the area ratio of the first dimming area in the first display area is greater than the area ratio of the second dimming area, the refraction ratio is relatively large, which can improve the light effect of the front viewing angle of the first display area. The area ratio of the first dimming area in the second display area is smaller than the area ratio of the second dimming area, so the reflection ratio is relatively large, which can reduce the light effect of the front viewing angle of the second display area. Therefore, embodiments of the present disclosure provide solutions to solve the problem that the light effect of the front viewing angle of the first display area is less than the light effect of the front viewing angle of the second display area, reduce the absolute value of the difference between the light effects of the front viewing angle, and improve a brightness uniformity of the entire display module.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> illustrates a curve diagram of a refraction ratio and a reflection ratio of a dimming layer with a lower refractive index in a dimming structure.
