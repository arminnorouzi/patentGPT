Hyper-ubiquitous and deeply entrenched in the lifestyles of people around the world, many of these devices transcend cultural and economic barriers. Computationally, these computing devices offer speed and storage capabilities comparable to engineering workstation or workgroup computers from less than ten years ago, and typically include powerful media processors, rendering them suitable for real-time sound synthesis and other musical applications. Indeed, some modern devices, such as iPhone&#xae;, iPad&#xae;, iPod Touch&#xae; and other iOS&#xae; or Android devices, support audio and video processing quite capably, while at the same time providing platforms suitable for advanced user interfaces.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Applications such as the Smule Ocarina&#x2122;, Leaf Trombone&#xae;, I Am T-Pain&#x2122;, AutoRap&#xae;, Smule (fka Sing! Karaoke&#x2122;), Guitar! By Smule&#xae;, and Magic Piano&#xae; apps available from Smule, Inc. have shown that advanced digital acoustic techniques may be delivered using such devices in ways that provide compelling musical experiences. As researchers seek to transition their innovations to commercial applications deployable to modern handheld devices and media application platforms within the real-world constraints imposed by processor, memory and other limited computational resources thereof and/or within communications bandwidth and transmission latency constraints typical of wireless networks, significant practical challenges continue to present. Improved techniques and functional capabilities are desired, particularly relative to audiovisual content and user interfaces.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has been discovered that, despite practical limitations imposed by mobile device platforms and media application execution environments, audiovisual performances, including vocal music, may be captured and coordinated with audiovisual content, including performances of other users, in ways that create compelling user experiences. In some cases, the vocal performances of individual users are captured (together with performance synchronized video) on mobile devices in the context of a karaoke-style presentation of lyrics in correspondence with audible renderings of a backing track. For example, performance capture can be facilitated using user interface designs whereby a user vocalist is visually presented with lyrics and pitch cues and whereby a temporally synchronized audible rendering of an audio backing track is provided. Exemplary techniques, including exemplary techniques for capture, coordination and mixing of audiovisual content for geographically distributed performers, are detailed in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 9,866,731, filed Oct. 30, 2015, entitled &#x201c;COORDINATING AND MIXING AUDIOVISUAL CONTENT CAPTURED FROM GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTRIBUTED PERFORMERS,&#x201d; the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Building on these and related techniques, user interface improvements are envisioned to provide user vocalists with mechanisms for seeding subsequent performances by other users (e.g., joiners). In some cases, a seed may be a full-length seed spanning much or all of a pre-existing audio (or audiovisual) work and mixing, to seed further the contributions of one or more joiners, a user's captured media content for at least some portions of the audio (or audiovisual) work. In some cases, a short seed may be employed spanning less than all (and in some cases, much less than all) of the audio (or audiovisual) work. For example, a verse, chorus, refrain, hook or other limited &#x201c;chunk&#x201d; of an audio (or audiovisual) work may constitute a seed in some cases or embodiments. Whatever the extent or scope of the seed, a seeding user may ask (or call) others to join. Typically, a call invites other users to join the full-length or short form seed by singing along, singing a particular vocal part or musical section, singing harmony or other duet part, rapping, talking, clapping, recording video, adding a video clip from camera roll, etc. The resulting group performance, whether full-length or just a chunk, may be posted, livestreamed, or otherwise disseminated in a social network.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A seed or seed portion may be selected by the seeding user using scrubbing techniques that allow forward and backward traversal of audiovisual content, optionally including pitch cues, waveform- or envelope-type performance timelines, lyrics, video and/or other temporally-synchronized content at record-time, during edits, and/or in playback. In this way, recapture of selected performance portions, coordination of group parts, and overdubbing may all be facilitated. Direct scrolling to arbitrary points in the performance timeline, lyrics, pitch cues and other temporally-synchronized content allows user to conveniently move through a capture or audiovisual edit session. For selections or embodiments that involve short seeds, scrubbing techniques may be employed to define start and stop points that delimit a particular seed portion or chunk. Likewise, in the case of full-length seeds, scrubbing techniques may be employed to define start and stop points that delimit portions of a performance timeline to which a joiner is invited to contribute. In some cases, the user vocalist may be guided through the performance timeline, lyrics, pitch cues and other temporally-synchronized content in correspondence with group part information such as in a guided short-form capture for a duet. In some or all of the cases, a scrubber allows user vocalists to conveniently move forward and backward through the temporally-synchronized content. In some cases, temporally synchronized video capture and/or playback is also supported in connection with the scrubber. Note that while scrubbing may be provided for synchronized traversal of multiple media lines (e.g., backing audio, vocals, lyrics, pitch cue and/or group part information), single-medium scrubbing is also envisioned.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Scrubbing techniques need not be employed in all cases or embodiments. In some cases or embodiments, portions of a performance timeline (often portions that correspond to musical sections) may be marked and labelled for user selection. Marking/labeling may be based on human or automated sources. For example, particular portions may be marked or labelled by a user that originally uploads a track or corresponding lyrics or by a media content curator. In a complementary fashion or alternatively, particular portions may be marked or labelled by a machine learning robot trained to identify section and boundaries (e.g., from an audio backing or vocal track, lyrics or based on crowd-sourced data such as where user tend to sing the most or most loudly).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition to user interface and platform features designed to facilitate non-linear media segment capture and edit, it is envisioned that collaboration features may be provided to allow users to contribute media content and/or other temporally synchronized information to an evolving performance timeline. To facilitate collaboration and/or accretion of content, a shared service platform may expose media content and performance timeline data as a multi-user concurrent access database. Alternatively or additionally, particularly once a performance timeline has been at least partially defined with seed audio or video, collaboration may be facilitated through posting (e.g., via the shared service platform or otherwise in a peer-to-peer manner) of the performance timeline for joins by additional users who may, in turn, capture, edit and accrete to the performance timeline additional media segments, lyric information, pitch tracks, vocal part designations, and/or media segment-based or performance/style/genre-mapped audio or video effects/filters. In some cases, additional captures, edits and accretions to the performance timeline are accomplished using the user interface and platform features described herein to facilitate non-linear media segment capture and edit of audiovisual content and data for karaoke-style performances.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other user interface improvements will be understood by persons of skill in the art having benefit of the present disclosure in connection with other aspects of an audiovisual performance capture system. Optionally, in some cases or embodiments, vocal audio can be pitch-corrected in real-time at the mobile device (or more generally, at a portable computing device such as a mobile phone, personal digital assistant, laptop computer, notebook computer, pad-type computer or netbook) or on a content or media application server in accord with pitch correction settings. In some cases, pitch correction settings code a particular key or scale for the vocal performance or for portions thereof. In some cases, pitch correction settings include a score-coded melody and/or harmony sequence supplied with, or for association with, the lyrics and backing tracks. Harmony notes or chords may be coded as explicit targets or relative to the score coded melody or even actual pitches sounded by a vocalist, if desired.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Based on the compelling and transformative nature of the pitch-corrected vocals, performance synchronized video and score-coded harmony mixes, user/vocalists may overcome an otherwise natural shyness or angst associated with sharing their vocal performances. Instead, even geographically distributed vocalists are encouraged to share with friends and family or to collaborate and contribute vocal performances as part of social music networks. In some implementations, these interactions are facilitated through social network- and/or eMail-mediated sharing of performances and invitations to join in a group performance. In some implementations, livestreaming may be supported. Living room-style, large screen user interfaces may facilitate these interactions. Using uploaded vocals captured at clients such as the aforementioned portable computing devices, a content server (or service) can mediate such coordinated performances by manipulating and mixing the uploaded audiovisual content of multiple contributing vocalists. Depending on the goals and implementation of a particular system, in addition to video content, uploads may include pitch-corrected vocal performances (with or without harmonies), dry (i.e., uncorrected) vocals, and/or control tracks of user key and/or pitch correction selections, etc.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Social music can be mediated in any of a variety of ways. For example, in some implementations, a first user's vocal performance, captured against a backing track at a portable computing device and typically pitch-corrected in accord with score-coded melody and/or harmony cues, is supplied to other potential vocal performers as a seed. Performance synchronized video is also captured and may be supplied with the pitch-corrected, captured vocals. The supplied vocals are mixed with backing instrumentals/vocals and form the backing track for capture of a second user's vocals. Often, successive vocal contributors are geographically separated and may be unknown (at least a priori) to each other, yet the intimacy of the vocals together with the collaborative experience itself tends to minimize this separation. As successive vocal performances and video are captured (e.g., at respective portable computing devices) and accreted as part of the social music experience, the backing track against which respective vocals are captured may evolve to include previously captured vocals of other contributors.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some cases, a complete performance, or a complete performance of a particular vocal part (e.g., Part A or B in duet), may constitute the seed for a social music collaboration. However, using techniques described herein, capture of even small or isolated portions of an overall performance, e.g., a refrain, hook, intro, outro, duet or group part, verse or other limited portion, section or select selected segment of a larger performance may be conveniently captured, re-captured, or edited for use as a collaboration seed, regardless of whether it constitutes a complete performance timeline. In some cases, select sections, locations or pre-marked/labeled segment boundaries may correspond to elements of musical structure. As a result, embodiments in accordance with the present invention(s) may facilitate &#x201c;small seed&#x201d; collaboration mechanics in a social music network of geographically distributed performers.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some cases, captivating visual animations and/or facilities for listener comment and ranking, as well as duet, glee club or choral group formation or accretion logic are provided in association with an audible rendering of a vocal performance (e.g., that captured and pitch-corrected at another similarly configured mobile device) mixed with backing instrumentals and/or vocals. Synthesized harmonies and/or additional vocals (e.g., vocals captured from another vocalist at still other locations and optionally pitch-shifted to harmonize with other vocals) may also be included in the mix. Audio or visual filters or effects may be applied or reapplied post-capture for dissemination or posting of content. In some cases, disseminated or posted content may take the form of a collaboration request or open call for additional vocalists. Geocoding of captured vocal performances (or individual contributions to a combined performance) and/or listener feedback may facilitate animations or display artifacts in ways that are suggestive of a performance or endorsement emanating from a particular geographic locale on a user-manipulable globe. In these ways, implementations of the described functionality can transform otherwise mundane mobile devices and living room or entertainment systems into social instruments that foster a unique sense of global connectivity, collaboration and community.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments in accordance with the present invention(s), a system includes first and second media capture devices communicatively coupled via respective network communication interfaces for multi-performer collaboration relative to a baseline media encoding of an audio work.

Vocal audio together with performance synchronized video may be captured and coordinated with audiovisual contributions of other users to form multi-performer, duet-style or glee club-style audiovisual performances. Nonlinear capture and/or edit of individual segments or portions of a performance timeline allows freeform collaboration of multiple contributors, typically with independent and geographically-distributed audio and/or video capture. In some cases, audio and video may be separately captured and associated after capture. In some cases, the performances of individual users (audio, video or, in some cases, audio together with performance synchronized video) are captured on mobile devices, television-type display and/or set-top box equipment in the context of karaoke-style presentations of lyrics in correspondence with audible renderings of a backing track or vocal performance. Captured audio, video or audiovisual content of one contributor may serve as a seed for a group performance.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Karaoke-Style Vocal Performance Capture</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts information flows amongst illustrative mobile phone-type portable computing devices (<b>101</b>A, <b>1018</b>) and a content server <b>110</b> in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention(s). In the illustrated flows, lyrics <b>102</b>, pitch cues <b>105</b> and a backing track <b>107</b> are supplied to one or more of the portable computing devices (<b>101</b>A, <b>1018</b>) to facilitate vocal (and in some cases, audiovisual) capture. User interfaces of the respective devices provide a scrubber (<b>103</b>A, <b>103</b>B), whereby a given user-vocalist is able to move forward and backward through temporally synchronized content (e.g., audio, lyrics, pitch cues, etc.) using gesture control on a touchscreen. In some cases, scrubber control also allows forward and backward movement through performance-synchronized video.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto, pitch-corrected, karaoke-style, vocal capture using mobile phone-type provides a useful descriptive context. For example, in some embodiments consistent with that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an iPhone&#x2122; handheld available from Apple Inc. (or more generally, a portable computing device <b>101</b>A, <b>1018</b>) hosts software that executes in coordination with a content server <b>110</b> to provide vocal capture, often with continuous real-time, score-coded pitch correction and/or harmonization of the captured vocals. Performance synchronized (or performance-synchronizable) video may be captured using a camera provided using an on-board camera. In some embodiments, audio, video and/or audiovisual content may be captured using, or in connection with, a camera or cameras configured with a television (or other audiovisual equipment) or connected set-top box equipment (not specifically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In some embodiments, traditional desk/laptop computers may be appropriately configured and host an application or web application to support some of the functions described herein.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Capture of a two-part performance is illustrated (e.g., as a duet in which audiovisual content <b>106</b>A and <b>106</b>B is separately captured from individual vocalists); however, persons of skill in the art having benefit of the present disclosure will appreciate that techniques of the present invention may also be employed in solo and in larger multipart performances. In general, audiovisual content may be posted, streamed, or may initiate or be captured in response to a collaboration request. In the illustrated embodiment, content selection, group performances and dissemination of captured audiovisual performances are all coordinated via content server <b>110</b>. A content selection and performance accretion module <b>112</b> of content server <b>110</b> performs audio mixing and video stitching in the illustrated design, while audiovisual render/stream control module <b>113</b> supplies group audiovisual performance mix <b>111</b> to a downstream audience. In other embodiments, peer-to-peer communications may be employed for at least some of the illustrated flows.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some cases, a wireless local area network may support communications between a portable computing device <b>101</b>A instance, audiovisual and/or set-top box equipment, and a wide-area network gateway (not specifically shown) that, in turn, communicates with a remote device <b>101</b>B and/or content server <b>110</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a configuration in which content server <b>110</b> plays an intermediating role between portable computing devices <b>101</b>A and <b>101</b>B, persons of skill in the art having benefit of the present disclosure will appreciate that peer-to-peer or host-to-guest communication between portable computing devices <b>101</b>A and <b>101</b>B may also, or alternatively, be supported. Persons of skill in the art will recognize that any of a variety of data communications facilities, including 802.11 Wi-Fi, Bluetooth&#x2122;, 4G-LTE, 5G, or other communications, wireless, wired data networks, and/or wired or wireless audiovisual interconnects may be employed, individually or in combination, to facilitate communications and/or audiovisual rendering described herein.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As is typical of karaoke-style applications (such as the Smule app available from Smule, Inc.), a backing track of instrumentals and/or vocals can be audibly rendered for a user/vocalist to sing against. In such cases, lyrics may be displayed (<b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B) in correspondence with local audible rendering to facilitate a karaoke-style vocal performance by a given user. Note that, in general, individual users may perform the same or different parts in a group performance and that audio or audiovisual captures need not be, and typically are not, simultaneous. In some embodiments, audio or audiovisual capture of performer contributions may be independent and asynchronous, often spanning time zones and continents. However, in some embodiments, live streaming techniques may be employed. In the illustrated configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, lyrics, timing information, pitch and harmony cues, backing tracks (e.g., instrumentals/vocals), performance coordinated video, etc. may all be sourced from a network-connected content server <b>110</b>. In some cases or situations, backing audio and/or video may be rendered from a media store such as a music library that is resident or accessible from the handheld, set-top box, content server, etc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">User vocal or audiovisual content <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B is captured at respective devices <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B, optionally pitch-corrected continuously and in real-time (either at the handheld or using computational facilities of audiovisual display and/or set-top box equipment not specifically shown) and audibly rendered to provide the user with an improved tonal quality rendition of his/her own vocal performance. Pitch correction is typically based on score-coded note sets or cues (e.g., pitch and harmony cues <b>105</b>), which provide continuous pitch-correction algorithms with performance synchronized sequences of target notes in a current key or scale. In addition to performance synchronized melody targets, score-coded harmony note sequences (or sets) provide pitch-shifting algorithms with additional targets (typically coded as offsets relative to a lead melody note track and typically scored only for selected portions thereof) for pitch-shifting to harmony versions of the user's own captured vocals. In some embodiments, note/pitch targets and score-coded timing information may be used to evaluate vocal performance quality.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Lyrics <b>102</b>, melody and harmony track note sets <b>105</b> and related timing and control information may be encapsulated in an appropriate container or object (e.g., in a Musical Instrument Digital Interface, MIDI, or Java Script Object Notation, json, type format) for supply together with the backing track <b>107</b>. Using such information, portable computing devices <b>101</b>A, <b>1018</b> may display lyrics (<b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B) and even visual cues (<b>105</b>A, <b>105</b>B) related to target notes, harmonies and currently detected vocal pitch in correspondence with an audible performance of the backing track(s) so as to facilitate a karaoke-style vocal performance by a user. Thus, if an aspiring vocalist selects &#x201c;When I Was Your Man&#x201d; as popularized by Bruno Mars, your_man.json and your_man.m4a may be downloaded from the content server (if not already available or cached based on prior download) and, in turn, used to provide background music, synchronized lyrics and, in some situations or embodiments, score-coded note tracks for continuous, real-time pitch-correction while the user sings. Optionally, at least for certain embodiments or genres, harmony note tracks may be score coded for harmony shifts to captured vocals.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Typically, a captured pitch-corrected (possibly harmonized) vocal performance together with performance synchronized video is saved locally, on the handheld device or set-top box, as one or more audio or audiovisual files and is subsequently compressed and encoded for upload (<b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B) to content server <b>110</b> as MPEG-4 container files. While MPEG-4 is an exemplary standard for the coded representation and transmission of digital multimedia content for the Internet, mobile networks and advanced broadcast applications, other suitable codecs, compression techniques, coding formats and/or containers may be employed, if desired. Depending on the implementation, encodings of dry vocal and/or pitch-corrected vocals may be uploaded (<b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B) to content server <b>110</b>. In general, such vocals (encoded, e.g., in an MPEG-4 container or otherwise) whether already pitch-corrected or pitch-corrected at content server <b>110</b> can then be mixed, e.g., with backing audio and other captured (and possibly pitch shifted) vocal performances, to produce files or streams of quality or coding characteristics selected accord with capabilities or limitations a particular target or network. In some embodiments, audio processing and mixing and/or video synchronization and stitching to provide a composite, multi-performer, audiovisual work may be performed at a server or service platform such as content server <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0000">Non-Linear Segment Capture and/or Edit</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts in somewhat greater detail an exemplary user interface presentation of lyrics <b>102</b>A, pitch cues <b>105</b>A and a scrubber <b>103</b>A in connection with a vocal capture session on portable computing device <b>101</b>A (recall <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). A current vocal capture point is notated (<b>281</b>A, <b>281</b>B, <b>281</b>C) in multiple frames of reference (e.g., in lyrics <b>102</b>A, in pitch cues <b>105</b>A and in the audio envelope depiction of a performance timeline in scrubber <b>103</b>A). Any of a variety of notation techniques or symbology may be employed. In general, particular forms of user interface notation and symbology are matters of design choice, but may include color cues (such as for word, line or syllable position <b>281</b>B in lyrics <b>102</b>A), vertical or horizontal bar markers (see notations <b>281</b>A, <b>281</b>C in pitch cue <b>105</b>A and scrubber <b>103</b>A portions of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> user interface presentation), or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">As will be understood with reference to subsequent drawings and description, the exemplary user interface presentation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (and variations thereon) provides a mechanism whereby the user may move forward or backward in a performance timeline based on on-screen gesture control. By manipulating a current position <b>281</b>C forward or backward in scrubber <b>103</b>A, vocal capture point is correspondingly moved forward or backward in the performance timeline. Correspondingly, lyrics <b>102</b>A and pitch cues <b>105</b>A advance or rewind in a visually synchronized manner. Likewise, position in backing tracks and/or captured audio, video or audiovisual content is advanced or rewound. In this way, an on-screen user interface manipulation by the user of portable computing device <b>101</b>A moves forward or backward and facilitates non-linear traversal of the performance timeline. For example, rather than starting vocal, video or audiovisual capture at the beginning of a performance timeline or resuming at a most recent stop or pause position, the user may move forward or backward to an arbitrary point in the performance timeline. Re-recording, overdubbing, and/or selectively capturing only particular sections or portions of a performance are all facilitated by the provided non-linear access. In some embodiments, non-linear access allows audio and video to be captured in separate passes.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">A current position <b>281</b>C in scrubber <b>103</b>A, which is visually presented as an audio envelope of the performance timeline, is laterally-manipulable with leftward (temporally backward) and rightward (temporally forward) swipe-type gestures on the touchscreen display of portable computing device <b>101</b>A. User interface gesture conventions are matters of design choice, and other gestures may be employed to similar or complementary effect, if desired. In some embodiments, current position may also (or alternatively) be manipulated with gestures in pitch track <b>105</b>A or lyrics <b>102</b>A panes of the display. In each case, presentations of the on-screen elements (e.g., pitch track <b>105</b>A, lyrics <b>102</b>A, and audio envelope of the performance timeline) are visually synchronized such that forward or backward movement of one results in corresponding forward or backward movement of the other(s). If and when capture is started or restarted, each of the on-screen elements (e.g., pitch track <b>105</b>A, lyrics <b>102</b>A, and audio envelope of the performance timeline) roll forward in temporal correspondence from a coherent, visually synchronized starting point within the performance timeline. In embodiments or display modes that provide for performance-synchronized video, video roll or capture may optionally be initiated at the visually synchronized starting point within the performance timeline.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates another exemplary user interface mechanic in connection with a vocal capture scrolling behavior wherein a current point (<b>281</b>B) in the presentations of lyrics <b>102</b>A and its corresponding point (<b>281</b>C) in the performance timeline moves forward or backward in correspondence with gestures by a user on a touchscreen of portable computing device <b>101</b>A (recall <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Although an expanded presentation of lyrics <b>102</b>A is provided and pitch cues are hidden in the illustrated embodiment, other embodiments may allocate screen real estate differently. User interface gestures for forward and backward scrolling through lyrics are expressed by the user-vocalist in connection with the on-screen presentation of lyrics using upward or downward movement on the touchscreen of portable computing device <b>101</b>A (recall <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In some situations or embodiments, fine-grain (line-, word- or syllable-level) movement through the lyrics with visually synchronized traversal of other displayed features (e.g., audio envelope of scrubber <b>103</b>A) may be a preferred mechanism for performance timeline traversal by a user vocalist during capture or recapture. As before, the touchscreen gestures provide synchronized movement through lyrics <b>102</b>A and the performance timeline. Additional or alternative gesture expressions may be employed in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">While exemplary user interface features emphasize lyrics and pitch cues, elements of musical structure such as segments, group parts, part A/B in duet, etc. may also be used to mark points in a performance timeline to which a current position may be advanced or rewound.

In general, MIDI, json or other suitable in-memory data representation formats may be employed for pitch, lyrics, musical structure and other information related to a given performance or musical arrangement. Persons of skill in the art having benefit of the present disclosure will appreciate use of any of a variety of data structure indexing techniques to facilitate visually synchronized presentation of a position in a performance timeline, e.g., using scrubber <b>103</b>A, lyrics <b>102</b>A and pitch cue <b>105</b>A portions of a display.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates some illustrative variations on the scrubbing mechanism(s) introduced with reference to the preceding drawings. Specifically, in one illustrated variation, scrubbing is alternatively (or additionally) supported based on side-to-side gestures in the pitch cue presentation portion (<b>105</b>A) of the touchscreen. As before, movement through lyrics (<b>102</b>A) and traversal of an audio signal envelope presentation of the performance timeline (<b>103</b>A) are visually synchronized with the pitch cue-based scrubbing. Vocal parts (e.g., lyrics <b>701</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>702</b>.<b>2</b>) for individual user vocalists may be notated in the performance timeline such as through an alternate color of other on-screen symbology. Similar symbology may be employed in pitch cue <b>105</b>A and timeline scrubber <b>103</b>A portions of the user interface to identify duet (Part A, Part B) or group parts sung or to-be-sung by individual vocalists. In some cases or embodiments, user interface facilities may be provided that advance/rewind to, or select, points of musical structure significance along the performance timeline. Examples include musical section boundaries, successive starts of a next Part A (or Part B) section in a duet, particular musical sections that have been assigned to a user vocalist as part of a collaboration request, etc. Upon loading a musical arrangement, user interfaces and scrubbing mechanisms in accordance with some embodiments of the present inventions allow users to advance/rewind to, or even select, an arbitrary or demarked point, section or segment in the arrangement for vocal, video and/or audiovisual capture, re-capture or playback using performance timeline, lyrics or pitch portions of the visually synchronized presentation.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates use of a captured vocal performance as an audio seed, to which a user adds video, and finally updates a performance time to add or change a flow or a vocal part selection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts an illustrative sequence that includes an additional multi user collaboration aspect. For example, after a first user (user A) captures a vocal performance as an audio seed, a second user (user B) joins user A&#x2032; performance and adds audio and/or video media segments. In the illustrative sequence, user B also adds a vocal part designation, such as by notating particular lyrics as part B of a duet. From there, multiple potential joiners are invited (e.g., as part of an open call) to add additional media content to user A's initial audio seed with the added audio, video and in accordance with vocal part designation by user B.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts a similar sequence with multi-user collaboration, but in which video created or captured by a first user (user A) is provided as an initial seed performance. A second user (user B) joins user A's video and adds an audio segment, here captured vocal audio. User A, in turn, invites users (e.g., user B and others) to add additional audio, here main audio (melody) and two additional vocal harmony parts. The result is video with multiple audio layers added as a collaboration.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts certain exemplary special invite options including user designation of a particular vocal part for subsequent joins and user selection of lyrics to designate a vocal portion for subsequent joins to seed media content (e.g., audio and/or video). In each case, the joiner is guided to sing, or more generally to provide audio for, the designated vocal portion.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">Freeform and collaborative arrangement creation processes are also envisioned. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, STEP 1, a user (user A) may perform and capture a freestyle mode performance, e.g., acoustic audio with performance synchronized video of a guitar performance. User A's initial freeform capture provides an initial seed for further collaboration. Next (in one illustrative flow), a user (e.g., user A or another user B) may enter lyrics (STEP 2) to accompany the audiovisual performance. Timeline editing and scrubbing facilities described herein can be particularly helpful in entering, manipulating and aligning entered lyrics to desired points in the performance timeline. Next (in the illustrated flow), a user (user A, B or another user C) may assign (STEP 3) particular lyric portions to singers (e.g., part A vs. part B in duet). More generally, larger numbers of vocal parts may be assigned in a group arrangement.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">An advanced feature of the freeform and collaborative arrangement creation process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, STEP 4, for at least some embodiments, is provision of a pitch line capture mechanism, whereby an audio track is captured against a karaoke-style roll of the evolving performance timeline and used to compute a pitch track. In general, any of a variety of pitch detection techniques may be applied to compute a pitch track from captured audio. Vocal audio and musical instrument audio (e.g., from a piano) are both envisioned. In each case, compute pitch tracks are added to the performance timeline. Note that the user-generated arrangement need not be limited to lyrics and pitch lines. As an example (see STEP 5+), the media segment capture and edit platform may be extended to allow a user (user A, B, C or still another user D) to designate things like: song part (&#x201c;Chorus&#x201d;, &#x201c;Verse&#x201d;, etc.), harmony part, segment-based video or audio effects/filters, etc. Note also that, while ordered flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is illustrative, other embodiments may vary ordering of steps, omit steps or include additional steps appropriate to a particular freeform collaboration and particular audio or audiovisual work.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Short Seed and Other Variations</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0074">Though much of the foregoing description demonstrates the flexibility of non-linear segment capture and edit techniques in the context of full performance timelines, persons of skill in the art having benefit of the present disclosure will appreciate that collaboration seeds may, but need not, span a full audio (or audiovisual work). In some cases, a seed may be a full-length seed spanning much or all of a pre-existing audio (or audiovisual) work and mixing a seeding user's captured media content for at least some portions of the audio (or audiovisual) work. In some cases, a short seed may be employed that spans less than all (and in some cases, much less than all) of the audio (or audiovisual) work. For example (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>), a verse, chorus, refrain, hook or other limited &#x201c;chunk&#x201d; of an audio (or audiovisual) work may constitute the seed for subsequent joins. Pre-marked portions (here musical sections) of an audio or audiovisual work <b>1301</b> may be selected by the seeding user. The resulting short seed <b>1311</b> constitutes the seed for multiple collaborations (here collabs #1 and #2). Whatever its extent or scope, the seed or seed portion delimits the collaboration request (or call) for others to join. Typically, a call invites other users to join the full-length or short-form seed by singing along, singing a particular vocal part or musical section, singing harmony or other duet part, rapping, talking, clapping, recording video, adding a video clip from camera roll, etc. Invites <b>1321</b> and <b>1322</b> are illustrative in the short seed example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The resulting group performance, whether full-length or just a chunk, may be posted, livestreamed, or otherwise disseminated (<b>1341</b>) in a social network.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">A seed or seed portion may be selected by the seeding user using scrubbing techniques that allow forward and backward traversal of audiovisual content, optionally including pitch cues, waveform- or envelope-type performance timelines, lyrics, video and/or other temporally-synchronized content at record-time, during edits, and/or in playback. In this way, recapture of selected performance portions, coordination of group parts, and overdubbing may all be facilitated. Direct scrolling to arbitrary points in the performance timeline, lyrics, pitch cues and other temporally-synchronized content allows user to conveniently move through a capture or audiovisual edit session. For selections or embodiments that involve short seeds, scrubbing techniques may be employed to define start and stop points that delimit a particular seed portion or chunk. Likewise, in the case of full-length seeds, scrubbing techniques may be employed to define start and stop points that delimit portions of a performance timeline to which a joiner is invited to contribute.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">In some cases, the user vocalist may be guided through the performance timeline, lyrics, pitch cues and other temporally-synchronized content in correspondence with group part information such as in a guided short-form capture for a duet. A scrubber allows user vocalists to conveniently move forward and backward through the temporally-synchronized content. In some cases, temporally synchronized video capture and/or playback is also supported in connection with the scrubber. Note that while scrubbing may be provided for synchronized traversal of multiple media lines (e.g., backing audio, vocals, lyrics, pitch cue and/or group part information), single-medium scrubbing is also envisioned.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">Scrubbing techniques need not be employed in all cases or embodiments. Portions of a performance timeline (often portions that correspond to musical sections) may be marked and labelled for user selection. Marking/labeling may be based on human or automated sources. For example, particular portions may be marked or labelled by a user that originally uploads a track or corresponding lyrics or by a media content curator. In a complementary fashion or alternatively, particular portions may be marked or labelled by a machine learning robot trained to identify section and boundaries (e.g., from an audio backing or vocal track, lyrics or based on crowd-sourced data such as where user tend to sing the most or most loudly). These and other variations will be appreciated by persons of skill in the art having benefit of the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Exemplary Audiovisual Processing Flows, Devices and Systems</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref> illustrate exemplary techniques for capture, coordination and/or mixing of audiovisual content for geographically distributed performers.
