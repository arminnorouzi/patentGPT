ICs often operate in different power modes including RUN, STANDBY and STOP modes for effective power management. In order to reduce wiring complexity, the IC receives the voltage of a single power supply to drive a load when the IC enters a RUN mode.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a conventional integrated circuit (IC) for driving a load. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating the waveforms of nodes and an input signal of a conventional IC for driving a load. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an IC <b>1</b> includes a buffer <b>10</b>, a P-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (PMOSFET) <b>11</b>, an N-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (NMOSFET) <b>12</b>, a voltage regulator <b>13</b>, and conductive terminals <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. The conductive terminal <b>15</b> is coupled to a load <b>16</b>. The load <b>16</b> has parasitic capacitances. The voltage regulator <b>13</b> is coupled to a single power terminal whose voltage is represented by VDDA. The voltage regulator <b>13</b> receives the voltage VDDA and converts the voltage VDDA into a supply voltage VDDIO. In other words, the conductive terminal <b>14</b> has the voltage VDDIO. The voltages of the conductive terminals <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and the gates of the PMOSFET <b>11</b> and the NMOSFET <b>12</b> are respectively the voltages of nodes A, B, C, and D. The buffer <b>10</b> receives an input signal IN to drive the PMOSFET <b>11</b> and the NMOSFET <b>12</b>, thereby charging or discharging the load <b>16</b>. When the voltage of the conductive terminal <b>15</b> changes from logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; to logic &#x201c;1&#x201d;, the PMOSFET <b>11</b> immediately receives the voltage VDDIO to generate a large driving current for driving the load <b>16</b>. Simultaneously, the large driving current causes voltage undershoot at the conductive terminal <b>14</b> such that the load <b>16</b> reads incorrect data. The value of the driving current depends on the resistance of the PMOSFET <b>11</b>. The conductive terminal <b>14</b> has a voltage difference &#x394;V. The voltage difference &#x394;V is expressed by equation (1).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>&#x25b3;V</mi>     <mo>=</mo>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <msubsup>        <mo>&#x222b;</mo>        <mn>0</mn>        <mi>T</mi>       </msubsup>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <mi>I</mi>         <mo>&#x2061;</mo>         <mo>(</mo>         <mi>t</mi>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mi>dt</mi>       </mrow>      </mrow>      <mi>C</mi>     </mfrac>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>1</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Wherein t represents time and C represents the capacitance of an external capacitor <b>17</b>.

The voltage regulator <b>20</b> may be implemented with a low-dropout regulator (LDO), but the invention is not limited thereto. The output terminal <b>25</b> may be, but not limited to, a digital output terminal or a serial peripheral interface (SPI). The voltage regulator <b>20</b> is coupled to a first high-voltage terminal whose first high voltage is represented by VDDA<b>1</b> and the conductive terminal <b>24</b>. The voltage generator <b>21</b> is coupled to a second high-voltage terminal whose second high voltage is represented by VDDA<b>2</b> and the output terminal <b>25</b>. The first high voltage VDDA<b>1</b> is substantially equal to or different from the second high voltage VDDA<b>2</b>. The second high-voltage terminal may be replaced with the first high-voltage terminal. The first high-voltage terminal and the second high-voltage terminal may be external voltage sources or implemented with external capacitors. The output terminal <b>25</b> of the driving device <b>2</b> is coupled to the load <b>3</b>. The voltages of nodes E and F respectively represent the voltages of the conductive terminal <b>24</b> and the output terminal <b>25</b>.

In Step S<b>10</b>, the voltage regulator <b>20</b> receives the first high voltage VDDA<b>1</b> of the first high-voltage terminal and steps down the first high voltage VDDA<b>1</b> to generate a supply voltage VDDIO. The supply voltage VDDIO is lower than the first high voltage VDDA<b>1</b>. For example, the supply voltage VDDIO has a range of 1.4-1.8 V and the first high voltage VDDA<b>1</b> may be 3.3 V. The voltage generator <b>21</b> receives a first control signal C<b>1</b>. The gate of the first NMOSFET <b>22</b> receives a second control signal C<b>2</b> corresponding to the first control signal C<b>1</b>. The gate of the first PMOSFET <b>23</b> receives a third control signal C<b>3</b> corresponding to the second control signal C<b>2</b>. The first control signal C<b>1</b>, the second control signal C<b>2</b>, and the third control signal C<b>3</b> may be digital signals, but the invention is not limited thereto.

The third control signal C<b>3</b> turns off the first PMOSFET <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">In Step S<b>11</b>, the first control signal C<b>1</b> and the second high voltage VDDA<b>2</b> of the second high-voltage terminal drive the voltage generator <b>21</b> to provide a reference voltage VREF for the output terminal <b>25</b> of the driving device <b>2</b> and charge the load <b>3</b> to the reference voltage VREF through the output terminal <b>25</b> for a period T<b>1</b> when the voltage of the first control signal C<b>1</b> changes from logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; to logic &#x201c;1&#x201d;.

During the period T<b>1</b>, the supply voltage VDDIO is not affected due to turning off the first PMOSFET <b>23</b>. The reference voltage VREF is substantially higher than the low voltage of the low-voltage terminal and lower than the supply voltage VDDIO.

In Step S<b>12</b>, the driving current passing through the first PMOSFET <b>23</b> is very small since the reference voltage VREF is near the supply voltage VDDIO. Although the voltage of the node E is immediately decreased by a voltage difference &#x394;V due to the very small driving current, the voltage difference &#x394;V is smaller and the voltage of the node E is very slightly varied. Thus, the voltage of the node E can correspond to the voltage specification of the load <b>3</b>. The voltage of the node F is logic &#x201c;1&#x201d; for a period T<b>2</b>.
