Because of growing concerns over how such ingredients may be obtained, many customers prefer to avoid cosmetics containing such ingredients, opting instead for products not relying upon such ingredients. However, without such ingredients (particularly beeswax), it can be difficult to obtain a creamy and desirable texture in a lipstick composition.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat.

Transfer resistance may be evaluated by any method known in the art for evaluating such. For example, transfer resistance of a composition may be evaluated by a &#x201c;kiss&#x201d; test or material transfer test. This test may involve application of the composition to lips, followed by rubbing a material, for example, a sheet of paper or cotton ball, against the lips after expiration of a certain amount of time following application, such as 2 minutes after application. Similarly, transfer resistance of a composition may be evaluated by the amount of product transferred from a wearer to any other substrate, such as transfer from the lips of an individual to an article of clothing when putting on the clothing after the expiration of a certain amount of time following application of the composition to the lips. The amount of composition transferred to the substrate (e.g., clothing, paper or cotton ball) may then be evaluated and compared. For example, a composition may be transfer resistant if a majority of the product is left on the wearer's lips. Further, the amount transferred may be compared with that transferred by other compositions, such as commercially available compositions. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, little or no composition is transferred to the substrate from the lips.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">&#x201c;Long wear&#x201d; compositions as used herein, refers to compositions where color remains the same or substantially the same as at the time of application, as viewed by the naked eye, after an extended period of time. Long wear properties may be evaluated by any method known in the art for evaluating such properties. For example, long wear may be evaluated by a test involving the application of a composition to lips and evaluating the color of the composition after an extended period of time. For example, the color of a composition may be evaluated immediately following application to lips and these characteristics may then be re-evaluated and compared after a certain amount of time such as after 24 hours or 36 hours. Further, these characteristics may be evaluated with respect to other compositions, such as commercially available compositions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Depending on the intended application, such as a stick, hardness of the composition may also be considered. The hardness of a composition may, for example, be expressed in gramforce (gf). The composition of the present invention may, for example, have a hardness ranging from 20 gf to 2000 gf, such as from 20 gf to 900 gf, and further such as from 20 gf to 600 gf, including all ranges and subranges therebetween.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">This hardness can be measured in one of two ways, for example. A first test for hardness is according to a method of penetrating a probe into the composition and in particular using a texture analyzer (for example, Texture Analyzer model PLUS-UPGRADE from Stable Micro Systems equipped with a stainless steel cylinder of height 28 mm and diameter 2 mm). The hardness measurement is carried out at 20&#xb0; C. at the center of 5 samples of the composition. The cylinder is introduced into each sample of composition at a pre-speed of 2 mm/s and then at a speed of 0.5 mm/s and finally at a post-speed of 10 mm/s, the total displacement being 2 mm. The recorded hardness value is that of the first maximum peak before the value drops observed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The second test for hardness is the &#x201c;cheese wire&#x201d; method, which involves cutting a 12.4 mm in diameter stick composition and measuring its hardness at 20&#xb0; C. using a DFGHS 2 tensile testing machine from Indelco-Chatillon Co. or similar machine at a speed of 100 mm/minute. The hardness value from this method is expressed in grams as the shear force required to cut a stick under the above conditions. According to this method, the hardness of compositions according to the present invention which may be in stick form may, for example, range from 120 gf to 270 gf, preferably from 170 gf to 220 gf, for a sample of 12.4 mm in diameter stick.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The hardness of the composition of the present invention may be such that the compositions are self-supporting and can easily disintegrate to form a satisfactory deposit on keratin materials. In addition, this hardness may impart good impact strength to the inventive compositions, which may be molded or cast, for example, in stick or dish form.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The skilled artisan may choose to evaluate a composition using at least one of the tests for hardness outlined above based on the application envisaged and the hardness desired. If one obtains an acceptable hardness value, in view of the intended application, from at least one of these hardness tests, the composition falls within preferred embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">&#x201c;Substituted&#x201d; as used herein, means comprising at least one substituent. Non-limiting examples of substituents include atoms, such as oxygen atoms and nitrogen atoms, as well as functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups, ether groups, alkoxy groups, acyloxyalky groups, oxyalkylene groups, polyoxyalkylene groups, carboxylic acid groups, amine groups, acylamino groups, amide groups, halogen containing groups, ester groups, thiol groups, sulphonate groups, thiosulphate groups, siloxane groups, and polysiloxane groups. The substituent(s) may be further substituted.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">&#x201c;Volatile&#x201d;, as used herein, means having a flash point of less than about 100&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">&#x201c;Non-volatile&#x201d;, as used herein, means having a flash point of greater than about 100&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">&#x201c;Low-water-content&#x201d; means the compositions contain less than 6% water (by weight). Preferably, compositions of the present invention contain less than 5% water, and preferably less than 4% water.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">&#x201c;Anhydrous&#x201d; means the compositions contain less than 1% water (by weight). Preferably, anydrous compositions of the present invention contain less than 0.5% water, and preferably no water.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">&#x201c;Polymer&#x201d; as used herein means a compound which is made up of at least two monomers.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">&#x201c;Free&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d; or &#x201c;devoid of&#x201d; as it is used herein means that while it is preferred that no amount of the specific component be present in the composition, it is possible to have very small amounts of it in the compositions of the invention provided that these amounts do not materially affect at least one, preferably most, of the advantageous properties of the conditioning compositions of the invention. Thus, for example, &#x201c;free of triethanolamine (TEA)&#x201d; means that TEA is omitted from the composition (that is, 0% by weight), &#x201c;substantially free of TEA&#x201d; means that TEA is are present in amounts not greater than 1% by weight, and &#x201c;devoid of TEA&#x201d; means that TEA is present in amounts not greater than 0.5% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition. The same nomenclature applies for all other ingredients identified throughout the application such as, for example, silicone oils (&#x201c;free of volatile silicone oils,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially free of volatile silicone oils,&#x201d; and &#x201c;devoid of volatile silicone oils&#x201d; have meanings consistent with the discussion within this paragraph), even if not specifically discussed for each identified ingredient. Discussed examples of the use of such language are intended to be exemplary, not limiting.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The compositions and methods of the present invention can &#x201c;comprise,&#x201d; &#x201c;consist of&#x201d; or &#x201c;consist essentially of&#x201d; the essential elements and limitations of the invention described herein, as well as any additional or optional ingredients, components, or limitations described herein or otherwise useful. For purposes of the compositions and methods of the present invention where the invention &#x201c;consists essentially of&#x201d; the identified ingredients and/or process steps, the &#x201c;basic and novel property&#x201d; of such compositions and/or methods is &#x201c;not having animal derived ingredients and/or beeswax.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">All U.S. patents or patent applications disclosed herein are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Natural Oil</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In accordance with the present invention, lipstick compositions comprising at least one natural oil are provided.

In contrast, compositions containing 1.5% or 3% natural fillers (C1.5, C3 and M3) surprisingly had significantly higher peak positive force (about 290 g or above), indicating compositions with better hardness properties. M1.5 (1.5% mica), however, had poorer hardness properties than even the control composition.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
