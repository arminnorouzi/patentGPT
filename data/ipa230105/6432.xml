Such hose-like envelopes or their sheaths are also known as &#x201c;pods&#x201d; and inter alia protect against the exit of abraded particles which arise during displacement of the lines.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For most applications a first end fastening device is provided for the first end and a second end fastening device for the second end of the line guide devices. The end fastening devices serve to connect the ends to one of two connection points, for example a machine, wherein at least one of the connection points is movable relative to the other.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples of such line guide devices with end fastening devices specifically suitable therefor are described in DE 10 2012 100 290 B4 or in EP 3 226 252 A1.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An end fastening device is described in utility model DE 20 2019 103 276 U1 or the subsequently published international patent application with application number PCT/IB2020/000047 (cf. FIGS. 13A-13D therein). In this case, the two end fastening devices each have at least two clamping plates with major faces for exerting a clamping force, wherein the clamping plates are each arrangeable with a principal direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the envelope(s) or of the guided lines. Furthermore, two strain relief elements are in each case provided between two clamping plates, with in each case one clamping surface for one or more lines in the dust-tight envelope thereof. The strain relief elements are arranged opposingly between the facing major faces of the clamping plates and retain the envelope together with the line in force-locking manner in the longitudinal direction, in particular for strain relief of the lines with regard to tensile force.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the end fastening according to DE 20 2019 103 276 U1 or PCT/IB2020/000047, each clamping plate has in each case two retaining portions which each retain a strain relief element on the clamping plate in the direction parallel to the major face, i.e. against displacement in the longitudinal direction of the lines. The retaining portions are in this case provided as elongate through-holes in the clamping plates, which extend in the principal direction of the clamping plates. The strain relief elements project with corresponding projections into these elongate holes and are secured thereby in the longitudinal direction or perpendicular to the principal direction of the clamping plates. Clamping plates with an elongate hole as retaining portion and of comparable function is also described for example in DE 10 2012 100 533 B4 (cf. for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref> therein), but therein in contrast for individual strain relief elements which lie side by side.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The clamping plates are typically connected together, for example clamped against one another, using bilateral screw fastenings and also fastened to the connection point, for example of the machine or installation to be supplied.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">By means of the strain relief elements, force-locking contact, in particular frictional contact, is exerted on the envelopes and lines guided therein, such that these are fixed to the respective connection point in the longitudinal direction using the end fastening, wherein the lines are strain-relieved.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One disadvantage of the known devices lies in the relatively complex handling of the end fastenings during fitting and removal. The end fastenings have to be regularly removed and refitted for maintenance purposes, in particular if lines have to be exchanged, owing to their service life defined by the movement cycles. When the clamping connection or screw fastenings are undone, known end fastenings come apart, as for instance in DE 10 2012 100 533 B4, into a plurality of individual parts and have accordingly also to be correctly arranged and retained before fastening. This disadvantage is particularly pronounced if the line guide device comprises a plurality of superposed envelope layers or is designed to guide a plurality of lines.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further disadvantage is that the suitability of known end fastenings for very different line diameters is limited; this applies in particular to the simplified construction according to DE 20 2019 103 276 U1.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Clamping devices for multiple lines with different diameters are known from another field, namely the field of stationary line routing. For example, GB934771A or DE19545867A1 describe devices for fixing several cables next to each other on a stationary surface. Each of these uses two profile rails with U- or C-section as clamping plates, as well as various clamping elements. Each clamping element has a clamping fixture for a cable on one side and a connecting area matching the profile of the profile rail on the other side. However, these clamping devices are costly to manufacture and are not readily suitable for fastening movable cable guides with a sheath.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A first object of the invention is therefore to propose a construction for the end fastening which simplifies handling and may nevertheless be better adapted to different line diameters, in particular by being modular. This is achieved by a line guide apparatus or an end fastening device thereof.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A further object is to improve the modular nature of the end fastening, in particular with regard to suitability for the widest range of envelope or line arrangements. This object is achieved according to an independent further aspect of the invention by an end fastening device, which may optionally also simplify handling.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a further independent aspect, a modular building kit for end fastening is proposed, which inter alia at least in part overcomes the two above-mentioned disadvantages.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">First Aspect</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the first aspect, it is proposed according to the invention, for a line guide device or an end fastening device, that the retaining portion of the clamping plate form an undercut profile cross-section, viewed in cross-section perpendicular to the principal direction, i.e. a profile cross-section with at least one undercut. According to the invention, the strain relief elements here in each case have at least one corresponding connection portion, which is configured for form-fitting engagement behind the undercut(s) and accordingly corresponds or interacts with the profile cross-section of the retaining portion.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">By engaging behind the connection portions of the strain relief elements in or on the clamping plates, the strain relief element may also be retained reliably on the respective clamping plate in the direction perpendicular to the major face.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">This design in particular offers the advantage that prior to fastening or after detaching or removal of a clamping plate, the strain relief elements are retained or remain in a predetermined manner or specified arrangement on the clamping plates, i.e. the end fastening is easier to handle. In particular, it is prevented from falling apart into different individual parts, which for re- or initial fitting would require complex arrangement in the desired manner to match the line arrangement.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">This is especially advantageous not only but in particular for applications having a plurality of layers of lines or envelopes and/or having a plurality of different modular strain relief elements, adapted for example in each case to the line diameters.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, the back-engaging connection between strain relief elements and clamping plate may also improve force transmission, in particular in the longitudinal direction, or minimize movement play and thereby minimize abrasion in the end fastening itself. Tests have shown that during operation greater particle discharge is typically measurable at the end fastening than at the runs or the deflection arc.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Unlike in DE 20 2019 103 276 U1 or PCT/IB2020/000047, an embodiment is advantageous which has a plurality of individual modular strain relief elements at each clamping plate. With such a further development, the individual strain relief elements are configured for arrangement in opposing rows between mutually facing major faces of the clamping plates, with a plurality of strain relief elements next to each other in each row in the principal direction. For instance, different strain relief elements may in each case be used and prefitted on a clamping plate which match the desired lines in modular manner.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, special fastening elements for end-point fixing of the support chain may be used to fasten optionally used additional support chains. Such fastening elements preferably likewise have connection portions which&#x2014;like those of the strain relief elements&#x2014;are designed to interact with the profile cross-section of the clamping plates.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A plurality of strain relief elements and fastening elements may thus be attached in a modular manner or alternatively and in each case captively to in each case one clamping plate in order to form a preassembled unit with the clamping plate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The strain relief elements for lines may be configured at their respective clamping surfaces for example with a type of toothing with protruding tooth portions extending in the longitudinal direction of the lines or in the manner of a comb with individual elongate comb teeth, in order to bring about good frictional engagement for strain relief and at the same time a deformability which makes the strain relief element usable for a range of different line diameters. The strain relief elements may for example also be configured to form a half-shell-shaped sheath with a concavely curved clamping surface, which allows as far as possible matching or mechanically favorable strain relief of the lines in the longitudinal direction optionally together with the corresponding receiving duct of the envelope by force-locking (frictional connection) and optionally clamping connection. The construction of the clamping surface is not critical for the invention, any suitable shape is feasible which retains the corresponding line in the respective envelope in the longitudinal direction at least by force-locking engagement. The clamping surface facing the lines may be provided on a front major side of the strain relief element, this lying opposite a rear major side with the connection portion.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The connection portions of the strain relief elements or optional fastening elements for support chains are configured according to the first aspect for form-fitting engagement in the undercut profile cross-section of the retaining portion of the assigned clamping plate, such that the element is retained on the clamping plate in the longitudinal direction of the lines, i.e. perpendicular to the principal direction of the clamping plate and at the same time in the direction perpendicular to the main plane. The elements are in this case preferably detachably connectable with a clamping plate, in particular transversely of the longitudinal direction of the lines.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The strain relief elements are preferably made in one piece and from plastics material, in particular integrally of a relatively soft plastics material, in particular a thermoplastic, with a strength or a hardness similar to the material of the flexible envelope. The strain relief elements may in this case be made from a suitable plastics material, in particular thermoplastic, with a Shore hardness in the range from 20 Shore A (ShA 20) to 65 Shore D (ShD 65), in particular in the range from 50 Shore A (ShA 50) to 100 Shore A (ShA 100). In this way, damage to the envelope is avoided and abrasion by friction-contact retention on the envelope is minimized. The strain relief elements are in particular preferably made from a softer material and/or with a more readily deformable morphology than the clamping plates, which are intended to transfer a clamping force to the strain relief elements.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The clamping plates are preferably dimensionally stable, in particular flexurally rigid, through suitable dimensioning and/or material selection. The clamping plate has in particular two long end faces and two short narrow sides and may have a substantially rectangular outline.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a preferred further development, provision is made for the profile cross-section of the clamping plate to open laterally outwards at at least one of the short narrow sides and preferably open laterally outwards at both short narrow sides. The strain relief elements may thus be simply inserted and positioned with the connecting portions into the clamping plate on one or both narrow sides of the clamping plate, in the transverse direction or lateral direction relative to the lines. Also feasible, however, is attachment by turning, for example as in the case of a bayonet coupling or the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Particularly preferably, the clamping plate is configured such that the profile cross-section extends over at least a predominant proportion of the length, preferably over the entire length of the clamping plate, such that a plurality of positionings of the strain relief elements are possible.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">At least the profile cross-section is preferably embodied uniformly over the entire length of the clamping plate or in the principal direction. The clamping plate may have as a whole over its entire length or in the principal direction a cross-sectionally uniform outer contour. Clamping plates may thus for example be inexpensively produced to size from long profile pieces. In this case, the contour may, in front view or in longitudinal section, in particular be of planar or flat configuration on both major sides.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a particularly preferred embodiment, the clamping plate, which typically has two long end faces (long sides) parallel to the principal direction, preferably has a profile cross-section formed by an end-face groove on or in each of the two end faces, wherein the groove is preferably mirror-symmetrical to a central plane of symmetry which may lie parallel to the major face. Preferably, corresponding connecting portions engaging both opposing end faces are provided on the strain relief elements. These may then engage in claw- or clip-like manner opposingly in the corresponding end grooves in order to achieve the desired retaining effect.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Through bilateral retention of the elements on the end faces of the clamping plates, a particularly stable hold of the elements on the clamping plates is brought about, i.e. displacements or relative movements between elements and the associated clamping plates, for example through tensile or shearing forces on reciprocal movement of the mobile end fastening, are minimized, such that abrasion and the resultant particles may also be minimized.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In particular but not only in the case of end face retaining portions on the clamping plates, it is advantageous for the strain relief elements in each case to protrude beyond the clamping plate at the end in the longitudinal direction, at least on the free side of the end fastening device remote from the connected run and preferably on both sides. In this way, edge protection may be formed for the lines over the edge of the clamping plates, by which the lines are protected and any abrasion more extensively minimized.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Connection portions are particularly preferred on the strain relief elements which engage on both sides at the end faces of the clamping plate and/or at the same time form an edge protection throughout over the width of the element transversely of the longitudinal direction. By arranging such strain relief elements in a row, edge protection may be produced throughout in the transverse direction in combination with a stable connection between the elements and the clamping plate. Optional fastening elements for support chains or optional spacers may also be configured with corresponding connection portions with edge protection.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment provision is made for each clamping plate to have two major faces facing away from one another and for a retaining portion for strain relief elements to be provided on both sides, in each case in or on each of the two major faces. Each retaining portion in this case forms, perpendicular to the principal direction, a profile cross-section with undercut, wherein the two profile cross-sections preferably, taken individually, have identical shaping. For example, strain relief elements and fastening elements may optionally be attached and retained on both sides.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment with retaining portions on both sides, provision is made for the two retaining portions to be provided on the clamping plate offset relative to one another in the longitudinal direction or in a direction perpendicular to the principal direction. In this case, the retaining portions may preferably be arranged rotationally symmetrically to a main central axis of the clamping plate, such that matchingly configured strain relief elements are equally usable on both sides of the clamping plate simply by being turned around. The retaining portions or profile cross-sections are preferably arranged centrally in one of two width halves of the clamping plate, wherein the two width halves of the clamping plate may in particular be configured rotationally symmetrically relative to one another. &#x201c;Width half&#x201d; here means a half after lengthwise bisection.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one preferred embodiment, the or each retaining portion may be mirror-symmetrical in configuration, in particular to a central plane of symmetry perpendicular to the major face, i.e. in particular with two mirror-symmetrical undercuts. This in particular further simplifies handling in the case of centrally arranged retaining portions.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Alternatively or optionally also in addition, provision may be made for each retaining portion to comprise a profile groove recessed relative to the major face and/or a profile projection protruding relative to the major face. This may for example be configured centrally in the major face or centrally in a width half, e.g. as a through-profile groove in the principal direction.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In principle, profile cross-section is in the present case understood to mean a cross-section with any type of profile which according to the invention allows back engagement by a strain relief element, in order to retain the latter in the direction perpendicular to the major face of the clamping plate. The profile may in this case form a positive shape, in particular a projection, and/or a negative shape (space), in particular a profile groove. The profile cross-section may be molded together with the clamping plate on production of the latter, for example using continuous casting or injection molding, or be incorporated subsequently by machining, for example by milling.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The profile groove and/or the profile projection may exhibit any suitable shaping with undercut(s), for example a T-shaped, V-shaped or dovetail-shaped or similar back-engageable profile cross-section.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The connection portions of the strain relief elements have a cross-section correspondingly conjugate to the profile cross-section, in particular a form-fittingly matching cross-section, and should be displaceable in the principal direction, i.e. transversely of the longitudinal direction of the lines, on the retaining portion due to slight play, in order further to simplify handling on fitting or subsequent adaptation of the line guide.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Features of the above-stated first aspect of the invention may advantageously be combined with those of the following second aspect and vice versa.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Second Aspect</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to an independent second aspect, an end fastening device is proposed for fastening an end of a generic line guide device. The end fastening device comprises at least two clamping plates with major faces for exerting a clamping force, wherein the clamping plates in each case have two lateral end portions and two long end faces, which extend parallel to a principal direction. The clamping plates are arranged as intended with the long end faces perpendicular to the envelope or the lines. In addition, the end fastening device has a number of, but at least two strain relief elements, each with a clamping surface for in each case one or more lines, wherein the strain relief elements are intended for opposing arrangement between facing major faces of the clamping plates.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to the independent second aspect, it is proposed according to the invention to provide two separate plate connectors, which serve to retain two associated clamping plates at in each case one of the two lateral end portions, wherein each plate connector has two opposing, in particular vertically opposing clip portions, which in each case interact with an end portion of one of the two clamping plates. According to the invention, the plate connectors are configured to hold the at least two clamping plates together, in particular in the vertical direction or perpendicular to the plate direction by in each case end-face gripping of the clamping plates.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The two plate connectors may hold the clamping plates in particular at a predetermined distance from one another and/or parallel to one another.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Two clamping plates may in each case be held in pairs against one another at their lateral end portions, which lie at the two short (narrow) sides, by such a separate, interposed plate connector and connected together in pairs. Each of the opposing clip portions preferably engages at least form-fittingly with each clamping plate.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Use of the plate connectors in particular simplifies handling in the case of a multilayer arrangement with a plurality of envelopes one above the other, since a respective layer is already retained when the plate connectors are attached to the corresponding clamping plates for this layer. The plate connectors may serve in prefixing and in this case achieve a clamping force on the lines in the envelope in conjunction with suitable strain relief elements. A separate screw fastening does not have to be produced for this purpose. Conversely, opening or access to an individual layer, for example for targeted replacement of a line may also be simplified, since in the case of a multilayer structure adjacent layers do not have to be removed.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Furthermore, separate plate connectors enable simplification of the clamping plate structure. These may for example optionally be cut to size from a longer profile to match the desired width of the end fastening.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A plate connector according to the second aspect may thus, with its clip portions, connect and retain two clamping plates in pairs in the longitudinal direction and perpendicular to the major face.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The plate connectors are preferably connected detachably with the end portions of the clamping plates, in particular displaceably laterally or in the transverse direction relative to the clamping plates, so enabling lateral detachment.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The plate connectors may in particular connect the two clamping plates together in the manner of a clip and hold them, in the direction perpendicular to the major face, at a specified spacing determined by the plate connectors. One advantage is that a screw fastening is not absolutely necessary for producing the desired strain relief, and the desired force-locking engagement with the envelope or the lines may be achieved by suitable selection of strain relief elements and/or plate connectors.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Alternatively or in addition, the clip portions of the plate connectors are particularly preferably&#x2014;in a manner similar to the connection portions of the clamping elements&#x2014;embodied for interaction with a profile cross-section of the clamping plate which preferably opens outwards at both short narrow sides. In this way, the plate connectors may be laterally readily attached and detached again.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Furthermore, each plate connector may comprise a supporting body, which represents a spacer for predetermining the vertical distance between the clamping plates. The supporting body preferably has a structural height which amounts to at least twice the structural height of a strain relief element, for example of a specific associated strain relief element from a kit.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">At least one vertical through-hole for a screw fastening is preferably provided in the supporting body, said screw fastening serving in fastening, in particular to a connection point.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">For both aspects, i.e. notwithstanding the first or second aspect, the following further features are in each case advantageous.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, each strain relief element is configured such that it projects in the longitudinal direction beyond the end faces of the clamping plates and forms a sheath at a rear side remote from the clamping surface, in which sheath the respective clamping plate may be at least partly accommodated.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In particular in combination with the latter construction and/or the second aspect, it is advantageous for each strain relief element to have opposing connection portions for form-fitting engagement in a corresponding undercut of a profile groove or molded groove at the end face of the clamping plate, in order to retain the respective strain relief element on the respective clamping plate in the direction perpendicular to the major face of this clamping plate. In this case, the structural height of the connection portions may per se preferably be less than or equal to half the plate thickness of a clamping plate, such that strain relief elements are fastenable unimpeded on both sides on the same clamping plate.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The connection portions of the elements, in particular strain relief elements, if these are attached to a major side of the clamping plate, preferably do not project beyond the opposing major side.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In principle, precisely one strain relief element could be provided on each major side of the clamping plate. A modular construction is preferred, however, in which in each case a plurality of strain relief elements, in particular elements selected to match the application from a kit of different strain relief elements and optionally fastening elements for support chains, are arranged in a row in the principal direction on the clamping plate</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The elements are preferably in each case retained displaceably in the principal direction for positioning on a clamping plate and/or detachably on a clamping plate.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Particularly inexpensive production is enabled if the clamping plates are embodied as substantially flat plates, in particular with major faces which are planar in longitudinal section or with a plate thickness which is uniform in the principal direction.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this case, the clamping plates may be produced from a continuous profile, for example from an extruded metal profile, in particular of aluminum, in particular with a profile cross-section according to the first aspect, by cutting to the desired lengths. Alternatively, the clamping plates may for example also be made from reinforced plastics material, for example by injection molding.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The strain relief elements and optionally fastening elements are on the other hand preferably made in one piece of plastics material, in particular as injection moldings.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The plate connectors are preferably made in one piece from a harder plastics material than the strain relief elements, in particular as injection moldings, for example from a fiber-reinforced polymer. The plate connectors are dimensionally stable in particular perpendicular to the major face of the clamping plates, i.e. under intended load they are not extendable or compressible, in order to allow force-locking engagement between strain relief elements and lines in interaction with the clamping plates. The desired force for retaining the line(s) may be achieved by suitable selection or dimensioning of the plate connectors in combination with suitable selection or dimensioning of the strain relief elements. A screw fastening is not necessary for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The strain relief elements may have an active side, on which the clamping surface is provided, which is for example. concave or alternately concavely/convexly curved or indeed concavely/convexly shaped with toothing or in the manner of a comb, when viewed in cross-section along the principal direction or perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the line(s). The clamping surface may in this case be cylindrical in the general geometric sense, i.e. with a uniform section parallel to the principal direction.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Differently adapted strain relief elements may be provided in particular for different line diameters, said elements being connectable in modular manner with a clamping plate.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In particular in the case of multilayer applications with a plurality of envelopes one above the other, it is mechanically favorable for the clamping plates to have in each case at least two through-holes for screw fastenings in both lateral end portions and to have one or more additional through-holes for screw fastenings between the end portions along the principal direction. Such a through-hole may optionally also take the form of an elongate hole, and serve for the attachment of additional screws for fastening and/or clamping action.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The plate connectors may have at least two, preferably three through-holes for screw fastenings, which are preferably arranged for aligned arrangement with corresponding through-holes for screw fastenings in the clamping plates.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A further advantage of the two aspects, in particular of the second aspect, consists in that optionally just three clamping plates arranged one above the other suffice for fastening of at least two envelopes in superposed layers, wherein on the middle clamping plate in the mounted state of the end fastening strain relief elements are retained on both sides, namely for fixing not only the one envelope on the one side of the middle clamping plate but also the other envelope on the other side. It is thus not necessary in each case to provide two clamping plates for each layer or envelope. In this way, material costs are reduced and handling is further simplified.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Third Aspect</heading><p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to a third independent aspect, the invention finally also relates to a modular building kit for generic end fastenings. According to the third aspect, the building kit is characterized, in its minimal embodiment, by at least five different components, namely:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0071">at least one flat clamping plate; &#x2014;at least two different types of strain relief element with in each case different structural heights and in each case connection portions of identical construction for securing to the clamping plate at least in a longitudinal direction; &#x2014;at least two different types of plate connector with different structural heights, wherein each plate connector has two opposing clip portions of identical construction, which in each case interact at least form-fittingly with the clamping plate, in particular with an end portion of the clamping plate.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0072" num="0072">All the above-described features of the individual components, in particular of the clamping plates, strain relief elements and plate connectors are also advantageously applicable in the building kit.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0073">The use of two plate connectors of different structural heights in particular allows modular use of the end fastening with just one design of clamping plate both for a multilayer arrangement with two or more superposed envelopes. which are retained optionally nested between just two clamping plates, and also for single-layer arrangements. Such a building kit may be better adapted, with just a minimum number of parts, to the various applications, in particular line diameters, and yet still simplifies handling during production and onsite maintenance. However, a number with more than two different types of strain relief element is preferably provided for different line diameters.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0074">Particularly preferably, clamping plate and strain relief elements in the building kit are configured according to the first aspect, wherein the clamping plate in each case has at least one retaining portion with a profile cross-section with undercut and each strain relief element in each case has a connection portion in order to retain the strain relief element on the clamping plate by engaging behind the undercut of the profile cross-section in the direction perpendicular to the major face of said clamping plate.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0075">In a preferred embodiment of all aspects, the strain relief elements project in the longitudinal direction or perpendicular to the principal direction of the clamping plates beyond the end faces thereof, in particular on both sides and/or grip at least in part around the respective end face to form an edge protection.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0076">Further details and advantages of the invention may be inferred, without restricting the general nature of the above, from the following explanation of preferred exemplary embodiments on the basis of the appended drawings.

The strain relief elements <b>23</b>A, <b>23</b>B, <b>23</b>C, <b>23</b>D in each case have a clamping surface <b>232</b> for force-locking retention of one or more lines <b>8</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) in the respective duct-like sheath <b>7</b> together with the envelope <b>2</b>. The strain relief elements <b>23</b>A, <b>23</b>B, <b>23</b>C, <b>23</b>D are modular and are configured for strung-together, opposing arrangement between facing major faces <b>22</b> of the clamping plates <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0093">As is most clearly apparent from the side view <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, each of the clamping plates <b>210</b> of identical construction in each case has a retaining portion <b>213</b>, inter alia for strain relief elements <b>23</b>A, <b>23</b>B, <b>23</b>C, <b>23</b>D etc., which retains these on the respective clamping plate <b>210</b> against displacement in the longitudinal direction L. As is most clearly apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>C</figref>, the clamping plates <b>210</b> to this end each have on their long end faces <b>211</b> pronounced retaining portions <b>213</b> facing away from one another and with a profile cross-section <b>220</b> here at the end with in each case one undercut when viewed in cross-section or side view, wherein the undercut in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref> is embodied at the end faces <b>211</b> by a groove <b>221</b> or recess which is roughly U-shaped or constant throughout in the principal direction.

The fastening elements <b>24</b> have connection portions <b>230</b> and sheaths <b>231</b> of identical construction on their rear sides (not shown). The same is also true of additional spacers <b>25</b> in the top two layers of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref>. These spacers <b>25</b> allow lateral offset in the transverse direction Q between the opposing strain relief elements <b>23</b>A, such that in each case two envelopes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, lying one above the other may be jointly secured between two clamping plates <b>210</b> in the top two layers. The spacers <b>25</b> have, like the fastening elements <b>24</b>, claws for retention on the clamping plates <b>210</b> which are likewise cross-sectionally identical to the connection portions <b>230</b>. The fastening elements <b>24</b> and spacers <b>25</b> are thus likewise securely retained and fixable on the clamping plates <b>210</b> in the longitudinal direction L and perpendicular to the major faces <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0098">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref> further show, the profile cross-section <b>220</b> opens on both sides at the short narrow sides <b>212</b> to the outside, i.e. is laterally openly accessible.

In this case, the clamping surfaces <b>232</b> have tooth strips or comb teeth projecting alternately between recesses and extending in the longitudinal direction L, which tooth strips or comb teeth achieve a degree of deformability for adaptation to different diameters of the lines <b>8</b> and at the same time achieve good frictional engagement. By way of example, only the clamping surface <b>232</b> is briefly described. Flat designs are also possible, as for instance in the case of strain relief elements <b>23</b>B, <b>23</b>C, <b>23</b>D which differ primarily by different structural heights or depths of the respective clamping surfaces.

To this end, each plate connector <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B has two opposing clip portions <b>242</b>, which according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref> correspond in construction to the claw-like connection portions <b>230</b> of the strain relief elements <b>23</b>A-<b>23</b>G, i.e. have two mutually facing end-face claws. The plate connectors <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B have however in each case at their top and bottom a corresponding clip portion <b>242</b> for connection with two clamping plates <b>210</b>. Using the plate connectors <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B, the clamping plates <b>210</b> are in each case connected together in pairs and retained parallel at a predetermined distance from one another. To this end, the opposing clip portions <b>242</b> grip in each case in pairs at least form-fittingly in the end-face groove <b>221</b> of the clamping plates <b>210</b>, in a manner similar to the connection portions <b>230</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref> two types of plate connector <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B are shown, which differ merely in different structural heights, such that through selection of the plate connectors <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B the space between the strain relief elements <b>23</b>A-<b>23</b>G opposing one another in pairs may be adjusted. Structurally identical plate connectors <b>240</b>A or <b>240</b>B are inserted between two clamping plates <b>210</b> in each case at the two end portions <b>214</b>. These are likewise laterally insertable in the principal direction H and re-detachable. The plate connectors <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B have a block-like supporting body <b>243</b>, here of solid material, in particular a dimensionally stable, non-resilient plastics material such as for example a fiber-reinforced polyamide. The supporting body <b>243</b> has a vertical spacer for predetermining the vertical distance between the clamping plates <b>210</b>. The plate connectors <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B differ in particular in the structural height of the supporting body <b>243</b> and are otherwise of identical construction, in particular their vertically and horizontally mirror-symmetrical clip portions <b>242</b>. The plate connectors <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B may unilaterally have a concave opening to the accommodation space for the envelopes.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0101">The plate connectors <b>240</b>A, <b>240</b>B in each case have, identically arranged in their supporting bodies <b>243</b>, three through-holes <b>245</b> distributed in the longitudinal direction L for screw fastenings using screws <b>250</b>. The through-holes <b>245</b> are arranged to match the aligned arrangement with corresponding through-holes <b>215</b> for the screws <b>250</b> in the clamping plates <b>210</b>. The outer two screws <b>250</b> in the end portions <b>214</b> may be used for lateral securing of the ready-mounted end fastening device <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032;, as may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A</figref>/<b>2</b>D. To this end, in the bottom clamping plate <b>210</b> a threaded bush may in each case be driven into the corresponding through-holes <b>215</b> at the bottom, or a nut can be used. The middle through-holes <b>215</b>, <b>245</b> may be used to fasten the end fastening device <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; to the connection point, i.e. to the fixed point or moving end (not shown).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0102">As is further apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref>, the connection portions <b>230</b> of the strain relief elements <b>23</b>A-<b>23</b>G and also of the fastening elements <b>24</b> and spacers <b>25</b> serve at the same time as edge protection at the end faces <b>211</b> of the clamping plates <b>210</b>, such that the lines <b>8</b> cannot come into contact with the end faces <b>211</b> of the clamping plates <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> show a modification with an end fastening device <b>30</b>, here by way of example for two layers of envelopes, which differs merely in the design of the clamping plates <b>310</b>. These likewise have a profile cross-section <b>320</b> with an undercut, which is not however symmetrical to the central plane of the clamping plate <b>310</b>. The clamping plate <b>310</b> corresponds in construction to a vertically bisected clamping plate <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref>, such that two clamping plates <b>310</b> have to be provided arranged inverted one on top of the other between two successive layers.

In the case of clamping plate <b>510</b> too, the profile cross-section <b>520</b> is identical throughout in the principal direction H and laterally open on both sides for insertion of the strain relief elements <b>523</b> or plate connectors <b>540</b> etc. in the principal direction H. The strain relief elements <b>523</b> or plate connectors <b>540</b> have a connection portion <b>530</b>, with matching cross-sectional profile, shaped accordingly as a form-fitting counterpart.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref> show a further exemplary embodiment of an end fastening device <b>60</b> with an alternative design of the profile cross-section <b>620</b> of the clamping plate <b>610</b>, here with two retaining portions <b>613</b> on each clamping plate <b>610</b>. The clamping plate has in each case one retaining portion <b>613</b> for strain relief elements <b>623</b> at both major faces <b>622</b>. Perpendicular to the principal direction H, the retaining portions <b>613</b> here also form a profile cross-section <b>620</b> with a double undercut, for example formed in each case of a T-shaped groove <b>621</b>, which is fully let into the plate body of the clamping plate <b>610</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0107">The two retaining portions <b>613</b> are provided on the clamping plate <b>610</b> in each case on one of the two major faces <b>622</b> facing away from one another, said retaining portions being offset relative to one another in the longitudinal direction L, i.e. perpendicular to the principal direction H, and arranged rotationally symmetrically to a main central axis M.
