However, flexible substrates have lower heat resistance than glass substrates or the like, and thus, by a method in which transistors or the like are directly formed on flexible substrates, the electrical characteristics and reliability of the transistors cannot be improved in some cases.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0009">Thus, as described in Patent Document 1, a method in which a semiconductor element, a light-emitting element, or the like formed over a glass substrate provided with a separation layer is separated and transferred to a flexible substrate has been considered. In this method, the formation temperature of the semiconductor element can be increased, and a highly reliable flexible device can be manufactured.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0010">Furthermore, in the case where a resin is used for the separation layer, a step of reducing adhesion between the substrate and the resin by irradiation with laser light or the like is used. It is preferable that the laser light have a linear beam shape in view of the productivity.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">However, a very expensive large optical component is needed to form a linear beam corresponding to the length of one side of a large glass substrate having the size of G10 (2880&#xd7;3130 mm) or the like. Furthermore, as the linear beam becomes longer, it is more difficult to secure necessary energy density and thus, a laser oscillator with higher output is also needed. Accordingly, it is preferable that a linear beam that is shorter than the length of one side of the glass substrate be used and a desired region be subjected to laser irradiation several times.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">Note that in the case where the beam length is shorter than the length of one side of the glass substrate, mechanisms for moving the linear beam or the glass substrate in the X and Y directions are needed, and thus there is a problem of an increase in the size of an apparatus.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0013">Furthermore, in a manufacturing process of a flexible device, a support substrate such as the above glass substrate is used so that a transfer process, a deposition process, a lithography process, and the like are performed easily. Moreover, the above laser irradiation is performed from the support substrate side.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">A laser processing apparatus that performs the above laser irradiation includes a laser oscillator and a moving stage for fixing an object to be processed. The object to be processed is subjected to laser irradiation from above the moving stage. For the moving stage, a linear movement mechanism or the like is used, and the object to be processed is moved while being irradiated with laser light, whereby a desired region of the object to be processed can be irradiated with the laser light.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">However, in the case where a desired structure body can be formed over one support substrate, a laser processing apparatus that performs laser irradiation from above the object to be processed is unsuitable. In this case, it is necessary to provide the structure body on the moving stage with the structure body being on the underside. Accordingly, it is necessary to employ a structure of protecting the structure body by provision of another support substrate over the structure body or formation of a robust layer or the like over the structure body. Moreover, a step of removing the another support substrate or the robust layer is needed in some cases.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016">Accordingly, an object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a laser processing apparatus that occupies a small area. Alternatively, an object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a laser processing apparatus that occupies a small area and can process a large glass substrate.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0017">Alternatively, an object is to provide a laser processing apparatus that can perform laser irradiation from below an object to be processed. Alternatively, an object is to provide a laser processing apparatus that is easily maintained. Alternatively, an object is to provide an inexpensive laser processing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0018">Alternatively, an object is to provide a stack processing apparatus including the above laser processing apparatus and an ashing unit. Alternatively, an object is to provide a novel stack processing apparatus. Alternatively, an object is to provide a laser processing method using the above laser processing apparatus or stack processing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0019">Note that the descriptions of these objects do not disturb the existence of other objects.

The first movable portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the second movable portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>can perform reciprocating linear motion in the horizontal direction.

Here, the movement direction of the first movable portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the movement direction of the second movable portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>are set to be orthogonal to each other in the horizontal direction.

The fixing mechanism <b>15</b> is fixed to the third movable portion <b>14</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the fixing mechanism <b>15</b> can perform a motion in the rotation direction (&#x3b8;-direction) in addition to the above-described first direction (the x-direction) and the second direction (the y-direction).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0086">The fixing mechanism <b>15</b> includes a stage <b>15</b><i>b </i>having a flat surface to which an object to be processed <b>30</b> is fixed.

For example, the first side is regarded as a long side, and the second side is regarded as a short side.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0088">Note that although not illustrated, the fixing mechanism <b>15</b> includes a pusher pin and a vertical movement mechanism thereof and thus can move the object to be processed <b>30</b> vertically when the object to be processed <b>30</b> is carried out of/in the chamber <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0089">The laser oscillator <b>20</b> is preferably a pulsed laser, but may be a CW laser as long as it outputs light with a wavelength and intensity suitable for the purpose of processing. Typically, an excimer laser that emits ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 351-353 nm (XeF), a wavelength of 308 nm (XeCl), or the like can be used. Alternatively, a second harmonic wavelength (515 nm, 532 nm, or the like) or a third harmonic wavelength (343 nm, 355 nm, or the like) of a solid-state laser (a YAG laser, a fiber laser, or the like) may be used. Moreover, a plurality of laser oscillators <b>20</b> may be provided.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0090">The optical system unit <b>21</b> includes, for example, a mirror, a beam expander, a beam homogenizer, or the like, and homogenizes and expands the in-plane distribution of the energy of laser light <b>25</b> emitted from the laser oscillator <b>20</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, a beam shape on the processed surface of the object to be processed is a linear shape, and thus laser light <b>26</b> emitted from the optical system unit <b>21</b> is preferably shaped into a rectangle.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0091">As the mirror <b>22</b>, a dielectric multilayer mirror can be used, for example, and is provided so that the incident angle of the laser light is substantially 45&#xb0;. As the lens <b>23</b>, for example, a cylindrical lens can be used. Furthermore, a quartz window <b>24</b> is provided in an upper portion of the chamber <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0092">Note that all components other than the laser oscillator <b>20</b> may be provided in the chamber <b>11</b>.

Laser light <b>26</b> that is extended and shaped into a rectangle by the optical system unit <b>21</b> enters the mirror <b>22</b>. At this time, the laser light <b>26</b> may be divided into a plurality of laser beams. Furthermore, although the laser light <b>26</b> emitted from the optical system unit <b>21</b> is illustrated as parallel light in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the like, the laser light <b>26</b> may be light that expands in the emission direction.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0096">The laser light <b>26</b> reflected by the mirror <b>22</b> enters the lens <b>23</b> and is condensed through the quartz window <b>24</b>, and thus, a linear beam <b>27</b> is formed at a desired position of the object to be processed <b>30</b>. The stage <b>15</b><i>b </i>is moved in the horizontal direction in a state where the object to be processed <b>30</b> is irradiated with the linear beam <b>27</b> as described above, whereby a desired region of the object to be processed <b>30</b> can be subjected to laser processing.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0097">Here, the length of the linear beam <b>27</b> is ideally greater than or equal to the length of one side of the object to be processed <b>30</b>. In this case, only by moving the linear beam <b>27</b> or the object to be processed <b>30</b> in one horizontal direction, the entire object to be processed <b>30</b> can be subjected to laser processing. However, a large optical component, which is very expensive, is needed to form a linear beam corresponding to the length of one side of a large glass substrate having the size of G10 or the like.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0098">Furthermore, as the linear beam becomes longer, it is more difficult to secure necessary energy density; therefore, a laser oscillator with higher output is also needed. Accordingly, it is practical to use a linear beam that is shorter than the length of one side of the object to be processed <b>30</b> and perform laser irradiation on a desired region several times. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the length of the linear beam <b>27</b> can be approximately &#xbc; of the length of one side of the object to be processed <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0099">Note that in the case where the beam length is shorter than the length of one side of the object to be processed <b>30</b>, a mechanism for moving the linear beam or the object to be processed in the x and y directions is needed, and thus there is a problem that the apparatus becomes larger.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b></figref>(A<b>1</b>) to <b>2</b>(A<b>4</b>) and <b>2</b>(B<b>1</b>) to <b>2</b>(B<b>4</b>) are conventional examples, and are diagrams illustrating methods in which the object to be processed <b>30</b> is irradiated with the linear beam <b>27</b> to form a processed region <b>31</b> on the entire surface (effective region). The linear beam <b>27</b> shows an irradiation position, and the linear beam <b>27</b> is fixed in the vicinity of the center of the chamber <b>11</b>.

Alternatively, irradiation of the entire surface of the object to be processed <b>30</b> is possible.

With the use of a metal oxide, the maximum process temperature can be lower than that in the case of using low-temperature polysilicon (LTPS).</p><p id="p-0294" num="0294">When LTPS is used for the channel formation region of the transistor, the maximum process temperature reaches approximately 500&#xb0; C. to 550&#xb0; C. Thus, the resin layer needs to have heat resistance. Furthermore, the resin layer is required to have a larger thickness to relieve the damage to an insulating layer or the like at the periphery of the resin layer in a laser crystallization step. In addition, when the resin layer is irradiated with laser light, a large thickness of the resin layer is required to suppress the degradation of characteristics caused by irradiation of the channel formation region of the completed transistor with laser light.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0295">In contrast, the transistor using a metal oxide does not need heat treatment at high temperatures, and can be formed at a temperature lower than or equal to 350&#xb0; C., or even lower than or equal to 300&#xb0; C. Therefore, the resin layer is not required to have high heat resistance. Accordingly, a relatively inexpensive resin whose heat-resistance temperature is low can be used for the resin layer. Furthermore, the transistor using a metal oxide does not need a laser crystallization step. Moreover, the metal oxide has a wide band gap greater than or equal to 2.5 eV and lower than or equal to 3.5 eV, and absorbs a smaller amount of laser light with a specific wavelength than silicon. Thus, there is no problem when the resin layer has a small thickness.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0296">Since the resin layer is not required to have high heat resistance and can be thinned, the manufacturing costs of a device can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, a metal oxide is preferably used, in which case the process can be simplified as compared with the case where LTPS is used.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0297">In one embodiment of the present invention, a transistor or the like is formed at a temperature lower than or equal to the allowable temperature limit of the resin layer. Here, the heat resistance of the resin layer can be measured by, for example, a weight loss percentage due to heat, specifically, the 5% weight loss temperature, or the like. The 5% weight loss temperature of the resin layer is preferably lower than or equal to 450&#xb0; C., further preferably lower than or equal to 400&#xb0; C., still further preferably lower than 350&#xb0; C. For example, a transistor is formed at a temperature lower than or equal to 350&#xb0; C., or even lower than or equal to 300&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0298">In one embodiment of the present invention, a resin layer may be formed using a photosensitive material. With the photosensitive material, a resin layer with a desired shape can be easily formed. For example, a resin layer having an opening or a resin layer having two or more regions with different thicknesses can be easily formed. Accordingly, the resin layer can be prevented from hindering formation of a back gate, an external connection terminal, a through electrode, or the like.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0299">A flexible display device can be manufactured using the separation method of a structure body of one embodiment of the present invention.

In this embodiment, a hybrid display will be described.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0322">Hybrid display is a method for displaying a letter or an image using reflected light and self-emitted light together in one panel that complement the color tone or light intensity of each other. Alternatively, hybrid display is a method for displaying a letter and/or an image using light from a plurality of display elements in one pixel or one subpixel. Note that when a hybrid display that performs hybrid display is locally observed, a pixel or a subpixel performing display using any one of the plurality of display elements and a pixel or a subpixel performing display using two or more of the plurality of display elements are included in some cases.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0323">Note that in this specification and the like, one satisfying any one or a plurality of expressions of the above-described structures is referred to as hybrid display.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0324">Furthermore, a hybrid display includes a plurality of display elements in one pixel or one subpixel. Note that as the plurality of display elements, for example, reflective elements that reflect light and self-luminous elements that emit light can be given. Note that the reflective element and the self-luminous element can be controlled independently. A hybrid display has a function of displaying a letter and/or an image using one or both of reflected light and self-emitted light in a display portion.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0325">The display device of one embodiment of the present invention can include a pixel provided with a first display element that reflects visible light. Alternatively, the display device can include a pixel provided with a second display element that emits visible light.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0326">Alternatively, the display device can include a pixel provided with the first display element and the second display element.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0327">In this embodiment, a display device including the first display element that reflects visible light and the second display element that emits visible light will be described.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0328">The display device has a function of displaying an image by one or both of first light reflected by the first display element and second light emitted from the second display element.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0329">Alternatively, the display device has a function of expressing grayscales by individually controlling the amount of the first light reflected by the first display element and the amount of the second light emitted from the second display element.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0330">Furthermore, the display device preferably has a structure including a first pixel that expresses grayscales by controlling the amount of reflected light of the first display element and a second pixel that expresses grayscales by controlling the amount of light emitted from the second display element. For example, a plurality of each of the first pixels and the second pixels are arranged in a matrix to form a display portion.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0331">In addition, it is preferable that the first pixels and the second pixels be arranged in a display region with the same number and the same pitch. At this time, the adjacent first and second pixels can be collectively referred to as a pixel unit. Accordingly, as described later, an image displayed only by a plurality of first pixels, an image displayed only by a plurality of second pixels, and an image displayed by both the plurality of first pixels and the plurality of second pixels can be displayed in the same display region.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0332">As the first display element included in the first pixel, an element that performs display by reflecting external light can be used. Such an element does not include a light source, and thus, the power consumption at the time of display can be significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0333">As the first display element, typically, a reflective liquid crystal element can be used. Alternatively, as the first display element, an element or the like using a microcapsule method, an electrophoretic method, an electrowetting method, an Electronic Liquid Powder (registered trademark) method, or the like can be used, other than a shutter type MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical System) element or an optical interference type MEMS element.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0334">As the second display element included in the second pixel, an element that includes a light source and performs display utilizing light from the light source can be used. It is particularly preferable to use an electroluminescent element in which light emission can be extracted from a light-emitting substance by application of an electric field. Since the luminance and the chromaticity of light emitted from such a pixel are not affected by external light, display with high color reproducibility (a wide color gamut) and high contrast can be performed; that is, vivid display can be performed.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0335">As the second display element, for example, a self-luminous light-emitting element such as an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode), an LED (Light Emitting Diode), a QLED (Quantum-dot Light Emitting Diode), or a semiconductor laser can be used. Alternatively, a combination of a backlight that is a light source and a transmissive liquid crystal element that controls the amount of transmitted light from a backlight may be used as the display element included in the second pixel.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0336">The first pixel can have, for example, a structure including a subpixel exhibiting white (W) or subpixels exhibiting light of three colors of red (R), green (G), and blue (B). Moreover, the second pixel can also have, for example, a structure including a subpixel exhibiting white (W) or subpixels exhibiting light of three colors of red (R), green (G), and blue (B). Note that the first pixel and the second pixel may each include subpixels of four colors or more. As the number of kinds of subpixels is increased, the power consumption can be reduced and the color reproducibility can be improved.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0337">In one embodiment of the present invention, a first mode in which an image is displayed by the first pixels, a second mode in which an image is displayed by the second pixels, and a third mode in which an image is displayed by the first pixels and the second pixels can be switched. In addition, as described in Embodiment 1, a different image signal is input to each of the first pixel and the second pixel, so that a composite image can be displayed.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0338">The first mode is a mode in which an image is displayed using light reflected from the first display element. The first mode, which requires no light source, is a driving mode with extremely low power consumption. For example, the first mode is effective in the case where external light has a sufficiently high illuminance and is white light or light near white light. The first mode is a display mode suitable for displaying, for example, text data of a book, a document or the like. Furthermore, since reflected light is used, eye-friendly display can be performed, so that an effect of less eyestrain can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0339">The second mode is a mode in which an image is displayed utilizing light emitted from the second display element. Thus, an extremely clear display (with high contrast and high color reproducibility) can be performed regardless of the illuminance and the chromaticity of external light. For example, the second mode is effective when the illuminance of external light is extremely low, e.g., during the night or in a dark room. When display of a bright image is performed under weak external light, a user may feel that the image is too bright. To prevent this, display with reduced luminance is preferably performed in the second mode. Thus, not only a reduction in glare but also low power consumption can be achieved. The second mode is a mode suitable for displaying a clear image, a smooth moving image, and the like.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0340">The third mode is a mode in which display is performed utilizing both reflected light from the first display element and light emitted from the second display element. Specifically, the driving is performed such that light from the first pixel and light from the second pixel adjacent to the first pixel are mixed to express one color. The third mode can perform more vivid display than the first mode, and the power consumption can be lower than that in the second mode. For example, the third mode is effective when the illuminance of external light is relatively low, e.g., under indoor illumination or in the morning or evening, or when the chromaticity of the external light is not white.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0341">A more specific example of one embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to drawings.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">[Structure Example of Display Device]</heading><p id="p-0342" num="0342"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a pixel array <b>70</b> included in the display device of one embodiment of the present invention.

As described above, the use of a top-gate transistor can reduce parasitic capacitance, so that the frame frequency of display can be increased.</p><p id="p-0411" num="0411">A transistor included in the display device of one embodiment of the present invention includes a conductive layer functioning as a gate electrode, a semiconductor layer, a conductive layer functioning as a source electrode, a conductive layer functioning as a drain electrode, and an insulating layer functioning as a gate insulating layer.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0412">Note that there is no particular limitation on the structure of the transistor. For example, a planar transistor may be used, a staggered transistor may be used, or an inverted staggered transistor may be used. In addition, a top-gate transistor or a bottom-gate transistor may be used. Alternatively, gate electrodes may be provided above and below a channel.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0413">There is no particular limitation also on the crystallinity of a semiconductor material used for the transistor, and an amorphous semiconductor or a semiconductor having crystallinity (a microcrystalline semiconductor, a polycrystalline semiconductor, a single crystal semiconductor, or a semiconductor partly including crystal regions) may be used. A semiconductor having crystallinity is preferably used because deterioration of the transistor characteristics can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0414">Furthermore, as a semiconductor material used for the transistor, a metal oxide whose energy gap is greater than or equal to 2 eV, preferably greater than or equal to 2.5 eV, further preferably greater than or equal to 3 eV can be used. Typically, an oxide semiconductor containing indium, or the like can be used.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0415">A transistor including an oxide semiconductor which has a wider bandgap and a lower carrier density than silicon has a low off-state current; therefore, charge accumulated in a capacitor that is series-connected to the transistor can be retained for a long time.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0416">The semiconductor layer can be, for example, a film represented by an In-M-Zn-based oxide that contains indium, zinc, and M (a metal such as aluminum, titanium, gallium, germanium, yttrium, zirconium, lanthanum, cerium, tin, neodymium, or hafnium).</p><p id="p-0417" num="0417">In the case where an oxide semiconductor that forms the semiconductor layer is an In-M-Zn-based oxide, it is preferable that the atomic ratio of the metal elements of a sputtering target used to deposit the In-M-Zn oxide satisfy In&#x2265;M and Zn&#x2265;M. As the atomic ratio of metal elements in such a sputtering target, In:M:Zn=1:1:1, In:M:Zn=1:1:1.2, In:M:Zn=3:1:2, In:M:Zn=4:2:3, In:M:Zn=4:2:4.1, In:M:Zn=5:1:6, In:M:Zn=5:1:7, In:M:Zn=5:1:8, or the like is preferable. Note that the atomic ratio in the formed semiconductor layer varies from the above atomic ratio of metal elements of the sputtering target in a range of &#xb1;40%.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0418">Moreover, a metal oxide formed of the above material or the like can function as a light-transmitting conductor by adjusting impurities, oxygen vacancies, and the like. Thus, when the components of the transistor such as the source electrode, the drain electrode, and the gate electrode, in addition to the semiconductor layer, are formed using a light-transmitting conductor, a light-transmitting transistor can be fabricated. The use of the light-transmitting transistor in a pixel of a display device allows light passing through a display element or light emitted from the display element to pass through the transistor; thus, the aperture ratio can be improved.</p><p id="p-0419" num="0419">Alternatively, silicon may be used as a semiconductor in which a channel of a transistor is formed. Although amorphous silicon may be used as silicon, silicon having crystallinity is particularly preferably used. For example, microcrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, single crystal silicon, or the like is preferably used. In particular, polycrystalline silicon can be formed at a lower temperature than single crystal silicon and has higher field-effect mobility and higher reliability than amorphous silicon.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0420">The above-described display panel <b>300</b> is broadly divided into a region <b>601</b> including the light-emitting element, the transistors, and the like and a region <b>602</b> including the liquid crystal element and the like (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>).
