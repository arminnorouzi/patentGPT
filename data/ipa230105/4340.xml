The data communications device can provide various services to a user in a vehicle by communicating with an external device. While the data communications device provides services by communicating with the external device, the data communications device may receive audio data and output audio corresponding to the audio data from a speaker inside the vehicle. However, the data communications device does not include an interface by which the user can directly adjust the volume of the audio, and therefore, it is difficult to adjust, by a user operation, the volume of the audio output by the data communications device from the speaker.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one aspect of this disclosure, while a data communications device outputs audio from a speaker provided in a vehicle, an information processing device connected to a volume adjustment portion notifies the data communications device of a user operation input into the volume adjustment portion. This allows the user operation to change the volume of the audio output by the data communications device from the speaker.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">More specifically, one aspect of this disclosure relates to an information processing device provided in a vehicle. The information processing device includes a controlling portion. The information processing device is, for example, an electronic control unit (ECU) configured to control multimedia in the vehicle. The controlling portion is a processor provided in the ECU, for example.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The controlling portion receives a user operation to make a volume change of audio output from a first speaker provided in the vehicle, the user operation being input into a volume adjustment portion. The volume adjustment portion is any of a button, a switch, a knob, a button displayed on a touchscreen display, and the like that are configured to adjust the volume, for example. However, the volume adjustment portion is not limited to them. While the data communications device outputs audio from a second speaker, the controlling portion notifies the data communications device of the volume change made by the user operation input into the volume adjustment portion.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The data communications device outputs audio from the second speaker. The second speaker may be the first speaker or a speaker different from the first speaker. In a case where the second speaker is a speaker different from the first speaker, the second speaker is directly or indirectly connected to the data communications device, for example, and the second speaker is a speaker configured to output audio corresponding to audio data output from the data communications device. In a case where the second speaker is the same speaker as the first speaker, the data communications device shares the first speaker with other devices in the vehicle such as the information processing device and outputs audio from the first speaker.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The controlling portion is connected to the volume adjustment portion. Accordingly, while audio is output from the first speaker, the controlling portion changes the volume of the audio output from the first speaker in accordance with the volume change made by the user operation input into the volume adjustment portion. In the meantime, the data communications device is not connected to the volume adjustment portion. Accordingly, in the related art, the adjustment of the volume by the user operation input into the volume adjustment portion does not affect the data communications device in either of a case where the second speaker is the same speaker as the first speaker and a case where the second speaker is a speaker different from the first speaker.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">However, in one aspect of this disclosure, the controlling portion notifies the data communications device of the volume change made by the user operation input into the volume adjustment portion. Hereby, the data communications device changes the volume of the audio output from the second speaker in accordance with the notified volume change made by the user operation, and the data communications device outputs, to the speaker, the audio the volume of which is changed. Accordingly, with the one aspect of this disclosure, it is possible to change, by the user operation, the volume of the audio output by the data communications device from the speaker.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one aspect of this disclosure, in a case where the data communications device starts to output audio, the data communications device may output a notification of the audio output start to an information processing device. In a case where the information processing device receives the notification of the audio output start from the data communications device, the information processing device may start to notify the data communications device of the volume change made by the user operation input into the volume adjustment portion. Hereby, a target of the volume change made by the user operation input into the volume adjustment portion can be changed from the information processing device to the data communications device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The data communications device can communicate with an external device. In a case where the data communications device starts to communicate with the external device, the data communications device may output the notification of the audio output start to the information processing device. This is because, as one example of a case where the data communications device outputs audio, there is such a case where audio data is received from the external device via communication.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a case where the data communications device detects an emergency event, for example, the data communications device may start to communicate with the external device. The emergency event is detected even in a case where a collision is detected by another device in the vehicle, for example. Alternatively, the data communications device may include an emergency call button, and when the emergency call button is pressed down, the data communications device may start to communicate with the external device. Hereby, in a case where an emergency event occurs, it is possible to change, by the volume adjustment portion, the volume of the audio output from the data communications device.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one aspect of this disclosure, in a case where the data communications device ends the output of the audio, the data communications device may output a notification of the audio output end to the information processing device. In a case where the information processing device receives the notification of the audio output end from the data communications device, the information processing device may stop notifying the data communications device of the volume change made by the user operation input into the volume adjustment portion. Hereby, a target of the volume change made by the user operation input into the volume adjustment portion can be changed from the data communications device to the information processing device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another aspect of this disclosure relates to a vehicle including a first speaker, a data communications device, and an information processing device. The volume adjustment portion receives input of a user operation to make a volume change of audio output from the first speaker. The data communications device is not connected to the volume adjustment portion. The information processing device is connected to the volume adjustment portion, and while the data communications device outputs audio from the second speaker, the information processing device notifies the data communications device of the volume change made by the user operation input into the volume adjustment portion.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Another aspect of this disclosure may be specified as an information processing method including the above process to be executed by the information processing device, and an information processing method including the above processes to be executed by the information processing device and the data communications device. Further, another aspect of this disclosure can be specified as a program causing the information processing device to execute the above process and a computer-readable non-transitory recording medium in which the program is stored.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The following describes an embodiment of this disclosure with reference to the drawings. A configuration of the following embodiment is an example, and this disclosure is not limited to the configuration of the embodiment.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view illustrating one example of a system configuration of a vehicle <b>100</b> according to a first embodiment. The vehicle <b>100</b> includes a data communication module (DCM) <b>1</b>, a central ECU (hereinafter referred to as C-ECU) <b>2</b>, a multimedia ECU <b>3</b>, a volume adjustment portion <b>4</b>, an overhead module (OHM) <b>5</b>, a speaker <b>6</b>, a speaker <b>7</b>, an emergency call button <b>8</b>, and other ECUS <b>9</b>. Note that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, only a hardware configuration related to a process according to the first embodiment is extracted and illustrated. The vehicle <b>100</b> also includes various ECUS other than the C-ECU <b>2</b> and the multimedia ECU <b>3</b> and has other hardware configurations related to running.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The DCM <b>1</b> is a device configured to communicate with an external device. The DCM <b>1</b> is, for example, a computer. The DCM <b>1</b> is connected to a network N<b>1</b> via wireless communication and communicates with a center server <b>500</b> via the network N<b>1</b>. The center server <b>500</b> is a server managed by a manufacturer of the vehicle <b>100</b>, for example. The center server <b>500</b> communicates with the DCM <b>1</b> and provides, to an occupant of the vehicle <b>100</b>, services such operation by audio of an operator, navigation, and an emergency call. The network N<b>1</b> is a public network such as the Internet, for example.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The DCM <b>1</b> is connected to the OHM <b>5</b>. The OHM <b>5</b> is connected to the speaker <b>6</b> and the emergency call button <b>8</b>, for example. However, the OHM <b>5</b> is not limited to this, and the OHM <b>5</b> is also connected to a microphone or the like in addition to the speaker <b>6</b>, for example. The OHM <b>5</b> is an ECU configured to control the speaker <b>6</b>, the emergency call button <b>8</b>, and so on, for example. The emergency call button <b>8</b> is a button to be pressed down when the occupant in the vehicle <b>100</b> notifies the center server <b>500</b> of an emergency event. When the emergency call button <b>8</b> is pressed down, an emergency call signal is input into the DCM <b>1</b> via the OHM <b>5</b>, and the DCM <b>1</b> performs an emergency call to the center server <b>500</b>.
