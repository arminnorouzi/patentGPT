More particularly, the present invention relates to a marine fuel oil pretreatment desulfurization system using a pretreatment desulfurization agent having a pretreatment desulfurization function, the system being capable of absorbing and reducing sulfur oxides (SO<sub>X</sub>) when marine fuel oil such as bunker C-oil commonly used as a fuel for a marine engine is burned, thereby reducing sulfur oxides (SO<sub>X</sub>) emissions during combustion of the marine fuel oil.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Sulfur oxides (SO<sub>X</sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) are pointed out as pollutants that cause air pollution. In particular, sulfur oxides are contained in industrial flue gas emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels containing sulfur, and the sulfur oxides cause various environmental pollution problems such as acid rain.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Desulfurization technology for removing sulfur oxides from industrial flue gas has been continuously studied, and a flue gas desulfurization method of treating flue gas after combustion of fossil fuels has been generally used in factories or power plants.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The flue gas desulfurization method refers to a method of desulfurizing the flue gas after burning a fossil fuels containing sulfur, and the flue gas desulfurization methods are categorized into wet treatment and dry treatment. A wet treatment method removes sulfur oxides by washing flue gas with ammonia water, sodium hydroxide solution, lime milk, etc. while a dry treatment method removes sulfur oxides by brining particles or powders of activated carbon or carbonates into contact with flue gas to adsorb or react with sulfur dioxide.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In particular, the sulfur oxide content of heavy fuel oil (MGO, MDO, or DDO) such as bunker C-oil used in marine engines is 1,000 to 3,000 times higher than that of automobile fuel. The amount of sulfur oxides emitted by ships around the world is 130 times higher than that by automobiles and thus is known as the main cause of environmental pollution.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For this reason, conventionally, flue gas desulfurization, which is a post-treatment process performed after combustion of fuel, is used. The fuel gas desulfurization uses a marine wet desulfurization system to remove sulfur oxides emitted from marine engines. In the wet desulfurization system, a pump is used to supply washing water (NaOH), which is usually, to a scrubber through a cooler, and the washing water comes into contact with flue gas in the scrubber. In this case, sulfur oxides are removed through a pose-treatment process.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this case, to maintain or boost the sulfur oxide removal capability of the wet desulfurization system at or to a predetermined level, the pH of the washing water is monitored, and the supply amount of the washing water is automatically controlled. To recycle the washing water, the used washing water is purified, and a huge amount of sludge is generated during the purification of the washing water. The sludge is usually collected and stored in a sludge tank during sailing, and the sludge is treated after the ship is anchored.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As described above, the conventional post-treatment wet desulfurization technology requires a lot of manpower and cost due to the complicated washing water purification process, and it is necessary to separately construct a separate complex desulfurization facility. Therefore, it is difficult to apply such a conventional desulfurization system to currently operating ships. That is, there is a problem that it is not easy and practical to use the conventional desulfurization system in an existing ship in terms of space and cost.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, in order to dramatically reduce the environmental pollution caused by the combustion of marine fuel oil and by the emission of sulfur oxides, research on an effective pretreatment desulfurization system that can significantly reduce the emission of sulfur oxides, can easily remove sulfur oxides, and can be easily applied to an existing ship is urgently needed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention has been made to solve the problems occurring in the related art, and an objective of the present invention is to provide a pretreatment desulfurization system for marine fuel oil, the system being capable of preventing sulfur oxides from being discharged into the air during the combustion of high sulfur marine fuel oil, being able to be simply and easily applied to an existing ship, and having a high desulfurization effect.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to solve the technical problem, according to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a pretreatment desulfurization system including: a desulfurization agent storage tank for storing a liquid-phase pretreatment desulfurization agent; and a metering pump for supplying the liquid-phase pretreatment desulfurization agent from the desulfurization agent storage tank to a fuel supply line through which marine fuel oil is supplied to a marine engine in a predetermined ratio.
