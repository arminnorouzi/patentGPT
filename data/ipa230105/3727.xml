In aquaculture, there is up to a 50% of production loss caused by infectious diseases, resulting in multibillion-dollar annual losses. The result is significant epidemics in fish and great financial loss to the associated industries. Besides bacterial, fungal and viral diseases, parasites can significantly harm finfish aquaculture enterprises. Although normally present in almost all ecosystems, parasites are generally benign for healthy fish. However, parasites can become a problem under stressful conditions inherently found in aquaculture. In order to maximize aquaculture productivity, high stocking densities and less than ideal water quality are common and provide optimal conditions for the infestation of parasites.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Dinoflagellates are a diverse group of aquatic protozoans and some members are parasitic, infesting the skin and gills of marine organisms. Amyloodiniosis, caused by <i>Amyloodinium ocellatum </i>(AO) in temperate and tropical marine fish is one of the most common and devastating parasitic diseases. Although less common and less pathogenic, Piscinoodiniosis, caused by <i>Piscinoodinium pillulare </i>(PP), is the freshwater version of AO in temperate and tropical freshwater fish and has convergent evolution with AO. Both are responsible for &#x201c;velvet disease&#x201d;, and are economically problematic in the fish aquaculture industries due to their ability to reproduce large numbers of infectious agents quickly and due to difficult 4925ies in detecting such agents before the onset of morbidity and mortality. In enclosed systems, such as recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) or aquariums, these parasites can rapidly reproduce and cause catastrophic mortalities in fish and elasmobranchs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Most parasitic species infect invertebrates, but those belonging to the genera <i>Amyloodinium </i>and <i>Piscinoodinium </i>infest the skin and gills of susceptible marine, brackish, or freshwater fish causing velvet disease. Velvet disease infestation causes damage to the host fish through the parasite rhizoids that penetrate deep into the epithelial cells of the skin and gills to obtain nutrition leading to cell death. Infections and mass mortalities of marine fish in tropical aquaria by AO have been documented since the 1930s across nearly every teleost taxa investigated. Essentially all fish within the wide environmental range of velvet disease are highly susceptible to a lethal infection when kept in captivity. The exact economic impact of AO is unclear, but once a facility has become infected, a large portion of the fish may succumb before the infection can be tamed. Eradication of velvet disease is both time consuming and costly and may prevent a business from becoming financially successful.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Velvet disease lifecycle consists of three main stages: trophant (parasitic, feeding stage), tomont (encysted, reproductive stage), and dinospore (free-swimming, infective stage). The trophants firmly anchor to the fish and feed on its epithelia by means of rhizoids. After feeding for 4-5 days (temperature dependent) and growing in size from &#x2dc;12 um to 100 um, trophants loosen their attachment and drop from the fish. They then encyst on the substratum, transform to tomonts, and start dividing. Reproduction peaks in a few days (again temperature dependent) with the release of as many as 256 infective, highly motile dinospores from each tomont. Upon finding a teleost host, the dinospores begin the lifecycle again. Dinospores remain infective for at least a week, with evidence that lower temperatures and non-piscine hosts may be exploited to prolong survival for up to a month. Dinospores have even been found to survive freezing temperatures and can be aerosolized over a distance of 2.5 m or more. Since the lifecycle can be completed in as little as 3 days at 20&#xb0; C., parasite load can increase rapidly and cause severe, acute mortality, and infections that are both very difficult to remove and control.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Mortalities from both AO and PP parasites are usually attributed to anoxia, associated with serious gill hyperplasia, inflammation, hemorrhage and necrosis in heavy infestations; or with osmoregulatory impairment and secondary microbial infections due to severe epithelial damage in mild infestation, see e.g., Moreira et al., <i>Physiological responses of reared sea bream </i>(<i>Sparus aurata Linnaeus, </i>1758) <i>to an Amyloodinium ocellatum outbreak</i>, J Fish Dis. 2017 November; 40(11):1545-1560. This disease state, common in many cultured fish, is contagious, spreads rapidly and has high mortality. Behavioral and physical changes can sometimes be seen just prior to death including flashing, rubbing, gasping at the surface, and a velvety appearance of the skin. However, due to its rapid onset, there are often no signs of infection before mortalities begin to appear within a system, making it imperative to diagnose and treat as early as possible</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Transmission of velvet disease can be through direct contact with live dinospores via contaminated fish or water, including aerosolized droplets from one culture system to another, through fomites (nets, hands, shoes, equipment, etc.), wildlife, dead fish, biofilms on tank and plumbing surfaces, and even from infected frozen baitfish used as feed. Furthermore, the potential for spreading infectious pathogens is increasing due to enhanced capabilities for the transportation of live, and possibly infected fish, into other aquaculture farms and systems.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to detect ribosomal DNA and a loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for <i>Amyloodinium dinoflagellate </i>identification has been developed, see e.g., Pic&#xf3;n-Camacho et al., <i>Development of a rapid assay to detect the dinoflagellate Amyloodinium ocellatum using loop</i>-<i>mediated isothermal amplification </i>(<i>LAMP</i>), Vet Parasitol. 2013 Sep. 23; 196(3-4):265-71. The assays perform equally well in a simple artificial seawater medium and in natural seawater containing a plankton community assemblage and are not inhibited by gill tissue. However, this detection technique employs a clinical setting, appropriate laboratory equipment and expertise to carry out the diagnostic assays, something that most aquaculture farms will not have.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Because AO can tolerate a wide range of salinities (2 to 50 ppt) and temperatures (15-30&#xb0; C.), manipulations of potential adverse environmental conditions may stop divisions, but they will not kill or control outbreaks of the parasite. Under current chemical mitigation options, only the dinospore life stage is susceptible to drug treatment. Using dip/bath treatments of freshwater, formalin or hydrogen peroxide on afflicted fish can force attached trophonts to detach, transform into the reproductive tomont cyst, and finally into the free-swimming dinospores that can then be killed using 0.15-0.2 mg/L free copper ion for 2-3 weeks. However, treatments must be repeated multiple times or for a prolonged period to control infection. It is important during treatment to carefully monitor copper concentration, as copper is lethal to fish at higher concentrations and if allowed to drop below lethal levels for dinospores, fish can quickly become re-infected with the copper tolerant trophont stage. While effective, freshwater dips or formalin baths, followed by copper treatment, are too harsh to utilize on highly infected or young sensitive fish and are very costly in terms of both time and treatment. Chloroquine is also an effective treatment strategy, but it can only be used on non-food fish. Current best practice may employ freshwater dips followed by numerous tank transfers allowing infected tanks to be thoroughly dried or disinfected between transfers. Drawbacks to this approach include high cost for labor and time, and frequent handling and consequent extreme stressful for the fish. These strict, costly, and time-consuming protocols are however necessitated by the significant economic consequences from an infestation introduced into a closed system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Opportunistic parasites play a critical role in influencing the productivity, sustainability and economic viability of global finfish aquaculture enterprises. Without stringent and appropriate control measures, the impacts of these pathogens can often be significant. As global aquaculture continues to expand, the spread of parasites to new environments, and the occurrence and the severity of infestations from parasites, may also rise along with the economic fallout from such infections. The potential for climate change affecting environmental conditions may also affect current production practices, interactions between wild and farmed aquatic stocks, parasite life cycles and transmission pathways. These and other pressures may consequently further constrain production, sustainability and economic feasibility.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">There remains an unmet need for an in-situ rapid diagnostic test (RDT) biosensor to be used by the farmers for the early detection of infection and increased viability of fish in the aquaculture industry.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The most common diagnostic technique used for identifying infections from AO and PP parasites is by microscopic analyses of mucus, skin and gills. However, there are several impediments to relying on microscopy for monitoring presence of these parasites. First, the identification of the parasites can be subjective, leading to potential false positives/negatives and second, by the time there is visual or behavioral evidence suggesting the possible onset of disease, it is too late for effective treatment and control. A tank-side RDT could ameliorate these impediments by providing growers a biosensor for early detection of these parasites.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Current methodologies for the detection of AO and PP are insufficient to circumvent outbreaks that can occur extremely rapidly, and which can lead to 100% mortality within a few days. Control is most successful when a diagnosis is made while the parasite load is still low. However, the trophonts must be numerous for a robust determination, which means that it may well be too late for effective treatment strategies. Some fish have been found to develop a specific, antibody-mediated response to AO. Unfortunately, since immune response is slow to develop, host antibody-based tests are not useful in early detection of infection.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">AO and PP parasites do not move directly from fish to fish as their immediate mode of transmission, and instead first pass through a developmental phase in the water when not attached to a fish host. While trophonts can contaminate an aquaculture system via an infected host fish, both tomonts and infective dinospores can be introduced directly with incoming seawater, becoming a separate source of infection for fish in the system. Consequently, assessing the presence of both trophonts on fish gill and skin tissue, and infective tomonts and dinospores in the water, will provide a more comprehensive monitoring scheme for the early detection and prevention of velvet disease. Preferably this involves early detection or identification of infected water or fish prior to introducing either into a closed water system. An RDT biosensor could provide a rapid in-situ low cost alternative for the detection of AO. With a parasite that reproduces as rapidly as velvet disease, immediate tank-side diagnosis is critical.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Disclosed herein are devices, systems and methods employing affinity reagents, such as recombinant monoclonal antibodies (rmAbs) and other affinity reagents discussed below, selected to target the two infectious life stages of AO, PP, or AO and PP.

It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the claimed inventions to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the subject matter as defined by the claims.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Velvet disease is problematic in warm water fresh and marine fisheries and aquaculture, due to its ability to rapidly produce large quantities of infectious dinospores, and is hard to detect with current technologies (microscopy) until morbidity and mortality has occurred. At that point treatment and control options are limited, leading to massive loss of fish product and reduced revenue for the growers.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Commercial disease RDT biosensors, such as for <i>Vibrio cholera</i>, typically employ a lateral flow technology assay (LFA), based on the principles of immunochromatography and nanotechnology, in which the main components used for detection are antibodies (Abs). Antibody based-biosensors work similarly to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) where the sensor relies on the ability of the Abs biosensor to recognize its target of interest (the antigen; Ag). An effective Ab-based biosensor should have high specificity in a very complex medium, well-characterized binding properties, high stability, and the potential for low-cost, large-scale production.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Polyclonal Abs (pAbs) are a heterogeneous antibody mixture derived from the immune response in a host animal species, with each pAb recognizing a different structural region (epitope) of the targeted Ag. While these pAbs can be easily generated, batch-related differences, varying affinity and poly-specificity (reactivity with more than one target) can be potential problems. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be better at targeting a particular region of an Ag of interest, resulting in higher specificity than pAbs; however, animal-derived, cell line production of mAbs can take up to eight months.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Rather than using pAbs or mAbs, an rmAb assay can be selected and developed in vitro using synthetic genes and a targeted selection strategy. Animals are not required, thereby shortening development time, and production can take place in the bacteria <i>E. coli</i>, providing a continuous source of Abs (unlike in vivo derived pAbs). Use of rmAbs for antigen binding can also provide improved specificity and high affinity, factors that are especially useful in an RDT biosensor. An assay based on appropriate rmAbs can also optimize the binding of both targets on the various lifestages. Without being bound by theory, rmAbs may provide enhanced cross-reactivity and thus enhanced detection for any of the AO or PP lifestages, allowing for a more thorough and sensitive screening method for fish.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The advantages described here, and many of the examples discussed in greater detail below, focus on rmAbs. Though rmAbs may represent some advantages over pAbs and mAbs, all three fall under the umbrella of affinity reagents. Other affinity reagents include various other proteins and peptides, as well as aptamers and oligos of nucleic acids.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Like recombinant antibodies, aptamers are a non-animal technology and likewise have a rapid development time. Unlike antibodies, aptamers are nucleic-acid based, which often results in a much smaller molecule as they are a short, single-stranded oligo of either DNA or RNA. Despite this difference in material, aptamers share antibodies' ability to bind proteins and modulate their function and are sometimes referred to as &#x201c;chemical antibodies&#x201d; due to this antibody-like behavior. Aptamers also share many of the advantages of rmAbs, including exhibiting high specificity and affinity. Aptamers may also exhibit unique advantages in some situations, such as the ability to access hidden epitopes due to their flexibility.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thus, though the examples discussed herein are discussed primarily in terms of rmAbs, it is to be understood that another affinity reagent may be used while preserving the advantages and functionality of the disclosure as described herein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Thus the above-described losses from velvet disease may be mitigated by using rmAbs, or another affinity reagent, selected to provide early detection of AO and PP (using, e.g., an RDT employing at least one conjugated (detection) rmAb, or other affinity reagent, and at least one immobilized (capture) rmAb, or other affinity reagent) to test waters or fish present in, or to be introduced into, aquaculture fish farms. Doing so can prevent infection or reinfection, and can permit effective treatment and control before widespread disease occurs.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The HuCAL Human Combinatorial Antibody Libraries from BioRad Laboratories, Inc. is, according to its manufacturer designed for selection and generation of &#x201c;highly specific, fully human, recombinant monoclonal antibodies in Fab and full immunoglobulin format&#x201d;. However, rather than using HuCAL to generate fully human antibodies, the library may instead be used to generate rmAbs for AO, PP, or AO and PP detection. Doing so does not require the use of animals and can generate useful rmAbs in less than 12 weeks. In contrast to traditional pAbs and mAbs, HuCAL rmAbs are developed in vitro and production occurs in the bacteria <i>E. coli</i>. This can provide a continuous source of Abs, unlike in vivo-derived Abs. Further, use of the HuCAL library and rmAb technology can optimize the binding of dinospore and trophont Ags, a distinct advantage over traditional Ab development technology. HuCAL rmAbs may provide enhanced detection for a plurality of parasite life stages, resulting in a more thorough and sensitive screening method for both the trophonts in infected fish, and the trophonts and dinospores in tank water.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, representative system <b>100</b> for processing and determining the presence of velvet disease is shown. Automated instrument <b>101</b> supports a microtiter plate <b>102</b> containing sample wells <b>104</b> and positioned atop movable stage <b>106</b>.

The measurements are stored <b>210</b> along with other previously or subsequently stored measurements for samples from the same population or region, using for example onboard, nearby, networked or cloud storage. The stored measurements are analyzed <b>212</b> using for example onboard, nearby, networked or cloud computing. Based on analysis <b>212</b>, an alternative <b>214</b> is followed, namely to delay or forego <b>216</b> any introduction of water or fish into a facility or any harvest, transport or sale of fish from such facility for a given time period and to instead continue monitoring or treatment of such fish, or to permit harvest <b>218</b>, transport, or sale of the fish.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A block diagram <b>300</b> demonstrating the general principles of the disclosed RDT biosensor assay device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

To maintain a natural source of AO-Ag (trophont and dinospore) for use in the immunoassays of this project, AO is cultured in a biosecure aquaculture facility under approved protocols and under the supervision of a veterinarian. The culturing of AO with na&#xef;ve host fish allows for a higher infection intensity and increases the yield of trophonts and dinospores. Culturing of trophont and dinospores is performed according to published methods, using a 500-L tank containing artificial seawater, equipped with appropriate aeration, biofilters and filtration for the culturing of AO. The temperature and salinity are maintained for the desired rearing of AO at 25&#xb0; C. and 26 ppt respectively. All water quality parameters including DO, temperature, pH, salinity, ammonia and nitrite are monitored daily. Previously AO infected fish obtained from aquaculture facilities are frozen, sent to a lab and examined via microscopy for the presence of AO followed by PCR confirmation. Excised gills from frozen infected fish are used to obtain the trophonts for inoculation of the culture tank. Na&#xef;ve pinfish (Lagodon rhomboids) obtained from local aquaculture farms are introduced to the inoculated tank and observed until evidence of significant infection is displayed by the fish (air gulping, erratic swimming, side scraping). The fish are removed and their gill arches excised, placed in glass dishes with artificial seawater, and gently agitated to dislodge trophonts. A subsample of seawater with the detached trophonts is passed through a 150 &#x3bc;m mesh filter, and the filtrate centrifuged at 200&#xd7;g for 10 mins. The trophont pellet is sonicated to disrupt the cellular tissue and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. to be used as a first Ag in HuCAL screening for AO-rmAbs. The remaining excised gill arches are allowed to settle for 20-30 min to allow the trophonts to transform into the tomont phase. The seawater is filtered twice, once with 200 &#x3bc;m and then with a 60 &#x3bc;m filter to remove any material larger than the tomont. The filtered tomonts are washed 3 times with sterile water and placed in 25 ml glass tube along with additional gill material as a substrate and incubated at 22&#xb0; C. for 72 hours to transform into dinospores. The dinospores are transferred by to a clean centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 10 mins at 200&#xd7;g to pellet the tissue followed by sonication. The sonicated dinospores are stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. for use as a second Ag in HuCAL screening for AO-rmAbs.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 2</heading><heading id="h-0010" level="1">HuCAL Library Screening for Identification of Two AO-rmAbs</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Clownfish immunized with sonicated dinospores were able to generate an immune response that recognized both the dinospore and trophont sonicated antigens (Ags). However, the tomont was not recognized due to rapid encysting which reduced Ag exposure. This suggests that the dinospore and trophont life stages may possess similar Ags allowing for the development of rmAbs having the ability to detect both these infective life stages. Therefore, both free-swimming dinospores (sonicated) and parasitic trophont (sonicated) are used to screen the HuCAL library for AO-rmAbs and create an AO-RDT for monitoring AO on fish bodies and in water. In order to identify AO-rmAbs, guided selection for epitope recognition of the dinospore and trophont Ags is performed. Selection of Abs using HuCAL technology is done in vitro, which enables greater flexibility for Ab generation than conventional methods based on animal immunization. Guided selection strategies involving either blocking steps or the use of two or more Ags are employed for the isolation of epitope-specific Abs, or for Abs that recognize different epitopes of the same Ag. Initial selection involves the presentation of the HuCAL Ab library to the sonicated dinospore immobilized on a solid support. Abs identified by the first round of selection are then presented to the sonicated trophont immobilized on a solid support. Three or more rounds of selection may be performed to enrich the Ab library for specific dinospore and trophont binding. Activity and specificity of the AO-rmAbs are tested using a quality control (QC) ELISA, in which the AO-rmAbs are tested on three non-related standard Ags and on all positive and negative control Ags. A primary criterion for selecting the rmAbs is their ability to detect the whole AO organism at various life stages. The rmAbs that pass all initial tests with the sonicated dinospores and trophonts are then tested with intact dinospores, tomonts, and trophonts as a final selection process.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 3</heading><heading id="h-0012" level="1">ELISA Testing to Determine AO-rmAbs Pairings, QA and QC</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Twenty rmAbs are selected from the HUCAL Library for potential use in an AO-RDT. The RDT employs a lateral flow assay (LFA), based on a sandwich ELISA format that requires two rmAbs, one serving as the &#x201c;capture&#x201d; rmAb and the other serving as the &#x201c;detector&#x201d; rmAb. Some Abs will work better as the capture and others as the detector. To determine which mAbs work best and as capture or detector, pairing of the rmAbs is performed using several capture or detector combinations and evaluated against traditional ELISA assay tests. The ELISA tests use as positive Ags the whole and sonicated forms of the trophonts and dinospores obtained in Example 1, with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) serving as negative controls. For diagnostic purposes, the ELISA and RDT assays are treated as qualitative assays requiring a simple positive or negative response for the presence of AO. For evaluation of a negative response, optical density (OD) measurements obtained from the negative controls are used to determine the upper limit of negativity with a 99.9% confidence limit. A positive response value is set based on the mean OD of the negative controls plus three standard deviations of the mean. Further optimization is performed by comparing and correlating ELISA results of those from conventional microscopy. Twenty or more positive and negative samples analyzed by ELISA are validated by microscopy and PCR for the presence or absence of AO. Once optimized, the ELISA assay is used for at least three independent experiments to determine the reproducibility of the AO-rmAb ELISA assay.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 4</heading><heading id="h-0014" level="1">ELISA Testing for PP Cross-Reactivity and Species Specificity</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0056">To investigate whether rmAbs that target AO may also detect the freshwater parasite PP by cross-reactivity to PP, freshwater fish naturally infested with PP are obtained from a collaborating aquaria facility. The investigation is based upon the shared common phylogeny (class Dinophyceae) of the AO and PP ectoparasites, as well as their morphologic and developmental similarities. Gill microscopy is used to validate the presence of PP with confirmation by PCR through amplification of ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Isolation of the trophonts and dinospores is carried out using the method described in Example 1. The PP trophont and PP dinospore as well as the proteins isolated by sonication from each of the life stages are be tested with AO-rmAb pairs by sandwich ELISA. The criteria employed in Example 3 are used to determine a positive and negative response for the presence of PP.

Activity and specificity of the AO-rmAbs are tested using a quality control (QC) ELISA, in which the AO-rmAbs are tested on three non-related standard Ags and on the positive and negative control Ags described in Example 2. Sandwich ELISA optimization for the best pairing of capture and detector AO-rmAbs is performed and compared and correlated to the optimized AO-rmAbs pair ELISA results obtained using conventional microscopy to evaluate the presence of AO as described in Example 3. The AO-rmAbs are tested for cross-reactivity with PP to determine utility of the AO-rmAbs as a tool for detection of PP in freshwater fish species.

Aptamers can be generated using an entirely in vitro process called Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX). The SELEX procedure involves presenting a random DNA library to the target (AO) in multiple rounds of binding, partitioning, recovery, and amplification until the DNA library is fully enriched for binders to the target. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example SELEX process.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">This highly selective and rigorous process can generate aptamers which may have superior sensitivity and specificity compared to equivalent target protein antibodies. Once a target aptamer sequence is known, it becomes virtually immortalized through chemical synthesis, resulting in minimal to no batch-to-batch variation (a common problem with antibodies). This characteristic confers on aptamers a significant advantage over conventional antibodies in that they can be synthesized with 100%, or nearly 100%, reproducibility. The aptasensor relies on the ability of the aptamer (receptor) to recognize its target of interest (ligand), i.e., <i>Amyloodinium</i>. Once identified, the aptamer(s) may be used to create an in situ lateral flow immunoassay for the early detection of the AO dinospore life stage in water samples.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A pure culture of AO dinospores can be used as the target for aptamer selection through the SELEX process. The dinospores immobilized on a Whatman glass fiber membrane can be exposed to an aptamer library (with a starting diversity of approximately 10<sup>15 </sup>individual candidate sequences, for example). The library can be added to the membrane in solution and allowed to incubate. The membrane may then be washed to remove non-binding candidates, and the bound candidates eluted from the membrane. The bound candidates can be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and converted back to ssDNA to be used as the input library pool for the next round of SELEX. The SELEX can be performed over ten rounds while the stringency is increased, such as by reducing the time allowed for binding or increasing the number of post-binding washes performed. Negative selection can be made using a plain membrane without dinospores, which may ensure that the aptamers are not binding to the filter. At the end of the SELEX, Next-generation Sequencing (NGS) can be performed on the sequence pools, such as from rounds 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Using NGS, bioinformatics, or a proprietary method, 24-candidate AO dinospore binding aptamers were identified in an example execution.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A fluorescence dot blot analysis can be performed to visualize aptamer binding to the AO dinospores. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an example fluorescence dot blot of AO dinospores immobilized on a PVDF membrane. The AO dinospore samples can be loaded on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, while the aptamer pools can be fluorescently dyed by amplification with a Cy5-labelled PCR primer. AO samples and aptamer pools can be incubated to stain the dots in separate wells. Stained dots can be scanned for Cy5 fluorescence using a GenePix microarray scanner. An example execution of this analysis may indicate that the aptamers can bind to the AO dinospores, however at or slightly above background, as demonstrated by the intensity of AO/aptamer pool dots compared to the Cy5 primer background dot. A lack of signal in the no stain (no Cy5) well, along with the lack of a visible dot in the EtOH only (no AO), Cy5 primer well can confirm that AO was successfully dotted onto the membrane.
