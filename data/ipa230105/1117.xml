Leaks between the patient interface and the patient's face can reduce the effectiveness of, and compliance with, the therapy, as the prescribed treatment parameters are not being maintained.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Leaks are especially prone to occur as the patient moves during the night. Movement of and drag on the air delivery tube as the patient turns or moves can alter the positioning and alignment of the patient interface with respect to the patient's face. This movement can be translated or transferred to the seal formed between the patient interface and the patient's face which may in turn create a leak in the seal. Thus, while the patient interface may initially be leak free when attached to the patient, leaks are prone to develop later in the night as the patient moves in bed which may cause the patient to waken rendering the therapy ineffective.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In certain mask designs, air pressure from within a mask chamber (or pressure chamber) may act on the underside of a mask seal, e.g., a thin flap, to urge the flap into sealing position. However in other mask designs, this air pressure effect may not impact on the seal effectiveness.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a continuous need in the art for patient interface systems, accessories, etc. that ensure a good seal between the patient interface and the patient's face is maintained.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF TECHNOLOGY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first aspect of the disclosed technology relates to a patient interface system configured to prevent or reduce deleterious effects of disruptive forces (e.g., tube drag) on the seal between a patient interface and the patient's face.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the disclosed technology relates to an apparatus arranged to maintain a patient interface in sealing relation with a patient's face.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the disclosed technology relates to an apparatus configured to prevent, limit, minimize or reduce degradation of a seal between a patient interface and a patient's face.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the disclosed technology relates to an apparatus configured to absorb disruptive forces (e.g., tube drag) exerted on a patient interface.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another aspect of the disclosed technology is a method and apparatus to improve the robustness and/or effectiveness of a seal between a patient interface and a patient's face when an air pressure effect acting on the underside of a seal portion of the patient interface does not provide an adequate seal with the patient's face.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another aspect of the disclosed technology is a patient interface having a pressure chamber, and seal portion that is not supported by air pressure in use.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another aspect of the disclosed technology is a patient interface having a seal member with an interior surface and an exterior surface, and wherein a seal is formed in use with a portion of the interior surface of the seal member.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another aspect of the disclosed technology relates to an apparatus for ensuring an effective seal is maintained between a respiratory patient interface and a patient's face, the respiratory patient interface adapted to receive pressurized gas from a supply tube and deliver the pressurized gas to the patient's airways, the patient interface including a seal portion adapted to seal against the patient's face.

It is to be understood that one or more features of any one example may be combinable with one or more features of the other examples. In addition, any single feature or combination of features in any of the examples may constitute an additional example or examples.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this specification, the word &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; is to be understood in its &#x201c;open&#x201d; sense, that is, in the sense of &#x201c;including&#x201d;, and thus not limited to its &#x201c;closed&#x201d; sense, that is the sense of &#x201c;consisting only of&#x201d;. A corresponding meaning is to be attributed to the corresponding words &#x201c;comprise&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprised&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; where they appear.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">1. Patient Interface Systems</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In treatment of SDB (e.g., by pneumatically splinting the patient's airways with gas or air pressurized in the range of about 2-30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (typically 8-12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O)), a variety of patient interfaces may be used to deliver the breathable gas to the patient's airways. As an example, suitable patient interfaces may include nasal and/or oral cushions, nasal &#x201c;cradles,&#x201d; nasal &#x201c;pillows,&#x201d; nasal prongs, nozzles, and cannulae. An interior area of the patient interface defined by the seal between the patient and the patient interface may be considered a pressure chamber. As mentioned above, to ensure effective therapy, a good seal between the patient interface and the patient should be maintained.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus, the patient interface system should be designed to avoid leakage that causes annoyance and/or discomfort to the patient and to improve the quality of the therapy by reducing or eliminating problems associated with leakage.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As the patient moves during the night, disruptive forces such as tube drag are transferred to the patient interface tending to cause the positioning of the patient interface to become altered, thereby increasing the likelihood that the seal will leak. Patient interface systems according to examples of the disclosed technology may be designed with various seal maintenance structures (described below) to prevent, reduce or stop such leakage from the patient interface. The patient interface systems may also be designed to reduce or eliminate noise disturbance to the patient, which may be a consequence of a leaking seal.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is noted that features described herein for preventing or reducing leakage described in relation to a particular patient interface may also be useable with a different patient interface.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">2. Scissor Mechanism</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a patient interface system includes a nasal cradle <b>101</b> and a seal maintenance device <b>110</b> to prevent movement of a supply tube <b>150</b> from disrupting the seal with the patient's face. The nasal cradle <b>101</b> is placed at an entrance to the patient's nares, resting on an upper lip region of the patient's face. The nasal cradle is structured to form an interface with the nares and includes right and left <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> portions (seal portions) (from the patient's perspective when the patient interface worn) that seal with the sides of the patient's nose, or the external nares. The supply tube <b>150</b> is coupled to the nasal cradle <b>101</b> and is arranged to deliver breathable gas to the patient. Headgear <b>170</b> may aid is supporting the cradle <b>101</b> on the patient's face.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The seal maintenance device <b>110</b> includes an actuator <b>160</b> coupled to the supply tube <b>150</b>, an extensible connector <b>162</b> connecting the actuator <b>160</b> and the cradle <b>101</b>, first and second scissor arms <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> having respective upper portions <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>114</b>(<b>1</b>) coupled to the cradle <b>101</b> and respective lower portions <b>112</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>114</b>(<b>2</b>) coupled to the actuator <b>160</b>, and a support member <b>164</b> for pivotably supporting the first and second scissor arms <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>. The seal maintenance device <b>110</b> may be coupled to the supply tube <b>150</b> such that a downward (or any other direction tending to pull the tube away from the patient's face) force (e.g., caused by tube drag) on the tube <b>150</b> is transferred to the seal maintenance device <b>110</b> to prevent the force from causing leakage at the seal.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The support member <b>164</b> is connected to or otherwise anchored by the headgear <b>170</b>. In an example, the support member <b>164</b> may form part of the headgear <b>170</b>. The extensible connector <b>162</b> has a first end <b>162</b>(<b>1</b>) connected to the support member <b>164</b> and a second end <b>162</b>(<b>2</b>) connected to the actuator <b>160</b>. When a disruptive force f<b>1</b> is applied to the supply tube <b>150</b>, the actuator exerts a force on the second end <b>162</b>(<b>2</b>) of the extensible connector <b>162</b>. As a result, the extensible connector <b>162</b> extends its length in the direction of arrow A due to its extensible construction and the connection of the first end <b>162</b> (<b>1</b>) to the support member <b>164</b>. That is, the first end <b>162</b>(<b>1</b>) of the extensible connector <b>162</b> is anchored via its connection to the support member <b>164</b> which is in turn connected to headgear <b>170</b> which is securely fastened to the patient's head. The pivot <b>116</b> of the scissor arms <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> is also connected to the support member <b>164</b>. The support member <b>164</b> may be formed of a substantially rigid material (e.g., metal, hard plastic, etc.).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The extensible connector <b>162</b> is constructed in a manner that allows it to extend its length so as to be movable from a compressed positioned to an extended position. Such movement of the extensible connector <b>162</b> effectively decouples movement of the supply tube <b>150</b> from the cradle <b>101</b>. As such, transference of the force f<b>1</b> to the cradle <b>101</b> is minimized or even completely eliminated. In the illustrated example, the extensible connector <b>162</b> will retract to the compressed position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>-<b>1</b></figref>, when no external force is applied which would cause the extensible connector <b>162</b> to extend. In an example, the extensible connector <b>162</b> may include rigid portions <b>162</b>(<b>3</b>) and flexible portions <b>162</b>(<b>4</b>) such that the flexible portions may tend to fold when the extensible connector <b>162</b> is compressed and stretch out when the extensible connector is extended.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The actuator <b>160</b> is connected to the second end <b>162</b>(<b>2</b>) of the extensible connector <b>162</b>. Thus, when the disruptive force f<b>1</b> is applied, the actuator <b>160</b> moves away from the cradle <b>101</b> along with the supply tube <b>150</b> and the extensible connector <b>162</b>. The actuator may include a pair of slots <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> formed therein and configured to respectively receive the lower portions <b>112</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>114</b>(<b>2</b>) of the first and second scissor arms <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>. The slots <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> may be curved or angled such that proximal ends of the slots (with respect to the patient) are disposed inwardly of distal ends of the slots. As such, movement of the actuator <b>160</b> away from the patient will cause the lower portions <b>112</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>114</b>(<b>2</b>) of the scissor arms to move closer (inwardly) to one another, in the direction of arrows B. Such inward movement of the lower portions <b>112</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>114</b>(<b>2</b>) of the scissor arms <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> causes the upper portions <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>114</b>(<b>1</b>) of the scissor arms to swing towards one another. This motion causes the upper portions <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>114</b>(<b>1</b>) to exert a force on the right and left portions <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> of the nasal cradle <b>101</b> to urge the right and left portions <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> against the patient's face, in the direction of arrows C. The upper portions <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>114</b>(<b>1</b>) of the scissor arms may cause the right and left portions <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> of the cradle <b>101</b> to stretch lengthwise as well as move inwardly, as shown by the direction of the arrows C. By converting motion of the supply tube <b>150</b> away from the patient's face into motion of the seal maintenance device <b>110</b> which actually urges the nasal cradle <b>101</b> towards the patient's face, deleterious effects of tube drag and other disruptive forces can be overcome and a good seal can be maintained as the patient moves during the night.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The upper portions <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>114</b>(<b>1</b>) may be respectively pivotably connected (e.g., via connectors <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>) to the right and left portions <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> of the cradle <b>101</b>. Connectors <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be attached to the cradle and include a portion pivotably connected to the upper portions <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>114</b>(<b>1</b>) of the scissor arms. Such pivotal connection may be about a single axis, two axes, or more than two axes (e.g., a ball and socket joint).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The actuator <b>160</b> may provide a swivel connection to the supply tube <b>150</b>.

The cushion <b>300</b> includes a non-face-contacting side <b>312</b> and a face-contacting side <b>314</b>. The non-face-contacting side <b>312</b> is connected to a connecting member <b>305</b> which provides a supply of breathable gas to the cushion <b>300</b>. The connecting member <b>305</b> may be a supply tube, a connector (such as a swivel connector or ball and socket type connector) interconnecting the cushion and a supply tube, or any other appropriate mechanism to introduce the breathable gas to the cushion. The breathable gas is communicated to the patient by an aperture <b>319</b> via a channel <b>321</b> extending through the cushion <b>300</b>. Suitable materials for the cushion <b>300</b> include Silicone, polyurethane, rubber and textiles.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The cushion <b>300</b> includes a compressible interior fluid chamber and thus forms a compression or gasket-type seal with the patient's face.

The nasal cradle <b>400</b> is structured to form an interface with the nares and includes right and left portions <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> (seal portions) that seal with the sides of the patient's nose, or the external nares. The resilient member may be arranged to passively counteract disruptive forces (e.g., tube drag) and thereby maintain an effective seal. That is, the resilient member may be configured to absorb a disruptive force thereby preventing degradation of the seal against the patient's face. Additionally, or alternatively, the resilient member may be configured to urge the seal portion against the patient's face in response to a disruptive force exerted on the seal portion.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The resilient member may comprise one or more springs, such as a mechanical spring. In another example, the resilient member may be a flexible beam, e.g., that is configured to bend. The resilient member may also be a compressible member. The resilient member may be constructed from an elastomeric material. The resilient member may be constructed from a foam, e.g., an elastic foam, and/or a visco-elastic foam. In the illustrated example, the patient interface system includes springs <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an example, the patient interface system may include an optional bow-shaped elastic member <b>420</b> which extends around the cradle <b>400</b> and includes right and left sides <b>422</b>, <b>424</b> connected respectively to the right and left portions <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> of the cradle. A supply tube <b>460</b> is connected to the frame <b>440</b> and is in fluid communication with an inlet <b>462</b> of the elastic member <b>420</b> or the cradle <b>400</b> to provide breathable gas to the patient's airways via the nasal cradle. A middle portion <b>426</b> of the elastic member <b>420</b> or the cradle <b>400</b> is connected to a frame at an engaging portion <b>443</b> of the frame.

The springs <b>432</b>, <b>434</b> are compressed when the nasal cradle <b>400</b> is positioned on the patient's face. As such, the springs exert outward forces f<sub>c </sub>against both the frame <b>440</b> and the right and left <b>422</b>, <b>424</b> sides of the elastic member <b>420</b> (or the right and left portions <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> of the nasal cradle <b>400</b> if connected directly thereto). Since the frame is a sturdy, rigid or semi-rigid member, the springs <b>432</b>, <b>434</b> tend to push the right and left <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> portions of the nasal cradle against the patient's nose which aids in establishing a good seal.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In use, springs <b>432</b>, <b>434</b> are in compression. Thus, if a disruptive force f<b>3</b> such as tube drag acts to pull the frame <b>440</b>, the elastic member <b>420</b>, or the cradle <b>400</b> away from the patient's nose, the springs <b>432</b>, <b>434</b> will resist such movement of the elastic member <b>420</b> or nasal cradle <b>400</b>, thus effectively decoupling the cradle <b>400</b> from the frame <b>440</b> and the supply tube <b>460</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>3</b></figref>.

In the illustrated example, since disruptive force f<b>3</b> is exerted on the right side of the nasal cradle, while spring <b>432</b> is partially unloaded, spring <b>434</b> may be further loaded thereby also remaining in compression. As such, the patient interface system may exhibit an increased ability to overcome such disruptive forces and prevent or limit degradation of the seal since the springs <b>432</b>, <b>434</b> remain in compression at all times thereby ensuring an outward force f<sub>c </sub>by the springs pushes the nasal cradle towards the patient's face to maintain a good seal even when a disruptive force is exerted on the patient interface.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Springs <b>432</b>, <b>434</b> may be formed of resilient metals (e.g., spring steel).
