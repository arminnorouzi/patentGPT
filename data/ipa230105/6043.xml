CN201911370082.8, filed on Dec. 26, 2019 and entitled &#x201c;Cell structure of silicon carbide MOSFET device, and power semiconductor device&#x201d;, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments relate to the technical field of power semiconductor devices, and in particular to a silicon carbide metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) device integrated with a Schottky barrier diode (SBD), and a cell structure thereof.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the development of energy conservation and emission reduction, new energy gate connection and the smart gate, more and more attention has been paid to the third-generation semiconductor silicon carbide (SiC) power device, the main advantage of which is that the breakdown electric field strength is ten times of that of a traditional silicon device, or that the specific on-resistance is almost a thousandth of that of the silicon device in the same voltage/current level. The switching frequency of the SiC device is 20 times of that of the silicon device, which can reduce the volume of an energy storage element in a circuit. In theory, the SiC device can operate in a high-temperature environment above 600&#xb0; C., and has excellent anti-radiation performance, which can greatly improve the reliability of a system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the bipolar degradation phenomenon in a silicon carbide bipolar device, which is limited by existing manufacturing technology, will result in a significant decrease of the life of a carrier of the device, and make the voltage drop and the reverse bias leakage current of the device increase, which is inconducive to the reliability of the silicon carbide device. An existing MOSFET with a planar gate N-type channel structure is also parasitized by one body diode, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, comprises: an N+ substrate layer <b>101</b>, an N&#x2212; drift region <b>102</b>, a P well region <b>103</b>, an N+ source region <b>104</b>, a P+ region <b>105</b>, a JFET region <b>106</b>, a gate oxide layer <b>107</b>, gate polysilicon <b>108</b>, source metal <b>109</b>, drain metal <b>110</b> and a body PIN diode <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the MOSFET is reverse biased, it is necessary to use a SBD in an anti-parallel manner with the MOSFET as a free wheeling diode of the MOSFET in order to inhibit the bipolar degradation caused by the turning on the body diode. In normal cases, connecting an SBD in an anti-parallel manner in a chip level will increase the cost of module encapsulation, and will introduce an additional bonding wire and stray inductance at the SBD end resulting in the decrease of the electrical performance of the module.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is necessary to provide a new MOSFET device in order to improve the above-mentioned technical problems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve the above-mentioned problems in some cases, the embodiments of the present disclosure provide a silicon carbide metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) device integrated with an SBD, and provide a cell structure of the silicon carbide MOSFET device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The embodiments of the present disclosure provide a cell structure of a silicon carbide MOSFET device, the cell structure including a first conducting type drift region located on a first conducting type substrate layer; a second conducting type well region and a first JFET region, which are transversely adjacent to each other along a surface of the cell structure, and are arranged within a surface of the drift region at one end transversely extending along the surface of the cell structure; an enhancement region, which is arranged within a surface of the well region at a side of the well region that is away from the first JFET region, the enhancement region including a first conducting type enhancement region and a second conducting type enhancement region, which are transversely adjacent to each other along the surface of the cell structure, wherein the first conducting type enhancement region is closer to the first JFET region than the second conducting type enhancement region; a gate insulating layer, which is arranged on the first conducting type enhancement region, a surface of the well region that is not covered by the enhancement region, and the first JEFT region, and is in contact therewith at the same time, and a gate, which is arranged on the gate insulating layer; source metal, which is arranged on the enhancement region, wherein the source metal forms ohmic contact with the enhancement region therebelow, and is not in contact with the drift region and the gate; Schottky metal, which is arranged on a surface of the drift region, which is not covered by the well region and the second JEFT region, at the other end transversely extending along the surface of the cell structure, wherein the Schottky metal forms Schottky contact with the drift region therebelow; and drain metal, which is located below the substrate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The embodiments of the present disclosure also provide a silicon carbide MOSFET device, including the cell structure of the silicon carbide MOSFET device in the above content.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be described in the following description, and some will become obvious from the description, or understood by implementing the present disclosure.
