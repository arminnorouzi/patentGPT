Along with the benefits these devices are designed to bring to a patient, they also can create a potential hazard of electric shock to the patient. Electric shock can be caused by current (referred to as leakage current) flowing through the patient, for instance, creating problems such as ventricular defibrillation in the patient's heart, which a medical device may induce in patient at ground potential or sink to ground if the patient is in contact with another source of electricity. It is desirable to design medical equipment to reduce leakage current. In particular, it is desirable to provide a pump that reduces or entirely blocks the passage of leakage current through the pump.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In certain embodiments, a leakage current path may be formed in a fluid line, such as a drain line. Often, fluid is pumped through a fluid line using a pump, such as a peristaltic pump. A peristaltic pump includes a rotor around which a plurality of rollers is disposed, and the rollers come into contact with a piece of compliant tubing and press it against a part referred to as a pump shoe. A peristaltic pump according to embodiments of the disclosure, reduces or entirely blocks and prevents the flow of leakage current through the pipe which is serving as the pumping tube segment, by ensuring that conductive fluid in the pumping tube segment is forced out of certain areas and thereby interrupting a conductive pathway through the pumping tube segment.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated herein and constitute part of this specification, illustrate exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, and, together with the general description given above and the detailed description given below, serve to explain the features of embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.

In a typical peristaltic pump, a rotor <b>120</b> carries a number of circumferential rollers (<b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>), possibly mounted on bearings, each of which is arranged to compress a flexible tube <b>130</b>. As the rotor rotates, a part of the tube is compressed by a roller, thus occluding the tube and forcing the fluid to move through the tube in the direction of movement of the roller. The tube is fabricated from a resilient material and thus reassumes its normal cross-sectional profile after the compression by the roller ceases. This process of peristalsis mimics many biological systems (such as the action of esophagus or the gastrointestinal tract). A body of fluid (or bolus) trapped between two successive rollers is thus transported at ambient pressure toward the pump outlet.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The peristaltic pump <b>100</b> includes a rotor <b>120</b> mounted on and rotatable about a central point or axis <b>121</b>, and positioned in close proximity to a pumping shoe <b>125</b>. As indicated by the double-sided arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the rotor <b>120</b> and the shoe <b>125</b> can be moved relative to each other such that the gap between the rotor <b>120</b> and the shoe <b>125</b> can be increased or decreased. The shoe <b>125</b>, the rotor <b>120</b>, or both may be installed on a shaft or rod <b>114</b> that is inserted in a spring <b>116</b> or other biasing mechanisms which urges the rotor and the shoe against each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. It will be understood that the central axis <b>121</b> of the rotor <b>120</b> can also be biased in addition to the shoe <b>125</b>, or be biased instead of the shoe <b>125</b> with a biasing mechanism, such as a spring, an electro-magnet, a linear motor, or a hydraulic piston, and other mechanisms that can apply a force or a torque on the axis <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The central rotor <b>120</b> includes multiple pumping rollers installed around its outer circumference. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, individual pumping rollers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>104</b> are shown, but fewer or more rollers may be present, as described in other embodiments of the present disclosure. In an embodiment, the rollers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>104</b> are spaced at equal angular spacing around the circumference of the rotor <b>120</b>. Each of the rollers is mounted on its own axis which allows the roller to rotate. In an embodiment, each of the multiple axes of the rollers is positioned on the outer circumference of the rotor <b>120</b>. In other embodiments, the central axes are positioned closer to the central point <b>121</b> such that they are not positioned on the outer circumference. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates the entire circumference of each roller to aid in the understanding, but it will be understood that normally the entire circumference of the individual or rollers would not be visible as it would be covered by a portion of the rotor <b>120</b>. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> can be thought of as a schematic representation, or a partial cut-away that shows the rollers without obstructions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The rotor <b>120</b> rotates in the clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, as indicated by the dashed arrow to cause the peristaltic pump to pump fluid through a pumping tube segment. A length of compliant hollow tube is positioned in the space between the rotor <b>120</b> and the shoe <b>125</b>. This part of a hollow tube is referred to as a pumping tube <b>130</b> or a pumping tube segment <b>130</b>. When the pumping tube segment <b>130</b> is so positioned, when the central rotor <b>120</b> rotates, the individual pumping rollers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>104</b> are pressed against the pumping tube segment <b>130</b> at pinch point <b>135</b> as shown in the figure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, there are two pinch points <b>135</b> created by rollers <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> when the rotor <b>120</b> is at the particular angular position shown. At each pinch point, the walls of the pumping tube collapse such that all fluid is pressed out of the tube at that location. The pinch point migrates along the curved surface <b>145</b> of the shoe <b>125</b> and thereby urges fluid ahead of the pinch point to move in the rotation direction of the rotor <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The capital letter A represents the angular spacing of rotors along the central rotor <b>120</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the angular spacing is 90 degrees because the four rollers illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> are spaced equally around the outer circumference of central rotor <b>120</b>. As noted above, there can be more or fewer than four rollers. In embodiments, the angular spacing is 120 degrees.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The pumping tube segment <b>130</b> may be filled with a fluid which can conduct electricity along the length of the pumping tube segment. In an embodiment, the pumping tube segment is fluidly connected to or a part of a drain line of a peristaltic dialysis system. In this situation, dialysate will at times flow through the pumping tube segment <b>130</b>. In embodiments, the pumping tube segment is fluidly connected inline with a drain line in a peritoneal dialysis system, conveying waste dialysate from a patient (peritoneal cavity) to a drain. The drain may be at ground potential. This creates a risk of leakage current flowing through the dialysate and the pumping tube segment <b>130</b> to ground.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Continuous occlusion of the pumping tube segment <b>130</b> prevents electrical current from flowing through the pumping tube segment <b>130</b>. To reduce the chance of leakage current flowing through the drain line, a pinch point <b>135</b> is maintained at all times to maintain an area that is devoid of the conductive fluid in the pumping tube segment <b>130</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the central rotor <b>120</b> has rotated by approximately 45&#xb0;, and it can be seen that in this situation, pumping roller <b>102</b> remains pressed against pumping tube segment <b>130</b> at the pinch point <b>135</b>, while pumping roller <b>103</b> is no longer in contact with the pumping tube segment <b>130</b>. In this situation, only a single pinch point <b>135</b> is created for at least a portion of the peristaltic pumping cycle. To ensure that no conductive fluid is present at the pinch point <b>135</b> the spacing between the central rotor <b>120</b> and the shoe <b>125</b> can be adjusted such that a sufficient force is applied by the rollers against the pumping tube segment <b>130</b> whenever a roller is in contact with the pumping tube segment. Further, the pumping tube segment size and material durometer, roller diameter and width, length and curvature of surface <b>145</b> are selected to ensure that complete occlusion occurs at the pinch point <b>135</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some circumstances, due to deterioration of the material of the pumping tube segment <b>130</b>, the wear of the rollers, and/or wear of the shoe, it may be desirable to ensure that at least two pinch points <b>135</b> are created at all times. This is because there is a possibility that the single pinch point may be insufficient to completely force all conductive fluid from the pinch point, thus leaving open the possibility that some electrical current may pass through the pumping tube segment <b>130</b>. Ensuring that two pinch points are always present reduces the likelihood of leakage current flowing through the pumping tube segment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, peristaltic pump <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, is shown. The angular spacing of the rollers is the same as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. In addition, the length of the curve the surface <b>145</b> of the shoe <b>125</b> is represented by capital letter L. The length L is the length measured around the curvature of the surface. Further, as shown by the Greek letter &#x3b1;, the curved surface of shoe <b>125</b> has an angular extent. There is a correlation between the angular extent &#x3b1; and the length L as will be understood. When the curvature of the curved surface is a part of a circle, the length L can be determined as a part of a circumference of that circle. Even when the curved surface does not have a curvature of a circle, but instead of an ellipse or some other ellipsoid, the angular extent &#x3b1; is related to the angular distribution of the rollers along the rotor <b>120</b>. In embodiments, the angular extent &#x3b1; is sufficiently large to guarantee that two rollers are always positioned radially against the curved surface such that two pinch points <b>135</b> are provided when a pumping tube segment is inserted into the space between the rotor <b>120</b> and the shoe <b>125</b>. In embodiments, when the angular spacing of the rollers is A degrees (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), the angular extent a is greater than or equal to 2&#xd7;A degrees, which guarantees that two pinch points <b>135</b> will always be present when the rotor <b>120</b> rotates through 360 degrees. Thus, providing more rollers (and thus decreasing A) can be used to ensure two pinch points <b>135</b> when the angular extent &#x3b1; needs to be small (due to other design constraints). Conversely, the angular extent &#x3b1; of the shoe curved surface can be selected to ensure at least two pinch points <b>135</b> when the number of rollers is constrained.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In embodiments, a peristaltic pump <b>100</b> reduces or eliminates electrical current flow in the pumping tube segment <b>130</b> by coupling a rotor with rollers that are separated from adjacent rollers by A degrees with a pump shoe that has an angular extent &#x3b1; greater than or equal to 2&#xd7;A degrees.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, an embodiment of a peristaltic pump <b>200</b> which ensures that at least two pinch points (but possibly more) are created at all times is shown. for increased clarity, the pumping tube segment <b>130</b> is omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, but it will be understood that the pumping tube segment <b>130</b> would be installed much as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Peristaltic pump <b>200</b> includes a central rotor <b>220</b> which has multiple rollers disposed around its outer circumference. The multiple rollers are grouped into roller groups. In an embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, four roller groups are present. Each of the four roller groups has two rollers. Rollers <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> are members of a first roller group; rollers <b>203</b> and <b>204</b> are members of a second roller group; rollers <b>205</b> and <b>206</b> are members of a third roller group; and rollers <b>207</b> and <b>208</b> are members of a fourth roller group.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although four roller groups are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, it will be understood that there may be more or fewer roller groups present, and that each roller group may have more than two rollers in it. The specific number of roller groups and rollers within each group is dictated by the size of the rotor <b>220</b> and the length of the surface <b>145</b> of the shoe <b>125</b>. In embodiments, the number of roller groups, number of rollers per roller group, and the length of the surface <b>145</b> are selected such that at all times there are two or more pinch points <b>135</b> along the pumping tube segment <b>130</b>. When referring to the length of the surface <b>145</b> of the pumping shoe <b>25</b>, it is the length L along the curved surface <b>145</b> which mates with the pumping tube segment that is referenced.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the spacing of all rollers along the circumference of the rotor <b>220</b> is not uniform, but instead rollers in a roller group are closer to other rollers in that group. For example, in an embodiment there are four roller groups, each roller group separated from the adjacent roller group by 90 degrees (similar to the arrangement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). More specifically, the middle of each roller group is 90 degrees from the middle of an adjacent roller group, even if individual rollers in one group may be less than 90 degrees spaced from rollers in another roller group.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In embodiments, there are four roller groups on rotor <b>220</b> and each roller group includes two rollers which are closer to each other then they are to rollers in other roller groups. In such embodiments, at least 2 rollers included in one or more of the roller groups pinch respective portions of the pumping tube segment <b>130</b> against the curved surface through a full rotation of the rotor <b>220</b>. In other embodiments, there are four roller groups and each roller group includes three rollers. In further embodiments, there are three roller groups and each roller group includes two rollers, three rollers, or four rollers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When more than two pinch points <b>135</b> are present at all times, it is possible to ensure that no electrical current can flow through the pumping tube segment <b>130</b>, even if a conductive fluid is being pumped through the pumping tube segment <b>130</b>. In an embodiment, there are three rollers in each roller group, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a peristaltic pump <b>290</b> is shown. The pump <b>290</b> includes a rotor <b>320</b> which has on it multiple roller groups. Roller group <b>321</b> is indicated in the figure, and includes separate rollers <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, and <b>303</b>. The pump illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> includes four roller groups, but fewer or more roller groups can be present. In an embodiment, the rotor <b>320</b> includes four roller groups, and each roller group includes three rollers. More specifically, rollers <b>304</b>, <b>305</b>, and <b>306</b> are members of a roller group; rollers <b>307</b>, <b>308</b>, and <b>309</b> are members of another roller group; and rollers <b>310</b>, <b>311</b>, and <b>312</b> are members of yet another roller group. Advantageously, this arrangement guarantees that there will always be at least 3 points of a contact (pinch points <b>135</b>) on the pumping tube segment <b>130</b> (which is not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> for clarity). For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, at least 3 rollers included in one or more of the roller groups pinch respective portions of the pumping tube segment <b>130</b> against the curved surface through a full rotation of the rotor <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates peristaltic pump <b>300</b> which includes a rotor <b>120</b> with rollers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>104</b>. The peristaltic pump <b>300</b> in this embodiment includes a modified shoe <b>325</b>, as shown. The modified shoe <b>325</b> has a curved surface <b>345</b> which faces toward the rotor <b>120</b>. The modified shoe <b>325</b> may be biased by spring <b>116</b> along biasing a rod <b>114</b>, or other urging mechanism, similarly, to pump <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The curved surface <b>345</b> of modified shoe <b>325</b> includes a protrusion <b>335</b>. The protrusion <b>335</b> is a discontinuity in the curvature of the curved surface <b>345</b> and has the effect of creating a pressure spike when any of the rollers rolls over the protrusion. By providing a protrusion such as <b>335</b> along the curved surface <b>345</b>, the occlusion of the tube <b>130</b> (not illustrated to increase clarity) is increased. By providing a pressure spike at a particular location, the likelihood that any conductive fluid remains in the occluded portion of tube <b>130</b> is reduced, thus reducing the possibility of a leakage current flowing through pumping tube segment <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, pumping shoe <b>326</b> may include more than one protrusion <b>335</b>. In an embodiment, two protrusions <b>335</b> are present along the curved surface <b>346</b>.

In embodiments, the rotor includes three rollers, four rollers, five rollers, six rollers, seven rollers, or eight rollers. It will be understood that the pump shoe <b>325</b> and <b>326</b>, with one or more protrusions <b>335</b> can be used with any of the rotors described in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates an embodiment of pump shoe <b>427</b> with a plunger <b>420</b> protruding through an opening <b>450</b> in the curved surface <b>447</b>. The plunger <b>420</b> can be a curved plunger, as illustrated, mounted on a movable platform such as a rod biased with a spring <b>416</b>. In embodiments, the spring can be omitted or substituted with a hydraulically actuated plunger which can move the leading tip, or edge, of plunger <b>420</b> in and out of the surface <b>447</b>. The view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> can be thought of as a cross sectional view as the top of plunger <b>420</b> protrudes through an opening <b>450</b> in the surface <b>447</b>. The tip may have a conical cross-section as shown. It is envisioned that pump shoe <b>427</b>, and all other pump shoes disclosed herein, may be used with any of the pump rotors described in the present disclosure. For example, pump rotor <b>120</b> may be used with pump shoe <b>427</b>. In an embodiment, the conical tip of plunger <b>420</b> protrudes from the middle of the curved surface <b>447</b> of pump shoe <b>427</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In other embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the plunger <b>420</b> is positioned at a location that is not in the middle of the curved surface <b>448</b> of shoe <b>428</b>, but instead closer to one end of the surface. The opening <b>450</b> is not expressly illustrated, but it is understood that the plunger extends out of an opening, much like in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. This arrangement may increase pumping efficiency (volume per number of rotor rotations).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In yet other embodiments, multiple plungers <b>420</b> may be used, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. Two plungers <b>420</b> are positioned toward two ends of the curved surface <b>449</b> of pump shoe <b>429</b>. It will be understood that the plungers <b>420</b> generate an increased pressure at a pinch point formed between a roller and the plunger, thereby reducing the possibility of a conductive fluid being retained at the pinch point inside of pumping tube segment <b>130</b>. Thus, an electrical current cannot flow through the pumping tube segment <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a peristaltic pump <b>500</b> includes a central rotor <b>520</b>, which is not necessarily circular in shape. In embodiments, the central rotor may have a substantial triangular shape, or a star shape. The central rotor shape illustrated and described here can be used with any of the other peristaltic pumps described in this disclosure, and the term rotor does not necessarily require a circular shape. The rotor <b>520</b> has three rollers <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, and <b>503</b>. The rotor <b>520</b> is positioned against pump shoe <b>525</b> which has a curved surface <b>545</b> that has a length indicated by the dashed line at <b>546</b>. The length of the curved surface <b>545</b> of the shoe <b>525</b> is greater than the length of the other curved surfaces shown in the other figures. Thus, the goal of ensuring that two rollers are always in contact with a pumping tube segment <b>130</b> (which is not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> for increased clarity) can be maintained with fewer than four rollers on a rotor, by extending the length of the curved surface of the pump shoe.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In embodiments, a peristaltic pump includes a rotor with three rollers mounted on the outer circumference of the rotor, and a pump shoe which has a curved surface which presses against the rollers and has a length that is sufficient to ensure that at least two of the rollers are always in contact with the curved surface during operation of the pump.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a process for reducing or blocking electrical leakage current in a pumping tube segment <b>130</b> using a peristaltic pump according to any of the disclosed embodiments. In addition, or instead of, the structural features described above that reduce or eliminate the leakage current in the pumping tube segment, it is possible to operate a peristaltic pump according to the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to further reduce or eliminate leakage current. At S<b>610</b> the pump rotor rotates forward (in the normal direction) to cause fluid to be pumped through the pumping tube segment. While the pump is operating, an electrical current sensor (not illustrated) is provided to detect electrical current flowing through the pumping tube segment <b>130</b>. If the electrical current sensor detects a current above a predetermined threshold (such as 50 &#x3bc;A) at S<b>620</b>, the process continues at S<b>630</b>. On the other hand, if no electrical current is detected, the pump rotor operates normally.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At S<b>630</b>, the peristaltic pump is controlled to block the flow of current. According to embodiments, the peristaltic pump rotor continues rotating forward until two rollers are in contact with the pumping tube segment and pressing against the pumping shoe, thus ensuring that are two pinch points exist.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In other embodiments, when electrical current is detected, the pump rotor is reversed and rotates in the opposite direction, until rollers come to rest at a position that creates two pinch points.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In other embodiments, the peristaltic pump rotor is stopped and the pressure between the roller that is in contact with the pumping tube segment and the pump shoe is increased. In embodiments, the rotor may rotate forward or backwards until one roller stops at a position that maximizes the pressure on the pumping tube segment. For example, this position may be substantially horizontal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> such that roller <b>502</b> would be pressing into the middle of surface <b>545</b>. In this situation, if pump shoe <b>525</b> is mounted on a pressure biasing mechanism similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the pressure from that mechanism acts directly against the roller <b>502</b>, thus maximizing the pressure on the pumping tube segment at that location, thereby minimizing the possibility of a conductive fluid being present at that location of the pumping tube segment.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In embodiments, this increase in pressure can be achieved by increasing the spring tension of a biasing spring such as spring <b>116</b> described above. In other embodiments, the pressure can be increased with a pressure mechanism such as those described above, which presses the rotor and/or the pump shoe against each other with a pressure that is greater than the normal operating pressure. Thus, the pinch point that is maintained at this state is under a greater pressure than a normal operating pressure, thus reducing the possibility of fluid being present in the pumping tube segment at the pinch point.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In further embodiments, S<b>630</b> includes stopping the rotation of the rotor which is initially rotating in the forward, rotating the rotor in the reverse direction for several degrees of rotation (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 degrees), and then again rotating in the forward direction. This action forces out fluid that may be at the pinch point through a squeegee action, without the need for increasing the pressure at the pinch point. Of course, this operation can be combined with the other disclosed embodiments. For example, the forward and backward rocking of the rotor can take place with a roller on one of the protrusions <b>335</b> of the pump shoe, to further enhance the squeegee effect and force out fluid from the pumping tube segment <b>130</b> at a pinch point.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A medical system, such as one used for renal replacement therapy, may include a dialysis system (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and others).
