For example, the control board <b>120</b> may obtain state information of the display device <b>100</b> based on various types of detected signal received from the display device <b>100</b>, and control the display device <b>100</b> to take an action corresponding to the state information.

The output signal DPC is continuously variable. The load state is energy consumed in the display panel <b>118</b> and may be determined by driving current used to display an image on the display panel <b>118</b>.

This is because the weight a corresponding to the second output signal is added to the first pulse frequency.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Therefore, as the load of the display panel <b>118</b> decreases, the second output signal DPC further increases.

The DC voltage EVDD<b>2</b> may gradually increase in inverse proportion to the second pulse frequency.
