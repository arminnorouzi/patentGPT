Such a bend sensor can detect movement of an object by a change in the electric resistance that occurs when the sensor undergoes elastic deformation as it follows the movement of the object. Such a bend sensor requires a power source for detection of the electric resistance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, bend sensors that do not require a power source are known. Examples of such sensors include a bend sensor having a sensor section in which a polymer electrolyte film is sandwiched between a pair of electrode films containing a polymer electrolyte and a conducting particle (see Patent Document 2). Such a bend sensor can detect movement of an object by voltage generated between the electrode films when the sensor section undergoes elastic deformation as it follows the movement of the object. Thus, since the sensor enables miniaturization, simplification, energy saving, and the like of devices, application of the sensor to a wide range of uses can be expected. However, from the viewpoint of, for example, increasing reliability of measured values, a further increase in the voltage generated has been demanded.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1: JP 2008-070327 A</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 2: JP 2012-069416 A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide a bend sensor having a sensor section composed of a polymer electrolyte film sandwiched between a pair of electrode films containing a polymer electrolyte and a conducting particle, wherein a high voltage is generated between the electrode films when the sensor section undergoes elastic deformation as it follows movement of an object.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to solve the object described above, the present invention provides the following:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0000">[1] a bend sensor comprising a sensor section in which a polymer electrolyte film is sandwiched between a pair of electrode films each containing:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">a block copolymer (Z) having:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">a polymer block (S) composed of a structural unit derived from an aromatic vinyl compound, and containing an ion-conducting group;

The &#x201c;lamellar structure&#x201d; herein means a phase separation structure in which a plurality of phases are laminated on each other to form layers. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in the bend sensor of the present invention, a phase(s) formed by the polymer block (S) and a phase(s) formed by the polymer block (T) are laminated on each other to form layers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The phase composed of the polymer block (S) plays a role as a migration path of ions, and the phase composed of the polymer block (T) plays a role in giving elasticity and flexibility to the sensor section. It is assumed that, by the formation of the lamellar structure, efficient migration of ions between the electrode films is possible when the sensor section of the bend sensor of the present invention undergoes elastic deformation, so that a high voltage can be generated. The lamellar structure may be formed in the entire electrode film, or may be partially formed therein. From the viewpoint of easy migration of ions between the electrode films, the phases composed of the polymer block (S) in the lamellar structures preferably communicate between the main surfaces of the electrode films. The above assumption can be commonly employed irrespective of the type of the monomers constituting the block copolymer (Z).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The lamellar structure in the electrode film contained in the bend sensor of the present invention can be observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Since the electrode film contains a conducting particle, preparation of a sample (ultrathin section) for the TEM observation may be difficult in some cases. In such cases, since the presence or absence of the conducting particle usually does not affect the phase separation structure of the block copolymer (Z), an evaluation polymer electrolyte film may be prepared in the same manner as the electrode film except that the conducting particle is not included, and an ultrathin section for the TEM observation may be prepared therefrom, followed by observation of the presence or absence of the lamellar structure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The width of the phase composed of the polymer block (S) in the lamellar structure is preferably within the range of 3 to 90 nm, more preferably within the range of 5 to 70 nm, still more preferably within the range of 7 to 40 nm. The &#x201c;width of the phase&#x201d; herein means the distance between the two phases adjacent to a specific phase forming the lamellar structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Normally, the width L<b>1</b> of each phase composed of the polymer block (5) is the same, and the width L<b>2</b> of each phase composed of the polymer block (T) is the same. The sum of the width L<b>1</b> of the phase composed of the polymer block (S) and the width L<b>2</b> of the phase composed of the polymer block (T) is referred to as the cycle of the lamellar structure. The width of each phase can be measured by the above TEM observation for observing the presence or absence of the lamellar structure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In cases where the width of the phase composed of the polymer block (S) is not less than 3 nm, the migration velocity of ions can be increased, and the response speed of the bend sensor can therefore be increased. On the other hand, in cases where the width of the phase composed of the polymer block (S) is not more than 90 nm, continuity of the lamellar structure can be increased, and the phases composed of the polymer block (S) can easily communicate between the main surfaces of the electrode films, so that the voltage generated between the electrode films of the bend sensor can be increased.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The block copolymer (Z) contained in the electrode films included in the bend sensor of the present invention is preferably obtained by producing a block copolymer (Z<sub>0</sub>) having: a polymer block (S<sub>0</sub>) composed of a structural unit derived from an aromatic vinyl compound, and containing no ion-conducting group (hereinafter simply referred to as &#x201c;polymer block (S<sub>0</sub>)&#x201d;); and a polymer block (T); and then introducing an ion-conducting group(s) to the polymer block (S<sub>0</sub>).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The number average molecular weight (Mn) of the block copolymer (Z<sub>0</sub>) is preferably within the range of 5000 to 200,000, more preferably within the range of 20,000 to 150,000, still more preferably within the range of 30,000 to 130,000.
