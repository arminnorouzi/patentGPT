INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/949,484 filed Oct. 30, 2020, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to bottle closures, more specifically, caps (e.g., threaded caps) for sealing bottle openings and containing fluids dispensed from the bottles.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Threaded caps are used in various industries as bottle closures. Threaded caps typically include a cylindrical-shaped wall and a thread disposed along the interior surface of the wall so that the cap may be securely received on a bottle neck via the application of torque. To ensure that threaded caps seal bottle openings reliably, the caps are designed to withstand impact forces that may dislodge and break the cap. One approach for strengthening the integrity of caps is limiting the caps' transverse dimension or a portion of the cap that rests above the end of the bottle neck (i.e., rest height).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Along with sealing the fluid held in the bottle, threaded caps may serve other purposes, such as receiving and holding a dosage of fluid dispensed from the bottle. Increasing the dosage capacity of the cap above the end of the bottle neck, however, may constrain the cap's impact tolerance, thereby compromising the cap's leak performance. Thus, threaded caps having larger dosage capacities have a tendency to break at the base of the upper area above the end of the bottle neck, even when exposed to minimal impact forces.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some conventional threaded caps may also be used to enclose a dispenser received within a bottle neck. While having a dispenser disposed within a bottle neck may aid a user pouring liquid out of the bottle, the dispenser may disrupt proper placement of the seal between the bottle neck and the cap, thereby increasing the risk of leaking or unwanted rotational movement of the dispenser.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure includes embodiments of caps and bottles having a container, a cap, and a spout.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the bottle includes a container having a neck having a rim defining an opening into the container and a cap removably coupled to the neck. In some embodiments, the cap includes an upper cap portion having a top and a first sidewall extending around a perimeter of the top from the top to a lower end, a lower cap portion including a second sidewall coupled to the first sidewall and having a distal end. In some embodiments, the upper cap portion and the lower cap portion define a chamber extending along a longitudinal axis of the cap, and a skirt extending in a radial direction with respect to the longitudinal axis of the cap and configured to be received on the rim of the neck of the container.

References to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;some embodiments,&#x201d; etc., indicate that the embodiment(s) described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to affect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; as used herein refer to a considerable degree or extent. When used in conjunction with, for example, an event, circumstance, characteristic, or property, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; can indicate a value of a given quantity that varies within, for example, 1-15% of the value (e.g., &#xb1;1%, &#xb1;2%, &#xb1;5%, &#xb1;10%, or &#xb1;15% of the value), such as accounting for typical tolerance levels or variability of the embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The following examples are illustrative, but not limiting, of the present embodiments. Other suitable modifications and adaptations of the variety of conditions and parameters normally encountered in the field, and which would be apparent to those skilled in the art, are within the spirit and scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">While threaded caps have been used in various industries, such as dispensing bottles, threaded caps tend to have limited dimensions and rest height above the bottle opening so that the cap may withstand strong impact forces (e.g., falling from a height). However, limiting the cap's dimensions and rest height curtails the dosage capacity of the cap. Thus, there is a need for a cap that may withstand strong impact forces, reliably seal the bottle opening, and also collect a greater dosage of fluid dispensed from the bottle by extending above the end of the bottle neck.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The upper portion extending above the end of the bottle neck may be cylindrical in order to maximize dosage capacity for a given rest height, however a cylindrical shape does not deflect or absorb impact forces as well as an arched shape. Therefore, a tapered top portion with a curved side wall would be the best configuration to withstand impact forces. This however creates a configuration in which the dimension of the top of the upper portion of the cap may be small enough to fit inside of the distal opening end of the lower portion of another of the same cap.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In addition, multiple threaded caps may be tumble packed or stacked together during transit prior to assembly with a bottle. When stacked together, the lower sidewalls of a top cap may form a vacuum seal with the top outer sidewalls of a bottom cap, such that the top cap is nested on the bottom cap. Consequently, a handler must apply a significant amount of force to separate the nested caps, thereby rendering the assembly of the caps cumbersome. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved cap that may be easily separated from other stacked caps during assembly.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Conventional dispensing bottles usually include a dispenser member received within the neck of the bottle to concentrate and direct liquid being poured out of the neck of the bottle. Seals, such as gaskets, may be used to isolate the bottle reservoir from the interface between the cap and the combination of the dispenser and the bottle neck. However, conventional seals are typically installed separately from the spout. Separately installing the seal gasket from the spout hinders proper placement of the seal along the interface between the cap and the combination of the bottle neck and the dispenser, which can pose higher risk of leaks and unwanted rotation of the dispenser within the bottle neck.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to embodiments described herein, the caps and bottles of the present disclosure may overcome one or more of the deficiencies noted above by having an upper cap portion configured to enclose an opening of a bottle neck and hold a dosage of fluid, a lower cap portion configured to extend into the bottle neck and increase the dosage capacity and pour cleanliness and convenience of the cap, and a skirt configured to engage the exterior surface of the bottle neck to secure the cap to the bottle. The upper cap portion may include a first sidewall with one or more sections that protrude radially away from other portions of first sidewall, so that the dosage capacity of cap may be increased and that stacked caps may be easily separated during shipping and assembly. The skirt may include a flange having a bottom surface that is inclined in a direction toward a neck of the bottle to deflect the seal ring in a radial direction, as the cap is secured to the neck of the bottle, thereby providing a proper seal between the neck of the bottle and the interior surface of the skirt.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">According to embodiments described herein, the spouts of the present disclosure may overcome one or more of the deficiencies noted above by including a central duct, an outer sidewall extending around the central duct, and a seal ring disposed on a flange of the outer sidewall.

In some embodiments, seal ring <b>650</b> may be formed from a second material (e.g., a soft conformable material) having a durometer in a range between about 10 shore and about 70 shore such that seal ring <b>650</b> can absorb and dissipate shock resulting from impact forces applied against cap <b>700</b>, thereby improving impact performance and the integrity of bottle assembly <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, seal ring <b>650</b> may include a durometer in a range between about 15 shore and 25 shore, such as, for example, 20 shore. In some embodiments, seal ring <b>650</b> can be elastically strained, thinned, or deformed by application of a compressive force to extrude into a void space disposed between the interior surface of skirt <b>730</b> and rim <b>511</b> of neck <b>510</b> when cap <b>700</b> and spout <b>600</b> are secured to bottle <b>500</b>, thereby providing a liquid-tight seal. In some embodiments, the second material may include, for example, TPE, a silicon, a rubber-based material, wax, an adhesive, or blends thereof.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In some embodiments, the second material forming seal ring <b>650</b> may include a static coefficient of friction slide angle in a range between about 50 degrees and about 70 degrees such as, for example, about 55 degrees and about 65 degrees (based on standards from American Society for Testing and Materials), to provide a balance between torque application and retention of spout <b>600</b>. For example, if coefficient of friction is too high, seal ring <b>650</b> may oppose too much torque as a user is attempting to twist cap <b>700</b> off neck <b>510</b>, rendering it difficult to remove cap <b>700</b>. If coefficient of friction is too low, seal ring <b>650</b> may slip as a user is attempting to twist cap <b>700</b> off neck <b>510</b>, thereby resulting in unwanted rotation of spout <b>600</b> such that central duct <b>630</b> is not oriented properly with a pouring motion. Accordingly, by having a static coefficient of friction slide angle in a range between about 50 degrees and about 70 degrees seal ring <b>650</b> allows cap <b>700</b> to be twisted off without substantial force while also providing proper orientation of spout <b>600</b>. In some embodiments, a predetermined coefficient of friction for seal ring <b>650</b> may be achieved through a selection of materials, such as slip agents, resins, and wax, to be blended together.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In some embodiments, seal ring <b>650</b> may be integrally attached to upper end <b>612</b> of outer sidewall <b>610</b> by a molding process such that seal ring <b>650</b> and spout <b>600</b> form a single element such that spout <b>600</b> and seal ring <b>650</b> may be placed together simultaneously within neck <b>510</b>, rather than placing spout <b>600</b> and seal ring <b>650</b> separately within neck <b>510</b> of bottle <b>500</b>. For example, in some embodiments, outer sidewall <b>610</b>, bottom wall <b>620</b>, central duct <b>630</b>, and seal ring <b>650</b> may be injected molded as a single integral element. In some embodiments, the injection molding process for spout <b>600</b> and seal ring <b>650</b> may include a two-shot injection procedure that includes injecting a first shot of the first material for spout <b>600</b> and a second shot of the second material for seal ring <b>650</b> into a mold that shapes spout <b>600</b> and seal ring <b>650</b> accordingly. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>, <b>27</b>, and <b>30</b></figref>, for example, the injection molding process allows interior surface <b>651</b> of seal ring <b>650</b> to be flush with interior surface <b>615</b> of outer sidewall <b>610</b> and a bottom surface <b>652</b> of seal ring <b>650</b> to be flush with upper end <b>612</b> of outer sidewall <b>610</b>, such that seal ring <b>650</b> extends continuously from flange <b>614</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In some embodiments, seal ring <b>650</b> may be secured to upper end <b>612</b> of outer sidewall <b>610</b> by other processes.
