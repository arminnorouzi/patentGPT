INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an endoscope including a packaged electronic component in a distal end portion of an insertion portion, a distal end barrel member of the endoscope, and an insertion portion of the endoscope.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, in order to observe a site that is difficult to directly observe visually such as an inside part or the like of a living body or a structure, an endoscope has been widely used in a medical field or an industrial field. The endoscope is formed to be capable of being introduced toward an inside from an outside of the living body or the structure, and includes a configuration that can form an optical image or pick up the optical image.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the endoscope as above, a distal end portion provided at a distal end of an insertion portion is mainly configured by a distal end unit in which various functional components are provided in a rigid distal end barrel. As the distal end barrel of the distal end unit like this, there has been proposed a distal end barrel using a technology of a molded interconnect device (MID) in recent years. For example, International Publication No. WO2015/082328 discloses an endoscope head as a distal end unit of an endoscope including a head body that is a distal end barrel including a MID device in which a plurality of conductive paths are formed, and various electronic components such as a camera module as an image pickup unit that is an imager unit supplied with electric power by the conductive paths.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Here, in the MID technology, it is possible to form a metal pattern only on a resin surface that can be irradiated with laser light or the like. A technology disclosed in International Publication No. WO2015/082328, which is a conventional art, adopts a configuration in which an opening portion is provided at one side of a camera accommodation space, and a conductive path as a wiring pattern that electrically connects to a camera module is formed on an outer peripheral surface of a distal end barrel continuing to the opening portion.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An endoscope in one aspect of the present invention includes: an insertion portion configured to

As a result, an outside diameter of a distal end portion <b>6</b> of an insertion portion <b>2</b> of an endoscope <b>1</b> can also be decreased, and the insertion portion <b>2</b> can be reduced in diameter.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">In each of the embodiments and modifications described above, it is a most efficient production method to subject a surface pattern of the distal end barrel member <b>21</b> of an MID structure and terminals of the camera module <b>30</b> to a reflow soldering process with the surface pattern of the distal end barrel member <b>21</b> facing up and a terminal side of the camera module <b>30</b> facing down when the surface pattern of the distal end barrel member <b>21</b> of the MID structure and the terminals of the camera module <b>30</b> are connected by soldering.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">However, in the case of a front-viewing endoscope <b>1</b>, the terminal side of the camera module <b>30</b> is on a proximal end direction side of the endoscope <b>1</b>, so that a placement surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>on which the camera module <b>30</b> can be placed during reflow soldering, and the surface pattern can be formed at a position capable of connecting to the terminals of the camera module <b>30</b> is formed on the proximal end side of the module accommodation chamber <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">When the placement surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>is located on a back surface of the camera module <b>30</b> as above, the distal end barrel member <b>21</b> is configured to be able to prevent the outside diameter of the distal end portion <b>6</b> of the insertion portion <b>2</b> of the endoscope <b>1</b> from increasing depending on a connection method of cables for connecting the camera module <b>30</b> and various circuits at a hand side and wiring patterns, because wiring patterns can be mainly formed on only a surface of a molded body due to the MID method.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">More specifically, it is possible to increase production efficiency of the distal end barrel member <b>21</b> of the MID structure by applying reflow soldering by placing the back surface of the camera module <b>30</b> on the placement surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the module accommodation chamber <b>26</b> with the back surface of the camera module <b>30</b> on a lower side, with a distal end side facing up and a proximal end side facing down, and it becomes easy to widen a connection region and it is possible to make the region wide, by providing a connection region of the cables at a position closer to the center axis X that is an axis than an outside diameter of the distal end barrel member <b>21</b>.

The camera module <b>30</b> is loaded on the distal end portion <b>6</b> of the insertion portion <b>2</b> of the endoscope <b>1</b>, receives electric power and sends and receives signals to drive, and is electrically connected to an extremal processor to display generated image pickup signals on a monitor.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">The above connection generally has a structure via a cable, but since a size and width of the terminals of the camera module <b>30</b> are extremely small with miniaturization of the camera module <b>30</b>, direct connection to the cable becomes difficult. For this reason, if a cable is connected according to the size of the terminal portion of the compact camera module <b>30</b>, the manufacturing cost increases.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">Accordingly, it is possible to increase production efficiency of the distal end barrel member <b>21</b> by adopting the MID structure, and applying reflow soldering by placing the camera on the placement surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the module accommodation chamber <b>26</b> with a back surface (undersurface) of the camera on a lower side, with the distal end side facing up and the proximal end side facing down, and connection to the cables becomes easy with the cable connection region secured widely.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">Thereby, in the endoscope <b>1</b>, increase in size of the outside diameter of the distal end portion <b>6</b> of the insertion portion <b>2</b> can be prevented, and the manufacturing cost can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">In the MID structure, a wiring pattern can be mainly formed on only a surface of a molded body due to a manufacturing method of the MID structure, and therefore it is necessary to form conductive paths on an outer surface of the distal end barrel member <b>21</b> when wiring patterns are drawn to a connection position of the camera module <b>30</b> and cables.
