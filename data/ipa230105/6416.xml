The light-emitting devices each comprise a first resonator mirror, a second resonator mirror, and also an active zone arranged between the first and second resonator mirrors and suitable for emitting electromagnetic radiation, and also a second contact element. The second contact elements and a first contact element, which is electrically connected to a first semiconductor layer of a first conductivity type of the light-emitting devices, are contactable from a first main surface of the light-emitting devices. At least two of the second contact elements are each individually controllable. That is to say that the second contact elements can each be individually controllable. In accordance with further embodiments, the contact elements can also be controllable in groups. In this case, the groups can each contain an identical or else a different number of light-emitting devices.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with embodiments, the optoelectronic semiconductor component furthermore has an arrangement of circuits, each suitable for controlling the second contact elements of the light-emitting devices.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">By way of example, the arrangement of circuits is arranged in a circuit substrate. The circuit substrate can be arranged in a manner adjoining the first main surface.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">By way of example, the first conductivity type can be the p conductivity type.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with embodiments, the optoelectronic semiconductor component furthermore has a multiplicity of optical elements arranged on a side of the light-emitting devices facing away from the first main surface. In this case, at least two of the optical elements are each formed differently, such that emitted radiation is emitted in different spatial directions in each case.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with embodiments, the optical elements are arranged at a distance from a second main surface of the light-emitting devices. This can be effected by means of suitable spacers. The interspace between the optical elements and the second main surface can contain for example air or a transparent material, for example a polymer or an oxide. In this way, the radiation emitted by the individual optoelectronic devices can be further shaped or deflected. In accordance with further embodiments, the optical elements can also directly adjoin the second main surface of the light-emitting devices.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with embodiments, optoelectronic devices, each adjoined by different optical elements, can each be individually controllable. In this way, for example, different spatial regions can be irradiated in a targeted manner.

On account of the specific construction of the optoelectronic semiconductor component as described above, the detector can have a simpler construction. By way of example, the detector can have a single light-sensitive area.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A method for producing an optoelectronic semiconductor component with a multiplicity of light-emitting devices comprises forming a first resonator mirror, a second resonator mirror, an active zone between the first and second resonator mirrors, and also forming second contact elements. The active zone is suitable for emitting electromagnetic radiation. The second contact elements and a first contact element, which is electrically connected to a first semiconductor layer of a first conductivity type of the light-emitting devices, are contactable from a first main surface of the light-emitting devices. At least two of the second contact elements are individually controllable. That is to say that the second contact elements can be controllable in each case individually or in groups.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">By way of example, it is possible to form firstly the first resonator mirror, then the active zone and finally the second resonator mirror.
