This process is governed by elaborate, dynamic spatiotemporal control of physiochemical cell signaling exerted by the cellular microenvironment. Prior art studies have revealed that both soluble or immobilized morphogens control cell signaling and developmental pathways, thereby determining cell fate and patterning (Perrimon et al. (2012) <i>Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol </i>4.). Spatial regulation of these developmental cues is an important aspect of pattern formation in tissues. Advances in imaging and computational analysis techniques have allowed researchers to investigate in vivo pattern formation induced by morphogens in animal models (Shimozono et. al. (2013) <i>Nature </i>496, 363-366; Zagorski et al. (2017) <i>Science </i>356, 1379-1383), but in vivo study of these developmental events in humans remains elusive. In addition, in vivo animal models lack systematic, precise control of morphogens, limiting their use in understanding how the nature of these morphogens regulates cell fate and pattern formation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The development of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has provided a powerful in vitro model not only for studying human development, but also for facilitating drug screening for therapeutics, modeling disease, and developing cell-based regenerative therapies. While temporal modulation of developmental pathways via molecular agonists and antagonists at specific differentiation stages has led to efficient methods to differentiate hPSCs to many different somatic cell types, spatial pattern formation from hPSCs has been more challenging mainly due to difficulties in spatially localizing morphogens in conventional cell culture platforms.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Self-organization of hPSCs or mouse PSCs under specific culture conditions, including different colony sizes, 3D culture, or specialized substrates, has been used to demonstrate early developmental events such as germ layer specification (Warmflash et al. (2014) <i>Nature Methods </i>11, 847-854; Poh et al. (2014) <i>Nature Comm. </i>5, 1-12), anteroposterior patterning (Moris et al. (2020) <i>Nature </i>582, 410-415), and ectodermal patterning (Zheng et al. (2019) Science advances 5; Britton et al. (2019) Development 146). However, this self-assembled patterning inherently lacks regulatory features with regard to spatial control of signaling cues. Alternatively, geometrically confining hPSC colonies into various shapes allowed investigation of effects of producing asymmetrically pre-patterned colonies on hPSC fate (Ma et al. (2015) <i>Nature Comm. </i>6, 1-10; Smith et al. (2018) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>115, 8167-8172). Such cell patterning methods also lack spatial regulation of signaling factors and interaction between patterned and surrounding cells which is critical for proper development in vivo.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Microfluidic devices offer a more complex model that can incorporate both spatial patterning and morphogen gradients. For example, a microfluidic device has been used to create an asymmetric germ layer pattern of hPSC colonies mimicking the presence of proximal morphogen-secreting cells (Manfrin et al. (2019) <i>Nature methods </i>16, 640). Establishment of human neural tube patterning was also demonstrated in a microfluidic device via a Wnt-activating gradient (Rifes et al. (2020) <i>Nature Biotech. </i>1-9). However, in addition to the use of specially designed apparatus, this strategy introduces substantial barriers to routine cell culture techniques necessitating specialized substrates, unique methods for media exchange, small medium volumes, and generation of hydrodynamic shear (Halldorsson et al. (2015) <i>Biosens. and Bioelec. </i>63, 218-231.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Substrate-mediated delivery of signaling factors, primarily through immobilization on a surface, is a conventional strategy to localize inductive factors that mimics natural protein sequestration and presentation in cellular microenvironment (Hettiaratchi et al. (2016) <i>J. of Mat. Chem. </i>4, 3464-3481). Many of these methods utilize functionalization of substrates to tether signaling molecules thereupon but typically surface functionalization is not spatially controlled and results in uniform substrate modification lacking regional specification (Alberti et al. (2008) <i>Nature methods </i>5, 645; Pompe et al. (2010) <i>Nature Protocols </i>5, 1042; Kilian et al. (2012) <i>Angewandte Chemie </i>124, 4975-4979; Ham et al. (2017) <i>Acta biomaterialia </i>53, 140-151). Additionally, most approaches to generate patterns require complex strategies, including functionalizing factors (Kim et al. (2012) <i>Angewandte Chemie </i>124, 5696-5699; Wang et al. (2014) <i>Advanced healthcare materials </i>3, 214-220) and/or the substrate (Li et al. (2011) <i>PNAS </i>108, 11745-11750; DeForest et al. (2015) <i>Nature materials </i>14, 523-531) to be immobilized, or special techniques such as bioprinting (Ker et al. (2011) <i>Biomaterials </i>32, 3413-3422).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A simpler, more versatile approach to pattern hPSC differentiation is needed in the art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Provided herein are in vitro methods for differentiating pluripotent stem cells, the methods comprising: patterning one or a plurality of signaling proteins on a portion of a suitable surface; coating the suitable surface comprising the one or a plurality of signaling proteins with a cell culture substrate; and plating a suspension of the pluripotent stem cells on the suitable surface coated with the cell culture substrate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain embodiments of the methods of the invention the cell culture substrate is Matrigel&#xae;, vitronectin, or laminin.

Unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include the plural and plural terms shall include the singular.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present disclosure relates to the inventors' straightforward and versatile method to pattern pluripotent stem cell (PSC) differentiation via localized adsorption of substrate-bound morphogens. As demonstrated in this disclosure human PSC (hPSC) differentiation can be spatially regulated by localized patterning of specific morphogens on a suitable substrate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, the skilled worker will understand that the term &#x201c;morphogen&#x201d; encompasses any molecule that directs cell fate. Signaling proteins can be morphogens but can also have effects broader than cell fate. The signaling proteins used in embodiments of the invention herein are also morphogens. The skilled worker in the art will understand that the term morphogen is broader than the term signaling protein, wherein the effects of morphogens include differentiation, proliferation, changes in metabolism, activation, and like biological activities. The skilled worker will appreciate when molecules described by either term are used in each such particular situation or embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In particular embodiments provided herein are in vitro methods for differentiating pluripotent stem cells, the methods comprising: patterning one or a plurality of signaling protein on a portion of a suitable surface; coating the suitable surface comprising the one or a plurality signaling proteins with a cell-culture substrate; and plating a solution of the pluripotent stem cells on the suitable surface coated with the cell-culture substrate.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, &#x201c;pluripotent stem cells&#x201d; are cells having the capacity to differentiate into cells of all three germ layers. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) suitable for the differentiation methods disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), non-human primate embryonic stem cells (nhpESCs), and non-human primate induced pluripotent stem cells (nhpiPSCs).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, the term &#x201c;embryonic stem cells&#x201d; or &#x201c;ESCs&#x201d; means a pluripotent cell or population of pluripotent cells derived from an inner cell mass of a blastocyst. See Thomson et al. (1998) <i>Science </i>282:1145-1147. These cells can be characterized as expressing Oct-4, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81, and appear as compact colonies having a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and prominent nucleolus. ESCs are commercially available from sources such as WiCell Research Institute (Madison, Wis.).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, the term &#x201c;induced pluripotent stem cells&#x201d; or &#x201c;iPS cells&#x201d; or &#x201c;iPSCs&#x201d; means a pluripotent cell or population of pluripotent cells that are produced in vitro from non-pluripotent cells such as differentiated somatic cells by inducing expression of certain potency-determining factors therein, that can vary with respect to their differentiated somatic cell of origin, that can vary with respect to a specific set of potency-determining factors, and that can vary with respect to culture conditions used to isolate them, but nonetheless are substantially genetically identical to their respective differentiated somatic cell of origin and display characteristics similar to higher potency cells, such as ESCs, as described herein. See, e.g., Yu et al. (2007) <i>Science </i>318, 1917-1920. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) exhibit morphological properties (e.g., round shape, large nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm) and growth properties (e.g., doubling time of about seventeen to eighteen hours) akin to ESCs. In addition, iPS cells express pluripotent cell-specific markers (e.g., Oct-4, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, Tra-1-60, or Tra-1-81, but not SSEA-1). Induced pluripotent stem cells, however, are not immediately derived from embryos. As used herein, &#x201c;not immediately derived from embryos&#x201d; means that the starting cell type for producing iPS cells is a non-embryonic, non-pluripotent cell, such as a multipotent cell or terminally differentiated cell, such as somatic cells obtained from a post-natal individual.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In particular embodiments, the disclosed methods employ pluripotent stem cells that are human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In particular embodiments, the solution of pluripotent stem cells is plated on the suitable substrate at a concentration of about 5&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As used herein &#x201c;suitable surface&#x201d; refers to a surface which allows stem cells to attach and grow. In particular embodiments, the suitable surface is hydrophilic. In further embodiments the hydrophilic surface can be a tissue-culture treated polystyrene plate, a round cover glass, or a &#x3bc;-dish with a polymer coverslip bottom. In particular embodiments, the suitable surface comprises tissue-culture treated polystyrene plates.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a particular embodiment, the one or a plurality of proteins are a morphogen. A number of morphogens can be used to differentiate hPSCs. In one embodiment, bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) is patterned to differentiate hPSCs to definitive mesendoderm. In a further embodiment, mesendodermal cells can further be differentiated into cardiomyocytes by adding IWP2 to the culture medium after BMP4 patterning. In another embodiment, cardiac progenitors can be differentiated into epicardial cells by patterning BMP4 with Wnt3a. In another embodiment, activin A is patterned to differentiate hPSCs to definitive endoderm. Other embodiments include combining BMP4 and activin A in the same well for localized multi-lineage differentiation of hPSCs. In particular embodiments, the one or a plurality of proteins can be selected from BMP4, activin A, noggin, or Wnt3a.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In particular embodiments, the pluripotent stems cells are differentiated into one or more of mesendoderm, endoderm, cardiomyocytes or epicardial cells.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein &#x201c;cell culture substrate&#x201d; refers to any extracellular matrix suitable to enhance stem cell attachment and survival on a surface. A cell culture substrate can be naturally-occurring or synthetic. In particular embodiments, the cell culture substrate is Matrigel&#xae;, vitronectin, or laminin.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The one or a plurality of signaling proteins used in the methods disclosed herein can be placed on the suitable surface as droplets, patterns drawn with a pipette, or confined using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stencil. In particular embodiments, the one or a plurality of proteins are placed on the suitable surface in a pattern. In other embodiments, the pattern is created on the suitable surface using a PDMS stencil cut into a desired shape. In other embodiments, the one or a plurality of proteins are patterned in a concentration gradient. These straightforward methods to create patterns are broadly accessible, but strategies such as a photolithography microfabrication to create more elaborate PDMS stencils can be applied to pattern protein adsorption on surfaces.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In particular embodiments, the one or a plurality of proteins are patterned on the suitable surface at a concentration of 1 ng/&#x3bc;l to about 1 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;l.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The disclosed methods for localized differentiation of hPSCs and committed progenitors provide numerous opportunities to investigate various aspects of developmental events and intercellular interaction in a spatially controlled manner due to its versatility. Unlike other strategies for patterning morphogens, this approach does not require complex functionalization of substrates or morphogen itself nor an additional device such as a bioprinter or a microfluidic device, making it more feasible in biological laboratories. The methods of the invention can advantageously be used for, constructing precisely patterned tissues for screening the effects of drugs and other compounds on tissue structure and function, as a tool to study cell interaction in a spatially controlled manner, and for building patterned micro-tissues for cell-based therapies. Additionally, the practice of this invention does not introduce hydrodynamic shear to cells, thus allowing the study of localized paracrine effects of differentiating cells, one of the key aspects of development.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Examples</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The Examples that follow are illustrative of specific embodiments of the disclosure, and various uses thereof. They are set forth for explanatory purposes only and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the disclosure in any way.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 1: Protein Patterning</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">To observe whether patterned adsorption can be applied to protein morphogens, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) solution was patterned as droplets, drawn letters, or stencil masks and then BMP4 was visualized by immunofluorescent microscopy.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A. Stock Solutions</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Stock solution for each protein was prepared as follows: 500 ng/&#x3bc;l BSA-FITC (Invitrogen, A23015) in sterile-filtered water (Sigma, W3500), 10 ng/&#x3bc;l human recombinant BMP4 (Invitrogen, PHC9534) in sterile-filtered 4 mM HCl containing 0.1% human serum albumin (HSA) (Sigma, A9731), 100 ng/&#x3bc;l human recombinant activin A (R&#x26;D Systems, 338-AC-010) in sterile-filtered 4 mM HCl, 250 ng/&#x3bc;l human recombinant noggin (R&#x26;D Systems, 6057-NG-025) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Gibco, 14190-144) containing 0.1% HSA, and 200 ng/&#x3bc;l human recombinant Wnt3a (R&#x26;D Systems, 5036-WN-010) in PBS containing 0.1% HSA. Further dilutions were performed in water for BSA-FITC and PBS for other proteins to the desired final concentrations.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">B. Protein Droplets</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Diluted protein solution was placed as a 5 &#x3bc;l droplet, drawn with a pipette tip (10 &#x3bc;l for each letter), or confined with PDMS stencil masks (20 &#x3bc;l for each shape) on a TC-treated plate (Corning, 3513 (12-well plate)/3526 (24-well plate)), untreated PS plate (Corning, 351143 (12-well plate)), or 15 mm round cover glass (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 71887-05) placed in a 24-well TC-5 mm &#x3bc;-dish with a polymer coverslip bottom (ibidi, 81156). To create an inverse pattern, a heart-shaped PDMS mask was placed at the center of the well of a 24-well plate to exclude Wnt3a and BMP4 adsorption from the heart-shaped region upon application of Wnt3a+BMP4 solution in the well.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">C. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) Stencil Masks</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">To make PDMS stencil masks, a PDMS layer was prepared, cut, and punched with commercially available hole punches. Briefly, base elastomer and curing agent (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 24236-10) were mixed thoroughly with a weight ratio of 10:1, poured in a unstick baking pan to cover the surface, de-gassed in a desiccator until bubbles were removed and cured in an oven for an hour at 100&#xb0; C. and finally cooled for at least 24 hours at room temperature. The cured PDMS layer was detached from the pan and used to make stencil masks. The PDMS masks were firmly attached on substrates to ensure solution confinement. Protein solutions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and aspirated. Protein solutions containing Wnt3a were incubated for 20 min at room temperature to minimize solution spreading. Immediately after aspiration, substrate was washed with PBS three times and further experiments were performed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">D. Localized Protein Patterns by Confinement of Protein Solutions</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Proteins adsorbed on substrates can mediate cellular responses such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation and they can also drive pattern formation (Hettiaratchi et al. (2016) <i>J. of Mats. Chem. </i>4, 3464-3481). Placing a protein solution on a substrate generated localized protein adsorption. Bovine serum albumin conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (BSA-FITC) solution was placed on a tissue culture plate as a droplet, drawn with a pipette tip (letter patterning), or confined with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stencil masks (circle, heart, and star patterning). The BSA-FITC remained adsorbed after a washing step while maintaining the patterns (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>). Importantly, more adsorption of BSA-FITC was observed on a hydrophobic untreated polystyrene (PS) plate when compared to the adsorption of BSA-FITC on a tissue culture (TC)-treated PS plate, suggesting that the adsorption likely involves hydrophobic interaction between the protein and the substrate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). Then, the effects of the different incubation time on adsorption were assessed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>). Even a short incubation (1 min) of the droplet resulted in a localized adsorption, suggesting that the interaction is rapid, consistent with the time scale of a hydrophobic interaction between a surfactant and a mineral surface (Meyer et al. <i>PNAS </i>103, 15739-15746).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Like BSA-FITC, BMP4 retained its patterns after washing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>) and more BMP4 was adsorbed on the hydrophobic untreated plate than the TC-treated plate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). These data demonstrated that a localized protein pattern can be created via a simple placement and confinement of a protein solution due to adsorption of the protein on the substrate.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 2: hPSC Maintenance and CPC Differentiation</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A. hPSC Maintenance</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">H9 hESC (WiCell), H9-hTNNT2-GFP hESC (H9-hTnnT2-pGZ-TD2, WiCell), and WTC11 (Allen Institute) were maintained in mTeSR1 basal medium (STEMCELL Technologies, 85851) supplemented with 5&#xd7; supplement (STEMCELL Technologies, 85852). When cells reached 70-80% confluency, they were passaged onto a Matrigel&#xae; (Corning, 354230)-coated 6-well TC-treated plate (Corning, 3516) with a split ratio of 1:9 using Versene (Gibco, 15040-066) (6 min incubation at 37&#xb0; C.).

The statistical comparison was performed using two-tailed Student's t test (** P&#x3c;0.01) between untreated and TC-treated conditions at each concentration. Intensity profiles at pattern boundaries were obtained using Fiji/ImageJ software. A representative image at each pattern boundary was transformed into gray scale images, then vertically averaged pixel intensities for all pixels along the x-axis were obtained for each marker. Averaged intensities for each marker were divided by the corresponding averaged intensities of nuclei and plotted to get normalized intensity profiles. Maximum intensity projection images of z-stack images were obtained using NIS-Elements imaging software (NIS-Elements Advanced Research version 5.20.01). For analysis of length and alignment of sarcomeres, 25 images for each condition were obtained from three biological replicates. The images were blinded using an ImageJ plugin &#x2018;Blind Analysis Tools&#x2019; generating encrypted file names with a mapping file. For each image, 20 lines across 4 &#x3b1;-actinin+ z-lines were quantified (500 lines per each condition) using NIS-Elements imaging software to get the lines' lengths and positional information. From the positional information of all 20 lines, angles between those lines were calculated. Specifically, a line was chosen as a reference line to obtain 19 different angles between the reference line and the other lines. These 19 values were averaged to get an angle difference value of a single line. The same calculation was performed for all 20 lines to get 20 different angles. These 20 angles were averaged again to get a representative value for angle between sarcomeres of a single image. The 25 angles from 25 images of each condition were averaged and standard deviations were calculated to get the reported values.

Localized Differentiation of hPSCs into Mesendoderm by Patterned BMP4</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">To explore whether spatial localization of adsorbed morphogens can mediate pattern formation during hPSC differentiation, different concentrations of BMP4 droplets were placed on either untreated PS or TC-treated PS plates followed by Matrigel&#xae; coating and subsequent plating of hPSCs. The cells were seeded to generate a confluent monolayer. BMP4 in the presence of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is known to induce primitive-streak like mesendoderm specification of hPSCs, characterized by expression of BRACHYURY (BRA) (Yu et al. (2011) <i>Cell stem cell </i>8, 326-334). While none of the BMP4 droplets induced mesendoderm differentiation on the untreated PS surface after two days of culture in the hPSC maintenance medium mTeSR1, a range of BMP4 concentrations induced localized mesendoderm differentiation on TC-treated PS (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>). This outcome can be attributed to the hydrophobic interaction between BMP4 and the surface, which can inactivate BMP4 on the untreated PS surface. On the untreated PS surface, the 0.1, 0.2, and 2.5 ng/ul BMP4 droplets partially or fully inhibited cell attachment on the patterned area. Staining for laminin, a major component of Matrigel&#xae; matrix, after placing the 2.5 ng/ul BMP4 droplet on the untreated PS surface showed limited Matrigel&#xae; coating on the patterned region (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>). This is likely due to the strong hydrophobic interaction between BMP4 and the surface that can have saturated the surface, preventing Matrigel&#xae; coating and cell attachment. Analysis was restricted to TC-treated PS surfaces because they permitted robust cell attachment on morphogen-patterned surfaces.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Next, BMP4 solution was placed on TC-treated plates in various patterns (droplet, letters, circle, heart, and star), and hPSCs seeded onto the substrate in mTeSR1 maintenance medium. Immunostaining for BRA after 2 days of culture demonstrated that localized BMP4 patterns led to spatially confined mesendoderm differentiation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Staining for the pluripotency markers SOX2 and NANOG showed that cells outside the BMP4-patterned regions maintained their pluripotent state, while the BRA+ mesendoderm cells expressed these pluripotency markers at a lower level than cells outside the BMP4 patterns (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). Some expression of pluripotency markers in the mesendoderm cells was expected according to previous studies (Yu et al. (2011) <i>Cell stem cell </i>8, 326-334; Thomson et al. (2011) <i>Cell </i>145, 875-889; Wang et al. (2012) <i>Cell stem cell </i>10, 440-454). The expression profile of BRA at the edge of the pattern exhibited a sharp boundary, similar to the profile of adsorbed BMP4 (FIG. <b>8</b>B), suggesting that the immobilized BMP4 acted directly on the hPSCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). This primitive streak-like mesendoderm fate was further verified by expression of MIXL1 in cells on the BMP4 pattern (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). Since the presence of inhibitory morphogens is also important in developmental patterning, a BMP inhibitor, noggin, was evaluated for antagonism to localized BMP4-induced mesendoderm differentiation. A noggin solution was placed as a droplet on TC-treated PS, then hPSCs were seeded and cultured in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 ng/ml BMP4 for 2 days. Only the cells outside of the noggin pattern expressed BRA, while the cells on the noggin-treated patterned area did not express BRA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>). There results demonstrated that adsorbed noggin inhibited BMP4-induced mesendoderm differentiation. Small molecule inhibitors targeting different actin-receptor like kinases (ALKs) including A83-01 (inhibitor of ALK4, ALK5, and ALK7), SB431542 (inhibitor of ALK4, ALK5, and ALK7), and LDN-212854 (inhibitor of ALK2) were tested to examine whether receptor-level inhibition can antagonize the localized mesendoderm differentiation on BMP4 patterns (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>). When these small molecules were added for the initial 24 h of culture on the patterned substrate, they suppressed BRA expression in the cells on the BMP4-patterned area, suggesting that localized mesendoderm differentiation required binding of BMP4 ligand and activation of corresponding receptors. This localized mesendoderm differentiation was also achieved on different substrates (glass and ibidi polymer coverslip) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>), different ECM coatings (Synthemax and vitronectin) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>), and with an additional hPSC cell line (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>) demonstrating the versatility of the approach. Collectively, these data showed that this simple and robust strategy to localize morphogens such as BMP4 and noggin can spatially regulate BMP4 signaling in hPSC cultures, thereby resulting in localized mesendoderm differentiation.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 4: Localized Differentiation of hPSCs into Definitive Endoderm by Patterned Activin a</heading><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A.

Differentiation of hPSCs by Patterned Activin a</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Since activin A has been reported to induce differentiation of hPSCs into definitive endoderm in the presence of a serum supplement (D'Amour et al. (2005) <i>Nature Biotech. </i>23, 1534-1541), activin A was patterned as a way to direct localized endoderm commitment of hPSCs. Activin A solution was placed on TC-treated plate in a multitude of different patterns, similar to the BMP4 patterning described above. hPSCs were seeded on the activin A patterned substrates after coating with Matrigel, cultured for 3 days, and immunostained for SOX17, a marker for definitive endoderm (D'Amour et al. (2005) <i>Nature Biotech. </i>23, 1534-1541). As with BMP4-induced mesendoderm differentiation, adsorbed activin A induced localized endoderm differentiation indicated by patterned expression of SOX17 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Immunostaining for NANOG and SOX2 showed that cells outside the activin A-patterned region retained SOX2 expression but lost NANOG expression, whereas cells on the activin A-patterned region expressed both SOX2 and NANOG as well as SOX17 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). The retained expression of NANOG and SOX2 in the SOX17+ endoderm population was consistent with the role of these pluripotency factors in directing early endoderm specification (Teo et al. (2011) <i>Genes and Development </i>25, 238-250). The SOX2+/NANOG-population found outside of the activin A patterned region is likely of ectoderm lineage because expression of SOX2 is maintained during ectodermal differentiation (Thomson et al. (2011) <i>Cell </i>145, 875-889; Wang et al. (2012) <i>Cell stem cell </i>10, 440-454). These cells were cultured in RPMI1640 basal medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS), which presumably induces spontaneous differentiation of hPSCs. Similar to the BMP4-induced BRA expression profile, the expression profile of SOX17 at the edge of the pattern showed a sharp boundary, suggesting that activin A acted directly on the cells in contact with the patterns (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). Small molecule-mediated ALK receptor inhibition abolished the patterned endoderm differentiation, again showing that differentiation is induced via the binding of the activin A to the receptors and activation of these receptors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Localized patterning of the definitive endoderm was also achieved in WTC11 iPSCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>D</figref>). Since it has been reported that SOX17 also plays an important role in the development of mesoderm lineages such as cardiac (Liu et al. (2007) <i>PNAS </i>104, 3859-3864), hematopoietic (Clarke et al.

(2014) <i>Developmental Biology </i>387, 109-120), the cells that activin A patterns were verified to be definitive endoderm with an additional marker, FOXA2. At day 5 of differentiation, almost all of the cells on the activin A-patterned area expressed both SOX17 and FOXA2, while virtually no cells outside of the activin A patterns expressed either of these markers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>).

At day 3 of differentiation, the cells on the BMP4-patterned areas expressed MESP1, a mesodermal transcription factor that regulates cardiac, hematopoietic, and skeletal myogenic specification (Chan et al. (2013) <i>Cell stem cell </i>12, 587-601), and lost expression of the pluripotency and ectodermal marker SOX2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>). Some of the cells on the BMP4 patterns expressed low levels of SOX17, which suggested the presence of endoderm cells derived from the BMP4-induced mesendoderm population or mesoderm cells that transiently expressed SOX17 (Liu et al. (2007) <i>PNAS </i>104, 3859-3864). The cells on the activin A-patterned region expressed SOX17 but not MESP1. At day 5 of differentiation, TE7 antibody, which is raised against human thymic stroma (Haynes et al. (1984) <i>The Journal of experimental medicine </i>159, 1149-1168) and has been used to detect mesoderm derived stromal cells such as fibroblasts, was used as a marker for mesoderm lineage cells. The cells on the BMP4-patterned region were stained by TE7 but did not express SOX2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>). Some of the cells on the BMP4 patterns at day 5 also expressed SOX17, like the cells at day 3. The cells on the activin A-patterned area expressed SOX17 and SOX2, but not TE7.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">To further investigate the identity of these cells on the BMP4 and activin A patterns immunostaining at day 7 was performed. Significantly, most of the cells on the BMP4-patterned region lost expression of SOX17 but stained positive with TE7, while the cells on the activin A-patterned region lost expression of SOX2 but retained expression of SOX17 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). The SOX2+ SOX17&#x2212; TE7&#x2212; cells outside the morphogen-patterned regions are likely a spontaneously differentiated ectoderm lineage population, as these cells were cultured in serum-containing medium for 6 days. Staining for the ectodermal transcription factor OTX2 further verified the ectoderm fate of the cells outside the morphogen-patterned regions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). Another interesting characteristic of this patterned differentiation culture was the very dense and volumetric (&#x2dc;200 &#x3bc;m thick) layer of SOX2+ SOX17- TE7- cells that was observed at the BMP4 pattern boundary, directly adjacent to the mesodermal-derived cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). A maximum intensity projection image of multiple z-slices for SOX2 showed a clear difference between this dense layer and the monolayer of ectodermal cells more distal to the morphogen patterns. Since this layer was only observed at the interface between the mesoderm linage cells and the ectoderm lineage cells, it suggested that the differentiating mesodermal cells could exert signaling to affect proliferation or differentiation fate of the cells in the surrounding layer through juxtacrine or localized paracrine interactions. Taken together, these data demonstrated spatially controlled differentiation of hPSC into the three germ layers in a single well and suggested the importance of crosstalk between developing germ layers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 6: Localized Differentiation of hPSCs into Cardiomyocytes by Patterned BMP4</heading><p id="p-0085" num="0084">For localized cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation, 2.5 ng/&#x3bc;l BMP4 solution was placed in PDMS stencil masks on a TC-treated plate.

BMP4 patterns were used to direct mesoderm and Wnt inhibition by addition of IWP2 to the culture medium at day 3 to specify cardiac mesoderm and achieve patterned CM differentiation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). The H9-hTNNT2-GFP hESC reporter line was used to visualize patterning of CMs in live cells. At day 8 of differentiation, immunostaining of the CM-specific marker, cardiac troponin T (cTnT), showed localization of CMs to the patterned area in H9 hESCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>) and live videos of the H9-hTNNT2-GFP line showed spontaneous contraction of patterned CMs. Cells outside of the BMP4 patterns did not express cTnT but retained SOX2 expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>). Since these cells did not receive cues to undergo mesoderm differentiation, they likely spontaneously differentiated to neuroectoderm in the RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with B27, which has been reported to support neuronal induction and maturation (Nicholas et al.

To mimic later stage cell fate patterning, the same patterned morphogen approach for the localized germ layer specification of hPSCs was examined to see if it could be applied to hPSC-derived cardiac progenitors. hPSC-derived cardiac progenitors possessing potential to be differentiated into CMs and EpiCs were generated by the GSK inhibitor and Wnt inhibitor (GiWi) protocol (Bao et al. (2016) <i>Nature biomed. Eng. </i>1, 1-12). These cardiac progenitors can further differentiate into CMs without any specific external signaling factors and can also differentiate into EpiCs upon activation of canonical Wnt signaling (Bao et al. (2016) <i>Nature biomed. Eng. </i>1, 1-12). Since previous studies showed that both BMP4 and Wnt3a play important roles in the generation of EpiCs (Bao et al. (2016) <i>Nature biomed.

While BMP4 and Wnt3a individually induced limited if any EpiC differentiation, the droplet containing both BMP4 and Wnt3a successfully induced localized EpiC differentiation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) indicated by the expression of WT1, a transcription factor expressed in epicardial cells. This result was consistent with a previous study showing the synergistic effects of Wnt3a and BMP4 on EpiC specification (Iyer et al.

Quantification of the distance between &#x3b1;-actinin+z-lines and the angles between these z-disc-crossing lines showed that the CMs located adjacent to EpiCs exhibited longer sarcomere length and increased myofibril alignment than CMs away from the boundary. Given that sarcomere length is an indicator of CM structural maturation and myofibril alignment of CMs is an important feature of CMs in vivo (Bursac et al. (2002) <i>Circulation research </i>91), these results suggested that the positive effects of EPIs on the structural maturation of hPSC-derived CMs occurred over a short length scale.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In summary, these experiments demonstrated that localized differentiation on morphogen patterns can be used to systematically derive spatially distinct cell populations and to assess cell-cell interactions in differentiating cell populations in a spatial context.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">While particular aspects and embodiments are disclosed herein, other aspects and embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing teaching.
