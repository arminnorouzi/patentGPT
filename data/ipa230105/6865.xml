Information is stored by programing memory cells within a memory device to various states. For example, binary memory cells may be programmed to one of two supported states, often denoted by a logic 1 or a logic 0. In some examples, a single memory cell may support more than two states, any one of which may be stored. To access the stored information, a component may read, or sense, at least one stored state in the memory device. To store information, a component may write, or program, the state in the memory device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various types of memory devices and memory cells exist, including magnetic hard disks, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM), ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM), magnetic RAM (MRAM), resistive RAM (RRAM), flash memory, phase change memory (PCM), self-selecting memory, chalcogenide memory technologies, and others. Memory cells may be volatile or non-volatile. Non-volatile memory, e.g., FeRAM, may maintain their stored logic state for extended periods of time even in the absence of an external power source. Volatile memory devices, e.g., DRAM, may lose their stored state when disconnected from an external power source.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a system that supports time-variable decision feedback equalization in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a circuit that supports time-variable decision feedback equalization in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example of a circuit that supports time-variable decision feedback equalization in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of a signal diagram that supports time-variable decision feedback equalization in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of a circuit that supports time-variable decision feedback equalization in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a block diagram of a receiving device that supports time-variable decision feedback equalization in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a flowchart illustrating a method or methods that support time-variable decision feedback equalization in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A signal transmitted between devices (e.g., a host device and memory device) over a conductive line may be degraded by the time the transmitted signal reaches the receiving device. In some examples, reflections of a transmitted signal occur on the conductive line and interfere with subsequent portions of the signal (or with subsequent signals transmitted over the conductive line). To compensate for the interference, a receiving device may use equalization to cancel reflections (or other interference) caused by a previous signal before processing a received signal. In some examples, a receiving device includes a decision feedback equalization (DFE) circuit that is configured to reduce interference in the received signal.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The DFE circuit may include a decision circuit that samples a received signal. In some examples, the decision circuit may sample the received signal on a unit interval basis. The decision circuit may further output a digitized signal based on the received signal. The DFE circuit may also include a feedback circuit that feeds back time-delayed and scaled versions of the signal (either the digitized signal or the analog signal) to subsequent portions of the received signal to cancel out reflections caused by the received signal. The feedback circuit may include a time-delay circuit and a variable gain circuit. In some examples, the time-delay circuit may apply fixed time-delays (e.g., full and/or fractional time delays) to a signal output by the decision circuit, and the variable gain circuit may scale the time-delayed signals to generate the feedback signal. The DFE circuit may subtract the feedback signal from the received signal to obtain a modified signal that more closely represents the originally transmitted signal before the modified signal is processed by the decision circuit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A performance of the DFE circuit, however, may be limited based on the type, quantity, and/or fixed time-delay of delay elements included in a delay circuit. That is, in some examples, a DFE circuit solely includes delay elements that introduce delays that are integer multiples of the unit interval. In such cases, if the reflections of the information signal are delayed by a non-integer multiple of the unit interval, the feedback signal may not be aligned with the reflections of the information signal, reducing a cancellation performance of the feedback signal. In some examples, to better align the feedback signal with the reflections and improve the equalization performance, the DFE circuit may also include fractional delay elements that introduce delays that are non-integer multiples of the unit interval. However, increasing the quantity of delay elements in the DFE circuit to also include fractional delay elements may increase a complexity, footprint, and/or power consumption of the DFE circuit.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Additionally, or alternatively, the DFE circuit may include a limited quantity of delay elements (e.g., less than 3 delay elements)&#x2014;e.g., to save power, reduce complexity, reduce footprint, etc. In such cases, the limited quantity of delay elements may generate a set of fixed time-delayed signals that fail to overlap with more significant reflections that occur with non-overlapping delays. Thus, significant reflections may be passed to an input of a decision circuit without any compensation. For example, if the DFE circuit includes a first delay element that applies a unit interval of delay and a second delay element that applies three unit intervals of delay, reflections having two unit intervals of delay may not be reduced by the DFE circuit. In some examples, to avoid missing reflections, a DFE circuit may be configured with a large quantity of delay elements (e.g., full and fractional delay elements), and a set of delay elements that reduces the reflections by a threshold amount may be activated. In some cases, including and supporting a large quantity of delay elements may increase a complexity and footprint of the DFE circuit.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">To improve a performance of a DFE circuit while using a reduced quantity of delay elements, a DFE circuit may be configured to include one or more variable time-delay elements. The DFE circuit may include a decision circuit that determines a voltage level of a received information signal and generates an output information signal; a delay circuit that includes one or more delay elements and generates one or more delayed signals based on the output information signal; and a variable gain circuit that includes one or more variable gain amplifiers and generates a feedback signal based on the one or more delayed signals. In some examples, delay parameters of the one or more delay elements may be programmable or adjustable so that the delayed signals align in time with significant reflections of the received information signal.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Features of the disclosure are initially described in the context of a system.

A system clock signal may be generated by a system clock, which may include one or more hardware components (e.g., oscillators, crystals, logic gates, transistors).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some examples, data channels <b>190</b> may be operable to communicate one or more of data or control information between the host device <b>105</b> and the memory device <b>110</b>.

In some examples, a channel <b>115</b> may include multiple individual signal paths. For example, a channel may be x4 (e.g., including four signal paths), x8 (e.g., including eight signal paths), x16 (including sixteen signal paths), etc.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Signals communicated over the channels <b>115</b> may be modulated using one or more different modulation schemes. In some examples, a binary-symbol (or binary-level) modulation scheme may be used to modulate signals communicated between the host device <b>105</b> and the memory device <b>110</b>. A binary-symbol modulation scheme may be an example of an M-ary modulation scheme where M is equal to two. Each symbol of a binary-symbol modulation scheme may be operable to represent one bit of digital data (e.g., a symbol may represent a logic 1 or a logic 0). Examples of binary-symbol modulation schemes include, but are not limited to, non-return-to-zero (NRZ), unipolar encoding, bipolar encoding, Manchester encoding, pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) having two symbols (e.g., PAM2), and/or others.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some examples, a non-binary symbol (or multi-level) modulation scheme may be used to modulate signals communicated between the host device <b>105</b> and the memory device <b>110</b>. A non-binary modulation scheme may be an example of an M-ary modulation scheme where M is greater than or equal to three. Unlike a binary-symbol modulation scheme, each symbol of a non-binary modulation scheme may be operable to represent more than one bit of digital data (e.g., a symbol may represent a logic 00, a logic 01, a logic 10, or a logic 11). Examples of non-binary modulation schemes include, but are not limited to, PAM3, PAM4, PAM8, etc., quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), and/or others. A non-binary signal (e.g., a PAM3 signal or a PAM4 signal) may be a signal that is modulated using a modulation scheme that includes at least three levels to encode more than one bit of information. Non-binary modulation schemes and symbols may alternatively be referred to as non-binary, multi-bit, or higher-order modulation schemes and symbols.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A memory device <b>110</b> may receive information signals (e.g., data signals, control signals, clock signals, etc.) from a host device <b>105</b> via one or more channels <b>115</b>&#x2014;e.g., during a write operation. Similarly, a host device <b>105</b> may receive information signals from a memory device <b>110</b> via the one or more channels <b>115</b>&#x2014;e.g., during a read operation. In some examples, channel characteristics (e.g., a frequency response of the channel, impedance matching of the channel, etc.) may affect the transmission of the information signals over the channels. In some examples (e.g., due to an impedance mismatch between a conductive line and termination point) reflections of an information signal may develop on a channel. The reflections of the information signal may be time-delayed and attenuated versions of the information signal that combine with later portions of the information signal, causing an altered information signal (relative to the information signal transmitted from the transmitter) to be received at the receiving device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The memory device <b>110</b> may include a decision circuit that determines a voltage level for a received information signal. In some examples, the decision circuit may periodically sample the received information signal in accordance with a rising and/or falling edge of a clock. Each time the decision circuit samples the received signal may be referred to as a sampling event. The sampling events may be separated from one another by a set duration that is based on the clock frequency, also referenceable as a unit interval. The decision circuit may compare, at a sampling event, a voltage of the received information signal against one or more threshold voltages and output a voltage having a particular voltage level based on the comparison&#x2014;e.g., a voltage that greater than or less than a threshold voltage or that is between a pair of threshold voltages. In some examples, the changes to the information signal caused by the reflections cause the decision circuit to output a signal having voltage levels that are inconsistent with the voltage level of the information signal originally transmitted from the host device <b>105</b>, resulting in data storage/retrieval errors.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">To compensate for the changes to the transmitted signal that may occur during transmission, a receiving device (e.g., the host device <b>105</b> or the memory device <b>110</b>) may apply an equalization technique to received information signals. For example, a receiving device may use a DFE circuit that includes a decision circuit (which may be or include a slicer), a delay circuit (which may include one or more delay elements, also referenceable as tap delays), and a variable gain (also referenceable as a scaling circuit and which may include one or more variable gain amplifiers). The decision circuit may determine a voltage level of a signal received at an input of the decision circuit&#x2014;e.g., by comparing the voltage level of the signal with one or more threshold voltages. The decision circuit may output a signal (also referenceable as an output signal) that transitions between different voltage levels of a set of possible voltage levels based on the comparison.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The signal output by the decision circuit may be received by the delay circuit, which may output one or more delayed versions of the output signal (also referenceable as delay signals). In some examples, the delay circuit includes one or more delay elements, where each delay element outputs a respective delay signal having a respective delay relative to the output signal. In some examples, each delay element outputs a delay signal that is delayed relative to the output signal by a duration that is an integer multiple of the unit interval (e.g., one unit interval, two unit intervals, etc.). In some examples, one or more delay elements may output a delay signal that is delayed by a duration that is not an integer multiple of the unit interval (e.g., one-and-a-half unit intervals, one-and-a-three-quarter unit intervals, etc.), and may be referred to as fractional delay elements.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The variable gain may receive the delayed signals and output scaled versions of the delay signals (also referenceable as feedback signals). In some examples, the variable gain outputs a feedback signal that has a smaller magnitude than a corresponding delay signal received at the variable gain&#x2014;e.g., the magnitude of the feedback signal may match the magnitude of the reflected component of the input signal.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some examples, the feedback signal may be applied to a subtraction circuit that also receives the information signal from the transmitting device. The subtraction circuit may subtract the feedback signal from the information signal, which may result in the reflected components of the information signal being reduced (or cancelled) by the scaled versions of the one or more delay signals. The subtraction circuit may output a modified signal based on the subtraction, where the modified signal may be received at the decision circuit. In other examples, the feedback signal may be applied to a threshold generation circuit and used to modify the threshold voltages used by the decision circuit. In such cases, the received information signal may be directly inputted into a first input of the decision circuit and the modified threshold voltages may be directly inputted into a second input of the decision circuit (and the decision circuit may be or include a comparator). In some examples, a training procedure is used to tune the gain of the variable gain to optimally reduce the reflected components of the received information signal&#x2014;e.g. by aligning a magnitude of one or more feedback signals with a magnitude of one or more corresponding reflections.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">However, a performance of the DFE circuit may be limited based on the type, quantity, and/or fixed time-delay of delay elements included in a delay circuit. That is, in some examples, a DFE circuit solely includes delay elements that introduce delays that are integer multiples of the unit interval. In such cases, if the reflections of the information signal are delayed by a non-integer multiple of the unit interval, the feedback signal may not be aligned (or may be poorly aligned) with the reflections of the information signal, reducing a cancellation performance of the feedback signal. In some examples, to better align the feedback signal with the reflections and improve the equalization performance, the DFE circuit may also include fractional delay elements that introduce delays that are non-integer multiples of the unit interval. However, increasing the quantity of delay elements in the DFE circuit to also include fractional delay elements may increase a complexity, footprint, and/or power consumption of the DFE circuit.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally, or alternatively, the DFE circuit may include a limited quantity of fixed-delay delay elements (e.g., less than 3 delay elements)&#x2014;e.g., to save power, reduce complexity, reduce footprint, etc. In such cases, the limited quantity of delay elements may generate a set of fixed time-delayed signals that fail to overlap with more significant reflections that occur with non-overlapping delays. Thus, significant reflections may be passed to an input of a decision circuit without any compensation. For example, if the DFE circuit includes a first delay element that applies a unit interval of delay and a second delay element that applies three unit intervals of delay, reflections having two unit intervals of delay may not be reduced by the DFE circuit. In some examples, to avoid missing reflections, a DFE circuit may be configured with a large quantity of delay elements (e.g., full and fractional delay elements), and a set of delay elements that reduces the reflections by a threshold amount may be activated. However, including and supporting a large quantity of delay elements may increase a complexity and footprint of the DFE circuit.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">To improve a performance of a DFE circuit while using a reduced quantity of delay elements, a DFE circuit may be configured to include variable time-delay elements. The DFE circuit may include a decision circuit that determines a voltage level of a received information signal and generates an output information signal; a delay circuit that includes one or more variable time-delay elements and generates one or more delayed signals based on the output information signal; and a variable gain circuit that includes one or more variable gain amplifiers and generates a feedback signal based on the one or more delayed signals. In some examples, delay parameters of the one or more delay elements may be programmable or adjustable so that the delay signals generated by the delay circuit align in time with significant reflections of the received information signal. Techniques for determining the delay parameters for the delay element elements may include minimum mean square error techniques that are based on a received information signal and corresponding output information signal.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a circuit that supports time-variable decision feedback equalization in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.

As depicted in signal diagram <b>400</b>, the peak of the different reflection may not be perfectly aligned with a beginning/end of a unit interval but may be offset by some amount. Additionally, the peak of some reflection may be at or near a zero value. In some examples, reflections are identified as signal components that occur after the initial transmission and have a magnitude that exceeds a threshold. The reflections of received signal <b>415</b> may affect (e.g., combine with) output signals resulting from subsequent pulses of input signal <b>410</b> (not shown). For example, if input signal <b>410</b> transitioned from a high voltage to a low voltage at second time <b>430</b>-<b>2</b>, second reflection <b>420</b>-<b>2</b> may combine with a first signal component of the resulting output signal, increasing or decreasing a voltage of the resulting output signal.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As described herein, a DFE circuit may be used to compensate for the reflections by generating a feedback signal that cancels out the reflections. The DFE circuit may include a decision circuit that samples a voltage of received signal <b>415</b> at first time <b>430</b>-<b>1</b> (e.g., which may correspond to sampling event <b>405</b>) and outputs a voltage level based on the sample voltage. For example, for a binary modulation scheme, if the decision circuit determines that the voltage of received signal <b>415</b> is greater than a threshold voltage, the decision circuit may output a high voltage.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some examples, the DFE circuit may also include one or more fixed time-delay elements that output delayed versions of the signal output by the decision circuit, where the delayed versions may also be referred to as delay signals. And the DFE circuit may include variable gain amplifiers that output scaled versions of the delay signals. In some examples, the fixed time-delay elements may introduce delays that are an integer multiple of a duration of a unit interval <b>425</b>. Thus, the variable gain amplifiers may generate scaled signals having peaks that are aligned with a beginning/end of a unit interval. As described herein, in some cases, the peaks of the reflections may not be aligned with a beginning/end of a unit interval, reducing a cancellation effect of the scaled signals. As also described herein, in some examples, the fixed time-delay elements may introduce delays that are not an integer multiple of a duration of a unit interval <b>425</b> (e.g., using fractional delay elements). In such cases, the variable gain amplifiers may generate scaled signals that have peaks that are aligned with peaks of one or more reflections.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">However, to align the peaks of the scaled signals with the peaks of one or more reflections using fixed time-delay element, the DFE circuit may be configured with an excessive quantity of delay elements&#x2014;e.g., to ensure that the proper delay can be applied to received signal <b>415</b>. To align the peaks of the scaled signals with the peaks of one or more reflections with a reduced quantity of delay elements, the DFE circuit may be configured with variable time-delay elements. Using variable time-delay elements, the DFE circuit may modify the delay of the delay elements so that peaks of the corresponding scaled signals are aligned with peaks of one or more reflections. In some examples, the DFE circuit includes one or more fixed time-delay elements and one or more variable time-delay elements.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some examples, the DFE circuit may include as many delay elements as reflections included in received signal <b>415</b>. In such cases, the first delay element may be tuned to apply a delay to a signal output by the decision circuit that corresponds to a duration between sampling event <b>405</b> and a peak of first reflection <b>420</b>-<b>1</b>, the second delay element may be tuned to apply a delay to the signal output by the decision circuit that corresponds to a duration between sampling event <b>405</b> and a peak of second reflection <b>420</b>-<b>2</b>, and so on.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In other examples, the DFE circuit may include less delay elements than reflections included in received signal <b>415</b>. In such cases, delays of one or more variable time-delay elements may be configured to cancel out a reflection or combination of reflections that have the largest effect on subsequent signals. For example, if the DFE circuit includes one variable time-delay element, the DFE circuit may be configured to set a time-delay for the variable time-delay element to be equal to the duration between sampling event <b>405</b> and second reflection <b>420</b>-<b>2</b>&#x2014;e.g., to cancel out the second reflection <b>420</b>-<b>2</b>. In another example, if the DFE circuit includes two variable time-delay elements, the DFE circuit may be configured to set a time-delay for a first time-delay element to be equal to the duration between sampling event <b>405</b> and second reflection <b>420</b>-<b>2</b> and a time-delay for the second time-delay element to be equal to the duration between sampling event <b>405</b> and fourth reflection <b>420</b>-<b>4</b>&#x2014;e.g., to cancel out the second reflection <b>420</b>-<b>2</b> and fourth reflection <b>420</b>-<b>4</b>. In some examples, if the DFE circuit includes a fixed time-delay element and a variable time-delay element, the DFE circuit may be configured so that the fixed time-delay element cancels out a dispersed component of receiving signal <b>415</b> (e.g., at first time <b>430</b>-<b>1</b>), and variable time-delay element may be tuned to cancel out second reflection <b>420</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some examples, to determine which reflections to cancel, reflections having a magnitude that exceed a first threshold (e.g., 0.2V) may be identified, and the available time-delay elements may be tuned to align the feedback signals with the identified reflections. If there are remaining time-delay elements, remaining reflections having a magnitude that exceed a second threshold (e.g., 0.1V) may be identified, and the available time-delay elements may be tuned to align another set of feedback signals with the identified reflections. And so on, until there are no remaining reflections to cancel or no available time delay elements left to tune.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As described herein, the DFE circuit may use different techniques to generate a control signal that is used to tune the variable time-delay elements and/or the variable gain elements&#x2014;e.g., using a minimum mean square estimation technique. In some examples, the DFE circuit first uses the control signal to tune the variable time-delay elements, where a variable time-delay circuit including the variable time-delay elements may modify a first time-delay element based on the control signal, then modify a second time-delay element based on the control signal when a magnitude (or rate of change) of the error signal falls below a threshold, and so on. After tuning the variable time-delay elements, the DFE circuit may use the control signal to tune the variable gain amplifiers, where a variable gain circuit including the variable gain amplifiers may modify a first variable gain amplifier based on the control signal, then a second variable gain amplifier based on the control signal when a magnitude (or rate of change) of the error signal falls below a threshold, and so on.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some examples, a response of a conductive line may be estimated, measured, or modeled prior to deployment of a memory device, and a timing and magnitude of a set of resulting reflections may be determined or estimated accordingly. After identifying the timing and magnitude of the reflections, the time-delay of a set of available variable time-delay elements may be programmed based on the identified timing and magnitude of the resulting reflections. For example, the set of available variable time-delay elements may be tuned to generate feedback signals that cancel out (or reduce the magnitude of) the more impactful reflections (e.g., second reflection <b>420</b>-<b>2</b> and fourth reflection <b>420</b>-<b>4</b>). In some examples, the time-delay for the variable time-delay element is set by blowing one or more fuses (e.g., melting a filament in the one or more fuses) included in the time-delay element that are used to set a timing of the variable time-delay element.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of a circuit that supports time-variable decision feedback equalization in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.

The conductivity of the substrate, or sub-regions of the substrate, may be controlled through doping using various chemical species including, but not limited to, phosphorous, boron, or arsenic. Doping may be performed during the initial formation or growth of the substrate, by ion-implantation, or by any other doping means.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">A switching component or a transistor discussed herein may represent a field-effect transistor (FET) and comprise a three terminal device including a source, drain, and gate. The terminals may be connected to other electronic elements through conductive materials, e.g., metals. The source and drain may be conductive and may comprise a heavily-doped, e.g., degenerate, semiconductor region. The source and drain may be separated by a lightly-doped semiconductor region or channel. If the channel is n-type (i.e., majority carriers are electrons), then the FET may be referred to as a n-type FET. If the channel is p-type (i.e., majority carriers are holes), then the FET may be referred to as a p-type FET. The channel may be capped by an insulating gate oxide. The channel conductivity may be controlled by applying a voltage to the gate. For example, applying a positive voltage or negative voltage to an n-type FET or a p-type FET, respectively, may result in the channel becoming conductive. A transistor may be &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;activated&#x201d; when a voltage greater than or equal to the transistor's threshold voltage is applied to the transistor gate. The transistor may be &#x201c;off&#x201d; or &#x201c;deactivated&#x201d; when a voltage less than the transistor's threshold voltage is applied to the transistor gate.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The description set forth herein, in connection with the appended drawings, describes example configurations and does not represent all the examples that may be implemented or that are within the scope of the claims.
