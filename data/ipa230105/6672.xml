The memory device <b>110</b> may be configured to operate in response to control signals received from the memory controller <b>120</b>. Operations of the memory device <b>110</b> may include, for example, a read operation, a program operation (also referred to as a &#x201c;write operation&#x201d;), an erasure operation, and the like.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The memory device <b>110</b> may include a memory cell array including multiple memory cells (also simply referred to as &#x201c;cells&#x201d;) configured to store data. The memory cell array may exist inside a memory block.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, the memory device <b>110</b> may be implemented as any of various types of memories, such as a double data rate synchronous dynamic random access memory (DDR SDRAM), a low power double data rate4 (LPDDR4) SDRAM, a graphics double data rate (GDDR) SDRAM, a low power DDR (LPDDR), a rambus dynamic random access memory (RDRAM), a NAND flash memory, a vertical NAND flash memory, a NOR flash memory, a resistive random access memory (RRAM), a phase-change memory (PRAM), a magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), a ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM), or a spin transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The memory device <b>110</b> may be implemented in a three-dimensional array structure. Embodiments of the present disclosure are applicable not only to a flash memory device having an electric charge storage layer configured as a conductive floating gate, but also to a flash memory device having a charge trap flash (CTF) having an electric charge storage layer configured as an insulating film.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The memory device <b>110</b> may be configured to receive a command and an address from the memory controller <b>120</b> and to access an area of the memory cell array, which is selected by the address. That is, the memory device <b>110</b> may perform an operation corresponding to the received command in a memory area of the memory device having a physical address corresponding to the received address from the controller.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, the memory device <b>110</b> may perform a program operation, a read operation, an erasure operation, and the like. In relation thereto, during the program operation, the memory device <b>110</b> may program data in the area selected by the address. During the read operation, the memory device <b>110</b> may read data from the area selected by the address. During the erasure operation, the memory device <b>110</b> may erase data stored in the area selected by the address.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The memory controller <b>120</b> may control write (program), read, erasure, and background operations with regard to the memory device <b>110</b>. The background operation may include, for example, at least one among a garbage collection operation (GC), a wear leveling (WL) operation, and a bad block management (BBM) operation.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The memory controller <b>120</b> may control the operation of the memory device <b>110</b> at the request of a host.
