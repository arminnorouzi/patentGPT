end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to the field of confectionery items, and more particularly to a confectionery assembly more suited to purchase, storage, and transport for use in the outdoors or when traveling.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For many people, meals and eating in general are fundamental to the enjoyment of the outdoors. This could be a meal cooked over a campfire when backpacking, a snack on a hike, eating food at a picnic in the local park, or otherwise when outside and on the go.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While eating outdoors, many people enjoy desserts and sweet treats. One iconic dessert typically associated with the outdoors is a confectionery assembly consisting of a layered &#x201c;sandwich&#x201d; typically made by two outer graham crackers above and below, a layer of chocolate, and a layer or toasted, browned or otherwise warmed puffed sugary confection such as a marshmallow in-between the graham crackers and next to the chocolate. This confectionery assembly is commonly known as a &#x201c;s'more.&#x201d; In typical practice, a person warms one or more marshmallows using a stick or rod over the coals or flames of a fire, grill, stove, or other heat source. This warming softens the marshmallow considerably and can brown or caramelize the exterior. One or more pieces of chocolate are placed atop an appreciably flat cookie or biscuit such as a graham cracker. The toasted marshmallow is then placed on top of the piece or pieces of chocolate. A second cookie, biscuit, or graham cracker is then placed on top of the marshmallow (the stick or rod can be easily removed at this point by pulling gently). The warmed and/or browned marshmallow transfers some of its stored heat onto the chocolate which can soften or melt the chocolate somewhat. This layered assembly&#x2014;graham cracker, chocolate, marshmallow, graham cracker&#x2014;is then eaten and enjoyed. The process may be, and often is, repeated for additional s'mores and associated enjoyment. An alternate process is to assemble the s'more with the aforementioned layers, wrap the entire assembly in metal tin foil, and then place the assembly in or near a heat source to warm up. After the assembly is warmed up, the tin foil is removed and the s'more is eaten and enjoyed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While the final s'more is a desired and delicious sweet treat, there are some challenges with bringing it into fruition. Some of these challenges are as follows:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Component purchase: The user is typically required to purchase the components separately. While there are often outdoor and camping meals sold in stores that cater to outdoor activities, typically these stores do not stock the components required to make a s'more. Thus, in general practice the user must travel to a grocery store that sells the individual s'more items.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Larger than desired quantities: Marshmallows are generally sold in bags of larger quantities (e.g. 40 or 50 marshmallows), graham crackers are often sold in boxes of larger quantities (e.g. a box containing 30 graham crackers), and chocolate is often sold in larger bars. Even though a user may only desire to make a small number of s'mores on a trip, they typically must purchase the above larger quantities and then separate and re-package the smaller number of components they may need.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Transport: The user must figure out a means to safely transport the s'more components. The marshmallows are soft and compressible, and can be somewhat sticky, so typically they must be packed in a way to prevent crushing or sticking to other food items. Typical graham crackers are somewhat delicate and can be easily cracked, chipped, or broken. The user must preferably pack these in a way to keep them intact. Lastly, the chocolate pieces are subject to melting if taken outside into warmer weather, so the user ideally packs these separately so any melted chocolate will not escape from the packaging and get onto other food or non-food items.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Leftover components: Many people will only have the time or means to travel in the outdoors a small number of times each year. For example, a person may make one or two weekend backpacking trips where they may desire to have some s'mores. A typical person might enjoy 1&#x2dc;2 s'mores/night. So, for this person they may only require a small number of total s'mores&#x2014;perhaps 10 s'mores or less per year. However, as previously mentioned, the s'more components are most typically sold in larger quantities e.g. bags of 50 marshmallows, boxes of 30 graham crackers, etc. But if a user only needs to make a far smaller number of s'mores then they are left with leftover marshmallows, graham crackers, and chocolate. These can be stored for some time, but eventually the partially opened packages of marshmallows, graham crackers, and chocolate can and will go stale. For many people, items like marshmallows and graham crackers are only eaten in the outdoors and are rarely if ever eaten at home. Moreover, an open bag of marshmallows will typically slowly congeal into a large, sticky mass of marshmallows that are not as easily separated and used. In common experience, users will often be forced to discard partially-open larger packages of marshmallows, graham crackers, and chocolate that have gone stale or degraded in quality, which is expensive and wasteful. And when the user wants to make s'mores again they are often required to restart the entire process over&#x2014;travelling to a grocery store, purchasing the bulk packages of the various components, repackaging them for their trip, etc.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a consequence there is a need for a more convenient way to purchase and transport s'more components for ready enjoyment in the outdoors and otherwise.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is disclosed in this application a confectionery assembly for a &#x201c;s'more&#x201d; which avoids the disadvantages of current s'more component options, while affording additional structural and convenience advantages in one, integrated solution.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular, there is disclosed a confectionery assembly comprising: a stack of graham crackers, one or more pieces of chocolate (which may be subdivided), and two or more marshmallows. The relative geometry of each component is carefully selected such that a very compact arrangement of the components is possible. The components are then placed in this compact configuration into a semi-rigid packaging box or container that protects the components from damage.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention and the advantages thereof, may best be understood by reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a typical, generally cylindrical marshmallow.

For example, in the various embodiments, the marshmallows within a particular confectionery assembly are oriented the same and have the same geometry. It should be apparent that in other embodiments, these characteristics may be mixed and matched as desired for aesthetic or other reasons. For example, one marshmallow may be stood on its end, while an adjacent marshmallow may rest on its side. In either a lateral or longitudinal orientation; or adjacent marshmallows may be laid on their sides in different orientations (e.g., laterally and longitudinally respectively). In another example, marshmallows having different geometries may be provided. For example, one marshmallow may have a cylindrical geometry while its neighbor may have a rectilinear or elliptical geometry. Of course, a variety of other combinations may be used as well.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0102">Similarly, in embodiments that utilize multiple cracker stacks, the placement of the marshmallows relative to the stacks may be varied as well. For example, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b></figref>/<b>22</b> shows the marshmallows laterally arranged in a row laterally to the side of the cracker stacks. In other embodiments, the marshmallow may be positioned at one or both ends of the stacks, or in between the stacks. For example, two marshmallows could be placed at each end of the illustrated stack instead of laterally to the side of the stack as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b></figref>/<b>22</b>, or a 2/2 array of marshmallows could be placed at one end of the stack or between the stacks. Of course, other combinations may be used as well. Therefore, the present embodiments should be considered illustrative and not restrictive and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalents of the appended claims. The described confectionery assembly has a number of advantages relative to traditional methods of assembly and transporting s'mores. The described s'more assembly is more convenient, eliminates the need to purchase larger quantities of individual components, and is a compact form factor for easy and convenient packing and transport. The sizing of the components creates a small and efficient overall package and helps protect the contents from damage during transport.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">REFERENCE NUMERALS</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0103"></p><p id="p-0068" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="133pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>10</entry><entry>Confectionery assembly</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>12</entry><entry>Multiple confectionery assemblies</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>20</entry><entry>Cylindrical marshmallow</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>22</entry><entry>Rounded surface</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>24</entry><entry>Flat end</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>30</entry><entry>Chocolate bar</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>32</entry><entry>Fracture feature</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>40</entry><entry>Graham cracker or biscuit</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>42</entry><entry>Width face</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>44</entry><entry>Length face</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>50</entry><entry>Stack of crackers</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>60</entry><entry>Rectilinear marshmallow</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>62</entry><entry>Elliptical marshmallow</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>70</entry><entry>Containing box</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
