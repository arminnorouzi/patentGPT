More specifically, the present subject matter provides a cloth hat brim that sits atop the head of the user, facing to the back of the user, using an adjustable band that wraps around the front of a hat which has a forward-facing visor, such as the basic style known as a baseball cap, or other suitable hats.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The number one risk for skin cancer is sun exposure. The most recent statistics provided by the American Cancer Society&#xae;, the 2022 Cancer Facts and Figures, show that the number of new invasive melanoma cases diagnosed annually increased by 31% in the past decade (2012-2022). Studies have shown that <b>86</b>% of melanomas can be attributed to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. While exposure may start with a single event, the greater concern is for a long term exposure that elevates the risk. Spending time in the sun creates an ever-present adverse risk that must be addressed. The best way to help avoid this risk is to completely cover or shade the skin from the sun's UV rays.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are many choices of hats of various design to shield the eyes, ears, face, and neck of the wearer. A baseball-style cap is preferred by many, because of its excellent ability to shade the scalp and the eyes from the sun, and it is portable and tight-fitting on the user's head. But the problem with a baseball-style cap is that it lacks a brim on the sides and back and does not adequately protect the ears and neck from the sun. For cap wearers, the solutions that are currently available are adding flaps, drops, and drapes which are often unbecoming and ineffective. These solutions also do not allow for distance or air movement above the ears and neck. They also easily lift away from the wearer with wind so the shade is often lost. When moving fast as in a power boat, these solutions vibrate, ruffle, and slap the face and neck of the wearer. Further, these solutions are typically of a single thin layer of material which does not block UV effectively, and they are typically hot and block air flow.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A common problem faced by users wearing hats and other headgear is that hats and headgear often do not fit the user's head perfectly well. For example, some people have smaller or larger than average sized heads such that conventional hat sizes are too big or small, respectively. Also anyone who has lost a hat knows without a chinstrap in a wind or a fast moving situation the risk of loss often means removing the hat to keep a hold of it hence, even more sun exposure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a need exists for an adjustable brim which can be placed onto the head over a baseball-style cap that shields the ears and neck of the user while providing airflow thereto and that can be manipulated into different positions relative to the user's ears and neck, as described herein.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To meet the needs described above, the present application provides an adjustable brim that attaches to a baseball-style cap to provide additional shading around the user's neck and ears while allowing for airflow thereto. The adjustable brim provided herein includes a sheath that rests around the cap and a body that extends outwardly from the sheath to provide shade to the user's neck and ears. A tightening device such as a cord threaded through the sheath and a fastener on the tightening device enable the user to adjust the size of the sheath to fit securely about the hat.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the sheath includes a first portion or length onto which the brim body is attached and a second portion or length that is free from the body. During use, the second portion of the sheath is positioned atop the forward brim or visor of the baseball cap, and the brim body of the adjustable brim extends along the sides and back of the baseball cap. In some embodiments, the brim body and the sheath are sewn or otherwise secured together. In other embodiments, the body and the sheath are formed integrally.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The adjustable brim includes a loop or other connection mechanism at a location opposite the second portion of the sheath. While the second portion of the sheath rests atop the baseball cap brim, the loop may engage the back strap closure of the baseball cap brim visor so that the adjustable brim of the present application is secured to the user's baseball cap.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The adjustable brim may also include a pair of loops along the opposing sides of the sheath for receiving ends of a chin strap. In one embodiment, the chin strap extends below the user's chin and includes beads at opposite ends thereof that hold the ends of the chin strap in each loop. The chin strap may include a chin strap fastener at a midpoint along its length which enables the user to adjust the tightness of the chin strap against the chin. In other embodiments, the ends of the chin strap connect to the adjustable brim through snaps, Velcro&#xae;, a type of hook-and-loop fastener, or other securement means.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the cloth brim is pliable, such that it can be bent, folded, or rolled into a smaller size for portability. Once rolled, the tightening device can be wrapped or looped around the body of the brim and secured by the fastener. If preferred, a further fastener, such as a carabineer-type fastener, or any method of attachment may be used to attach to the portable brim to a pant loop, bag, or key chain for hands-free transport of the brim while it is not in use. This portability allows for a high frequency of use. Sun exposure for even short time periods such as walking through parking lots adds up significantly when done repeatedly on a daily basis over a lifetime, and portability increases the likelihood that a user would wear the adjustable brim, reducing UV exposure over time. Further, the adjustable brim of the present application is compatible with a variety of headwear designs and styles.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment, a brim for use with a baseball-style hat includes a sheath having a rounded shape for positioning around the hat and including a channel, a body, a tightening device, and a fastener. The body includes an inner edge, an outer edge opposite the inner edge, an outer surface, and an inner surface opposite the outer surface. The inner edge of the body is connected to an attachment edge of the sheath. The tightening device is positioned within the channel of the sheath, and the fastener is positioned on the tightening device for adjusting the size of the sheath. The sheath of the adjustable brim includes an opening through which a portion of the tightening device extends. The fastener is secured to the portion extending through the opening.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Additionally, in a preferred embodiment, the brim is constructed so that the brim body can be manipulated between a downward position and an upward position, in part or in whole, and retain its positioning, while the user is wearing the adjustable brim. As such, the user can selectively manipulate the brim body such that an outer portion of the body's inner surface faces outwardly, an outer portion of the body's outer surface faces inwardly toward the sheath, and the user's ear(s) and/or neck are selectively covered and uncovered.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, one or more loops are positioned on the inner surface of the body. In other embodiments, the sheath of the adjustable brim is integral with brim. The adjustable brim further comprising a chin strap, wherein the one or more loops includes a first and second chin strap loops for receiving first and second ends of the chin strap.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the examples will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following description and the accompanying drawings or may be learned by production or operation of the examples. The objects and advantages of the concepts may be realized and attained by means of the methodologies, instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The drawing figures depict one implementation in accord with the present concept, by way of example only, not by way of limitations.

The adjustable cloth brim <b>100</b> includes a sheath <b>104</b> that rests around the cap <b>102</b> and a brim body <b>106</b> extending outwardly from the sheath <b>104</b> to provide shade to the user's neck and ears. The adjustable brim <b>100</b> provides shade to the user's neck and ears while the front brim of the cap <b>102</b> provides shade to the user's face. A tightening device <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) threaded through the sheath <b>104</b> and a fastener <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) on the tightening device <b>110</b> enable the user to adjust the size of the sheath <b>104</b> to fit securely about the hat. In the embodiments illustrated herein, the adjustable brim <b>100</b> is positioned atop a baseball cap <b>102</b>; in other embodiments, the adjustable brim <b>100</b> is connected to the baseball cap <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the brim body <b>106</b> extends outwardly and downwardly from the sheath <b>104</b> in various configurations. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in one configuration, the brim body <b>106</b> extends such that it has an outward and downward body angle that allows airflow to the neck and ears of the user. More specifically, in this configuration, the body's inner surface <b>106</b><i>c </i>faces the user's ears and/or neck but is maintained in a position distanced therefrom. Additionally, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the body <b>106</b> is constructed (further detailed below) such that the user can selectively manipulate a portion or all of the body <b>106</b> as to achieve a different positioning of the brim body <b>106</b>. In this configuration, the body's inner surface <b>106</b><i>c </i>partially faces outwardly away from the user's neck and ears and the body's outer surface <b>106</b><i>b </i>partially faces inwardly toward the sheath <b>104</b> so as to expose the user's ears and/or neck. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows the same configuration from the rear. This view illustrates the body's inner surface <b>106</b><i>c </i>facing the exterior, while the body's outer surface <b>106</b><i>b </i>is parallel with the sheath <b>104</b> so as to face the sheath <b>104</b>. While only a portion of the brim body <b>106</b> is manipulated into an upward position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the entire length of the brim body <b>106</b> is manipulated into an upward position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the body <b>106</b> attaches to an attachment edge <b>128</b> of the sheath <b>104</b>, allowing the body <b>106</b> to project downwardly and outwardly from the sheath <b>104</b>. In order to position the body <b>106</b>, specifically an outer edge <b>106</b><i>d </i>thereof, maintained at a lofted position spaced from the user's ears and neck, the inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the body has a different curvature than a curvature of the attachment edge <b>128</b> of the sheath <b>104</b> such that the connection of the different curved edges causes tensioning of the brim body <b>106</b> into a first outward and downward position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The outer edge <b>106</b><i>d </i>of the body <b>106</b> also has a different curvature than the curvature of the attachment edge <b>128</b> of the sheath.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">More specifically, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, each of the inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the outer edge <b>106</b><i>d </i>of the body <b>106</b> has a parabolic shape when the body <b>106</b> is positioned along a planar surface. In contrast, the sheath <b>104</b> has an approximately circular shape when positioned along a planar surface. In turn, an attachment edge <b>128</b> of the sheath <b>104</b> has a circular curvature that does not match the parabolic shapes of the inner and outer edges <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>d</i>, seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The structure created by the parabolic curves of the inner and outer edges <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>d </i>and the inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>meeting on the sheath <b>104</b> is analogous to a flying buttress in architecture with a &#x201c;flyer&#x201d; or sloping beam supporting an outward load. With the adjustable brim <b>100</b> of the present application, the brim edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>joining the sheath <b>104</b> corresponds to the flyer, and rather than support by buttressing, the brim body <b>106</b> extends downwardly and outwardly into a lofted position and carries the weight of the fabric construction outwardly around the circumference of the brim, maintaining a certain amount of circumferential tension. By positioning on a cap in the sweatband region at or about where the brim-visor projects forward, the tension is transmitted through the sheath <b>104</b> around the forehead to form a complete circular structure supporting the lofted sideward-, backward-, and outward-extending brim body <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In still further embodiments, the inner and outer edges <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>d </i>may have non-parabolic curved shapes that are different from the generally circular shape of the attachment edge <b>128</b> of the sheath <b>104</b> such that connection of the inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>to the attachment edge <b>128</b> causes tensioning of the brim body <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the brim body <b>106</b> attaches to the sheath <b>104</b> such that the inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the attachment edge <b>128</b> are coupled along the plane P, and the curvature of the inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the body <b>106</b> conforms to match the approximately circular shape of the attachment edge <b>128</b> of the sheath <b>104</b>, which causes the inner and outer surfaces <b>106</b><i>b</i>, <b>106</b><i>c </i>of the body to become tensioned out of the plane P. This tensioning positions the outer edge <b>106</b><i>d </i>below the attachment edge <b>128</b> and corresponding plane P, yet supports the outer edge <b>106</b><i>d </i>in a lofted position spaced from the user's neck and ears, forming a truncated cone shape and allowing airflow between the user's neck and the brim body <b>106</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the outer edge <b>106</b><i>d </i>is positioned such that the inner and outer surfaces of the brim body <b>106</b> form an angle with the plane P of between 55 and 65 degrees.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">This tensioning created by the parabolic shapes of the inner and outer edges <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>d </i>allows for a fluidity of various brim shapes within the range of angles relative to the plane P. This fluidity of shapes can form stable contour variations as described and illustrated herein. In the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the parabolic shapes of the inner and outer edges <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>d </i>meet at first and second endpoints <b>130</b>, to define a crescent-like shape of the body <b>106</b>. The parabolic curvature can vary, as shown in the alternative embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Specifically, the shape of the outer edge <b>106</b><i>d </i>may vary to provide different sizes of the body <b>106</b>, ranging from short to long, of the adjustable brim <b>100</b> conforming to the functional needs of the user to effectively make a wider brimmed hat. Additionally, instead of a full 360 degrees of brim offered by conventional brims, the adjustable brim of the present application has an approximately 270 degree span. Conventional brims spanning the full 360 degrees are generally difficult to hold shape and do not allow for adjustability between varying brim shapes.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>may connect to the attachment edge <b>128</b> through stitching, sewing, or any other suitable means.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, the brim body <b>106</b> is constructed so that it is sufficiently rigid to hold its shape, but also pliable enough to be configurable by the user to be manipulated and positioned to adjust the location of the shading, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b></figref>. The parabolic shapes of the inner and outer edges <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>d </i>of the brim body <b>106</b> combined with the conforming of the parabolic shapes to a circular curvature of the attachment edge of the sheath <b>104</b> provide tensioning that enables the user to manipulate the outer edge <b>106</b><i>d </i>upwardly from the first downward position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to a second upward position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The adjustable brim of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> include a portion adjacent to the user's left ear in the downward position and a portion adjacent to the user's right ear in the upward position. The curved upward position of the brim <b>106</b> provides a lateral curvature between the inner and outer edges <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>d</i>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. This lateral curvature may define an additional parabolic shape in some embodiments. In other embodiments, the lateral curvature may define a radius of curvature of approximately 0.25 in. In still further embodiments, the inner and outer surfaces <b>106</b><i>c</i>, <b>106</b><i>d </i>of the brim body <b>106</b> can be manipulated to allow a downward projection of 55 degrees from the plane P before curving upwardly towards the outer edge <b>106</b><i>d </i>with a radius of curvature of 1.25 in, forming a valley. The parabolic shapes of the inner and outer edges <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>d </i>of the brim body combined with the conforming of the parabolic shapes to a circular curvature of the attachment edge of the sheath <b>104</b> provide tensioning that enables the user to modify the shape of the brim during use, manipulating portions of or the entire length of the brim fluidly between various shapes and angles to provide various amounts of shade, airflow, and streamlined styles.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, the brim body <b>106</b> may be manipulated such that only a portion of the length of the brim <b>106</b> is manipulated into the second upward position. The brim <b>106</b> may also be manipulated so that two portions of the brim <b>106</b> are manipulated into the upward position while a third portion separating the two upward portions is positioned in the first downward position, or two portions are manipulated into the downward position while a third portion separating to the two downward portions is positioned upwardly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate a first portion of the brim <b>106</b> in the upward position while a second portion of the brim <b>106</b> is in the downward position, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the entire length of the brim <b>106</b> in the upward position. In comparison to hat shade devices having a drape or flap, such devices have no ability to be positioned upwardly but instead fall at angles sometimes exceeding a 90 degree angle and/or flapping uncomfortably in the wind against the user's neck and ears.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The brim body <b>106</b>, or a portion thereof, may be configured to be manipulated or positioned upwardly along a line generally aligned with one of the inner edge or outer edge. In the positioning illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the user's right ear and neck may be exposed to sunlight and/or increased air flow in breezy conditions compared to the user's left ear and neck that remains protected by the downwardly positioned portion of the brim body <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the brim body <b>106</b> includes a first layer of material for the inner surface <b>106</b><i>c </i>and a second layer of material for the outer surface <b>106</b><i>d</i>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second layers of material are sewn together along the inner and outer surfaces and also through a plurality of stitch lines. Each line of stitching is parallel to the outer edge, and the plurality of stitch lines spans the inner and outer edges to cover the surfaces thereof. Brim binding is another technique that could be combined with stitching around the brim to increase stiffness, holding the brim shape. It should be noted that additional factors, like stitching patterns and thread thicknesses used, can also play a factor in achieving the desired construction of the body <b>106</b>. In alternate embodiments, the body <b>106</b> can include, for example, a middle layer (not shown here) that adds additional rigidity and/or pliability. Any suitable material may be used for the construction of the brim body <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The brim body <b>106</b> and the sheath <b>104</b> are sufficiently ductile and malleable in their ability to sustain a large, semi-permanent deformation under varying shape molding tensile and compressive manipulations. Ductility refers to the physical property of being pulled or molded into a new form and being able to be flexible, loose, and yielding as a result of being able to be stretched and shaped easily. Malleability is a measure of a material deformation under compressive stress. This ductility and malleability is key to the usable functionality in this invention. While fabrics are not considered brittle as with brim-visors, fabrics may kink, bend, and fold without malleability or ductility. Examples of fabric without malleability or ductility are drops, drapes and flaps. With a few calculated rows of stitching and a measured fabric construction including warp and weft orientations or combinations of material types, the adjustable brim <b>100</b> maximizes for ductility and malleability, enabling shapes that are both fashionable and have multifold functionality. Any suitable fabric material may be used.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the body <b>106</b> has an arcuate shape with an inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>that, when attached to the sheath <b>104</b>, extends along a portion <b>107</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) of the attachment edge <b>128</b> of the sheath <b>104</b>. The body <b>106</b> includes inner and outer surfaces <b>106</b><i>c</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>extending between the inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>and an outer edge <b>106</b><i>d </i>opposite thereof. In addition to the arcuate, crescent-like shape shown in the illustrated embodiment, the spatial relationship between the inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the outer edge <b>106</b><i>d </i>may form a shape that is oval, square, or any other shape that effectively covers the neck and ears of the user from an overhead perspective.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The sheath <b>104</b> has an approximately circular shape with an inner channel <b>105</b> that extends around the hat <b>102</b> of the user and is adjustable in size to fit about the cap <b>102</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the sheath <b>104</b> comprises a single panel of material including first and second edges <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>b </i>sewn together to form the channel <b>105</b>. The inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the body <b>106</b> is sewn between at least a portion <b>107</b> of the first and second edges <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>b </i>of the sheath <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, the sheath <b>104</b> may be formed integrally with the body <b>106</b> by attaching a portion of the inner edge <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the body <b>106</b> onto itself to form the channel <b>105</b>. In still further embodiments, the sheath <b>104</b> may comprise two or more panels of material secured to the body <b>106</b>. The sheath <b>104</b> may attached to the body <b>106</b> using a stitch or other suitable method.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the sheath <b>104</b> includes the first portion <b>107</b> along with the inner edge of the body <b>106</b> extends and a second portion <b>109</b> that is not attached to the body <b>106</b>. During use, the second portion <b>109</b> of the sheath <b>104</b> rests against the front brim <b>100</b> of the ball cap <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. By providing the portion <b>109</b> of the sheath <b>104</b> that is free from the body <b>106</b>, the adjustable brim <b>100</b> may be rotated, or adjusted on a rotational axis around the baseball cap or user's head, so that the user can adjust which area of the user's body receives shade and which area of the user's body receives sunlight. This is advantageous, for example, in watching sporting events or when working with the sun in a position shining into the eyes of the wearer beyond the shade provided by a standard brim-visor. Thus, in addition to using the brim-visor symmetrically placed on a cap, it can be positioned asymmetrically in an off-center position relative to the face, to screen or block direct sun when and where needed.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the channel <b>105</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>) may extend within only the first portion <b>107</b> of the sheath <b>104</b> and the second portion <b>109</b> of the sheath <b>104</b> may include additional and/or different material such a fabric insert comprising relatively more resilient material. In still further embodiments, the second portion <b>109</b> of the sheath may have a narrow thickness so as to minimize interference with the logo or other information on the front of the baseball cap <b>102</b>. While portability allows for a high frequency of use as mentioned above, ensuring that the logo and other information on the front of the baseball cap <b>102</b> is accommodated is also important to increase the likelihood of use. The second portion <b>109</b> conforms to the spherical shape of the user's forehead or baseball cap, which enables the adjustable brim <b>100</b> to remain in place on the uesr's head without slipping towards the crown of the user. In other embodiments, the body <b>106</b> may extend along the full length of the sheath <b>104</b> and overlap the brim <b>100</b> of the ball cap <b>102</b> as needed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The tightening device <b>110</b> is positioned within the sheath <b>104</b> to allow for adjustment of the brim <b>100</b> about the user's cap <b>102</b> or head.

The adjustable brim <b>100</b> described herein is meant to be used with both hats and caps with or without a visor or brim portion. For example, the adjustable brim <b>100</b> may be used with brimless hats and crownless visor caps when the user experiences circumstances of sun or the elements (such as rain, hail, sleet, snow or fog). While the adjustable brim <b>100</b> may be used as a sun effect mitigation strategy providing ventilated and fully adjustable shade interventions, the adjustable brim <b>100</b> can also be used to provide warmth, shed rain, blunt the wind's force, hold in body heat, and/or protect the head, face, and neck regions from the cold. In these latter situations or conditions, the adjustable brim <b>100</b> would be used to blunt the negative effects of a wide range of potentially adverse exposures when the user is exposed to sun or the elements (such as rain, hail, sleet, snow or fog). Because the adjustable brim <b>100</b> can be constructed with outer fabric of a type that can be considered camouflaged for one environment or another, the functionality may go beyond protection from the elements but as an extension of the activity in which the user, such as hunters, fishermen, warriors, etc. are participating, and which in some cases may take precedence over the environment condition being mitigated against.
