For example, WO 2018/015293 A1 discloses a stator for an axial flux machine having a stator portion formed of a plurality of sheets and provided with teeth.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further background of the art is known, for example, from WO 2014/166811 A2, which discloses a lightweight axial flux machine in which a plurality of stator teeth are connected to one another in end regions via a respective ring structure and to a housing surrounding the stator radially on the outside. Consequently, it is already known to construct stator cores by means of sheets which are arranged laterally to the stator cores in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, a disadvantage of these designs known from the background of the art has been that the mechanical fixation of the stator cores is often inadequate. Furthermore, the existing magnetic resistance in the required directions is often still relatively large. Also, eddy currents can form in the magnetic core due to the alternating currents in the windings as well as the magnetic fields from the rotor. At the same time, there is a requirement for these systems to efficiently cool the stator windings and stator cores.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore the object of the present disclosure to remedy the disadvantages known from the background of the art and, in particular, to provide an axial flux machine with a stator core that is as stable as possible, wherein at the same time the magnetic resistance is reduced in the required directions and undesirable eddy currents are avoided. At the same time, efficient cooling of the components of the stator is to be implemented.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the disclosure, this is achieved in that at least one stator core has a plurality of (magnetically conductive) guide segments which are stacked (or, layered) on top of one another in the circumferential direction, extend radially and are of plate-like (or, flat) design, wherein at least a partial quantity of the guide segments has a retaining contour on its radial outer side and/or its radial inner side which is received in an interlocking manner on at least one supporting region which is fixed to the housing (or fixed at the installation location).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This results in several advantages. On the one hand, the radially extending guide segments (preferably designed as sheet metal segments) ensure high mechanical strength against forces in the circumferential direction. This extension of the guide segments simultaneously enables good heat transfer within the guide segments to the outside (preferably towards the fixation). In addition, the radial arrangement of the guide segments achieves a high pole pitch (which is particularly advantageous for high torques). The retaining contours on the guide segments simplify the fixation of the stator core.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further advantageous embodiments are claimed and explained in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">If the guide segments of the at least one stator core are designed as identical parts, series production is possible in a particularly economical manner.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the multiple stator cores are designed the same. In further embodiments, it is also advantageous if the stator cores are designed differently at least with regard to the retaining contours.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is also advantageous if the guide segments of the at least one stator core are connected on the radial outer side to two axially spaced, first supporting regions and/or on the radial inner side to two axially spaced, second supporting regions in an interlocking manner. This makes the structural design of the stator even more robust.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The at least one supporting region is preferably annular/designed as a retaining ring.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is particularly expedient if the guide segments of the at least one stator core are secured in the circumferential direction (of the axis of rotation), radial direction (of the axis of rotation), axial direction (of the axis of rotation) and/or against tilting about an axis parallel to the axis of rotation via an interlock relative to the at least one supporting region.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">To implement the interlocking connection between the guide segments and the at least one supporting region, it has proven to be expedient to provide an axially projecting retaining tab on the at least one supporting region, which projects into an undercut which co-forms the retaining contour and is open in the axial direction to the at least one supporting region. The retaining tab is therefore preferably inserted into the retaining contour in such a manner that the guide segments are supported on the supporting region both in the radial and axial directions and against tilting about an axis parallel to the axis of rotation of the rotors. The force acting on the stator cores tangential to the axis of rotation, together with the support, causes a torque on the individual stator core.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">For robust circumferential support of the guide segments, it has also proved advantageous if the at least one supporting region has two axially projecting supporting tabs spaced apart in the circumferential direction. between which supporting tabs the guide segments of the respective stator core are accommodated together.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The magnetic resistance is further reduced if the at least one stator core is provided with a covering section consisting of a soft-magnetic composite material towards one circumferential side or towards both circumferential sides of the totality of guide segments.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further preferably, an electrical insulation is provided between the individual stator cores themselves and/or between the individual stator cores and the at least one supporting region. In the latter case, it is also advantageous if either the insulation is inserted between the guide segments/a package formed by the guide segments and a fixation, or fixation elements are formed directly from electrically non-conductive material.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this context, it is further expedient if the at least one stator core tapers inward in the radial direction (reduction of the width/extension in the circumferential direction).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, it is advantageous if the at least one stator core comprises several groups of guide segments, which groups differ from one another by the formation of their guide segments.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this context, it has been found to be particularly expedient if the at least one stator core has, in addition to a first group with a plurality of first guide segments which are designed to be identical to one another, a second group with a plurality of second guide segments, wherein the second guide segments have a shorter radial extension than the first guide segments and are arranged stacked towards a first circumferential side of the first group of first guide segments. This further reduces the magnetic resistance.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this respect, it is also expedient if, in addition to the second group with a plurality of second guide segments, a third group with a plurality of third guide segments is arranged on a second circumferential side, facing away from the first circumferential side, of the totality of first guide segments, wherein the third guide segments have a shorter radial extension than the first guide segments.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">If the at least one stator core is divided into two halves in the axial direction, the assembly of the stator cores and the entire stator is further facilitated. In a further preferred embodiment, the stator core is, in turn, formed as a single piece/undivided and, on the other hand, the covering section then present (further preferably the two covering sections present in each case) is divided/halved. This provides the advantage that the windings can be manufactured independently of the stator core and then united.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, it is expedient if each stator core is provided with a stator winding, wherein this stator winding forms several axially adjacent winding loops and the respective winding loop narrows inwardly in the radial direction with respect to its circumferential side width.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In other words, according to the disclosure, a mechanical fixation of the stator cores for an axial flux machine is implemented with radially extending electrical sheets (guide segments). The sheets have a contour radially outside and/or radially inside which allows the stator cores to be fixed in an interlocking manner. Optionally, the stator core is covered with an SMC material (SMC=&#x201c;Soft Magnetic Composite&#x201d;) in the circumferential direction.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The disclosure will now be explained in more detail below with reference to various figures, in which context various exemplary embodiments are also shown.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the figures:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an axial flux machine according to the disclosure, cut in the longitudinal direction according to a first exemplary embodiment, wherein its construction can be clearly seen,</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a detail view of the axial flux machine according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a longitudinal section, in a radial outer area of a stator core co-forming a stator to illustrate its interlocking reception on two retaining rings,</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an assembly of the stator core with a stator winding surrounding it,</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the stator core in full view to its radial outer side,</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a view of the stator core from its front side,</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a first sheet metal segment inserted in the stator core,</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a front view of the first sheet metal segment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a partial assembly of the stator in a longitudinal section, wherein a plurality of stator cores distributed in the circumferential direction with two axially spaced retaining rings can be seen from a radial outer side without stator windings,</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the stator core, similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, with the orientation implemented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a circumferential area of a retaining ring receiving the stator cores, showing the retaining and supporting tabs forming the interlock,</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows an exploded view of the partial assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an assembly of stator core and stator winding designed according to a second exemplary embodiment, wherein the stator core has different sheet metal segment groups,</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an assembly of stator core and stator winding designed according to a third exemplary embodiment, wherein two covering sections consisting of SMC material are even dispensed with compared to the second exemplary embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a coil arrangement of the stator, wherein a plurality of stator cores wound with coil windings are arranged in a row in the circumferential direction,</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows a detailed perspective view of the coil arrangement in the radial outer region of three adjacent stator cores,</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows a front view of the entire coil arrangement according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows a perspective exploded view of a subassembly consisting of a stator core and stator winding according to a fourth exemplary embodiment, wherein the stator core is divided into two axial halves,</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows a perspective, partially exploded view of a stator having a plurality of subassemblies according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, wherein each half of a stator core is fixed to one of two outer retaining rings;

In its preferred application, the axial flux machine <b>1</b> is used in the drive of a motor vehicle. Accordingly, the corresponding motor vehicle is implemented either as a purely electric motor vehicle or a hybrid motor vehicle.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The directional information used below, as can be seen in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, refer to a central axis of rotation <b>3</b> of both rotor elements <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the axial flux machine <b>1</b>. Accordingly, an axial direction is a direction along/parallel to the axis of rotation <b>3</b>, a radial direction is a direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation <b>3</b>, and a circumferential direction is a direction along a circular line of constant diameter extending coaxially around the axis of rotation <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to the construction of an axial flux machine <b>1</b>, it has a substantially annular stator <b>2</b> that rotates completely in the circumferential direction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Of course, individual stator teeth <b>6</b> could also be left out of the composite of the stator <b>2</b>. It can be seen that the stator <b>2</b> has a thickness (axial extension) that is less than its radial extension (radial height/thickness).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition to the stator <b>2</b>, the two rotor elements <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>are part of the axial flux machine <b>1</b>, as already mentioned. A first rotor element <b>4</b><i>a </i>is arranged towards a first (axial) end face <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the stator <b>2</b>. A second (axial) end face <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the stator <b>2</b>, facing away axially from the first end face <b>5</b><i>a</i>, is provided with a second rotor element <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The rotor elements <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>are each implemented in essentially the same manner. Both rotor elements <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>each have a disk-shaped main body <b>23</b> and a plurality of magnets <b>24</b> (permanent magnets) distributed in the circumferential direction, which magnets <b>24</b> are arranged on an axial side of the rotor elements <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>facing the stator <b>2</b>. The rotor elements <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>can also be constructed differently; e.g., radially extending between magnetic flux guide elements shaped similar to a piece of pie. The rotor elements <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>are mounted rotatably relative to the stator <b>2</b> about the axis of rotation <b>3</b> in a typical manner.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an overall consideration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>5</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the stator <b>2</b> is equipped with a plurality of stator cores <b>6</b> distributed in a circumferential direction of the axis of rotation <b>3</b>. The stator cores <b>6</b> are each implemented as identical parts to one another. Each stator core <b>6</b> serves to accommodate a stator winding <b>21</b>, which has several winding loops <b>22</b> arranged side by side in the axial direction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). Stator core <b>6</b> and stator winding <b>21</b> typically form a stator coil <b>25</b>/coil arrangement. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> to <b>16</b></figref>, the stator coils <b>25</b> are arranged uniformly and contiguously distributed in the circumferential direction. The stator coils <b>25</b> taper in the radial direction toward their inner side. Each stator coil <b>25</b>, i.e. each stator core <b>6</b> and each stator winding <b>21</b> thus has an extension as seen along its radial extension, reducing in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an overall consideration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>7</b></figref>, it can also be seen that each stator core <b>6</b> has several first guide segments <b>7</b> designed as sheet metal segments, which is why these first guide segments <b>7</b> are referred to below as first sheet metal segments <b>7</b>. According to the disclosure, each stator core <b>6</b> has several first sheet metal segments <b>7</b> aligned/extending in the radial direction of the axis of rotation <b>3</b>. Each first sheet metal segment <b>7</b>, in turn, extends along the entire radial length of the stator cores <b>6</b> or even directly co-forms the radial ends of the stator core <b>6</b>. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, a first sheet metal segment <b>7</b> is shown as an example. Several first sheet metal segments <b>7</b> are stacked on top of one another in the circumferential direction to form a laminated core and are electrically insulated from one another in such a manner that only minimal eddy currents are generated due to the changing magnetic fields, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and are each insulated from one another in a typical manner by means of an intermediate insulation layer which is not shown further here for the sake of clarity.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The first sheet metal segments <b>7</b> are provided with a retaining contour <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>both towards their radial outer side <b>8</b> and towards their radial inner side <b>9</b>, which retaining contours <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>are each connected in an interlocking manner to a supporting region in the form of a retaining ring <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> of the stator <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The first sheet metal segments <b>7</b> are all implemented as identical parts and each have the designated retaining contour <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). Each retaining contour <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>is formed by a radial extension which forms two undercuts <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>towards its axial sides. A first retaining contour <b>10</b><i>a </i>is formed to a radial outer side <b>8</b> of the stator core <b>6</b>; a second retaining contour <b>10</b><i>b </i>is formed to a radial inner side <b>9</b> of the stator core <b>6</b>.
