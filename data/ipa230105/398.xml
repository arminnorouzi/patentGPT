laparoscopic medical device includes an oximeter sensor at its tip, which allows the making of oxygen saturation measurements laparoscopically. The device can be a unitary design, wherein a laparoscopic element includes electronics for the oximeter sensor at a distal end (e.g., opposite the tip). The device can be a multiple piece design (e.g., two-piece design), where some electronics is in a separate housing from the laparoscopic element, and the pieces (or portions) are removably connected together. The laparoscopic element can be removed and disposed of; so, the electronics can be reused multiple times with replacement laparoscopic elements. The electronics can include a processing unit for control, computation, or display, or any combination of these. However, in an implementation, the electronics can connect wirelessly to other electronics (e.g., another processing unit) for further control, computation, or display, or any combination of these.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="136.74mm" wi="137.08mm" file="US20230000399A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image"

More specifically, the invention relates to optical probes, such as oximeters, that include source structures and detector structures on a tip of a laparoscopic probe.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Oximeters are medical devices used to measure oxygen saturation of tissue in humans and living things for various purposes. For example, oximeters are used for medical and diagnostic purposes in hospitals and other medical facilities (e.g., surgery, patient monitoring, or ambulance or other mobile monitoring for, e.g., hypoxia); sports and athletics purposes at a sports arena (e.g., professional athlete monitoring); personal or at-home monitoring of individuals (e.g., general health monitoring, or person training for a marathon); and veterinary purposes (e.g., animal monitoring).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Pulse oximeters and tissue oximeters are two types of oximeters that operate on different principles. A pulse oximeter uses a pulse to make measurements. A pulse oximeter typically measures the absorbance of light due to pulsing arterial blood. In contrast, a tissue oximeter does not need a pulse in order to function, and can be used to make oxygen saturation measurements of a tissue flap that has been disconnected from a blood supply or of tissue, such as internal organs that are connected to a blood supply.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Human tissue, as an example, includes a variety of light-absorbing molecules. Such chromophores include oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, melanin, water, lipid, and cytochrome. Oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, and melanin are the most dominant chromophores in tissue for much of the visible and near-infrared spectral range. Light absorption differs significantly for oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins at certain wavelengths of light. Tissue oximeters can measure oxygen levels in human tissue by exploiting these light-absorption differences.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Despite the success of existing oximeters, there is a continuing desire to improve oximeters by, for example, improving form factor; improving measurement accuracy; reducing measurement time; lowering cost; reducing size, weight, or form factor; reducing power consumption; and for other reasons, and any combination of these measurements.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, assessing a patient's oxygenation state, at both the regional and local level, is important as it is an indicator of the state of the patient's local tissue health. Thus, oximeters are often used in clinical settings, such as during surgery and recovery, where it may be suspected that the patient's tissue oxygenation state is unstable. For example, during surgery, oximeters should be able to quickly deliver accurate oxygen saturation measurements under a variety of nonideal conditions. While existing oximeters have been sufficient for postoperative tissue monitoring where absolute accuracy is not critical and trending data alone is sufficient, accuracy is, however, important during surgery in which spot-checking can be used to determine whether tissue might remain viable or needs to be removed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, there is a need for improved tissue oximeter probes and methods of making measurements using these probes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A laparoscopic medical device includes an oximeter sensor at its tip, which allows the making of oxygen saturation measurements laparoscopically. The device can be a unitary design, wherein a laparoscopic element includes electronics for the oximeter sensor at a distal end (e.g., opposite the tip). The device can be a multiple piece design (e.g., two-piece design), where some electronics is in a separate housing from the laparoscopic element, and the pieces (or portions) are removably connected together. The laparoscopic element can be removed and disposed of; so, the electronics can be reused multiple times with replacement laparoscopic elements. The electronics can include a processing unit for control, computation, or display, or any combination of these. However, in an implementation, the electronics can connect wirelessly to other electronics (e.g., another processing unit) for further control, computation, or display, or any combination of these.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an implementation, an oximeter probe utilizes a sensor head positioned at a tip of an attached laparoscopic element to make oximetry measurements of a patient's internal tissue that is under investigation. The probe can use sensor head position on the laparoscopic element in combination with a relatively large number of simulated reflectance curves to quickly determine the optical properties of such internal tissue under investigation. The optical properties of the tissue allow for the further determination of the oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations of the tissue as well as the oxygen saturation of the tissue.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an implementation, a method includes forming a first portion and a second portion of an oximeter device. The first portion and second portions can be removably connected in a fixed configuration. An elongated laparoscopic element of the first portion is formed and extends in a first direction. A proximal end of the laparoscopic element is positioned in the first direction from a distal end of the laparoscopic element.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An outer surface of the laparoscopic element is smooth such that movement of the element in a trocar and tissue is smooth without catching on the trocar and without abrading the tissue.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An interior tubular space of the laparoscopic element is formed in the space where the space extends from the proximal end to the distal end and extends from a first opening at the proximal end of the laparoscopic element to a second opening at the distal end of the laparoscopic element. The space has a first cross-section that is transverse to the first direction and the first cross-section has a first length.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A sensor head is positioned in the second opening of interior tubular space at the distal end of the laparoscopic element. A first structure and a second structure are formed in the of the sensor head where the first structure is an emitter and the second structure is a detector.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A first enclosure of the second portion is formed to have a second cross-section transverse to the first direction. The first enclosure has a second cross-section that is transverse to the first direction. The second cross-section has a second length that is larger than the first length.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first enclosure of the second portion of the oximeter device is connected to the first portion of the oximeter device at the distal end of the laparoscopic element. In an implementation, the connection is a removealbe connection facilitating the removal and replacement of the laparoscopic element after the laparoscopic element is sterilized for reuse or is replaceable with another laparoscopic element. Each of the first enclosure and the laparoscopic elements can have couplers that facilitate the connecting and disconnecting.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An analog-to-digital converter circuit is positioned in the first enclosure of the second structure and is electrically connected the analog-to-digital converter circuit to the sensor head. An interface circuit is connected to the analog-to-digital converter circuit and a battery is connected to the analog-to-digital converter and the interface circuit.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an implementation, a method includes connecting a first elongated laparoscopic element and a first enclosure to form an oximeter device. The first elongated laparoscopic element extends in a first direction and includes a first proximal end and a first distal end.

The second elongated laparoscopic element and the first enclosure form a second oximeter device. The first and second elongated laparoscopic elements are different laparoscopic elements.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an implementation, a method includes providing an oximeter probe that includes a sensor head that has a first structure and a second structure. The first structure is an emitter and the second structure is a detector. The oximeter probe includes a first processing circuit, a first display, and a first transceiver where the first processing circuit is connected to the first display and the first transceiver.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The oximeter probe is connected to a system to a system unit where the system unit includes a second transceiver and a second processing unit. The system unit is separate from the oximeter probe. The second transceiver communicates with the first transceiver through a direct communication connection.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The detector receives light and converts the light into electrical signal information.

In another implementation, the first oximeter information and the second oximeter information are different oximeter information.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A system includes a first portion that includes an elongated laparoscopic element where the laparoscopic element extends in a first direction and includes a proximal end and a distal end. The proximal and distal ends are opposite the proximal end.

An oximeter probe is applicable to many areas of medicine and surgery including abdominal surgery, plastic surgery, breast reconstruction, and other surgeries. The oximeter probe can make oxygen saturation measurements of tissue where there is no pulse and where there is a pulse. In an implementation, the oximeter probe is a pulse oximeter. In contrast to a tissue oximeter probe, a pulse oximeter uses a pulse in order to make measurements.

Using the detector, light is received and converted into electrical signal information. The electrical signal information on the received light is converted into digital signal information. Using the first wireless transceiver, the digital signal information is transmitted over the direct wireless connection.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The method can further include using the second wireless transceiver, receiving the digital signal information from the oximeter probe. The digital signal information is processed using a processing circuit of the system unit to obtain an oxygen saturation value. The oxygen saturation value is displayed on a display (e.g., LCD or OLED panel) of the system unit.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will

idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an image of an oximeter probe <b>101</b> in an implementation. Oximeter probe <b>101</b> is configured to make tissue oximetry measurements of tissue, such as internal tissue, intraoperatively. Oximeter probe <b>101</b> may be a handheld device that includes a probe unit <b>105</b> and a laparoscopic element <b>108</b> extending from the probe unit. A sensor head is positioned at a tip <b>110</b> of the laparoscopic element. The oximeter probe can include one or more user-input devices, such as one or more buttons <b>119</b>. In some implementations, the display is a user-input device and includes a touch pad.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Oximeter probe <b>101</b> is configured to measure the oxygen saturation of internal tissue intraoperatively by positioning the laparoscopic element in a patient's body cavity and by emitting light, such as near-infrared light, from probe tip <b>110</b> into the tissue. Thereafter, the light reflected from the internal tissue is collected by the probe tip for determining the oxygen saturation of the tissue. Oximeter probe <b>101</b> includes a display <b>115</b> or other notification device that notifies a user of the oxygen saturation information for oximeter measurements made by the oximeter probe.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Oximeter probe <b>101</b> is a handheld device that can be held in the hand of medical provider for use. The probe unit is adapted to be held while the laparoscopic element is positioned in a patient's body cavity. The patient can be a human patient or animal patient in a veterinary medical environment. The probe unit and the laparoscopic element can be separable or not separable. In an implementation were the probe unit and the laparoscopic element are not separable, the oximeter probe may be a disposable device. Alternatively, where the probe unit and the laparoscopic element are separable, the probe unit may be reusable and the laparoscopic element may be disposable or the laparoscopic element might be adapted to be sterilized for subsequent reuse.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The laparoscopic element can be removably connected to the probe unit by one or more connector devices. For example, the laparoscopic element can include a twist lock device that is adapted to twist lock the laparoscopic element to the probe unit. Alternatively, the laparoscopic element can be pressed into contact with the probe unit and latched into place via a latch, a setscrew, a rotatable collar that pulls the laparoscopic element into contact with the probe unit, or other device. The laparoscopic element and probe unit can include one or more registration elements (e.g., slots and grooves) that facilitate registration and connection of electrical connectors and registration and connecting of light guides (e.g., sometimes referred to as waveguides), such as optical fibers, or both.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an oximeter probe <b>201</b> that is adapted to communicate with a display <b>215</b> (sometimes referred to as a system unit). Oximeter probe <b>201</b> can be similar to oximeter probe <b>101</b> described above where the laparoscopic element can be separable or not separable from the probe unit. The oximeter probe may be disposable if the probe unit and laparoscopic element are not separable, or the probe unit may be reusable and the laparoscopic element may be disposable if the probe unit and laparoscopic element are separable. Alternatively, the laparoscopic element can be adapted to be sterilized (e.g., by autoclaving) for reuse with the probe unit from which the laparoscopic element was detached or with a different probe unit.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Display <b>215</b> is adapted to display information for oxygen saturation measurements generated by the oximeter probe and transmitted to the display from the probe. Oximeter probe <b>201</b> and display <b>215</b> may be adapted to communicate via wired (e.g., cable) communication or wireless communication. The communication link can operate according to one of a variety of protocols, such as one of the Bluetooth protocols (e.g., Bluetooth, Bluetooth SMART, Bluetooth Low Energy, others), one of the IEEE 802.11 protocols, ANT, 6LoWPAN, MyriaNed, EnOcean, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, one of the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, such as ZigBee, or others. These or other wireless protocols can be used by the device to transfer data from the device to the display at 0.5 kilohertz to 500 kilohertz, such as approximately 250 kilohertz. Data transfer from the display to the device can be at similar rates.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The wireless link between the oximeter probe and the display is a direct wireless connection in an implementation. That is, no intermediary transmitter circuits, receiver circuits, or transceiver circuits receive the wireless signal transmitted from the oximeter probe for subsequent for retransmission of the wireless signal to the display. Similarly, no intermediary transmitter circuits, receiver circuits, or transceiver circuits receive the wireless signal transmitted from the display for subsequent for retransmission of the wireless signal to the oximeter probe.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an implementation where the oximeter probe is adapted to communicate with display <b>215</b> for the display of information for oxygen saturation measurements, the probe may not include a display, such as display <b>115</b>. In this implementation, display <b>215</b> operates as the display for the probe. Alternatively, the oximeter probe may include display <b>115</b> and may be adapted to communicate with display <b>215</b> where the two displays may display the same, different, or complementary oximetry information.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Display <b>215</b> can be a tablet computer or other display type, such as a display that is included in a laparoscopic tower used with other laparoscopic devices used during a laparoscopic surgery. In an implementation where the display is a tablet computer, the display can be attached to a laparoscopic tower that might include other displays and other medical devices. The display can operate an Android mobile operating system or other operating system adapted for use with mobile devices.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Display <b>215</b> can store and operate one or more computer applications adapted for receiving information for oximeter measurements generated by the oximeter probe. The display, via the application, can process the information and display the information or a derivative of the information. For example, the oximeter probe can transmit information (e.g., a value) for blood oxygen saturation (StO2), the percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2), the percentage of deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), the blood volume, the melanin concentration, or other oximetry information. The display can display one or more pieces of information for these values, such as the values themselves or derivatives of the values.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Alternatively, the oximeter probe can transmit substantially raw measurement data in digital or analog form to the display. Substantially raw measurement data includes data that has not been processed by the processor or any preprocessors. The substantially raw measurement data can be analog detector responses generated by the detectors that may or may not be conditioned, amplified, or both. The substantially raw measurement data can be digitized detector responses that are digitized by the oximeter probe via an analog-to-digital convertor housed within the oximeter probe. The display, via use of the application, can perform data processing on the raw measurement data to generate final measurement information for the tissue, such as a value for blood oxygen saturation (StO2), a value for the percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2), a value for the percentage of deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), blood volume, melanin concentration, or other value. The display, via the application, can display one or more pieces of the oximetry information.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Alternatively, the oximeter probe can transmit partially processed measurement data to the display. Partially processed data can include data for which one or more calibration corrections have been made for intensity difference of light emitted by the LEDs, inherent sensitivity differences of the photodetectors, or both. The display, via use of the application, can perform data processing on the partially processed data to generate final measurement information for the tissue, such as a value for blood oxygen saturation (StO2), a value for the percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2), a value for the percentage of deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), blood volume, melanin concentration, or other value. The display, via the application, can display one or more pieces of the oximetry information.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The following U.S. patent applications are incorporated by reference along with all other references cited in this application Ser.

In an implementation, the processing circuit performs operations in digital (e.g., Boolean logic). But in other implementation, the processing circuit can be analog.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Some implementations of the display include a transceiver <b>490</b> (wired, wireless, or both) that is electrically connected to the display. In some implementations, the transceiver is a wired or wireless transmitter or a wired or wireless receiver. The display includes a light engine <b>440</b> and a detector stack <b>445</b>. Different implementations of display <b>415</b> may include any number of the listed components, in any combination or configuration, and may also include other components not shown. The display includes coupler element <b>419</b> and an optical port <b>449</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Processor <b>420</b> can include one or more of a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a multi-core processor, or other processor type. Memory <b>422</b> may include one or more of a variety of memories, such as a volatile memory (e.g., a RAM), a nonvolatile memory (e.g., a disk or FLASH), or other memory types.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Battery <b>430</b> can include one or more of a variety of battery types, such as one or more disposable batteries or one or more rechargeable batteries. Disposable batteries are discarded after their stored charge is expended. Some disposable battery chemistry technologies include alkaline, zinc carbon, or silver oxide. The battery has sufficient stored charge to allow use of the handheld device for several hours. In an implementation, the oximeter probe is a disposable.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In implementations where the battery is rechargeable, the battery can be recharged multiple times after the stored charge is expended. Some rechargeable battery chemistry technologies include nickel cadmium (NiCd), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), lithium ion (Li-ion), and zinc air. The battery can be recharged, for example, via an AC adapter with cord that connects to the handheld unit. The circuitry in the display can include a recharger circuit (not shown).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The light engine is electrically connected to the processor and the processor controls generation of light by the light engine for emission of the light into tissue <b>467</b>. The light engine includes one or more sources that generate and transmit light, such as visible light, infrared light, or both. Each source can include one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs), such as one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or more LEDs. Each LED is adapted to emit one or more wavelengths of light, such as visible light, infrared light, or both. The LEDs can be discrete LEDs, organic LEDs (OLEDs), high brightness LEDs (HLEDs), quantum dot LEDs, laser diodes, or other types of LEDs.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The LEDs are optically connected to first ends of one or more source light guides <b>447</b>, which are housed in the display. The light guides can be optical fibers or other light guiding elements. One, two, three, four, five, or more LEDs can be optically connected to one light guide <b>447</b>. Second ends of the light guides are optically connected to a first optical port <b>449</b> of the display.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Detector stack <b>445</b> includes one or more of photodetectors <b>455</b>, such as PIN photodiodes, phototransistors, photoresistors, or other detector type. The detector stack also includes one or more transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs) <b>460</b>. The photodetectors convert received light into electrical signals, which the TIAs amplify. Each photodetector may be electrically connected to one TIA. In an implementation, multiple photodetectors are connected to a single TIA, for example, via a multiplexer. The TIAs are adapted to receive analog detector responses generated by the photodetectors. The TIAs convert the current for the analog detector responses to a voltage and amplify the voltage.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some implementations, the display includes one or more electrical components that perform these functions, such as one or more current to voltage converters and one or more voltage amplifiers. It will be understood that a TIA is one example of an electronic circuit that can perform the conversion and amplification.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The photodetectors may generate output current (e.g., detector responses) that changes relatively linearly with the changing intensity of detected light, whereas the generated output voltage changes relatively nonlinearly with the changing intensity of detected light. The TIA or current to voltage converter can output relatively linear voltage from the current to voltage conversion. Thereafter, the amplified voltage is also relatively linear.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The detector stack includes one or more analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) <b>465</b>. Each TIA may be electrically connected to one ADC. In an implementation, multiple TIAs are connected to one ADC, for example, via a multiplexer. The ADCs are also electrically connected to the processor. The ADCs digitize the amplified voltage signal received from the TIAs and transfer the digitized detector responses to the processor.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The ADC samples the analog signal at a sampling rate. For example, the sampling rate can be about 0.33 hertz, about 1 hertz, about 2 hertz, about 3 hertz, or about 1-3 hertz (depending on conditions). In other implementations, the rate can be above 3 hertz, such as from about 4 hertz to about 1 kilohertz. Generally, the faster the sampling rate, the more power than is consumed which is a consideration for a battery-operated device, and also the data generated increase with sample rate. When using a sample rate of from about 0.33 to about 3 hertz, the amount of data can be transmitted wireless using technologies such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (and others mentioned in this patent) without data loss. In other implementations, a proprietary wireless technology can be used, such as when higher samplings rates are desired.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The detector stack can include one or more detector light guides <b>480</b>. The light guides can be optical fibers or other light guiding elements. In an implementation, each photodetector is optically connected to a first end of one of the light guides and receives light transmitted through the light guide. Second ends of the light guides are connected to the optical port of the display.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The oximeter probe can be configured as a laparoscopic element that includes a laparoscopic tube <b>452</b>, a coupler <b>417</b> that may be positioned at a first end of the laparoscopic element, and a sensor head <b>457</b> positioned at a second end of the laparoscopic element.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The laparoscopic element includes light guides <b>450</b> that are sometimes referred to as source light guides, and includes light guides <b>464</b> that are sometimes referred to as detector light guides. The light guides can be optical fibers or other light guiding elements. First ends of light guides <b>450</b> and <b>464</b> are optically connected to an optical port <b>478</b> of the laparoscopic element. Second ends of the light guides <b>450</b> and <b>464</b> extend through the laparoscopic element to sensor head <b>457</b>. The optical port is distally positioned on the laparoscopic element relative to the sensor head.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Turning to coupler elements <b>417</b> and <b>419</b>, the coupler elements are adapted to releasably connect to each other and in-turn releasably connect the oximeter probe to the display. Couplers <b>417</b> and <b>419</b> can mechanically couple the probe and display, can optically connect the probe and the display, can electrically connect the probe to the display, or can facilitate one or more of these connections in any combination.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Specifically, the connections of couplers <b>417</b> and <b>419</b> facilitates optical connections of the first and second optical ports <b>449</b> and <b>478</b> and thereby facilitates optical connections of light guides <b>447</b> and <b>450</b>, and light guides <b>464</b> and <b>480</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In an implementation, the oximeter probe or the display includes an optical cable that optically links display <b>415</b> to oximeter probe <b>401</b>.

The optical cable can be relatively flexible allowing the oximeter probe to be relatively freely moved for surgery.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">When couplers <b>417</b> and <b>419</b> are connected, light emitted from the LEDs is transmitted into light guides <b>447</b> and thereafter is transmitted through light guide <b>477</b> to light guides <b>450</b>. Light transmitted through light guides <b>450</b> is transmitted to the sensor head and can thereafter be transmitted out from the sensor head into tissue <b>467</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Light collected by the sensor head is transmitted through light guides <b>464</b> to light guides <b>480</b>. Light guides <b>480</b> transmit the light to photodetectors <b>455</b>. The photodetectors generate analog detector responses that are amplified by the TIAs and transmitted from the TIAs to the ADCs. The ADCs digitize the analog detector response output from the TIAs and transmit the digitized detector responses for the collected light to the processor. The processor can determine a variety of information for the tissue under examination based on the detector responses, such as absolute StO2, relative StO2, total hemoglobin, blood volume, or other information. Oximetry information generated by the processor can be displayed on display element <b>115</b>, stored in memory <b>422</b>, or transmitted via a wired or wireless transceiver <b>490</b> to other electrical devices.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In an implementation, the laparoscopic element is adapted for intraoperative use in a patient and can be introduced into the abdominal cavity of a patient through a trocar <b>485</b>. An outer surface of the laparoscopic element can be smooth so that the laparoscopic element can slide through the trocar smoothly, rotated within the trocar smoothly, and can slide into and past patient tissue smoothly and without abrading the tissue. The oximetry system can be used on various internal tissue to determine various oximetry information for the tissue.

Further, the measurements are for a specific implementation of the device, and other implementations can have different values, such as certain dimensions made longer to accommodate larger hands or to access tissue in a particular location of the body.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0148">For the specific implementations described, some specific values, ranges of values, and numbers are provided. These values indicate, for example, dimension, angles, ranges, frequencies, wavelengths, numbers, a relationship (e.g., relative value), and other quantities (e.g., numbers of sensors, sources, detectors, diodes, fiber optic cables, and so forth). Some measurements are for a specific implementation of the device, and other implementations can have different values, such as certain dimensions made larger for a larger-sized product, or smaller for a smaller-sized product. The device may be made proportionally larger or smaller by adjusting relative measurements proportionally (e.g., maintaining the same or about the same ratio between different measurements). In various implementations, the values (or numbers or quantities) can be the same as the value given, about the same of the value given, at least or greater than the value given, or can be at most or less than the value given, or any combination of these.

In a specific implementation, the diameter of the sensor head is approximately 5 millimeters, but can be other diameters. A sensor head having a diameter of 5 millimeters or less may have apertures for the source light guides and the detector light guides. In an implementation, a diameter is 5 millimeters or greater. In an implementation where the photodetectors are positioned on PCB <b>568</b> and light guides <b>150</b> extend through apertures in the PCB, the diameters of the sensor head is approximately 7 millimeters, but can be other diameters. In other implementations, the diameter can be 7 millimeters or less, or 7 millimeters or greater.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0150">A cross-sectional dimension (e.g., diameter of a round or circular cross-section dimension) of the central opening of the laparoscopic element can have similar lengths, such as about 2 millimeters to about 10 millimeters to accommodate a sensor head having a diameter of about 3 millimeters to about 10 millimeters.

The length of the laparoscopic element can range from about 10 centimeters to about 60 centimeters (e.g., 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, or 45 centimeters (e.g., for bariatric procedures), or others).</p><p id="p-0154" num="0152">A relationship between the probe unit and the laparoscopic element is that a width of the cross section of the laparoscopic element (e.g., 3 millimeters, 5 millimeters, or 10 millimeters) is less than a cross section the probe unit (e.g., 18 millimeters, 40 millimeters, 75 millimeters, or 95 millimeters). A ratio of cross-sectional width (or cross-section area) between probe unit and laparoscopic element can range from about 32:1 to about 1.8:1. For example, the ratio can be 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 10:1, 16:1, 20:1, 24:1, or 30:1, or others value, or any value greater than or less than these (e.g., 2:1 or greater, 3:1 or greater, or 4:1 or greater, or 30:1 or less, 24:1 or less, or 5:1 or less), or in a range between these.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0153">Also a cross-section shape can differ between the probe unit and the laparoscopic element.

That is, the probe face of the sensor head is not transverse to the lateral extent of the tube of the element. In an implementation, source structures and detector structures are positioned along the sides of the laparoscopic element so that the structures can make contact with target tissue when the tip cannot make contact with target tissue or such contact is difficult to make with the tip.
