The second detector is configured to detect an object by transmitting an ultrasonic wave in the moving direction of the moving object from a position different from the first detector and receiving a reflected wave of the ultrasonic wave. The hardware processor is configured to: determine that an obstacle is present in the moving direction of the moving object, based on an object detection result by the first detector and an object detection result by the second detector; determine crossing of the obstacle based on an object detection result by the first detector and an object detection result by the second detector in a state in which the hardware processor is determining that the obstacle is present; and cause a driving controller mounted on the moving object, to release driving restriction control of restricting movement of the moving object when the hardware processor determines the crossing, or prohibit the driving controller from releasing the driving restriction control under a predetermined condition.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of an object detection device;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exemplary functional block diagram of the object detection device according to a first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining a method of calculating an estimated position of an obstacle;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an object detection state when a second vehicle stops in front of a vehicle;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an object detection state when a second vehicle in front of a vehicle moves:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating the operation of a sonar control unit according to the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the sonar control unit according to a second embodiment;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the sonar control unit according to a third embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an exemplary functional block diagram of the object detection device according to a fourth embodiment;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an object detection state when there is a vehicle behind a second vehicle;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an object detection state when a second vehicle is a trailer with a first container and a second container connected;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the sonar control unit according to the fourth embodiment;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the sonar control unit according to a fifth embodiment;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the sonar control unit according to a sixth embodiment;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the sonar control unit according to a seventh embodiment;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is an exemplary functional block diagram of the object detection device according to an eighth embodiment;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the sonar control unit according to the eighth embodiment;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an object detection state when a crossing determination is performed at a front end of a second vehicle;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the sonar control unit according to a ninth embodiment;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an object detection state when other vehicles include a two-wheel vehicle according to a tenth embodiment;

The object detection device <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment is a vehicle-mounted device mounted on a vehicle <b>100</b> as a moving object and receives object detection information from an obstacle sensor <b>2</b> to detect, for example, an obstacle <b>3</b> or a second vehicle, as an object present around the vehicle <b>100</b>. The object detection device <b>1</b> forms a part of a driving assistance system with a vehicle control device <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">First, a configuration of the object detection device <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment will be described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The obstacle sensor <b>2</b> is, for example, an ultrasonic sensor and has a function of transmitting an ultrasonic wave of 20 to 100 kHz as a transmitted wave and a function of receiving an ultrasonic wave reflected from an object as a reflected wave. In the present embodiment, a first detector <b>21</b> and a second detector <b>22</b> are attached at the front of the vehicle at a distance from each other such that they are aligned in a vehicle width direction that is a direction orthogonal to the moving direction of the vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Specifically, the first detector <b>21</b> is provided on the right side of the centerline of the vehicle <b>100</b>. The second detector <b>22</b> is provided on the left side of the centerline of the vehicle <b>100</b>. The first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b> may be mounted, for example, at the back of the vehicle, rather than the front of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b> have an object detection range set as a region in which they can receive reflected waves of ultrasonic waves transmitted by themselves. The first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b> are attached such that the object detection ranges of two obstacle sensors <b>2</b> partially overlap.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although the vehicle is provided with the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b> that are two obstacle sensors <b>2</b>, the present disclosure is not limited thereto. For example, a plurality of other obstacle sensors <b>2</b> such as corner sensors may be separately provided.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A configuration of the object detection device <b>1</b> will now be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of the object detection device <b>1</b>. The object detection device <b>1</b> includes the obstacle sensor <b>2</b> and a sonar control unit <b>4</b>. The obstacle sensor <b>2</b> includes the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b>. The sonar control unit <b>4</b> includes a distance calculator <b>41</b>, an obstacle determiner <b>42</b>, a crossing determiner <b>43</b>, and a restriction release determiner <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sonar control unit <b>4</b> is mainly composed of a microcontroller including a processor such as a central processing unit (CPU), a read only memory (ROM), and a random access memory (RAM) and detects the presence or absence of an obstacle <b>3</b> around the vehicle based on detection information of the obstacle <b>3</b> received from the obstacle sensor <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The sonar control unit <b>4</b> generates a control signal through cooperation between the processor such as a CPU and a computer program (software) stored in the ROM or the like. The functions of the sonar control unit <b>4</b> are not necessarily implemented by software and may be implemented by a hardware configuration such as dedicated circuitry.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The object detection device <b>1</b> is connected to the vehicle control device <b>5</b>. The vehicle control device <b>5</b> includes a driving controller <b>51</b>. The vehicle control device <b>5</b> is connected to an operating unit <b>6</b>. The operating unit <b>6</b> includes an accelerator pedal <b>61</b>, a brake pedal <b>62</b>, and a notification unit <b>63</b>. Here, the vehicle control device <b>5</b> is an example of &#x201c;driving controller&#x201d; in the claims.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b> each have a transmitter (not illustrated) and a receiver (not illustrated). The transmitter is composed of an ultrasonic microphone having a piezoelectric element, transmits an ultrasonic wave having a frequency equal to that of an input transmission signal to an object such as the obstacle <b>3</b>, and outputs an electrical signal corresponding to the transmitted ultrasonic wave to the distance calculator <b>41</b>. The transmitted ultrasonic wave is reflected by the object.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The receiver is composed of an ultrasonic microphone having a piezoelectric element in the same manner as the transmitter, receives an ultrasonic wave reflected by an object such as the obstacle <b>3</b>, converts the received ultrasonic wave into an electrical signal, and outputs the electrical signal to the distance calculator <b>41</b>. The transmitter and the receiver may be integrated or may be separated. The number of transmitters is not necessarily equal to the number of receivers. For example, the second detector may have no transmitter and only have a receiver, and the receiver of the second detector may receive an ultrasonic wave transmitted by the transmitter of the first detector.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The distance calculator <b>41</b> calculates the distance to an object based on the electrical signals output from the transmitter and the receiver. Specifically, the distance to an object is measured from signals output from the transmitter and the receiver, based on the time difference from transmission to reception of ultrasonic waves. The calculated distance is sent as an electrical signal to the obstacle determiner <b>42</b>. Here, the object refers to a target including other vehicles, people, and walls.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The obstacle determiner <b>42</b> determines the presence or absence of an obstacle <b>3</b> based on an electrical signal sent from the distance calculator <b>41</b> and an electrical signal output from the receiver. Specifically, the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> has a threshold value, and if the signal strength (amplitude) output from the receiver is greater than the threshold value, the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> determines that an obstacle <b>3</b> is present. The determination of the presence or absence of an obstacle <b>3</b> by the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> may be performed before measurement of the distance to the object by the distance calculator <b>41</b>. In this case, the distance calculator <b>41</b> measures the distance to the obstacle detected by the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> based on the time difference from transmission to reception of ultrasonic waves. As used herein the obstacle <b>3</b> is, for example, an object present within a predetermined distance from the vehicle <b>100</b> in the moving direction of the vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The obstacle determiner <b>42</b> may compare the signal strength (amplitude) output from the receiver with a threshold value multiple times, and if the signal strength (amplitude) is greater than the threshold value multiple times in succession, the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> may determine that an obstacle <b>3</b> is present. Even when the signal strength (amplitude) output from the receiver is greater than a threshold value, an obstacle need not be determined to be present, if the distance to the object is large based on the distance information sent from the distance calculator <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When it is determined that an obstacle <b>3</b> is present, the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> transmits obstacle information to the driving controller <b>51</b> in the vehicle control device <b>5</b>. In this case, the driving controller <b>51</b> performs steering control, acceleration suppression control, and braking control of the vehicle <b>100</b> as hitting avoidance control to prevent the vehicle <b>100</b> from hitting against the obstacle <b>3</b>. Alternatively, the notification unit <b>63</b> may give notification to alert the driver. The notification unit is, for example, a speaker and a display.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The distance calculator <b>41</b> not only calculates the distance to the obstacle <b>3</b> but also calculates the relative position of the obstacle <b>3</b> to the vehicle <b>100</b> using signal information obtained from the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b>, using the principle of triangulation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In triangulation, the coordinates of a measurement point are calculated from the distance between two known points and the distance between each of the two known points and the measurement point. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining a method of calculating the position of the obstacle <b>3</b>. The first detector <b>21</b>, the second detector <b>22</b>, and the obstacle <b>3</b> located in front of the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b> are illustrated in a plan view.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the sensor transmitting an ultrasonic wave and the sensor receiving it are the same, the received ultrasonic wave is called a direct wave, and the sensor receiving the ultrasonic wave is called a direct detection sensor. On the other hand, when the sensor transmitting an ultrasonic wave and the sensor receiving it are different, the received ultrasonic wave is called an indirect wave, and the sensor receiving the ultrasonic wave is called an indirect detection sensor. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first detector <b>21</b> is a direct detection sensor that transmits an ultrasonic wave with its own transmitter and receives the ultrasonic wave with its own receiver, whereas the second detector <b>22</b> is an indirect detection sensor that receives an ultrasonic wave transmitted by the transmitter of the first detector <b>21</b> with its own receiver.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The distance calculator <b>41</b> sets a coordinate system in which a straight line passing through the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b> is the X axis and a straight line passing through the middle between the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b> and perpendicular to the X axis is the Y axis, and calculates the X and Y coordinates in the coordinate system as the position of the obstacle <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Specifically, when an ultrasonic wave is transmitted from the transmitter of the first detector <b>21</b> and the ultrasonic wave is reflected by the obstacle <b>3</b> and received as a direct wave by the receiver of the first detector <b>21</b>, the distance calculator <b>41</b> calculates the distance between the first detector <b>21</b> and the obstacle <b>3</b> based on the direct wave.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the reflected wave of the ultrasonic wave by the obstacle <b>3</b> is received as an indirect wave by the receiver of the second detector <b>22</b>, the distance calculator <b>41</b> calculates the distance between the second detector <b>22</b> and the obstacle <b>3</b> based on the received indirect wave.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The distance from the origin O at the intersection of the X and Y axes to the first detector <b>21</b> is equal to the distance from the origin O to the second detector <b>22</b>, and these distances are stored in advance in a memory (not illustrated) in the sonar control unit <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The distance calculator <b>41</b> calculates a first time t1 by subtracting the time when the transmitter of the first detector <b>21</b> transmits an ultrasonic wave from the time when the first detector <b>21</b> receives a direct wave. The distance calculator <b>41</b> also calculates a second time t2 by subtracting the time when the transmitter of the first detector <b>21</b> transmits an ultrasonic wave from the time when the second detector <b>22</b> receives an indirect wave.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A value obtained by multiplying the first time t1 by the speed of sound is a value twice the distance between the first detector <b>21</b> and the obstacle <b>3</b>. A value obtained by multiplying the second time t2 by the speed of sound is the sum of the distance between the first detector <b>21</b> and the obstacle <b>3</b> and the distance between the second detector <b>22</b> and the obstacle <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The distance calculator <b>41</b> can determine the position by calculating the coordinates of the obstacle <b>3</b> by triangulation operations using the distance between the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b>, and the first time t1 and the second time t2 that are the measured times.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first detector <b>21</b> is a direct detection sensor and the second detector <b>22</b> is an indirect detector, by way of example. However, the distance calculator <b>41</b> can determine the position of the obstacle <b>3</b> in the same way when the first detector <b>21</b> is an indirect detection sensor and the second detector <b>22</b> is a direct detection sensor.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a second vehicle may be present as an obstacle <b>3</b> so as to block the moving direction (in other words, the moving direction) of the vehicle <b>100</b>. In this case, it can be determined whether there is an obstacle <b>3</b> blocking the moving direction of the vehicle <b>100</b>, based on the detection results of the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector are each detecting an object. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the moving direction (or moving direction) of the vehicle <b>100</b> is forward of the vehicle <b>100</b>, by way of example. However, when the vehicle <b>100</b> moves backward, the moving direction of the vehicle <b>100</b> is backward of the vehicle <b>100</b>, so it should be understood that the directions illustrated in the drawing and the wording in the description of the drawing should be replaced.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, since a second vehicle is present as an obstacle <b>3</b> so as to block the moving direction (in other words, the moving direction) of the vehicle <b>100</b>, the ultrasonic wave transmitted by the obstacle sensor <b>2</b> is reflected by a side surface of a second vehicle. The ultrasonic wave transmitted by the first detector <b>21</b> is reflected by a side surface of a second vehicle and is incident on the first detector <b>21</b> as a direct wave and incident on the second detector <b>22</b> as an indirect wave. One point of the side surface of the vehicle ahead is then detected as a first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In this case, whether the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a </i>is present is determined based on whether the position of the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a </i>is calculated stably in transmission of ultrasonic waves multiple times. For example, when the position of the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a </i>can be calculated multiple times in succession, the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> determines that the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a </i>is present.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Similarly, the ultrasonic wave transmitted by the second detector <b>22</b> is reflected by a side surface of a second vehicle and is incident on the second detector <b>22</b> as a direct wave and incident on the first detector <b>21</b> as an indirect wave. One point of the side surface of a second vehicle ahead is then detected as a second obstacle <b>3</b><i>b. </i>Whether the second obstacle <b>3</b><i>b </i>is present is determined based on whether the position of the second obstacle <b>3</b><i>b </i>is calculated stably, in the same manner as in the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">When the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> determines that the obstacle <b>3</b> of either the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a </i>or the second obstacle <b>3</b><i>b </i>is present, the driving controller <b>51</b> performs driving restriction control of the vehicle <b>100</b>, because if the vehicle <b>100</b> starts, the vehicle <b>100</b> may hit against the vehicle ahead that is the obstacle <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Driving restriction control includes, for example, acceleration suppression to suppress acceleration of the vehicle <b>100</b> when the driver operates the accelerator pedal <b>61</b>, and braking control to brake the vehicle <b>100</b> even when the driver is not operating the brake pedal <b>62</b>. Alternatively, the driving controller <b>51</b> may perform steering control to prevent hitting against the obstacle <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">When the obstacle <b>3</b> is a second vehicle, it may stop in front of the vehicle <b>100</b> and then move to cross in front of the vehicle <b>100</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when a state in which both of the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second obstacle <b>3</b><i>b </i>are detected shifts to a state in which the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a </i>is not detected and only the second obstacle <b>3</b><i>b </i>is detected, and then a second vehicle is no longer present in front of the vehicle <b>100</b>, neither the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a </i>nor the second obstacle <b>3</b><i>b </i>is detected.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a second vehicle moves from the right to the left in front of the vehicle <b>100</b>, by way of example. However, the same applies when a second vehicle moves from the left to the right in front of the vehicle <b>100</b>. In this case, the obstacle sensor <b>2</b> installed at the left front of the vehicle <b>100</b> should read as the first detector <b>21</b>, and the obstacle sensor <b>2</b> installed at the right front of the vehicle <b>100</b> should read as the second detector <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this case, even though the driver of the vehicle <b>100</b> recognizes the movement of a second vehicle ahead, driving restriction control is applied until a second vehicle completely passes by in front of the vehicle <b>100</b>. More specifically, driving restriction control is released after both of the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second obstacle <b>3</b><i>b </i>become the non-detection state, so even if the driver recognizes the movement of a second vehicle ahead and presses on the accelerator, driving restriction control is exerted unless a second vehicle completely passes by in front of the vehicle <b>100</b> at the moment of pressing. Accordingly, the vehicle does not start, against the driver's will. A detection time lag also adversely affects the driving restriction control. In obstacle detection, in order to increase the reliability of the detection result, it is determined that &#x201c;an obstacle is present&#x201d; when an obstacle at the same distance continues being detected multiple times. Once it is determined that &#x201c;an obstacle is present&#x201d;, the determination result is not immediately changed to &#x201c;not detected&#x201d; even when an obstacle is not detected once. The determination result is changed to &#x201c;not detected&#x201d; when the obstacle continues not being detected multiple times. Such a time delay in the change of detection results is the detection time lag. In other words, while the determination result &#x201c;an obstacle is present&#x201d; remains unchanged due to the detection time lag even after a second vehicle completely passes by in front of the vehicle <b>100</b>, the driving restriction control is exerted and the vehicle does not start even if the accelerator is pressed.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Such driving restriction control is against the will of the driver who recognizes the movement of a second vehicle ahead, and therefore needs to be improved. The crossing determiner is therefore added to determine a situation in which a vehicle is crossing in front. At a time point when the crossing determiner <b>43</b> determines crossing of a second vehicle, the determination result is sent to the driving controller <b>51</b>, and upon receiving the crossing determination, the driving controller <b>51</b> releases the driving restriction control of the vehicle <b>100</b>, so that driving assistance as intended by the driver is performed.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Specifically, the crossing determiner <b>43</b> detects crossing of a second vehicle when a state in which both of the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second obstacle <b>3</b><i>b </i>are detected (both of the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b> are in the detection state) shifts to a state in which the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a </i>is not detected and only the second obstacle <b>3</b><i>b </i>is detected (the first detector <b>21</b> is the non-detection state and the second detector <b>22</b> is in the detection state).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the crossing determiner <b>43</b> determines crossing, the driving controller <b>51</b> releases the driving restriction control of the vehicle <b>100</b>. In other words, acceleration suppression control or braking control of the vehicle <b>100</b> is released. Since the driver is likely to visually recognize a second vehicle crossing in front of the vehicle <b>100</b>, releasing the driving restriction control of the vehicle <b>100</b> when crossing is detected can be driving assistance that is more likely to meet the driver's intention.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">However, depending on the driving status of the vehicle <b>100</b> and the surrounding conditions of the vehicle <b>100</b>, it may be better not to release the driving restriction control of the vehicle <b>100</b> in consideration of safety and the like. In the present embodiment, the object detection device <b>1</b> includes the restriction release determiner <b>44</b>. The restriction release determiner <b>44</b> determines whether to release the driving restriction control depending on the driving status of the vehicle <b>100</b> and the surrounding conditions of the vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In other words, even when the crossing determiner <b>43</b> determines crossing of a second vehicle, the release of the driving restriction control is prohibited in consideration of the driver's safety, depending on the driving status of the vehicle <b>100</b> and the surrounding conditions of the vehicle <b>100</b>. Here, the driving status of the vehicle <b>100</b> and the surrounding conditions of the vehicle <b>100</b> are examples of &#x201c;predetermined condition&#x201d; in the claims.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The term &#x201c;crossing&#x201d; means that a second vehicle that is an obstacle <b>3</b> passes by in a direction intersecting the moving direction of the vehicle <b>100</b> from a state in which it is present ahead or behind the vehicle <b>100</b> that is a moving object, and includes a situation in which a second vehicle comes from the right side in front of the vehicle <b>100</b> and then a second vehicle moves back to the right side. The crossing determination is performed not only when the moving direction is the forward direction but also when the moving direction is the backward direction. The installation location of the obstacle sensor is not limited to the front part of the vehicle, but rather the obstacle sensor is more often installed at the back part of the vehicle. The obstacle sensor is installed on the rear bumper of the vehicle to detect an obstacle not visible to the driver, because the driver has a clear vision in front of the vehicle, whereas the driver has a wide range of blind spot at the back. As an example of the situation in which the crossing determination is applied in backing, the own vehicle may be wanted to be backed to the back of a vehicle crossing behind the own vehicle through a path from when backing the own vehicle out from a position where the own vehicle is parked forward in a parking slot for double parking. The prior art discloses a crossing determination performed for a vehicle crossing the moving direction and is not limited to forward movement.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the present embodiment, even when the crossing determiner <b>43</b> determines crossing of a second vehicle, the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> prohibits the release of the driving restriction control if the gear position of the vehicle <b>100</b> is the reverse position.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The restriction release determiner <b>44</b> determines a driving status of the vehicle <b>100</b> based on the gear position. The driving status is, for example, a status as to whether the vehicle <b>100</b> is moving forward or backward.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In other words, when the driving status of the vehicle <b>100</b> is moving backward, the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> prohibits the release of the driving restriction. This is because it is more difficult for the driver to check the safety of the surroundings of the vehicle <b>100</b> when the vehicle <b>100</b> moves backward than when it moves forward. Crossing of a second vehicle is determined when the second vehicle is detected at least in the moving direction of the vehicle <b>100</b>, and if the second vehicle stops before completely passing by in the moving direction of the own vehicle, there is a risk that the corrosion occurs when the driving restriction is released to driving. In a normal situation, the obstacle sensor is designed to avoid a collision by performing driving restriction (deceleration or braking) when detecting an obstacle, but when driving restriction is released based on the crossing determination, driving restriction is not exerted, which may cause a collision. Even when driving restriction is not exerted, a collision does not occur in many cases as long as the driver keeps an eye in the moving direction, because the driver can press the brake pedal for braking when a second vehicle stops before completely passing by in the moving direction of the vehicle <b>100</b>, or the driver can ease off the accelerator for deceleration when a second vehicle is slow and takes time to completely pass by in the moving direction of the vehicle <b>100</b>. However, the driver sometimes has a limited view when backing and may keep backing without noticing the stop or the slowness of a second vehicle, which may result in a collision. Moreover, the driver of a vehicle equipped with obstacle sensors sometimes presses on the accelerator without sufficiently checking for safety, thinking that the brakes should be applied automatically when there is a risk of a collision. In this way, releasing the driving restriction based on the crossing determination in backing may cause a collision. The restriction release determiner <b>44</b> therefore prohibits the release of the driving restriction when the driver backs the vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> prohibits the release of the driving restriction, driving restriction information is sent to the driving controller <b>51</b> in the vehicle control device <b>5</b>.

More specifically, it may be assumed that crossing is determined while at least one of a first detector <b>21</b><i>c </i>and a second detector <b>22</b><i>c </i>is detecting an obstacle.

A wall or a pillar, even detected by both detectors, may become undetected as an obstacle by one of the detectors. In this case, since the wall or the pillar that is a fixed object does not cross, the release of braking must be prohibited in order to avoid a collision of the vehicle <b>100</b> with the fixed object. The ultrasonic waves transmitted by the obstacle sensor <b>2</b><i>b </i>are susceptible to wind and outside temperature. This is because the attenuation rate of ultrasonic waves changes with wind speed and outside temperature states.

In a combination with the fourth embodiment, even when the crossing determiner <b>43</b><i>d </i>(<b>43</b><i>e, </i><b>43</b><i>f</i>) determines crossing of a second vehicle, the restriction release determiner <b>44</b><i>f </i>may prohibit the release of the driving restriction control if an object is detected by two or more (a plurality of) detectors among at least three detectors.

The vehicle <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> has a first detector <b>21</b>, a second detector <b>22</b>, a third detector <b>23</b>, and a fourth detector <b>24</b>, but the vehicle <b>100</b> has at least the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b>. The present embodiment can be applied to handle a case where the obstacle detected by a plurality of detectors is not a single vehicle but a plurality of objects such as a four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>and a two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b, </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. In the present embodiment, the term vehicle generally refers to not only the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>but also the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b. </i>The two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>may be a motorcycle or may be a bicycle or the like. Compared with the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a, </i>the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>may be difficult to reflect an ultrasonic wave or the strength of the reflection may vary among parts.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">Specifically, when the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>is in front of the object detection device <b>1</b>, an ultrasonic wave striking on the main part of the body of the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b, </i>especially the engine part, is reflected, but an ultrasonic wave striking on the spoke of the wheel is transmitted, so that the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>is sometimes partially not detected as an obstacle. Furthermore, with ultrasonic waves, it is sometimes difficult to grasp the shape of the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>as an obstacle, and therefore, when the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>is in front of the vehicle <b>100</b> and the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>is in front of the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a, </i>the detection of the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>and the detection of the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>in front may be indistinctive, and the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> may fail to identify the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>and the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>as separate obstacles. In this case, even when the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>moves in front of the own vehicle <b>100</b> and it is determined that crossing has occurred, the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>does not always move at the same time. The release of braking therefore must be prohibited in order to avoid a collision of the vehicle <b>100</b> with the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b. </i>In other words, the condition required to ensure safety even when it is determined that crossing has occurred and braking is released is that the object in front of the own vehicle <b>100</b> is a single, so when there is a suspicion that a plurality of objects are present in front of the vehicle <b>100</b>, the release of braking must be prohibited. Hereafter, this condition for prohibiting the release of braking will be referred to as the condition related to pluralism of objects. Specifically, even when the crossing determiner <b>43</b> determines crossing of a second vehicle (for example, when from a state in which the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b> respectively detect the first obstacle <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second obstacle <b>3</b><i>b, </i>a state in which it is undetected by the obstacle sensor <b>2</b> of either the first detector <b>21</b> or the second detector <b>22</b> is reached), the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> determines that the condition related to pluralism of objects should apply if it is presumed that the obstacle includes a plurality of objects, that is, the obstacle is not a single, and the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> prohibits the release of the driving restriction control. The information of prohibiting the release of the driving restriction control is sent as a signal to the driving controller <b>51</b> in the vehicle control device <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">There are multiple methods for assuming that the obstacle includes a plurality of objects, and any method may be used. For example, the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> in the present embodiment may determine that two vehicles at different distances are detected, when a plurality of pieces of distance information are detected and the difference between the pieces of distance information exceeds a predetermined value, for example, 30 cm. The distance information detected is information indicating the distance calculated by the distance calculator <b>41</b>, based on an electrical signal based on the ultrasonic wave received by the receiver included in the first detector <b>21</b> or the second detector <b>22</b>, as described in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">The predetermined condition for prohibiting the release of the driving restriction control in the present embodiment is the condition related to pluralism of distance information to the detected obstacle, as described above. More precisely, for example, when there are a plurality of pieces of distance information and the difference between the pieces of distance information exceeds a threshold value, the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> in the present embodiment determines that the condition related to pluralism of objects should apply and prohibits the release of the driving restriction control. In other words, the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> in the present embodiment causes the driving controller <b>51</b> to prohibit the release of the driving restriction control when the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> determines release prohibition to prohibit the release of the driving restriction control of the moving object under a predetermined condition. The threshold value for the difference between the pieces of distance information is 30 cm in the present embodiment but is not limited to this value.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the first detector <b>21</b> disposed to the right of the center of the front of the vehicle <b>100</b> detects a propagation distance A<b>1</b> of the ultrasonic wave passing through the spoke of the wheel of the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>and reflected by the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a. </i>In comparison, the second detector <b>22</b> disposed to the left of the center of the front of the vehicle <b>100</b> detects a propagation distance A<b>2</b> of the ultrasonic wave reflected by the main part of the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b, </i>especially the engine part. Thus, there is a difference in distance information detected. In general, a side surface of one vehicle seldom has a large protrusion or depression exceeding 30 cm, and when the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>runs alongside the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a, </i>the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>does not approach within 30 cm as long as it keeps a safe distance on the side. Based on these, when there are a plurality of pieces of distance information and the difference between the pieces of distance information exceeds 30 cm, it can be assumed that there are two vehicles. Although an example in which there is a difference between distance information detected by two detectors, namely, the first detector <b>21</b> and the second detector <b>22</b> has been described above, the present embodiment can be applied also when there are a plurality of pieces of distance information detected by one detector and there is a difference between the pieces of distance information. For example, the second detector <b>22</b> to the left of the center of the front of the vehicle <b>100</b> or the first detector <b>21</b> to the right of the center of the front of the vehicle <b>100</b> may receive the ultrasonic wave reflected by the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>and thereafter receive the ultrasonic wave reflected by the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>after a time difference in accordance with the propagation distance. Since the first detector <b>21</b> or the second detector <b>22</b> can individually detect reflected waves received at different timings, a plurality of pieces of distance information corresponding to the individual reflected waves can be obtained. In this way, the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> in the present embodiment may assume that there are two vehicles also when there are a plurality of pieces of distance information detected by one obstacle detection device and the difference between the pieces of distance information exceeds 30 cm.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">Furthermore, the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> may prohibit the release of the driving restriction control when the distribution of strength (amplitude) information of the received wave signal detected by the second detector <b>22</b> has a plurality of peaks. When there are a plurality of obstacles reflecting ultrasonic waves, for example, when the ultrasonic wave reflected by the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>is received and thereafter the ultrasonic wave reflected by the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>is received, the distribution of strength (amplitude) information of the received wave signal, that is, the distribution of the received wave signal strength on the time axis, has peaks at positions (times) corresponding to the respective distances to a plurality of obstacles. When there are two peaks, therefore, the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> in the present embodiment may determine that there are two obstacles at different distances. Since the strength of the reflected wave from the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>tends to be lower, pluralism of obstacles may be assumed if there is a second peak at a position different from the reflected wave from the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a, </i>even though its strength does not reach a threshold value for detecting an obstacle. If the difference in distance corresponding to the difference in position between the two peaks exceeds 30 cm, the possibility that the waves are reflected at different positions on a side surface of one vehicle can be excluded. Therefore, if the strength distribution has two peaks and the difference in distance corresponding to the difference in position between the peaks exceeds 30 cm, the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> in the present embodiment can assume that there are two vehicles in view of pluralism of distance information.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">Furthermore, pluralism of obstacles may be assumed when the difference in strength between received wave signals detected by one detector or a plurality of detectors is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold value. The two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>is a bicycle and has no engine part, a part of the ultrasonic wave emitted by the second detector <b>22</b> is partially interrupted by the bicycle rider's leg, and the rest of the ultrasonic wave is reflected by the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a, </i>and a part of the reflected ultrasonic wave is interrupted by the bicycle rider's leg again and the rest is received by the second detector <b>22</b>. In this way, when the bicycle rider's leg is on the path of the ultrasonic wave moving back and forth, the strength of the received wave signal is weakened as much as the ultrasonic wave is interrupted by the rider's leg. Since the human body, especially the human body covered by clothing, has low reflectivity of ultrasonic waves, the ultrasonic wave reflected by the human body may have no detectable peak in the distribution of strength information of the received wave signal and may fail to be detected as an obstacle. However, if there is a difference equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold value between the strengths of the reflected waves of the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>received by different detectors, for example, the first detector <b>21</b>, and the strength of the reflected wave of the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>received by the second detector <b>22</b>, it is conceivable that another vehicle be in front of the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>and is blocking the reflected wave. Thus, pluralism of obstacles may be assumed if there is a difference equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold value between the strengths of the reflected waves. In other words, the predetermined condition for prohibiting the release of the driving restriction control in the present embodiment may be a condition related to the strength information of the detected received wave signal. In this case, the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> in the present embodiment prohibits the release of the driving restriction control due to pluralism of obstacles when the difference between strength information of the received wave signals exceeds a threshold value.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">(Modification)</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">The foregoing tenth embodiment handles a case where the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>and the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>are in front of the vehicle <b>100</b>. However, the present modification handles a case where initially only the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>is present in front of the vehicle <b>100</b>, and later the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>comes in. The configuration of the object detection device <b>1</b> according to the present modification is similar to that of the object detection device <b>1</b><i>c </i>illustrated by the block diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> used to describe the fourth embodiment and thus a description of each component will be omitted. The object detection device <b>1</b> according to the present modification differs from the object detection device <b>1</b><i>c </i>according to the fourth embodiment in the condition by which the restriction release determiner <b>44</b><i>c </i>prohibits the release of the driving restriction control.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">The present modification will be described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> which is a diagram illustrating the positional relation of the vehicles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an object detection state when other vehicles include a two-wheel vehicle according to the modification. The fourth embodiment handles a case where a vehicle (two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b</i>) is behind a vehicle (four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a</i>) crossing in front of the vehicle <b>100</b>, whereas the present modification handles a case where the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>behind on the right side catches up with the vehicle (four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a</i>) crossing in front and runs alongside at the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">When the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>is in front of the first detector <b>21</b> to the fourth detector <b>24</b>, the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>is sometimes partially not detected as an obstacle because the ultrasonic wave passes through the spoke of the wheel, as described above. However, it is not completely undetected but is partially detectable as an obstacle by the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> because the main part of the body of the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b, </i>especially the engine part, reflects ultrasonic waves. The first detector <b>21</b> to the fourth detector <b>24</b> repeat detection at a frequency of more than 10 times per second. The obstacle detector <b>42</b> therefore can detect the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>as an obstacle based on the detection results of the first detector <b>21</b> to the fourth detector <b>24</b>, at any point in a period until the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>behind on the right side passes through the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> and reaches the position alongside the vehicle (four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a</i>) crossing in front, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. For example, when the third detector <b>23</b> detects the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>as an obstacle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the third detector <b>23</b> changes from a state in which an object is not detected when only the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>is present in front to a state in which an obstacle is detected, and it can be determined that a second obstacle is added to the original obstacle, that is, there are a plurality of obstacles.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">Since the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>does not reflect ultrasonic waves at some parts, the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>may be detected as an obstacle when it stops in front of the vehicle <b>100</b> and comes into the positional relation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, but the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>may not be detected in some cases. In other words, when the crossing determiner <b>43</b> determines that crossing has occurred, the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>is not always detected as a second obstacle different from the obstacle that has been detected in the moving direction of the moving object. When the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>is detected as an obstacle in the process before the positional relation between the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>and the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>becomes the positional relation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the object detection device <b>1</b> stores the occurrence of an event indicating the possibility that a second obstacle different from the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>is added in front, until the time point when crossing is determined, so that the object detection device <b>1</b> can determine that there is a possibility of a collision with a second obstacle added in front and can prohibit the release of the driving restriction control. The existence of an event indicating the possibility that an obstacle other than the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>is added is stored, for example, in a not-illustrated memory in the object detection device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">Specifically, even when the crossing determiner <b>43</b> determines crossing of a second vehicle (when from a state in which both of the first detector <b>21</b><i>c </i>and the second detector <b>22</b><i>c </i>detect the obstacle, a state in which it is undetected by the obstacle sensor <b>2</b><i>c </i>of either of the first detector <b>21</b><i>c </i>or the second detector <b>22</b><i>c </i>is reached), the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> prohibits the release of the driving restriction control if there is a possibility that a second obstacle is added in front and it is presumed that there are a plurality of obstacles. The information of prohibiting the release of the driving restriction control is sent as a signal to the driving controller <b>51</b> in the vehicle control device <b>5</b>. In other words, when an event of detecting a second obstacle different from the obstacle that has been detected in the moving direction of the moving object occurs before the crossing determiner <b>43</b> determines that crossing has occurred, the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> prohibits the release of the driving restriction control based on the condition of pluralism of obstacles.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">The addition of a second obstacle can be detected not only when a state in which an object is not detected changes to a state in which an object is detected, but also in other cases. For example, when the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>moves forward from the position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, a state in which the ultrasonic wave emitted by the first detector is reflected only by the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>changes to a state in which it is reflected by both of the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>and the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b, </i>and the strength distribution of the received wave signal may have a plurality of peaks. In this case, if the peak indicating the sound wave reflected by the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>exceeds a threshold value for detecting an obstacle, it can be determined that an event of detecting a second obstacle different from the obstacle that has been detected in the moving direction of the moving object has occurred. However, as described above, the strength of the reflected wave from the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>(including the rider) is sometimes weak. Therefore, even when the peak does not exceed the threshold value for detecting an obstacle, the event in which the strength distribution of the received wave signal has a plurality of peaks can be determined as the condition related to pluralism of objects. Furthermore, as described above, the strength of the reflected wave from the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>may be weakened by the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>interrupting in front of the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a. </i>Therefore, when the strength distribution of the received wave signal changes beyond the threshold value, blocking by another object may be assumed and it may be determined that the condition related to pluralism of objects should apply. In this case, a predetermined condition used to determine the prohibition of release is a condition related to change in strength distribution of the detected received wave signal, and when an event of the number of peaks appearing in the strength distribution of the received wave signal increasing occurs before the crossing determiner <b>43</b> determines that crossing has occurred, the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> prohibits the release of the driving restriction control.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">Alternatively, the predetermined condition used to determine the prohibition of release may be a condition related to change in strength information of the detected received wave signal. In this case, when an event of the strength information of the received wave signal changing beyond a threshold value occurs before the crossing determiner <b>43</b> determines that crossing has occurred, the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> prohibits the release of the driving restriction control.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">The possibility that a second obstacle is added in front may be determined by change in the detected distance. When the positional relation between the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>and the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>changes from the positional relation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> to the positional relation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the distance detected by the second detector <b>22</b> to the left of the center of the front of the vehicle <b>100</b> changes from distance B<b>1</b> to distance A<b>2</b> due to intrusion of the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>in front of the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a. </i>As long as a safe distance on the side is kept, the difference between the distance to a side surface of the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>and the distance to a side surface of the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>is not less than 30 cm. If the detected distance decreases to less than 30 cm, the obstacle determiner <b>42</b> in the present modification detects this decrease as an event indicating the possibility that a second obstacle is added in front, and stores the occurrence of this event until the time point when crossing is determined, so that it can be determined that the condition related to pluralism of objects should apply, and the release of the driving restriction control can be prohibited.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">As described above, change in strength distribution of the received wave signal, change in strength information of the received wave signal, or change in the detected distance is a condition by which change in number of obstacles can be detected.

More specifically, when an event of detecting a second obstacle different from the obstacle that has been detected in the moving direction of the moving object occurs before the crossing determiner <b>43</b> determines that crossing has occurred, the restriction release determiner <b>44</b> prohibits the release of the driving restriction control.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">The object detection device <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment determines that the condition related to pluralism of objects should apply and prohibits the release of the driving restriction control when the obstacle in front of the vehicle <b>100</b> includes a plurality of vehicles, such as the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>and the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b, </i>and the four-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>a </i>crosses and the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>remains in front, thereby reducing the possibility that the vehicle <b>100</b> hits against the two-wheel vehicle <b>31</b><i>b </i>in such a state.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">The first to tenth embodiments of the object detection device of the present disclosure have been described above, and each embodiment can be implemented in combination with another embodiment as appropriate.
