In addition, some example embodiments of the invention relate- to an X-ray imaging method in which said X-ray contrast agent is used. Some example embodiments of the invention also relate-a to an image reconstruction facility. Some example embodiments of the invention further relates- to an X-ray imaging system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the aid of modern imaging methods, two or three-dimensional image data is often created which can be used for visualizing an imaged object under investigation and also for further uses.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The imaging methods are often based upon the detection of X-ray radiation wherein so-called projection measurement data is generated. For example, projection measurement data can be acquired with the aid of a computed tomography (CT) system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an X-ray image recording, contrast agents are often used which are injected into the patient in order to enhance the contrast of the image recording and thereby to facilitate a diagnosis. An example for the use of contrast agents is the imaging of vessels with X-ray methods. X-ray methods can therein be carried out with conventional systems, C-arm systems, angiography systems or CT systems. Conventionally, iodine is used as the X-ray contrast agent for such an imaging method.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the case of angiography with iodine, the problem arises that bones, calcifications and partially calcified plaques in the vessels have density values similar to the contrast agent-filled vessel and thus, particularly in the case of complex anatomical structures, for example in the region of the skull, iodine-filled vessels, bones and calcifications are overlaid on the vessels and can therefore no longer be precisely separated from one another in the image representation. Therefore, particularly in the case of vessels of small diameter, the width of the vessel, or lumen, can often no longer be ascertained with the aid of CT angiography in a case of severe calcification. This phenomenon represents a restriction for the use of the CT angiography for coronary arteries and peripheral leg vessels.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventionally, the attempt has been made, by subtraction of a pre-recording of a region to be recorded, carried out without contrast agent, to separate bones and calcifications and/or partially calcified plaques in vessels from the regions made visible by way of the iodine contrast agent. However, due to the temporal offset between the pre-recording and the main recording, problems of registration arise resulting from patient movement. Furthermore, by means of the additional image recording, the radiation dose to the patient is increased.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The use of software-based methods for separating image information relating to the vessels and image information relating to bones is also error-prone. These errors occur, in particular, in the case of complex imaging representations, for example, of the base of the skull. In addition, an elimination of (partially) calcified plaques from the representation of vessels is not possible due to the blooming effect. This is because the partially calcified plaques are represented larger than they actually are, due to the blooming effect. If the representations of the plaques are removed from the image, then, due to the excessively large areas previously covered by the plaques, regions remain for which no image information exists.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A possibility for separating bones and iodine-laden contrast agent pixels exists in the use of dual energy or multi-energy imaging methods. Therein, image recordings of one and the same examination region are carried out with at least two different mean X-ray energies. However, in simple variants in which pixels are associated with the contrast agent or the bone material by classification, similar problems arise as in the use of software-based methods. Error-prone separation of iodine-laden regions and regions having plaques also occurs, in particular with complex vascular structures. Similarly, with this procedure, an enlarged representation of calcified regions takes place. If these regions are subsequently extracted to make the vessels visible, it is unclear how the regions covered by the enlarged representation should be represented in the image.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another relatively new method, a dual-energy image recording is used to calculate two different images on the basis of this recording, wherein one of the two images represents the structures laden with calcium and the other of the two images represents regions that are laden with contrast agent. In the contrast agent image, therefore, neither bones nor calcifications of the vessels are visible. Although, in this way, enlarged representations of the calcifications in the image are prevented and information regarding the regions otherwise covered by the enlarged structures is present, the problem still persists that previously used contrast agents such as iodine, and bones or calcifications are very similar with respect to their spectral absorption behavior in the energy range of X-ray recordings (40 keV to 140 keV). This means that for both materials, the X-ray absorption at low energies increases sharply. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the absorption is represented for a recording at a low energy (labelled E(<b>1</b>)) and a recording at a higher energy (labelled E(<b>2</b>)). Due to the similar behavior of the conventional contrast agent iodine and of calcium, the resultant material images have a high level of image noise and an imprecise material separation. Although the problem of a high level of image noise and of imprecise material separation can be solved by way of a significant increase in the radiation dose, this measure entails a greater health risk to the patient and, for some examination types such as coronary angiography, cannot be realized due to technical limitations.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The problem therefore exists of realizing qualitatively good vessel imaging with a low radiation dose.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This object is achieved with an X-ray contrast agent in accordance with claim <b>1</b>, an X-ray imaging method in accordance with claim <b>5</b>, an image reconstruction facility in accordance with claim <b>9</b> and an X-ray imaging system in accordance with claim <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The X-ray contrast agent according to example embodiments of the present invention has an X-ray absorption the change of which between at least two different X-ray photon energies differs significantly from the change in the X-ray absorption of calcium between the at least two different X-ray photon energies.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Ideally, the absorption by the X-ray contrast agent according to example embodiments of the present invention between the at least two different X-ray photon energies should remain almost constant. &#x201c;Significantly&#x201d; should be understood in this context to mean that the change amounts to less than half the change in calcium at the selected different X-ray photon energies.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Advantageously, the spectrally deviating behavior of the contrast agent according to example embodiments of the present invention can be used to represent regions which are flooded by the contrast agent separately from other image regions that are calcified or partially calcified. In particular, in the angiographic representation of vessels, more precise values for the opening width of the vessels represented and the accuracy of the representation is improved in comparison with conventionally used contrast agents. Therefore, the X-ray contrast agent according to example embodiments of the present invention can advantageously be used for the imaging representation of blood vessels, since thereby the internal diameter of vessels can be represented particularly exactly.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the X-ray imaging method according to example embodiments of the present invention, initially a selection of a contrast agent according to the present invention takes place. Furthermore, X-ray raw data is captured from a region of an examination object which is flooded by the contrast agent with the aid of a multi-energy recording method. The X-ray imaging method according to example embodiments of the present invention can be carried out as a computer-implemented method on the basis of the captured data.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">On the basis of the X-ray raw data, a material decomposition into data that is to be assigned to either the contrast agent according to example embodiments of the present invention or to calcium takes place.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Material decomposition, which is known in principle, proceeds from the consideration that an X-ray attenuation value measured by means of an X-ray image recording apparatus can be described as a linear combination of X-ray attenuation values of so-called base materials with regard to the aforementioned X-ray quantum energy distribution and/or X-ray photon energy. Measured X-ray attenuation values result from the at least two raw datasets and/or image datasets reconstructed therefrom at different X-ray quantum energy distributions. The material and/or base material in the application according to embodiments of the present invention are firstly calcium and secondly the X-ray contrast agent according to embodiments of the present invention. The X-ray attenuation of a base material dependent upon the energy of the X-ray radiation is, in principle, known or can be determined by way of prior measurements with phantoms and stored in the form of tables for retrieval in the context of the material decomposition. The result of the material decomposition is a spatial density distribution of the at least two materials, i.e. of the contrast agent according to embodiments of the present invention and of calcium in the patient, from which for each volume element in the body region of the patient that is to be imaged, the base material portions and/or the base material combination can be ascertained.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The material decomposition can both relate directly to the raw data and can also take place on the basis of the reconstructed image data. In any event, in the context of the method, at least two image datasets are generated on the basis of spectrally decomposed data, whether raw data or image data: the at least two image datasets comprise a first image dataset, which represents a first image region affected by the contrast agent according to embodiments of the present invention, and a second image dataset, which represents a second image region which is preferably complementary to the first image region in which calcium-containing structures are made visible.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the case of a complementary representation of the first and second image dataset, regions affected by the contrast agent according to embodiments of the present invention and calcium-containing structures can be visualized together in an image, for example, by way of an overlaying of the two image datasets, wherein the relative position of the different structures and/or materials and the spatial separation and/or boundary surfaces between these different structures and/or materials are readily recognizable.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">If the different materials represented by the two image datasets are present intermingled, then for separate visualization of the different materials, a separate representation of each of the first and the second image datasets in two separate images can take place.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The X-ray imaging method according to embodiments of the present invention enables a separate representation of calcium-containing image regions and those affected by the contrast agent according to embodiments of the present invention. In this way, for example, a more precise representation of the internal diameter of vessels can be achieved, which contributes to a more reliable diagnosis on the basis of angiographic image data. In addition, due to the different spectral absorption properties of the contrast agent according to embodiments of the present invention and the remaining materials to be imaged, the X-ray dose can be selected lower than with conventional imaging methods.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The image reconstruction facility according to embodiments of the present invention has an ascertaining unit for ascertaining at least two different X-ray photon energies at which a contrast agent according to embodiments of the present invention differs significantly from the change in the X-ray absorption of calcium between the at least two different X-ray photon energies.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The selection of the energy values can be taken into account in the context of a multi-energy recording method in the selection of the energies and/or mean energy values of the X-ray sources used for imaging. If counting detectors are used for capturing the X-ray radiation, then energy thresholds and/or intervals can be selected so that the aforementioned energy values are included.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Also a part of the image reconstruction facility according to embodiments of the present invention is a raw data receiving unit for receiving X-ray raw data from a region of an examination object which is at least partially flooded by the contrast agent, with the aid of a multi-energy recording method.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The image reconstruction facility according to embodiments of the present invention also comprises a decomposition unit for carrying out a material decomposition on the basis of the X-ray raw data in relation to the contrast agent and calcium and a reconstruction unit for reconstructing at least two image datasets on the basis of the material decomposition. Such material decompositions are known, in principle, for the imaging representation of a plurality of materials with the aid of dual-energy imaging or multi-energy imaging, as described above.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The at least two image datasets comprise a first image dataset which represents a first image region which is affected by the contrast agent, and a second image dataset which preferably represents a second image region which is complementary to the first image region. The image reconstruction facility according to embodiments of the present invention shares the advantages of the X-ray imaging method according to embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The X-ray imaging system according to embodiments of the present invention has an image reconstruction unit according to embodiments of the present invention. The X-ray imaging system according to embodiments of the present invention can preferably comprise a CT angiography facility. The X-ray contrast agent according to embodiments of the present invention can advantageously be used, in particular, for the imaging representation of blood vessels, since thereby the internal diameter of vessels can be represented particularly exactly.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The essential components of the image reconstruction facility according to embodiments of the present invention can be configured mainly in the form of software components. This relates, in particular, to the decomposition unit and the reconstruction unit of the image reconstruction facility according to embodiments of the present invention. Fundamentally however, these components can also, in part, be realized in particular, if particularly rapid calculations are involved, in the form of software-supported hardware, for example, FPGAs or the like. Similarly, the required interfaces can be configured, for example, where only an acceptance of data from other software components is concerned, as software interfaces. However, they can also be configured as interfaces which are constructed as hardware and are controlled by suitable software.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A realization largely with software has the advantage that conventionally used imaging systems and/or image reconstruction facilities can also be upgraded by easy means with a software update in order to operate in the manner according to embodiments of the present invention. In this respect, the object is also achieved by means of a corresponding computer program product with a computer program which can be loaded directly into a storage facility of an X-ray imaging system, having program portions in order to carry out the steps of the X-ray imaging method according to embodiments of the present invention that can be realized with software when the program is executed in the X-ray imaging system. Such a computer program product can comprise, apart from the computer program, additional components, if relevant, such as for example, documentation and/or additional components including hardware components, for example hardware keys (dongles, etc.), in order to use the software.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For transport to the subsystem and/or for storage at or in this subsystem, a computer-readable medium, for example a memory stick, a hard disk or another transportable or firmly installed data carrier can be used on which the program portions of the computer program which can be read in and executed by a computer unit are stored. For this purpose, the computer unit can have, for example, one or more cooperating microprocessors or the like. The computer unit can be, for example, part of a terminal or a control facility of an imaging system, for example a CT system, but can also be part of a remotely arranged server system within a data transfer network which communicates with the imaging system.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The dependent claims and the description below each contain particularly advantageous embodiments and developments of the present invention.

For the visualization of the absorption of the materials mentioned, the mass absorption coefficient K is shown dependent upon the energy EPH of the X-ray photons. Furthermore, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a typical mean energy E(<b>1</b>) of an image recording with a low energy and the mean energy E(<b>2</b>) of an image recording with the high energy of a dual-energy image recording is shown. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the progression of the two curves of the mass absorption coefficient of iodine I and of calcium Ca is very similar. It must therein be taken into account that the materials iodine and calcium can be present in different densities and concentrations. This has the result that, in the most unfavorable case, the absorption curves shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> overlap one another completely. A pictorial separation of the two materials is then no longer possible.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a graphical representation <b>20</b> that illustrates absorption values Is of the contrast agent iodine I and the material tungsten W dependent upon the tube voltage VT of an X-ray device. Whereas the X-ray absorption of iodine decreases with increasing energy, the X-ray absorption of tungsten W decreases only slightly with increasing energy.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052">Particularly in a dual-energy image recording at a low energy of 80 kV and a higher energy of 140 kV or 150 kV with a tin filter, the X-ray absorption Is of tungsten W changes practically not at all as compared with the X-ray absorption of iodine. Therefore, image points at which the two individual recordings are generated with different tube voltages can easily be associated with one of the two contrast agents. For example, a point at which the absorption is the same in the two images is clearly attributable to the material tungsten and a point at which the absorption in the two images is strongly different is clearly attributable to the material iodine.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a graphical representation <b>30</b> that illustrates the absorption properties of the contrast agents iodine I and tungsten W as well as those of calcium Ca and water H2O, dependent upon the energy EPH of the X-ray photons. For each of the materials mentioned, the mass absorption coefficient K is shown dependent upon the energy EPH of the X-ray photons. It is clearly apparent in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> that the absorption of the contrast agent iodine I and of the bone material calcium Ca decreases greatly in the region from 40 to 80 keV with increasing photon energy EPH. It should be noted that therein the absorption is shown logarithmically. In contrast thereto, tungsten W behaves more like water H2O. That is, the absorption of tungsten W for a first photon energy E(<b>1</b>), which is at approximately 45 keV, is equal to the absorption at a second photon energy E(<b>2</b>) which is at approximately 80 keV. Due to the strongly differing behavior of tungsten W as compared with calcium Ca, image regions which are laden with tungsten W can readily be separated or separately represented from regions in which calcium Ca prevails.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a flow diagram <b>400</b> which illustrates an X-ray imaging method according to an example embodiment of the present invention. In the step <b>4</b>.I, initially a contrast agent based upon the element tungsten is selected for an angiographic imaging of an examination region of a patient, for example, the skull of the patient. Furthermore, in the step <b>4</b>.II, X-ray raw data RD that has been recorded from a region of an examination object O which is flooded with the selected contrast agent with the aid of a dual-energy recording method is captured. In the method visualized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, X-ray raw data that has been recorded with X-rays at two different energy values E(<b>1</b>) and E(<b>2</b>) is captured. The energy values are therein selected such that the absorption behavior of the selected contrast agent based upon the material tungsten is the same for both the energy values in this example embodiment. This process can be realized, for example, by way of the use of two detectors arranged spatially separated from one another, wherein a filter is introduced into the beam path in front of one of the two detectors, said filter filtering out part of the spectrum of the X-rays. Thus, two raw datasets to which different X-ray energies E(<b>1</b>) and E(<b>2</b>) are assigned are captured.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055">In step <b>4</b>.III, a reconstruction of two image datasets BD<b>1</b>, BD<b>2</b> takes place on the basis of the two raw datasets generated in step <b>4</b>.II. Therein a first image dataset BD<b>1</b> is generated which represents a first image region affected by the contrast agent tungsten, and a second image dataset BD<b>2</b> is generated which represents a second image region, which is complementary to the first image region, and in which calcium-based structures are made visible. The creation of the two image datasets BD<b>1</b>, BD<b>2</b> can take place, for example, with the aid of a material decomposition on the basis of the raw data acquired in step <b>4</b>.II.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a reconstruction facility <b>50</b>. The reconstruction facility <b>50</b> has an ascertaining unit <b>51</b>. The ascertaining unit <b>51</b> receives information regarding the contrast agent K to be used and establishes values E(<b>1</b>), E(<b>2</b>) of two different X-ray photon energies at which a selected contrast agent K behaves like water, i.e. the absorption is the same for both energy values. However, the image regions laden with calcium that are to be separated from the contrast agent K have, in energy regions that can be used by X-ray devices, a clear spectral dependence of the absorption and can therefore easily be differentiated at the established energy values E(<b>1</b>), E(<b>2</b>) from the selected contrast agent K. The selection of the energy values E(<b>1</b>), E(<b>2</b>) can take place, for example, on the basis of energy-dependent absorption values of the selected contrast agent K stored in a data store.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057">The selection of the energy values E(<b>1</b>), E(<b>2</b>) can be taken into account, in the context of a multi-energy recording method, in the selection of the energies and/or mean energy values of the X-ray sources used for imaging. If counting detectors are used for capturing the X-ray radiation, then energy thresholds and/or intervals can be selected so that the energy values mentioned are included.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058">The reconstruction facility <b>50</b> also has a raw data receiving unit <b>52</b> for receiving X-ray raw data RD. The raw data RD has been acquired with the aid of a dual-energy CT method from a region of an examination object which is partially flooded by the contrast agent K.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0059">The raw data RD is passed on to a decomposition unit <b>53</b> which carries out a material decomposition of the raw data RD on the basis of the X-ray raw data RD in relation to the contrast agent K and calcium. The material-specific portions MA<b>1</b>, MA<b>2</b> of the raw data which are associated with the individual absorption spectra of the different materials are transferred to the reconstruction unit <b>54</b> which reconstructs at least two image datasets BD<b>1</b>, BD<b>2</b> on the basis of the material-specific portions MA<b>1</b>, MA<b>2</b>. A first image dataset BD<b>1</b> visualizes a first image region affected by the contrast agent and a second image dataset BD<b>2</b> visualizes a second image region which is complementary to the first image region, and in which structures laden with calcium or structures contrasted with iodine prevail. The image datasets BD<b>1</b>, BD<b>2</b> generated are output by means of an output interface <b>55</b>, for example, to a display unit, a data storage unit or a control computer with an image display.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an X-ray imaging system, in this case a CT system <b>60</b>, according to an example embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">The CT system <b>60</b> which is configured as a dual-energy CT system, substantially consists therein of a typical scanner <b>9</b> in which a projection measurement data acquisition unit <b>5</b> with two detectors <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>and two X-ray sources <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>arranged opposite the two detectors <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>circulates on a gantry <b>11</b> round a measurement space <b>12</b>. Situated in front of the scanner <b>9</b> is a patient positioning apparatus <b>3</b> and/or a patient table <b>3</b>, the upper part <b>2</b> of which can be displaced with a patient O situated thereon toward the scanner <b>9</b>, in order to move the patient O through the measurement space <b>12</b> relative to the detector system <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The scanner <b>9</b> and the patient table <b>3</b> are controlled by way of a control facility <b>31</b> from which acquisition control signals AS come via a conventional control interface <b>34</b> in order to control the whole system in the conventional manner according to predetermined scan protocols. In the case of a spiral acquisition, by way of a movement of the patient O along the z-direction which corresponds to the system axis z through the measurement space <b>12</b> and the simultaneous circulation of the X-ray sources <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, for the X-ray sources <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>relative to the patient O during the scan, a helical path results. The detectors <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>therein always move in parallel relative to the X-ray sources <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, in order to capture projection measurement data PMD<b>1</b>, PMD<b>2</b> which is then used for the reconstruction of volume and/or slice image data. Similarly, a sequential scanning method can also be carried out in which a fixed position in the z-direction is approached and then, during a circulation, a partial circulation or a plurality of circulations at the z-position in question, the required projection measurement data PMD<b>1</b>, PMD<b>2</b> is captured, in order to reconstruct a sectional image at this z-position or to reconstruct image data from the projection measurement data of a plurality of z-positions. The method according to embodiments of the present invention can also in principle be used with other CT systems, for example, with just one X-ray source or with a detector forming a complete ring. For example, the inventive method can also be used on a system with an unmoved patient table and a gantry moved in the z-direction (a so-called sliding gantry).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062">The projection measurement data PMD<b>1</b>, PMD<b>2</b> (also referred to here as raw data) acquired from the detectors <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>is transferred via a raw data interface <b>33</b> to the control facility <b>31</b>. This raw data is then further processed, possibly after a suitable pre-processing in a reconstruction facility <b>50</b> which, in this example embodiment, is realized in the control facility <b>31</b> in the form of software on a processor. This reconstruction facility <b>50</b> reconstructs, on the basis of the raw data PMD<b>1</b>, PMD<b>2</b>, two image datasets BD<b>1</b>, BD<b>2</b> of which a first image dataset BD<b>1</b> visualizes vessel structures affected by a contrast agent K according to embodiments of the present invention and a second image dataset BD<b>2</b> visualizes bone structures and calcified or partially calcified regions in the vessels.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0063">The exact configuration of such a reconstruction facility <b>50</b> is illustrated in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0064">The image data BD<b>1</b>, BD<b>2</b> generated by the reconstruction facility <b>50</b> is then stored in a memory store <b>32</b> of the control facility <b>31</b> and/or is output in the usual manner on the screen of the control facility <b>31</b>. Thus, by means of an interface (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), it can also be fed into a network connected to the computed tomography system <b>60</b>, for example, a radiological information system (RIS), and stored in a mass memory store accessible there or output as images to printers or filming stations connected there. The data can thus be further processed in any desired manner and then stored or output.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0065">In addition in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a contrast agent injection facility <b>35</b> is shown, with which a contrast agent K is injected into the patient O in advance, that is before the start of the CT imaging method. The regions which are flooded by the contrast agent K and bone structures and (partially) calcified regions can then be captured in image form with the aid of the computed tomography system <b>60</b> using the X-ray imaging method according to embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0066">The components of the reconstruction facility <b>50</b> can be realized mainly or entirely in the form of software elements on a suitable processor.
