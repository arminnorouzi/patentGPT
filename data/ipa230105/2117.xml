id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to recyclable woven plastic bags, and more particularly to recyclable woven plastic bags formed with a quad-seal and/or K-seal.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional plastic bags of a wide variety of size and shape are used in various situations. Bulk materials, such as flour, sugar, rice, seed, animal feed, chemicals, powdered materials or the like, for example, typically have been packaged in woven plastic bags in the past. Pet food, bird seed and other products sold in retail stores typically have not been packaged in conventional woven plastic bags. Among other reasons for this, woven plastic bags were considered too rudimentary to be printed with high end graphics suitable for consumer type of packaging. In addition, the high speed requirements in the filling and packaging operations limited the use of the woven bags in these applications.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Laminated woven sacks (LWS) were developed using a woven polypropylene structure laminated to a bi-oriented polypropylene film (BOPP) that can be reverse printed with high end graphics suitable for consumer type of packaging. The LWS provides a stronger, more attractive bag than the more conventional multiwall bags used for that purpose over the last 20 years. Due to their tough strong structure, conventional LWS bags are typically sewn shut on both ends. These LWS recently met with success and have been successfully substituted for the conventional multiwall paper bags used in the pet food industry for many years.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One major drawback of the sewn LWS has been the closing of the bags at high speed filling lines, such as those for filling such bags with pet food. Experience has shown that sewing production lines are typically slower than the filling of the multiwall pinch bottom bags. Additionally, the sewn bags do not provide an aesthetically pleasing and useful clean display on the ends of the bags, thus making it difficult for consumers to identify or find a desired brand quickly when the bags are displayed on the shelves at the point of sale, such as when they are stacked on top of one another. In addition, the sewn ends required puncturing the plastic bags and thus result in a bag that is not sealed, leading to somewhat reduced shelf-life and possible infestation of the contents of the bag.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Woven plastic bags have been used and are conventional for certain applications. An example of a conventional woven plastic bag is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 4,373,979 (&#x201c;the '979 patent&#x201d;), issued on Feb. 15, 1983. The '979 patent describes the use of woven strips of highly longitudinally-oriented, high-density polyethylene or polypropylene in a bag construction in which the bag is formed from a seamed tube made of the woven plastic material. The seamed tube has gussets on either side and, when a portion is cut from the rest of the tube, a bag having two open, unsealed ends is provided. The '979 patent describes the use of ultrasonic spot welds to seal portions of a bag made of such woven plastic strips, as opposed to sewing the seams of a bag or using a hot melt adhesive to seal the gusset forming pleat. The '979 patent is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The '979 patent purports to be an improvement for sealing a plastic bag. As noted in the '979 patent, sewing one end tends to take longer, thus adding time to the manufacturing process. In addition, the sewn ends in a conventional bag tend to be a weak portion of the bag, and a likely location for rips, tearing, and subsequent loss of contents during storing, shipping and handling. In addition, such bags may not provide sufficient protection from infestation from vermin and/or insects.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another example of plastic bags is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication Number US 2010/0029455 A1 (&#x201c;the '455 publication&#x201d;), published on Feb. 4, 2010, which describes production of web sections from a flexible web material that is provided with tear-off lines produced by laser beam processing at the distance of the length of the web sections to be formed. The tear-off lines weaken the flexible web material, but do not result in complete separation of the web sections from the web material, which occurs upon tearing the flexible web material. The '455 publication is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">More recently, some types of plastic bags have provided improvements in sealing the ends of the bags. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,051 B2 (&#x201c;the '051 patent&#x201d;), issued on Oct. 5, 2004, a process for sealing side fold sacks made of plastic film is described. According to the '051 patent, a web of plastic tubular film is cut to provide a staggered detachment along a perforation so that one wall (e.g., the front wall) projects beyond the opposing wall (e.g., the back wall). The projecting portion of the first wall is then folded over and sealed to the opposing wall by means of a plastic adhesive such as a polyurethane adhesive or hot melt. The '051 patent is hereby incorporated by reference herein. However, such bags involve plastic films, not woven plastic materials, and therefore are unable to handle the weight loads of conventional bulk bags made of paper and other materials. Such bags are useful for only certain lightweight contents, such as bread.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are a variety of conventional ways of providing for reusable openings in bags. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,478,465 B1 (&#x201c;the '465 patent&#x201d;), issued Nov. 12, 2002, describes a peelable opening in a multiwall, pinched bottom open mouth bag construction. The '465 patent also describes the use of an adhesive layer that can be used so that the bag opening is reclosable. The '465 patent is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other types of conventional plastic bags, such as those used in retail and grocery stores, the use of weakened portion provided by one or more perforations in the plastic bag wall is known. A number of approaches have been taken in connection with such bags, including those shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,235 (the '235 patent), issued Feb. 23, 1993, as well as in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2005/0087542 A1 (the '542 application), published Apr. 28, 2005, U.S. Pat. No. 5,979,655 (the '655 patent), issued Nov. 9, 1999, and U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2006/0072856 (the '856 application), issued Apr. 6, 2006. However, none of these bags are woven bags, let alone bags with multiple layers. The '235 patent, the '655 patent, the '542 application, and the '856 application are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Newly developed pinch laminated woven sacks overcome these drawbacks in the filling and closing operations while allowing an attractive graphic display of the bags' ends at the retail outlet and also providing a strong, durable bag which remains sealed. However, such bags still remain susceptible to leakage, breakage and infestation at both ends of the seam and in the area along the top and bottom of the gussets. There is a need for such a pinch bottom laminated woven sack that includes one or more feature(s) that prevent leakage, breakage and/or infestation at both ends of the seam and in the area along the top and bottom of the gussets. Moreover, the bag needs to be strong enough to avoid leakage, breakage or infestation, which can begin with a small opening or crack that then gets larger over time, such as with additional forces or movement of the bag. At the same time, however, it is desirable to avoid &#x201c;solutions&#x2019; that require additional plastic material, additional adhesive material, such as for extra strength, or that slow the speed of manufacture. Such &#x201c;solutions&#x201d; increase the cost of the bag.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Typically woven and non-woven bags are sealed with a single or double fold at each end with tape over the single or double fold, stitching at both ends, or a zipper at one end and a single or double fold at the other end. However, opening woven and certain non-woven bags has proven difficult due to the strength of the bag. Therefore, what is needed are woven and non-woven bags that are easier to open, that do not add much to the cost or time to manufacture, and are not susceptible to inadvertent tearing, punctures, breaking, or the like.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure provides woven plastic bags comprising one or more features that prevent leakage and/or infestation at both ends of the seam and in the area along the top and bottom of the gussets as well as recyclable woven plastic bags comprising at least one of a quad-seal or a K-seal.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure provides bags that have certain sections that are separated by an angled portion or edge, a curved portion or edge, or a combination thereof, and/or bags that comprise a cut-out and corresponding tab at opposing ends of the bag proximal to the portions of the back wall that form the seam.

embodiments of the present invention is described here with specificity to meet statutory requirements, but this description is not necessarily intended to limit the scope of the claims. The claimed subject matter may be embodied in other ways, may include different elements or steps, and may be used in conjunction with other existing or future technologies. This description should not be interpreted as implying any particular order or arrangement among or between various steps or elements except when the order of individual steps or arrangement of elements is explicitly described. Directional references such as &#x201c;up,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;down,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;left,&#x201d; &#x201c;right,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; among others, are intended to refer to the orientation as illustrated and described in the figure (or figures) to which the components and directions are referencing. These references are for the convenience of the reader and are not limiting with respect to the scope of the disclosure or the claims. For the purposes of this disclosure, &#x201c;recyclable&#x201d; means that an item, e.g., a bag, is formed from substantially a single material, e.g., polyethylene, and contains no more than approximately 20%, or approximately 10%, or approximately 5% of other materials that would prevent the recycling of the item, such as by melting the bags or portions thereof back into feed stock pellets. Additionally, for the purposes of this disclosure, the use of &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; means that the described object is limited to substantially only the listed material(s) and contains no substantial amount of any other material that would prevent recycling.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a planar view of an embodiment of a substantially flat sheet of material from which a &#x201c;step cut&#x201d; bag <b>1</b> is to be formed is shown. Shown on the sheet are front wall <b>2</b>, rear wall <b>3</b>, seam <b>4</b>, first side wall <b>5</b> having gusset portion <b>6</b>, and second side wall <b>7</b> having gusset portion <b>8</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the bag <b>1</b> has a first or top end <b>9</b> and a second or bottom end <b>10</b>, and thus each of the front wall <b>2</b>, rear wall <b>3</b>, first side wall <b>5</b> and second side wall <b>7</b> has a first or top end and a second or bottom end. It will be apparent, however, that the orientation of the bag ends <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> are unimportant and the &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; references are useful but may change depending upon the orientation from which one views the bag. Bag <b>1</b> is considered a &#x201c;step cut&#x201d; bag because the front wall <b>2</b>, the first side wall <b>5</b> and the second side wall <b>7</b>, and the rear wall <b>3</b> are cut so that the front wall <b>2</b>, the first side wall <b>5</b> and the second side wall <b>7</b>, and the rear wall <b>3</b> have different lengths on one end (or both ends) of the bag. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first side wall <b>5</b> and the second side wall <b>7</b> are cut to different lengths on either side of the gusset portion <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the first end <b>9</b> of bag <b>1</b> has portions <b>3</b> <i>a </i>and <b>3</b> <i>b </i>of the rear wall <b>3</b> of the bag that extend further from the body of the bag <b>1</b> than do portions <b>5</b> <i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>a </i>of the first side wall <b>5</b> and second side wall <b>7</b>, respectively, which in turn extend further from the body of the bag <b>1</b> than do portions <b>5</b> <i>b </i>and <b>7</b><i>b </i>of the first side wall <b>5</b> and second side wall <b>7</b>, respectively, which in turn extend further from the body of the bag <b>1</b> than does the top end of the front wall <b>2</b> of the bag <b>1</b>. In addition, the bottom end of the front wall <b>2</b> at the second end <b>10</b> of bag <b>1</b> extends further from the body of the bag <b>1</b> than do portions <b>5</b><i>c </i>and <b>7</b><i>c </i>of the first side wall <b>5</b> and second side wall <b>7</b>, respectively, which in turn extend further from the body of the bag <b>1</b> than do portions <b>5</b><i>d </i>and <b>7</b><i>d </i>of the first side wall <b>5</b> and second side wall <b>7</b>, respectively, which in turn extend further from the body of the bag <b>1</b> than do portions <b>3</b><i>c </i>and <b>3</b><i>d </i>the bottom end of the rear wall <b>3</b> of the bag <b>1</b>. Therefore, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> both of the ends of the bag <b>1</b> have a &#x201c;step cut.&#x201d; Also shown is weakened portion <b>20</b>, which in this embodiment is near the first end <b>9</b> of the bag <b>1</b> and comprises a plurality of perforations <b>21</b> extending from a first end <b>21</b><i>a </i>on the front wall <b>2</b> of the bag <b>1</b> across the first side wall <b>5</b> of the bag <b>1</b> to a second end <b>21</b><i>b </i>on the rear wall <b>3</b> of the bag <b>1</b>. The weakened area is generally on or near the fold line (not shown) for closing or sealing the first end <b>9</b> of the bag <b>1</b>. This weakened portion can be opened with less force than required to open or tear other portions of the bag <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the upper portion of the bag <b>1</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is shown after sealing the first end <b>9</b> of the bag <b>1</b>.

Bag <b>1</b> is opened by initially pulling on the portions <b>3</b>&#x2032; and <b>3</b>&#x2033; of the rear wall <b>3</b> on both sides of the plurality of perforations <b>21</b>, which creates a tear in the weakened portion <b>20</b> of the bag <b>1</b> and begins separating the portions of the first side wall <b>5</b> that are separated by the gusset portion <b>6</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> the portions <b>3</b>&#x2032; and <b>3</b>&#x2033; of the rear wall <b>3</b> on both sides of the plurality of perforations <b>21</b> are further pulled apart, resulting in the expansion of the tear in the weakened portion <b>20</b> toward the second end <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the plurality of perforations <b>21</b>. Additionally visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> are front wall <b>2</b>, back wall <b>3</b> having portions <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, seam <b>4</b>, and first side wall <b>5</b> having gusset portion <b>6</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> the portions <b>3</b>&#x2032; and <b>3</b>&#x2033; of the rear wall <b>3</b> on both sides of the plurality of perforations <b>21</b> are pulled completely apart, resulting in the expansion of the tear in the weakened portion <b>20</b> further toward the second end <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the plurality of perforations <b>21</b> and to the first end <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the plurality of perforations (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).

Although not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the optional adhesive can also be applied near the top end of the second side wall. Although shown as a spot in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the adhesive can be applied in any manner that results in the closure of the top end of the first side wall <b>5</b>, for example as a strip that runs from the edge of the intersection of the first side wall <b>5</b> and the back wall <b>3</b> to the edge of the intersection of the first side wall <b>5</b> and the front wall <b>2</b>.

For example, it has been found that a bag <b>1</b> with dimensions of 16.5 inches by 6.5 inches by 39.5 inches can durably hold up to about fifty five (55) pounds of material without showing undue stress, undue tearing, undue breakage, undue deformation, or leakage or the like. It is believed that any bulk material can be contained by bag <b>1</b>, and in certain embodiments the contents can weigh up to 100 pounds or so without undue risk of tearing or damage to bag <b>1</b>. Once the bag <b>1</b> is filled, the second end typically needs to be sealed. The second end of the bag <b>1</b> can be sealed in a similar manner as that described above. Alternatively, the bag <b>1</b> can have its second end sealed by conventional means such as sewing. Still another approach is to stitch the second end, and then seal the second end in a manner like that described above (not shown). Although not shown, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a second end of bag <b>1</b> can be sealed using any conventional technique once bag <b>1</b> has been filled with the selected amount of the desired material.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a planar view of an embodiment of a substantially flat sheet of material from which a &#x201c;step cut&#x201d; bag <b>101</b> is to be formed is shown.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the portions <b>403</b><i>a </i>and <b>405</b><i>a</i>, <b>405</b><i>b </i>and <b>402</b><i>a</i>, <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>407</b><i>b</i>, <b>407</b><i>a </i>and <b>403</b><i>b</i>, <b>403</b><i>c </i>and <b>405</b><i>d</i>, <b>405</b><i>c </i>and <b>402</b><i>c</i>, <b>402</b><i>c </i>and <b>407</b><i>c</i>, and <b>407</b><i>d </i>and <b>403</b><i>d</i>, respectively, are separated from one another not by straight lines and right angles but by curved portions or edges, which in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> are shown as radial (circular) elements. Although one particular size and shape of radial portion is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, for the features between the foregoing portions, those skilled in the art will appreciate that in other embodiments (not shown), these radial portions can be as small or as large as desired. In addition, the portions <b>405</b><i>a </i>and <b>405</b><i>b</i>, <b>407</b><i>a </i>and <b>407</b><i>b</i>, <b>405</b><i>c </i>and <b>405</b><i>d</i>, and <b>407</b><i>c </i>and <b>407</b><i>d</i>, respectively, are not defined or separated by a radial portion or edge, but rather an angled portion or edge (see circles). Although in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> this angled portion is shown as about 45&#xb0; with respect to the top end of the front wall, the angle can vary in different embodiments (not shown). These radial and angled portions serve to further prevent breakage, leakage of contents out of the bag, or infestation of organisms into the contents of the bag, by providing extra material at one end of the bag that improves sealing. Further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is cut-out <b>411</b> and corresponding tab <b>412</b> at opposing ends of the seam <b>404</b>. Since the bag <b>401</b> is formed from a continuous sheet of material, the formation of the cut-out <b>411</b> (removal of material) at one end of the bag <b>401</b> results in a tab <b>412</b> (extra material) at the other end of the bag <b>401</b>. The cut out <b>411</b> and tab <b>412</b> extend into the seam <b>404</b>, and also serve to further prevent breakage, leakage of contents out of the bag, or infestation of organisms into the contents of the bag. This is because since extra material can be present between the seam <b>404</b> of the bag and the edge of the rear panel <b>403</b><i>b </i>of the bag that is not sealed, a hole can be present that can serve as an access point into or out of the sealed bag. But the presence of the cut-out <b>411</b> and the tab <b>412</b> ensures that the ends of any such hole will be sealed, preventing access into or out of the sealed bag. The cut-out <b>411</b> and tab <b>412</b> can be any depth/height desired, and can extend further into the seam as desired (not shown). Although in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> the cut-out <b>411</b> and tab <b>412</b> are shown as extending from within the seam <b>404</b> to the edge of the rear panel <b>403</b><i>b </i>of the bag, in other embodiments (not shown) the cut-out and tab can extend from within the seam <b>404</b> only a portion of the distance to the edge of the rear panel <b>403</b><i>b </i>of the bag <b>401</b>. Furthermore as shown, the tab and cut-out are illustrated as primarily rectangular in shape. It is understood that the shape is not limited to rectangles but can also be configured as an angular or rounded cut-out and matching tab as long as the configuration fits together to form a seal effective to prevent leakage or infestation. Additionally, in other embodiments (not shown), the bag can comprise an easy open or easy access feature, such as the weakened portion near the top of the bag as shown herein above (for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), or the easy open features detailed in United States Patent Application Publication Number US 2013/0206631 and United States Patent Application Publication Number US 2013/0209002, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a planar view of the top portion of an embodiment of a substantially flat sheet of material from which a bag <b>501</b> is to be formed is shown.

In certain embodiments the bags are composed of two or more laminated layers including an inner layer comprised of woven polymer strips. Polymer strips can be extruded polyethylene or polypropylene cut into flat strips of about &#x215b; to &#xbc; inch in width and woven to produce a continuous woven sheet that is then cut into individual bag blanks. The woven layer can be laminated to a polymer film such as a polyester or polypropylene film, and the two layers can be laminated by a third polyethylene or polypropylene film that laminates the first two layers. The second layer of polymer film can also include graphics printed thereon including reverse printed graphics in order to provide an attractive display for commercial purposes. There are certain advantages to providing all three layers in the same polymer such as polypropylene or polyethylene, in that such bags are more easily recycled, for example. For example, a bag having its walls comprise a laminate which has two or three (or more) layers, wherein each of the bag wall layers comprises or consists essentially of the same polymer (such as polypropylene or polyethylene), may not use an adhesive material and thus is a non-adhesive laminate, is easy to recycle. Moreover, any scrap or unusable bags resulting from manufacturing can be recycled as well.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The woven strips create a bag with the requisite strength to hold large amounts of material under stress and are typically not used in smaller bags, holding ten pounds or less because of the increased cost and complexity of producing heavy duty bags. An inner layer of woven flat polymer strips is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> as inset <b>832</b>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">It should be understood that the perforations may include or may be replaced with cuts which are longer, and may include cuts in various shapes in addition to the thumb tab, and the bags of the present disclosure may have both cuts and perforations. In addition, the cuts and/or perforations may extend entirely through all layers of the bag wall, or may extend through one or more of the bag wall and not through one or more other layers. For example, the perforations may extend through one or more outer film layers and partially but not entirely through the woven layer. In addition, it is noted that the cuts and/or perforations may include one or more cuts and/or perforations which extend through all three bag layers and others which do not, and may include cuts and/or perforations which extend deeper through one or more layers than other cuts and/or perforations. It is further noted that the cuts and/or perforations may vary in size and/or in shape, such that, for example, one or more cuts or perforations are greater in length and/or width (and/or depth) than one or more other cuts and/or perforations.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The sealing tape and/or fibers may comprise polymers, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, or combinations thereof, and can include woven polymers or woven polymer strips. A bag may include two, three, or possibly more layers, as well as the tape and fibers, which may all comprise a single material composition, thus making it much easier to recycle a bag or scrap for manufacturing purposes and also to minimize the costs of the bag. For example, the bag wall layers (whether two, three, four, or more layers) may comprise a non-adhesive laminate which is made of a single polymer (such as polyethylene or polypropylene), with the strings and tape also made of the same material or combination thereof as the bag wall layers. In one embodiment, the strings may themselves comprise a braided or woven string with one or more separate fibers or strings braided together (or woven together) to provide greater strength.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In still another embodiment (not shown), a sealing tape and substantially parallel strings may be added to the interior surface of the bag wall. In such an embodiment, a pull tab is provided which extends from the tape and from the exterior surface of the bag wall, or a pull tab can be added to the tape. In such an embodiment, a customer can pull the pull tab and the tape may pull the bag wall defined by the cuts and/or perforations (i.e., the weakened area of the bag wall) with the tape, thus providing an opening for access to the bag contents.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the front side view of an embodiment of a &#x201c;flush cut&#x201d; bag <b>2001</b><i>a </i>is shown.

Once these portions are folded over, heat and pressure can be applied as appropriate to obtain and ensure that the bottom end <b>2110</b> of bag <b>2100</b> is durably sealed, such as with a conventional heat sealable adhesive.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Once the bag <b>2100</b> is sealed at one end, it can be filled with the desired materials. It has been found that a bag <b>2100</b> with a height of 41 inches and a width of 28 inches can durably hold at least about fifty (50) pounds of material without showing undue stress, tearing, breakage or the like. It is believed that any bulk material can be contained by bag <b>2100</b>, and the contents can weigh up to 100 pounds or so without undue risk of tearing or damage to bag <b>2100</b>. Once the bag <b>2100</b> is filled, the second end typically may be sealed. The second end of the bag <b>2100</b> can be sealed in a similar manner as that described above for the bottom end <b>2110</b>. Alternatively, the bag <b>2100</b> can have its second end sealed by conventional means such as sewing. Still another approach is to seal the second end in a manner like that described for the bottom end <b>2110</b> of the bag <b>2100</b>, and then stitching one of the two ends (not shown). Although not shown, it is noted that a second end of bag <b>2100</b> can be sealed with conventional techniques once bag <b>2100</b> has been filled with the selected amount of the desired material.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>, an isometric view of bag <b>2100</b><i>b </i>is provided.

The bag <b>3700</b> may be stacked on top of similar or different bags, such as at a grocery store, pet store, or other display location, such that panel <b>3707</b> is easily visible to a consumer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> the front panel <b>3701</b>, the first side panel <b>3709</b> and the bottom panel <b>3707</b> includes printing (and can also include graphics), and it is noted that the top panel, the rear panel, and the second side panel of bag <b>3700</b>, which are not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>, can also include graphics and/or printing. Thus bag <b>3700</b> has six discrete areas for printing and/or graphics, each formed by a discrete surface area of the bag <b>3700</b>. Additionally, the printing and/or graphics can extend across more than one panel, or any combination of the six panels (not shown). The panel <b>3707</b> may include graphics and/or printing so that a consumer is able to quickly, readily and easily identify the brand of the contents in the bag, such as the brand name for the pet food therein if the bag <b>3700</b> contains pet food. Alternatively, or in addition, the printing or graphics on the panel <b>3707</b> may contain information such as price, composition, expiration date, and the like. In another embodiment, the panel <b>3707</b> may contain printing or graphics that provide a coupon or other price discount or other offer, either on the contents of the bag <b>3700</b> or some other product.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a bag is provided that has a peelable, easy open feature. Such as the bag that is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>35</b> and <b>36</b></figref>. The bag has a front or first wall and an opposing back or second wall. The bag may have side walls, and the side walls may have gussets, all as described above in connection with the various embodiments described, or the bag may instead comprise a laminated bag, such as a bag having two or more laminated layers, or any other type of consumer goods packaging. In the following description, a laminated, woven bag is described as a specific example of a bag, but is provided only as an example. In the example of a woven bag as a particular embodiment, the bag has a top or first end, and a bottom or second end, with the first end of the back wall extending beyond the first end of the front wall. This extension of the top end of the back wall beyond the top end of the front wall may be anywhere from a fraction of an inch to four inches, six inches, eight inches, ten inches, or more, as may be desired. Each of the bag walls has an exterior surface and an interior surface. The bag walls may have a woven polymeric layer and one or more polymeric film layers, such as any of those described above in connection with the various bags described herein. The bag wall layers may comprise any one or more materials, including any type of polymer, polypropylene, polyethylene, high density or low density polyethylene, polyester, nylon, polyethylene terephthalate, polyester, polyamide, oriented polypropylene, biaxially-oriented polypropylene, oriented polyethylene, biaxially-oriented polyethylene, oriented polyester, biaxially-oriented polyester, nylon, oriented or biaxially-oriented nylon, oriented polyethylene terephthalate, biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate, oriented polyamide, biaxially-oriented polyamide, coated paper, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">A portion of the exterior surface of the front bag wall, the interior surface of the back bag wall, or both, may be treated to provide a preferential peelable, easy open area as described in more detail below. The treated portion of the surface(s) of the front and/or back bag wall(s) may be treated with a polyamide ink, a urethane-based ink, a nitrocellulose ink, or a combination of any of the foregoing, and may be treated in a particular pattern, such as a rectangular area, an elliptical area, a triangular area, or the like. It should be appreciated that the interior of the back wall and/or the exterior of the front wall may be treated with two or more inks or a combination of one or more inks and one or more treatments. For example, a first portion of the overlay portion can be treated with a first type of ink or subject to a first treatment, and a second portion of the overlay portion can be treated with a second, different ink and/or subject to a second, different treatment. Depending on the material selected for one or more of the bag layers, one or more different inks or treatments may be selected to provide the desired sealing strength control at the desired locations of the bag. For example, a polyamide resin or polyamide-based ink may provide less scaling strength than a nitrocellulose- or polyurethane-based ink or resin.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">The treated portion of the surface(s) of the front and/or back bag wall(s) is determined so that it is preferably proximal the top end of the front bag wall, such as within the top one, two, or three inches from the top end of the front bag wall when the back bag wall is folded over the top end of the bag and brought into contact with a portion of the exterior surface proximal the top end of the front bag wall. The treated portion may extend all or partially across the width of the front and/or back bag walls. For example, if it is desired to control the sealing strength so that the seal is stronger on the left hand side of the bag (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>35</b> and <b>36</b></figref>) than the right hand side, more ink may be used on the right hand side of the bag wall and/or no ink may be used on the left hand side. Alternatively, the ink may be applied to an area that extends across 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, or 100% of the bag's width from one side.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Once the front and/or back bag wall(s) have been treated, and a portion of the extending portion of the back bag wall has been folded over and brought into contact with a portion of the front bag wall proximal the top end of the bag, the overlaying portions of the front and back bag walls may be sealed, such as by applying heat and/or pressure in desired amounts for a desired time period, or by any of the sealing techniques described above in connection with any of the other embodiments described herein. This sealing may be done by passing the overlaying portions of the front and bag walls past a nozzle blowing heated air at or above a predetermined temperature or within a predetermined temperature range, or by applying heated clamps to opposing exterior surfaces of the overlaying portion of the front and bag walls, with the clamps applying a predetermined amount of pressure and at a predetermined temperature or above or within a predetermined temperature range. It is noted that the front and back bag walls may be sealed without the use of an adhesive, or, as described above, one or more adhesives may be used to seal the bag end.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">In addition, the sealing of the overlaying portions of the front and back bag walls may be done selectively, such that a portion of the back bag wall is not sealed to the front bag wall and forms a flap. The flap may extend along the width of the bag wall, or may extend for only a portion of the width of the bag wall. The flap and sealing of the front and back bag walls as described provides an easy open feature such that a consumer can grip the flap, such as at one side of the bag, and pull the flap upwards and/or away from the front wall of the bag. Because the strength of the seal has been controlled at the overlay portion of the front and back bag walls as desired, the consumer should be able to open the bag without a knife or for scissors. The flap may include one or more pull tabs to assist the consumer in gripping and pulling the flap, and may include printing and/or graphics to instruct and assist the consumer in how to open the bag.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>35</b> and <b>36</b></figref>, an example of one type of bag with a peelable, easy open feature of this type is illustrated. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>, a bag <b>3500</b> with a peelable, easy open feature is shown. The bag <b>3500</b> has a front wall <b>3501</b> and an opposing back wall (not shown), which are joined by side walls. The bag <b>3500</b> further has a top end <b>3510</b> and a bottom end <b>3505</b>. The bottom end <b>3505</b> can be of any type, including a stepped-cut bag, a pinch bag, a pouch bag, or other type, and can be sealed using any of the sealing techniques described herein, or may include a peelable, easy open feature or other type of easy open feature. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>, a portion <b>3515</b> of the back wall is folded over and forms the top end <b>3510</b> of the bag <b>3500</b>. At least a portion of the portion <b>3515</b> located above the line <b>3525</b> is sealed to the front wall <b>3501</b> of the bag <b>3500</b>. In this particular illustration, the interior surface of the portion <b>3515</b> of the back wall is sealed to the exterior surface of the front bag wall. It is noted that the extending portion of the back wall can be double-folded if desired so that an exterior surface of the back bag wall is scaled to the exterior surface of the front wall. It can be seen that a flap <b>3520</b> of the end of the back bag wall is not sealed to the front bag wall below the line <b>3525</b>. This flap <b>3520</b> can be gripped by a consumer and pulled to open the bag <b>3500</b> easily.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>, the exemplary bag <b>3500</b> is shown with a portion of the top end <b>3510</b> opened on the right hand side of the bag. The top end <b>3530</b> of the front wall <b>3501</b> of the bag <b>3500</b> is shown. It can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref> that the left-handed portion <b>3535</b> of the top end of the back wall is still sealed to the exterior surface of the front wall <b>3501</b>. It should be appreciated that a consumer can grip the flap <b>3520</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>) at the right-hand side of the bag and pull upwards and/or away from the bag front wall <b>3501</b> to open the bag <b>3500</b>. It should also be appreciated that the selective treatment of a portion or portions of the front and/or back bag walls as described herein allow for a controlled sealing area proximal the top end of the bag <b>3500</b>, such as to create one or more areas in which the front and back bag walls are sealed with a stronger seal than other areas, and/or one or more areas in which the front and back bag walls are sealed with a seal which is more easily separated, all without the use of an adhesive (although, as noted, an adhesive may be used to seal the top end of the bag <b>3500</b> if desired). By selectively controlling the area(s) treated with one or more inks, and by controlling the heat, pressure, and/or duration of the application of heat and pressure to selected areas of the overlaying portions of the front and back bag walls, a selective and more precise control of the location of the seal between the front and back bag walls as well as the local strength of such seals, may be attained. The local strength of the seal may vary, but yet provides sufficient strength to pass the applicable drop test, peel test, and the like and provides a strong, durable seal.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>37</b> through <b>48</b></figref>, various different examples of easy open features are shown. The views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>37</b> through <b>48</b></figref> show a wall of the bag that includes an easy open feature in a vertical orientation and a corresponding diagonal orientation.

Accordingly, easy open feature <b>3752</b> may be used with or without a sealing tape that covers easy open feature <b>3752</b>. It is further noted that a depth of easy open feature <b>3752</b> may vary in different embodiments. For example, easy open feature <b>3752</b> may include cuts, including perforations, that penetrate all layers of bag <b>3750</b>, in some embodiments.

Additionally, having the layered composition of the bags <b>5601</b>, <b>5701</b>, <b>5720</b> consist essentially of polyethylene allows the bags <b>5601</b>, <b>5701</b>, <b>5720</b> to be easily recycled, e.g., bags <b>5601</b>, <b>5701</b>, <b>5720</b> could be recycled at the plastic bag recycling location commonly found at grocery stores or anywhere else in the polyethylene recycling stream of infrastructure.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b></figref>, a planar view of an embodiment of substantially flat sheets of material from which a bag <b>5801</b> with a flat bottom and terminated gusset is to be formed is shown. The bag <b>5801</b> may include the same or similar elements as the bags discussed in any of the preceding or subsequent figures. The sheets shown are front wall <b>5802</b>, rear wall <b>5803</b>, bottom wall <b>5804</b>, first side wall <b>5805</b> having gusset portion <b>5806</b>, and second side wall <b>5807</b> having gusset portion <b>5808</b>. The bag <b>5801</b> has a first or top end <b>5809</b> and a second or bottom end <b>5810</b>, and thus each of the front wall <b>5802</b>, rear wall <b>5803</b>, first side wall <b>5805</b>, and second side wall <b>5807</b> has a first or top end and a second or bottom end. It will be apparent, however, that the orientation of the bag ends <b>5809</b> and <b>5810</b> are unimportant and the &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; references are useful but may change depending upon the orientation from which one views the bag. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b></figref>, the top end <b>5809</b> of the front wall <b>5802</b> and the rear wall <b>5803</b> each extend the same distance from the body of the bag <b>5801</b>, and the bottom end of the front wall <b>5802</b>, the first side wall <b>5805</b>, the second side wall <b>5807</b>, and the rear wall <b>5803</b> at the second end <b>5810</b> of bag <b>5801</b> each extend the same distance from the body of the bag <b>5801</b>.

Therefore, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b></figref>, the first and second side walls <b>5805</b> and <b>5807</b> form terminated gussets that do not reach to top end <b>5809</b> of the bag <b>5801</b>.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">Bag <b>5801</b> may also include a weakened portion (not shown), which may be arranged near the top end <b>5809</b> of the bag <b>5801</b>, the bottom end <b>5810</b> of the bag <b>5801</b>, or any other suitable location of the bag <b>5801</b> and may comprise a plurality of perforations extending from a first end on the front wall <b>5802</b> of the bag <b>5801</b> across the first side wall <b>5805</b> of the bag <b>5801</b> to a second end on the rear wall <b>5803</b> of the bag <b>5801</b>.

In forming bag <b>5801</b>, a first edge <b>5812</b> and a second edge <b>5814</b> of the front wall <b>5802</b> are each sealed to a first edge <b>5816</b> of the first side wall <b>5805</b> and a first edge <b>5818</b> of the second side wall <b>5807</b>, respectively. A first edge <b>5813</b> and a second edge <b>5815</b> of the rear wall <b>5803</b> are each sealed to a second edge <b>5817</b> of the first side wall <b>5805</b> and a second edge <b>5819</b> of the second side wall <b>5807</b>, respectively. Thus, four vertical seals, e.g., seals that extend along longitudinal lengths of bag <b>5801</b>, are created at the four corners of the bag <b>5801</b>. The bottom wall <b>5804</b> may also be sealed to the front wall <b>5802</b>, rear wall <b>5803</b>, first side wall <b>5805</b>, and second side wall <b>5807</b> along the bottom edges <b>5820</b>, <b>5821</b>, <b>5822</b>, <b>5823</b> of the front wall <b>5802</b>, rear wall <b>5803</b>, first side wall <b>5805</b>, and second side wall <b>5807</b>, respectively, to form the bag <b>5801</b>. The rectangular shaped bottom wall <b>5804</b> may enable bag <b>5801</b> to stand upright when fully formed. However, the walls of bag <b>5801</b>, e.g., the front wall <b>5802</b>, rear wall <b>5803</b>, bottom wall <b>5804</b>, first side wall <b>5805</b>, and second side wall <b>5807</b> are not limited to a rectangular shape. Although most walls and bags are shown as rectangular, it should be appreciated that other shapes are possible, e.g., circular, oval, frustroconical, triangular, trapezoidal, etc. Additionally, bag <b>5801</b> may be formed of more or fewer walls. For example, in certain embodiments, bag <b>5801</b> may not include the bottom wall <b>5804</b>. Instead the bottom of the front wall <b>5802</b>, rear wall <b>5803</b>, first side wall <b>5805</b>, and second side wall <b>5807</b> of bag <b>5801</b> may be sealed along the bottom edges <b>5820</b>, <b>5821</b>, <b>5822</b>, <b>5823</b> to form a pillow-type sealed bottom and/or folded over and pinch sealed to seal the bottom of bag <b>5801</b>.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">The sealing of the edges and the top and bottom ends of the bag <b>5801</b> may be done using hot air, hot melt, a sealing bar, adhesive, or any other suitable sealing means. The bag <b>5801</b> offers a number of advantages, including increased capacity of bag <b>5801</b> for holding materials as well as the ability to have graphics printed on each wall, e.g., the front wall <b>5802</b>, rear wall <b>5803</b>, bottom wall <b>5804</b>, first side wall <b>5805</b>, and second side wall <b>5807</b>, without having any middle seams interrupting the graphics. Further advantages of bag <b>5801</b> include less wasted space when multiple bags <b>5801</b> are stacked, an easier ability to stack and store multiple bags <b>5801</b>, the ability to stand bags <b>5801</b> up for display and other purposes, and a more aesthetically pleasing appearance.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref> shows a formed, terminated gusset bag <b>5901</b> with each wall having multiple layers.

The first side wall <b>6005</b> and the second side wall <b>6007</b> may each also be folded to create the gusset portion <b>6006</b> and gusset portion <b>6008</b>. The three corners <b>6020</b> of bag <b>6001</b> may then each be sealed to create a sealed seam <b>6022</b> at each of the three corners <b>6020</b>. In some embodiments, the size of the sealed seam <b>6022</b> at each of the three corners <b>6020</b> may depend on the spacing between each wall on the flat sheet of material. For example, if each wall is spaced approximately 20 mm apart, then the sealed seam <b>6022</b> at each of the three corners <b>6020</b> will be approximately 10 mm. Additionally, the size of the sealed seam <b>6022</b> at each of the three corners <b>6020</b> may be trimmed to adjust the size after sealing. The fourth corner <b>6024</b> of bag <b>6001</b> may be formed by sealing the separate edges of the front wall <b>6002</b> and the second side wall <b>6007</b> to one another. Forming bag <b>6001</b> in such a way as shown and described relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>64</b>A-B</figref> may result in a stronger, four-cornered bag because only one corner is formed of sealed, separate pieces of material versus all four corners being formed of sealed, separate pieces of material.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">In certain embodiments, the bottom of the front wall <b>6002</b>, rear wall <b>6003</b>, first side wall <b>6005</b>, and second side wall <b>6007</b> of bag <b>6001</b> may be sealed along the bottom edges to form a pillow-type sealed bottom and/or folded over and pinch sealed to seal the bottom of bag <b>6001</b>, e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>61</b>A-<b>61</b>B</figref>. In addition to the seals at the corners, bag <b>6001</b> also includes diagonal seals <b>6012</b> at the second end <b>6010</b> of the bag <b>6001</b>.

The second layer may be laminated to the first layer, such as without an adhesive, and may be laminated to the first layer by a third layer comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a film layer comprising polyethylene, polyester, or polypropylene. The first, second and third layers may all comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the same material, and may be polyethylene, polyester, and polypropylene, or a combination thereof. The top end of the back wall may extend 0.25 to 6.0 inches or so beyond the top end of the front bag wall. A polyamide ink, urethane ink, nitrocellulose ink, or combination thereof, may be applied to the exterior or interior surface of the front bag wall in an area extending across the width of the front bag wall and from the top end of the front wall to 0.25 to 6.0 inches below the top end of the bag wall. The top end of the back wall may be folded over the top end of the front wall and a portion of the interior surface of the back wall may be placed into contact with a portion of the exterior surface of the front wall to form an overlaying portion of the front and back walls. The overlaying portion may extend lengthwise across the width of the bag wall and may be from 2.0 to 20.0 inches in width. The overlaying portion may be sealed by passing it by a nozzle blowing heated air at a temperature of from 360 F. to 1800 F. or so, at a speed of about 20 to 3,000 inches per minute, to form a seal at the top end of the bag. In addition, an unsealed flap of about 0.125 to 2.0 inches or so in width may extend lengthwise across the width of the bag, wherein the flap is formed from the portion of the top end of the back wall that is not scaled to the front wall of the bag. It has been observed that such a bag is adapted to hold anywhere from 1.5 pounds, ten pounds, twenty pounds, thirty pounds, forty pounds, fifty pounds, sixty pounds, to seventy pounds of a filling material once filled, and provides a strong, durable seal that is rugged and can hold such contents without the risk of spilling or contamination, yet can be easily opened by a consumer without a knife or scissors by pulling the tab upwards and/or outwardly from the front wall of the bag. In this particular example, the bag's second layer may comprise printing and/or graphics on at least one side, which may be done with reverse printing or surface printing, and the ink coating may be applied to the second bag layer (e.g., the film layer) on the second layer's printed side. The ink coating may be applied to the film layer after the film layer has had the printing and/or graphics printed thereon.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">The disclosed bags are described herein as heavy duty bags or bags designed to hold about 10 pounds or more, or about 10-150 pounds or about 20-100 pounds of dry product, and can also be described as bags that can withstand the standard drop test requirements in accordance with ASTM D5276-98 (ASTM D5276-98 (2009), Standard Test Method for Drop Test of Loaded Containers by Free Fall, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, Pa., 2009), which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, within an acceptable failure rate, for example, less than 5% or less than 3% or less than 1% failure rate when subjected to a drop test including hanging a filled bag at 145&#xb0; F. for 72 hours followed by a six point drop test from a height of at least four feet, followed by storage at &#x2212;27&#xb0; F. for 24 hours followed by another six point drop test from a height of at least four feet and repeating this test sequentially for five drop test cycles.

It is further understood that the sealing tape covering the easy open feature, or the folded or rolled portion of bag that seals the openable end, also has to endure these tests and fall within the acceptable failure rate. It is further understood that a six point drop test includes dropping the bag onto the front, back, top, bottom, and the two sides, while a ten point drop test includes the six point test and additionally dropping the bag on the four corners of the bag. It is understood herein that the openable end of the bag refers to the end which includes or is nearest to an easy open feature or a seal that requires less force to open than the opposite sealed end of the bag.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">In some embodiments, the bag described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>63</b></figref> may be manufactured using any suitable method. For example, the method may comprise forming the walls of a bag by forming a sheet of wall material. The sheet of wall material may be formed by forming or providing a woven polymer layer. The woven polymer layer may be formed by weaving together strips of polymer. In some embodiments, the polymer strips may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of polyethylene, high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, oriented polyethylene, biaxially-oriented polyethylene, oriented polyethylene terephthalate, biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, high density polypropylene, low density polypropylene, oriented polypropylene, biaxially-oriented polypropylene, polyamide, oriented polyamide, biaxially-oriented polyamide, or combinations of any thereof.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">The method may further comprise applying one or more polymer film layers to the woven polymer layer. In some embodiments, the one or more polymer film layers may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of polyethylene, high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, oriented polyethylene, biaxially-oriented polyethylene, oriented polyethylene terephthalate, biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, high density polypropylene, low density polypropylene, oriented polypropylene, biaxially-oriented polypropylene, polyamide, oriented polyamide, biaxially-oriented polyamide, polyester, coated paper, or any combinations thereof. The one or more polymer film layers may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the same material as the woven layer, or may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of one or more materials different from the woven layer. The one or more layers may be laminated to one another and/or the woven layer, such as by a polymer film layer like those described, or the one or more film layers may be adhered to one another and/or the woven layer such as by an adhesive layer. The one or more layers may further be extruded or co-extruded.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">The method may further comprise adhering the polymer film layer to the woven polymer layer, or alternatively adhering the woven polymer layer to the polymer film layer. The polymer film layer may be adhered to the woven polymer layer by applying a laminate resin or film layer between the woven polymer layer and the polymer film layer. In some embodiments, the laminate resin or film layer may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the laminate resin or film layer that comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of polyethylene, high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, oriented polyethylene, biaxially-oriented polyethylene, oriented polyethylene terephthalate, biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, high density polypropylene, low density polypropylene, oriented polypropylene, biaxially-oriented polypropylene, polyamide, oriented polyamide, biaxially-oriented polyamide, polyester, or combinations of any thereof.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">The method may further comprise reverse printing ink onto one or more layers of the bag to form a high end graphic and/or printing visible on an outer surface of the bag suitable for consumer type packaging. In some embodiments, the method may comprise of reverse printing ink onto at least one of the woven polymer layer, the polymer film layer, the laminate resin or film layer, or any combinations thereof. Additionally, the reverse printed ink may form its own layer of the bag.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">The method may further comprise cutting the sheet of wall material so that the cut wall material is sized into smaller sheets each of which is a selected size for forming an individual bag. The cut wall material may be a single piece or multiple pieces that are sized to form each wall of the bag. In some embodiments, the single piece of cut wall material may be folded to form each wall of the bag and the ends of the single piece of cut wall material may be sealed together to form a folded tube. The sealing of the ends may be done using hot air, hot melt, a sealing bar, which applies heat and pressure, adhesive, or any other suitable sealing means. Additionally, at least one of the folded corners may be sealed to form a sealed corner edge along the longitudinal length of the bag (or along another edge of the bag). Similarly, the sealing of the folded corners may be done using hot air, hot melt, a sealing bar, adhesive, or any other suitable sealing means. In some embodiments, the multiple pieces of cut wall material may be sealed to each other along each edge to form four sealed corner edges along the longitudinal edges of the bag. The sealing of the edges may be done using hot air, hot melt, a sealing bar, adhesive, or any other suitable sealing means.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">The method may further comprise forming diagonal seals at the corners at the bottom end of the bag. The diagonal seals are formed between a front wall and a first side wall, the front wall and a second side wall, a rear wall and the first side wall, and/or the rear wall and the second side wall. In some embodiments, the diagonal seals extend at angles ranging from approximately 30&#xb0; to approximately 45&#xb0; from the edges of the front wall, rear wall, first side wall, and second side wall. The sealing of the diagonal seals may be done using hot air, hot melt, a sealing bar, adhesive, or any other suitable sealing means.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">The method may further include the step of trimming the edges formed by the sealing, including the one or more edges formed by joining and sealing two edges of the wall material together, and/or the one or more edges formed by folding of the wall material to form the walls of the bag (e.g., the front wall, the back wall, and two side walls, which may include gussets). When such edges have been sealed as described above, the edges may include excess material that extends beyond the edges that are desired. In such situations, the method may include trimming any excess material from one or more of the edges so that the formed sealed edges have a relatively uniform size and shape. For example, it may be desirable for the edges to have a sealed edge of about 20 millimeters in width. For such bags, the method may include passing the bag edges by a knife or other blade, or other cutting instrument, to remove any material which extends outwardly from the edge. Alternatively, the method may include removing any excess material and potentially some of the sealed edge by passing the edges by a knife or other blade or cutting instrument, to trim the edges so that the bag walls with the sealed edges will have a selected width or distance between each of the sealed edges.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">The method may further comprise sealing at least one of a top end or the bottom end of the bag. In some embodiments, the bag may be sealed along at least one of the bottom ends or the top ends to form a pillow-type sealed bottom or top and/or folded over and pinch type sealed bottom end or top end. The sealing of the ends may be done using hot air, hot melt, a sealing bar, adhesive, or any other suitable sealing means.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">The method may further comprise forming a handle at one of the sealed top end or the sealed bottom end of the bag. For example, the handle may be formed by cutting, stamping, melting, etc. an opening into the sealed top end or the sealed bottom end of the bag. Additionally, the handle may be formed by cutting, stamping, melting, etc. a series of perforations in the sealed top end or the sealed bottom end that a user may break through to create an opening in the sealed top end or the sealed bottom end of the bag.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">The method and steps described above for making bags in accordance with the present disclosure may be automated, such as by using machinery that automatically weaves the polymeric strips to form a woven layer, adds one or more polymeric film layers on either or both the interior and exterior surface of the woven layer, adheres the one or more film layers to the woven layer as described above (e.g., by lamination with a film, adhesive, etc.), separates the formed bag wall material to form sheets for forming into separate bags (e.g., by cutting separate sheets for forming separate bags), forming a tube of the bag wall material, forming one or more bag walls (such as by folding the bag wall material to form the walls and/or by joining one or more separate bag wall pieces together), sealing the edges formed by the forming of the bag walls (e.g., with hot air, a press bar that applies heat and pressure, etc.), trimming any excess material from the one or more corner edges of the bags, adding one or more diagonal seals at the corners of the bag if desired, and then sealing one end of the bag in any of the ways described above. As also noted, one or more of the bag layers may include printing and graphics, such as by reverse ink printing on one or more of the film layers. The method may also include a step of adding an easy open feature, which may include a weakened portion, a resealable feature, or the like, such as are described above. We believe that a bag made with a method as described herein provides a superior bag that is durable and strong enough to survive the requirements of storage, transportation, and the like in hot or cold temperatures and yet can be recycled and easily opened when an easy open feature is included.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that the bag according to the invention may vary in size, dimensions, and shape without departing from the scope of the invention, and that the foregoing description of the preferred embodiments is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined by the claims.
