Some meters, such as electric meters, are powered by alternating current electricity service from the electricity grid. Other devices, such as many water and gas meters, are battery powered.

This disclosure describes techniques to extend the battery life of endpoint devices by adjusting message size and/or transmission rates for messages transmitted by the endpoint devices. For instance, in some examples, the disclosure describes techniques for removing or omitting one or more data fields from a message to reduce the energy expended by the endpoint device to transmit the message. In other examples, the transmission rate at which messages are sent by the endpoint device can be adjusted to reduce the battery consumption of a device. In some configurations, an endpoint device, such as a utility smart meter, transmits messages which may be referred to herein as &#x201c;bubble-up messages&#x201d;. According to some examples, these messages can be periodically transmitted by the endpoint device (e.g., a utility smart meter) and/or transmitted in response to receiving a &#x201c;wake up&#x201d; polling signal containing a request for information associated with the endpoint device (e.g., meter information such as consumption information, tamper information, . . . ). Generally, these &#x201c;bubble-up&#x201d; messages are sent without receiving a request for information. Instead, these &#x201c;bubble-up&#x201d; messages are unsolicited information that include information about the endpoint device. As described herein, the messages, such as &#x201c;bubble-up&#x201d; messages, can include a different data fields at different times. In some cases, the &#x201c;bubble-up&#x201d; messages transmitted by the smart utility meter, or some other endpoint, include a device identifier that identifies the endpoint device and a protocol identifier that identifies the data fields included in the &#x201c;bubble-up&#x201d; message. More details are provided below.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to some configurations, one or more criteria are used by the endpoint device to determine what data fields to include within a message and/or when to adjust a transmission rate associated with the transmission of messages by the endpoint device. For instance, the one or more criteria may include the battery level of the endpoint device, an age or time since activation or installation of the endpoint device, the time of year (e.g., winter, summer, . . . ), the time within a billing cycle (e.g., a day within the billing cycle, a week of the billing cycle, etc.), whether the data has already been transmitted by the endpoint device, a number of times the data has already been transmitted by the device, whether the data has been acknowledged as received by another device, whether the endpoint device has been instructed by another device to reduce the message size and/or adjust the transmission rate, whether the endpoint device is being utilized (e.g., whether it has measured consumption of a resource within a threshold period of time), a number of lifetime transmissions of the endpoint device, and the like. In some configurations, the fields included within a message include at least a device identifier field that includes a device identifier that identifies the device and a protocol identifier field that includes a protocol value that identifies the data fields included in a message.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Generally, the &#x201c;battery level&#x201d; may refer to remaining battery life of the device, such as indicated by the current state of a charge of a battery. The state of charge of a battery may be indicated in different ways, such as but not limited to along a scale (e.g., 0-100%), within a classification (e.g., full, half, low), and the like. In other examples, the battery level may be based on a time the endpoint device has been in service. For instance, the battery level may be considered at a first level for a first period of time (e.g., the first several years from the time the endpoint device was placed in service), at a second level for a second period of time, and the like. The battery level may be measured using different techniques. For example, the voltage of the battery can be measured, a coulomb counter may be used, impedance tracking can be utilized, as well as other battery measurement techniques may be utilized. According to some configurations, the battery level of the endpoint device can be estimated based on the operations performed by the endpoint device. For instance, the energy use (e.g., micro-amp-seconds) associated with the endpoint device performing different operations can be determined. The energy use for performing the different operations may be determined during development of the operations and/or development of the endpoint devices or determined at some other time. When the endpoint device is in service, a counter, or some other mechanism, can be utilized to estimate how many micro-amp-seconds have been used for the operations performed by the endpoint device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As an example, when the battery level of an endpoint device is above a first threshold (e.g., &#x3e;10%, 20%, 50%, . . . ), or within a range of battery levels (e.g., between 50%-90%, . . . ) the endpoint device, such a smart utility meter, transmits messages without reducing the size of the message (e.g., each of the data fields of the message is transmitted) and/or without adjusting the transmission rate. When the battery level of the endpoint device drops below the first threshold, however, the size of the message may be reduced (e.g., one or more fields of the message can be removed prior to transmission) and/or the transmission rate may be reduced. For instance, instead of transmitting at a first rate (e.g., 15 second intervals), the transmission rate may be changed to a second, slower rate (e.g., 20 second intervals). In some examples, the transmission rate may be further reduced to a third, still slower rate (e.g., 30, 40, 50 second intervals) upon the battery level falling below a second threshold (e.g., &#x3c;50%, 20%, 10%, etc.).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Many different thresholds can be utilized. In some configurations, an authorized user may configure the thresholds. For example, a customer utilizing the endpoint device, may be authorized to configure the thresholds. While two thresholds are described in the above example, fewer or more thresholds can be utilized. Further, instead of using thresholds, a formula, a machine learning mechanism, or some other technique can be used to determine when to adjust the message size and/or change the transmission rate. Generally, the fewer bytes transmitted in a message by the endpoint device and the less frequently the messages are transmitted conserves battery of an endpoint device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to some techniques described herein, the size of the message transmitted is reduced by the endpoint device in response to determining that another electronic device has received the same data in a previous transmission of the message. In some examples, the endpoint device determines that the transmitted data has been received based on receipt of a message acknowledging receipt of the message from a collection device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">After receiving a message, or some other data, indicating that the message has been received, the endpoint device generates messages for transmission that removes or omits one or more of the data fields. In some examples, the endpoint device transmits an identifier data field that identifies the endpoint device and omits the other data fields of the message. In other examples, the endpoint device may generate messages that include more data fields.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to some configurations, when a value of a data field not currently included within a message transmitted by the endpoint device changes, the endpoint device includes that data field when generating a message for transmission. For example, when the endpoint device is a smart utility meter and a consumption value of the utility meter changes, the endpoint device generates a message that also includes a consumption data field. In this way, the endpoint device transmits updated data without having to transmit data that has already been received by a collection device.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Transmitting smaller messages has many benefits. For example, noise in the RF spectrum used for transmitting messages is reduced, which also decreases potential interference with collection devices that may be collecting other data from other electronic devices. The battery consumption of the endpoint device is also reduced by transmitting smaller messages thereby extending the life of the electronic device. Network traffic is also reduced since fewer messages may be transmitted and/or messages smaller in size may be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Many of the examples described in the disclosure are given in the context of an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) of a utility communication network. However, the techniques described herein are not limited to use in a utility industry AMI. Rather, unless specifically described to the contrary, the techniques described herein applicable to any other communications network, control network, and/or other type of network or system that includes battery powered network communication devices. By way of example and not limitation, network communication devices include utility meters (e.g., electricity, water, or gas meters), relays, repeaters, routers, transformers, sensors, switches, encoder/receiver/transmitters (ERTs), appliances, personal computers (e.g., desktop computers, laptop computers, etc.), mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.), servers, access points, or the like. Battery powered network communication devices (or &#x201c;battery powered devices&#x201d;) are network communication devices that rely on a battery for power (i.e., are not connected to mains power).</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Example Environment</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an example network architecture <b>100</b>, including endpoint devices <b>102</b>, such as battery powered devices, that change the size of messages transmitted and/or adjust the transmission rate to conserve battery life and/or reduce network traffic. The architecture <b>100</b> includes multiple network communication devices.

In the illustrated example, the endpoint devices <b>102</b> are representative smart sensors associated with utility meters such as, but not limited to water meters and/or gas meters. However, as noted above, in other examples, endpoint devices <b>102</b> may comprise other types of electronic devices, respectively.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The endpoint devices <b>102</b>, collection devices <b>106</b>, and/or computing devices <b>104</b> may be in wireless communication with one another. For example, the endpoint devices <b>102</b> may be configured to communicate with one or more collection devices <b>106</b> via radio frequency (RF) channels and/or one or more networks, such as network <b>112</b>. Examples of networks include, for example, local area networks (LANs), neighborhood area networks (NANs), personal area networks (PANs), home area networks (HANs), or the like. While only one network <b>112</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in practice, multiple networks may exist and may collectively define a larger network, such as an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) of a utility communication network.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The endpoint devices <b>102</b> may also use one or more links to communicate with other electronic devices, such as collection devices <b>106</b>, computing devices <b>104</b>, and/or other electronic devices (not shown). The term &#x201c;link&#x201d; refers to a direct communication path between two devices (without passing through or being relayed by another device). A link may be over a wired or wireless communication path. Each link may represent a plurality of channels over which a device is able to transmit or receive data. Each of the plurality of channels may be defined by a frequency range which is the same or different for each of the plurality of channels. In some instances, the plurality of channels comprises RF channels. The plurality of channels may comprise a control channel and multiple data channels. In some instances, the control channel is utilized for communicating one or more messages between devices to specify one of the data channels to be utilized to transfer data. Generally, transmissions on the control channel are shorter relative to transmissions on the data channels. An area network may implement a channel hopping sequence, such that the control channel and data channels change over time.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, a network may be a mesh network, in which the network communication devices relay data through the mesh network. Other types of networks (e.g., star or hub-and-spoke networks, mobile networks, cellular networks, etc.) can also be utilized. Additionally, in some instances, one or more devices may be able to communicate with multiple different types of networks (e.g., a mesh network and a star network) at the same or different times.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The computing system <b>110</b> includes computing devices <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>), . . . <b>104</b>(N) that can be configured to provide one or more services. For example, the computing system <b>110</b> can be configured as a meter data management system (in the utility context), a customer relationship management system (in the sales context), a diagnostic system (in a manufacturing context), an inventory system (in a warehouse context), a patient record system (in the healthcare context), a billing system, etc. In some examples, the computing system <b>110</b> is associated with a utility service provider.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The computing system <b>110</b> may be physically located in a single central location or may be distributed at multiple different locations.

The endpoint devices <b>102</b> are associated with, for example, utility meters UM (e.g., gas meters, water meters, electric meters, etc.), for obtaining data associated with a utility meter. For example, the endpoint devices <b>102</b> can be configured to provide data such as consumption data, tampering data, and the like associated with a UM.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As briefly discussed, the endpoint devices <b>102</b> may be a wired or wireless communications device capable of performing two-way communications with a collection system, such as wireless communication with collection devices <b>106</b>. For example, the endpoint devices <b>102</b> are capable of receiving data (e.g., messages, commands, software and/or firmware updates, etc.) from collection devices <b>106</b>, or some other device or component, and transmitting meter data or other information to collection devices <b>106</b>. Depending on the exact configuration and types of devices used, the endpoint devices <b>102</b> transmit standard meter readings either periodically (&#x201c;bubble-up&#x201d;) according to a transmission rate, in response to a wake-up signal, or in a combination/hybrid configuration. In some configurations, the endpoint devices <b>102</b> are configured to exchange data with collection devices <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the current example, the collection devices <b>106</b> collect meter reading data and other data from the plurality of endpoint devices <b>102</b>, process the data, and forward the data to the computing system <b>110</b> associated with a utility service provider. The collection devices <b>106</b> may employ any number of AMR protocols and devices to communicate with the endpoint devices <b>102</b>. In the example shown, a collection device <b>106</b>, for example, may be a handheld meter reader capable of radio-based collection and/or manual entry of meter readings. In other examples, the collection devices <b>106</b> may also include a mobile collection unit (e.g., utility vehicle not shown), configured with a radio transmitter/receiver for collecting meter readings within a drive-by coverage area. According to some examples, the collection devices <b>106</b> are configured to forward meter readings to the computing system <b>110</b> over a network, such as a wide area network <b>112</b>, which may be implemented utilizing TCP/IP Protocols (e.g., Internet), GPRS or other cellular based protocols, Ethernet, WiFi, Broadband Over Power Line, and combinations thereof, etc. In some examples, the collection devices <b>106</b> can be configured to receive the &#x201c;bubble-up messages&#x201d; transmitted by endpoint devices <b>102</b>, such as smart utility meters. According to some examples, the collection devices <b>106</b> receive a bubble-up message and decode the data of the message based on the protocol identifier that identifies the data fields included within the bubble-up message. As described herein, the collection device <b>106</b> can also transmit a &#x201c;wake up&#x201d; polling signal containing a request for information associated with the endpoint device (e.g., meter information such as consumption information, tamper information, . . . ). In some examples, if the collection device <b>106</b> wants information not contained within a transmitted bubble-up message, the collection device <b>106</b> can transmit a message to the endpoint device requesting the desired information. As briefly discussed, this disclosure describes techniques to extend the battery life of endpoint devices by adjusting message size and/or transmission rates for messages transmitted by the endpoint devices. For instance, in some examples, the disclosure describes techniques for removing or omitting one or more data fields from a message to reduce the energy expended to transmit the message. In other examples, the transmission rate at which messages are sent can be adjusted to reduce the battery consumption of an endpoint device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to some techniques described herein, the size of the message transmitted is reduced by the endpoint device <b>102</b> in response to determining that another electronic device has received the data. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) is transmitting message data <b>120</b>A to collection device <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>). In some configurations, the EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) transmits message data <b>120</b>A that includes the data fields specified by a type of message In the example of a utility service, the EDP <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) may initially transmit message data <b>120</b>A that includes an identifier data field that identifies the EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>), a consumption data field that identifies consumption of a utility meter associated with the EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>), a tampering data field that identifies tampering of the EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>), and the like. More details will be provided below. For example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> and related description for an exemplary message and data fields associated with a utility meter.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some examples, the EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) determines that the transmitted message data <b>120</b>A has been received in response to receiving message data <b>120</b>B from collection device <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>). According to some configurations, the endpoint devices <b>102</b> are configured to listen for transmissions during a &#x201c;listen window&#x201d;. A &#x201c;listen window&#x201d; is a time the endpoint device is actively listening for messages transmitted by another device. In some examples, the message data <b>120</b>B received by EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) can be an acknowledgment message (&#x201c;ACK&#x201d;). In other examples, the message data <b>120</b>B received by the EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) may be a request for additional data and/or some other instruction.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">After receiving message data <b>120</b>B, or some other data, indicating that the message <b>120</b>A has been received by the collection device <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>), the endpoint device EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) generates subsequent messages for transmission that remove one or more of the data fields. In some examples, the EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) transmits message data <b>120</b>C that includes an identifier data field that identifies the endpoint device and removes the other data fields of the message. In other examples, the EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) may generate messages that include additional data fields but removes at least some of the data that was transmitted in message data <b>120</b>A.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to some configurations, when a value of data. associated with a data field not included within a message, changes, an endpoint device <b>102</b>, such as EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) includes that data field and updated value when generating a subsequent message to transmit. For example, when the endpoint device <b>120</b> is a smart utility meter and a consumption value of the utility meter changes, the EPD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) generates message data <b>120</b>D that also includes a consumption data field and transmits the message. Some data fields of a message may not be included within a message and transmitted for long periods of time. For instance, a tamper data field may initially be transmitted by an endpoint device <b>102</b> but may not be included within messages subsequently transmitted by the endpoint device <b>102</b> since it is not typical for an endpoint device to be tampered with.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to some configurations, one or more criteria are used by an endpoint device <b>102</b> to determine what data fields to include within a message and/or adjust a transmission rate associated with the transmission of messages by the endpoint device. For instance, the criteria may include the current battery level of the device, the time of year (e.g., winter, summer, . . . ), whether the data has already been transmitted and received by another device, whether the endpoint device has been instructed by another device to reduce message size and/or adjust the transmission rate, an age/time since installation/activation of the device, a number of lifetime transmissions of the device, and the like.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, EPD <b>102</b>(N) is shown as transmitting message data <b>120</b>E at a first time. For purposes of explanation, assume that the one or more criteria utilized by the EPD <b>102</b>(N) is the battery level for the battery of EPD <b>102</b>(N). In the current example, when EPD <b>102</b>(N) determines that the battery level is above a first threshold (e.g., &#x3e;50%, &#x3e;60%, &#x3e;90%, . . . ), EPD <b>102</b>(N) may transmit message data <b>120</b>E that does not reduce the size of the message (e.g., each of the data fields of the message is transmitted) and/or without adjusting the transmission rate. When the EPD <b>102</b>(N) determines that the battery level of the device drops below the first threshold, the EPD <b>102</b>(N) generates a message that is reduced (e.g., one or more data fields of the message are removed prior to transmission) and/or the transmission rate may be reduced (e.g., instead of transmitting at 20 second intervals, the transmission rate changes to 30 second intervals) by the EPD <b>102</b>(N). After generating the message, the EPD <b>102</b>(N) transmits the message data <b>120</b>F. In some examples, the EPD <b>102</b>(N) may also reduce the transmission rate such that the EDP <b>102</b>(N) is not transmitting as many messages.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">While thresholds have been used as an example for determining when to reduce message size and/or adjust transmission rate, other techniques or mechanisms can be utilized. For example, a formula, a machine learning mechanism, or some other technique can be used to determine when to adjust the message size and/or change the transmission rate. Generally, the fewer bytes transmitted in a message and the less frequently the messages are transmitted conserves battery of a device.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Example Signal Flow Between Network Communications Devices</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a signal flow diagram illustrating aspects of an endpoint device conserving battery by transmitting some messages with fewer data fields.
