Such processes are used extensively in contexts like the healthcare industry or a wide range of scientific research activities.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A central aspect of such processes is the ability to determine whether the sterilization process was successful, in order to ensure the required conditions of use of the sterilized material and/or surface. To this end, several methods are employed with varying degrees of quality.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Biological indicators known in the art generally involve subjecting a known amount of microbial spores, such as bacterial spores, to a sterilization process along with the target material and/or surface. Immediately after the process is complete, tests are carried out in order to probe the presence of remaining living and/or viable microorganisms. If these tests yield negative results, then it may be determined that the sterilization was effective.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">More specific biological indicators include probing the occurrence of certain biochemical reactions that are known to indicate the presence of viable forms of life. Such biochemical reactions relate to enzymatic and/or catalytic activity commonly found in microbial life or color change in a dye.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent application US 2015/0159192 A1 discloses a method of determining the success of a sterilization process comprising the use of an isolated enzyme or the microorganism to which such enzyme is endogenous or expressed by genetic engineering. Indicator enzymes according to this disclosure are enzymes found commonly in spore forming microorganisms such as beta-D-glucosidase. After the indicator has been exposed to a sterilization process, an enzymatic activity test is carried out in order to assess the effectiveness of the sterilization.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other biological indicators are based on the use of genetically engineered microorganisms capable of expressing specific reporter genes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent application WO 2018/071732 A1 discloses a biological indicator making use of genetically engineered microorganisms capable of expressing reporter genes that are suitable to be screened for fluorescence (e.g. reporter genes suitable for expression of fluorescent proteins). After the indicator has been subjected to the sterilization process, it is screened for optically detectable signals, thus evidencing the presence or absence of viable microorganisms.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Similarly, patent application WO 2017/185738 A1 discloses a biological indicator based on the use of spores from genetically engineered microorganisms expressing specific fluorescent reporter genes. After the sterilization process, the indicator is screened for optically detectable signals, in order to assess the presence of viable microorganisms.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other biological indicators known in the prior art comprise providing a genetically engineered microorganism suitable for expression of specific enzymes, in order to screen enzymatic activity of said specific enzyme after sterilization.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Patent application US 2017/0292143 A1 discloses genetically engineered microorganisms suitable for expression of a specific enzyme (e.g. &#x3b2;-lactamase) which is able to hydrolyze a fluorogenic compound designed to emit fluorescence by hydrolysis. The optically detectable fluorescent signal therefore indicates the presence of viable microorganisms.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other biological indicators employ the screening of surrogate proteins selected from proteins critical for the growth of infectious agents, and pathogenic or immunogenic proteins.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Patent application US 2017/0283847 A1 discloses a biological indicator based on the screening for a defined surrogate protein after a sterilization process. The disclosed method requires procedures such as Western Blot analysis in order to assess the presence of the target protein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other biological indicators of similar characteristics also employ genetically modified microorganisms or mutant and/or labeled proteins and/or enzymes in order to enable an effective screening after sterilization, such as disclosed by CA 2667698 C, U.S. Pat. No. 9,717,812 B2, EP 2456882 B1, U.S. Pat. No. 10,047,334 B2, US 20140370535 A1 and JP 2014-060947 A.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The biological indicators of the prior art generally rely on complex, costly and significantly time-consuming procedures for both production and use, affecting the overall costs of the biological indicator per se and of sterilization processes in general. Biological indicators based on such procedures demand considerable incubation and/or readout time, which also represents a significant expense in time and resources. Biological indicators that rely solely on screening enzymatic activity are limited by the generally low stability of the employed enzyme. Inherent characteristics of enzymes, like their structure and catalytic activity, have a negative effect on the overall stability of the indicator and the effectiveness of the system. Moreover, longer periods of time are needed in order to screen enzymatic activity.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Therefore, the need remains for a biological indicator that is both reliable and cost-effective, capable of reducing incubation and/or readout times, and without involving costly procedures and/or requirements.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additionally, it is desirable that the indicator does not require development stages comprising Western Blot analysis, protein array analysis, magnetic separation analysis, mass spectrometry analysis, peptide analysis, chromatography analysis, nor gas chromatography analysis, which require specialized equipment and are considerably time-consuming.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">On the other hand, the fact that the biological indicator does not depend on enzymatic reactions to indirectly determine the outcome of a sterilization process provides more reliable results. Enzymatic reactions are complex physical and chemical phenomena that require a wide range of favorable conditions in order to take place. For example, and as is known to a person skilled in the art, enzymatic activity depends greatly on the structure and nature of an enzyme active site. Even a small variation in any of the characteristics of such active sites, or in the environmental conditions around the enzyme, may have significant consequences in the enzyme ability to properly carry out the reaction. The chances of such variations entail serious potential flaws for a biological indicator reliant on enzymatic reactions, as these might incorrectly indicate the success of a sterilization.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention relies only on the results of two simple and straightforward tests, namely a fluorescence intensity test and a colorimetric test, rendering the overall process significantly more time- and cost-effective in relation to the prior art.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a self-contained biological indicator for determining the efficacy of an oxidative sterilization process, employing both an immediate fluorescence signal detection and a colorimetric test after a certain incubation time.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is therefore an object of the present application a device for determining the efficacy of an oxidative sterilization process comprising a flexible container, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0022">a) a set of microbial spores,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0023">b) at least one fluorescent sensor protein,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0024">c) a culture medium, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0025">d) a pH indicator or colorimetric component for extended readout confirmation.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">The at least one fluorescent sensor protein is capable of yielding an optically detectable signal, i.e., a fluorescence signal, when the at least one sensor protein is not in a denatured state due to the oxidative sterilization process and is further capable of yielding a different optically detectable signal, i.e., a different fluorescence signal, such as a signal with different intensity, depending on the tridimensional structure of the at least one fluorescent sensor protein and the polarity of the environment, when the at least one fluorescent sensor protein is in a denatured state after the oxidative sterilization process. Advantageously, this difference is independent of a catalytic activity of the at least one fluorescent sensor protein and the culture medium being brought into contact with the set of microbial spores.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">The culture medium is capable of inducing growth of any viable microbial life present after the oxidative sterilization process, and comprises the colorimetric component being capable of undergoing an optically detectable color change in the presence of microbial growth.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">In embodiments of the invention, the oxidative sterilization process is a process employing an oxidizing agent selected from ozone, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid.

The culture medium is nonetheless separated from the set of microbial spores, within a breakable ampoule contained in the flexible container, due to the need to bring these two elements into contact only after the sterilization process is complete.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0060">In an embodiment of the invention, the biological indicator comprises a flexible container as schematized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, comprising a cap <b>2</b> for sealing the flexible container, cap orifices <b>1</b>, a container tube <b>3</b>, an ampoule <b>4</b> containing culture medium and a carrier <b>5</b> containing the microbial spores.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0061">In certain embodiments, the flexible container is a transparent polypropylene tube.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0062">In another embodiment, the flexible container comprises a movable cap that may be pushed down in order to seal the container.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0063">In other embodiments, the microbial spores are embedded in a carrier contained within the flexible container.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0064">In certain embodiments, the microbial spores are embedded in a carrier made of a porous material, such as polypropylene fibers material, high-density polyethylene fibers, or in the polypropylene container itself.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0065">In a preferred embodiment, the high-density polyethylene fibers carrier is a sheet of paper with a grammage of 55 to 80 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0066">In an embodiment of the present invention, the ampoules are made of a fragile material with low thermal expansion coefficient, such as borosilicate glass, preferably glass, and contain 0.5 to 0.9 mL of culture medium.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0067">In a preferred embodiment, the culture medium comprises 0.8 to 1.2 g/L of bacteriological peptone; 0.8 to 1.2 g/L of yeast extract and 0.4 to 0.6 g/L of L-valine.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0068">In a preferred embodiment, the culture medium comprises 0.03 g/L of bromocresol purple indicator as a colorimetric component. Said culture medium has an adjusted pH between 7 and 9 preferably around 8.5. In a particular preferred embodiment, the pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0069">In some embodiments, detection of a change in fluorescence intensity as a result of the denaturation of the at least one fluorescent sensor protein may be achieved by means of a device for detecting fluorescence intensity or fluorimeter.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0070">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the fluorimeter is integrated to the incubator, in order to minimize handling and movement of the biological indicator. This way, the detection of a change in fluorescence intensity can be made directly in the same incubator, without requiring further steps to obtain a fluorescence readout.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0071">In some embodiments, detection of a change in color as a result of a colorimetric test may be achieved by means of direct visual observation or by means of a camera with subsequent image analysis.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0072">The at least one fluorescent sensor protein is also contained in the carrier.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0073">While contained in the carrier with the spores, the at least one fluorescent sensor protein and the spores are subjected to the same conditions (oxidizing agent concentration, time and temperature) as the target material to be sterilized.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0074">The amount of fluorescent sensor protein present in the carrier is in the range of 5-100 &#x3bc;g, preferably 25 &#x3bc;g.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0075">Said at least one fluorescent sensor protein is selected from the group comprising green fluorescent proteins (GFPwt, EGFP, SFGFP, Emerald, avGFP, T-Saphire), blue fluorescent proteins (Sirius, Azurite, EBFP, EBFP2, mKalama1, TagGFP), cyan fluorescent proteins (ECFP, Cerulean, CyPet, mTurquoise2, SCFP), yellow fluorescent proteins (YFP, Citrine, Venus, YPet, SYFP, Topaz, mAmetrina), red fluorescent proteins (tdTomato, mPlum, DsRed, mCherry, mStrawberry, mRaspberry, mRuby) and orange fluorescent proteins (mOrange, mKO and mOrange2).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0076">Chimeric proteins, i.e., fusion proteins, comprising any number of these fluorescent proteins or chimeric proteins comprising a fluorescent protein fused to a non-fluorescent protein such as fibrin, elastin, casein, collagen, actin, keratin, albumin and enzymes like lysozyme, amylase, lipase, pepsin, glucosidase, phosphatase, galactosidase, chymotrypsin and lipase can also be used. These non-fluorescent proteins are to be selected in accordance with their structural features, not in relation to their catalytic activity.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0077">Fluorescence in fluorescent proteins, such as GFP, is directly linked to a &#x201c;properly folded&#x201d; protein structure. In the case of GFP, in its native, i.e., non-denatured, structure, the fluorescent tripeptide formed by serine 65, tyrosine 66 and glycine 67 has limited movement and is excluded from the bulk of water. Only when these fluorescent GFP proteins are denatured does the chromophore increase its rotational freedom and is further attacked by water molecules, leading to a quenching of the fluorescence phenomenon.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0078">Oxidizing agents such as ozone, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid are highly reactive and predominantly target the cysteine residues of proteins.

Its tridimensional structure is closely related to conditions of the hydrogen peroxide sterilization process, such as exposition and concentration. Time of exposure to said conditions is also an important factor influencing the tridimensional structure.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0080">In particular embodiments, the fluorescent sensor protein may be synthesized by microorganisms, such as genetically engineered microorganisms that express specific fluorescent macromolecules.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0081">Non-limiting examples of genetically engineered microorganisms that synthetize these fluorescent sensor proteins include <i>B. atrophaeus, B. subtilis, G. stearothermophilus</i>, and <i>B. pumilus</i>.
