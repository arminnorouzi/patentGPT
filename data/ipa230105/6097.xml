Accordingly, the micro LED may produce the same brightness with about half energy of an existing LED (each exceeding 100 &#x3bc;m in width, length, and height) or OLED. In addition, a micro LED may realize high resolution, excellent color, contrast, and brightness, and thus it may accurately express a wide range of colors, and implement a clear screen even outdoors in bright sunlight. In addition, the micro LED is strong against burn-in and has low heat generation, and thus a long lifespan is guaranteed without deformation. The micro LED may have a flip chip structure in which an anode and a cathode electrode may be formed on the same first surface and a light emitting surface may be formed on a second surface opposite to the first surface on which the electrodes are formed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the disclosure, a TFT layer having a thin film transistor (TFT) circuit is disposed on a front surface of the substrate, and a power supply circuit for supplying power to the TFT circuit, a data driving driver, a gate driving driver, and a timing controller for controlling each driving driver may be disposed on a rear surface of the substrate.
