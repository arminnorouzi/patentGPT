to a movable curtain disinfection device using a technology related to plasma, heat, ultraviolet rays, disinfectants, and the like.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recently, as viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and novel influenza occur and circulate, and the perception of disinfection is increasing. In particular, there are social issues on cross-infection between infected patients in hospitals and infection caused by the spread of virus.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In particular, the spread of disease was amplified because of cross-infection between patients due to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015, resulting in significant social confusion and loss. As a result, there has been increased social awareness of the importance of spatial disinfection and management of spatial disinfection in hospitals.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, there is a limitation in disinfection in the hospital despite the growth of awareness of infection management. While guidelines on managing high-infectious medical devices are established, methods of cleaning walls, floors, or the like are not specified. In particular, a method of cleaning a curtain used to protect the patient's privacy is performed just by immediately replacing a dirty or contaminated curtain with a washed curtain, and each specified department merely conforms to the cycle of replacing curtains.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, if patients cannot be isolated, curtains are placed between the patients and ensure distances of at least 1 m between the patients and other patients or visitors. Therefore, the function of the curtain is also used to block infection. In addition, because many people touch the curtain with their hands several tens of times a day, it is very important to manage infection through the curtain.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a related art, there is Korean Utility Model Registration No. 20-0418452 (entitled Ultraviolet Sterilization Device for Mobile Device and published on Jun. 12, 2006).</p><heading id="h-0003"
