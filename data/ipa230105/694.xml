To effectively contain bodily exudates, the article should provide a snug fit around the waist and legs of a wearer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current diaper designs frequently include the use of a barrier leg cuff to prevent leakage of bodily exudates and an outer cuff which provides a covering over the barrier leg cuff to minimize the visibility of exudates through the barrier cuff and provide a secondary means to capture bodily exudates should they breach the barrier leg cuff. The barrier leg cuff may be made using a hydrophobic nonwoven and may be disposed on the body-facing surface of the absorbent article or connected to the body-facing surface of the film backsheet layer. The barrier leg cuff may be a substantially liquid impervious layer that prevents bodily exudates from passing out of the sides of the article and may also be highly breathable, allowing outside air to reach the skin to help maintain a healthy level of skin hydration. In many current diapers, the outer cuff comprises the polymeric film layer of the backsheet to provide high opacity required to cover the barrier leg cuff as well as to prevent molten adhesive from passing through the cuff to the garment-facing surface of the article during manufacturing. The outer cuff contains the outer leg elastic strands, which create the contraction forces and gathers, and can be sandwiched between the cuff material and backsheet material. The elastic strands in the leg cuffs are typically joined with molten adhesive during manufacture, and the hot adhesive generally has the potential to pass through nonwoven materials during manufacture, causing contamination of manufacturing lines as well as the potential for stickiness on the outside surface of the article. The polymeric film generally is used to prevent these issues, however, results in a plastic-like look as well as a noisy application process.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Because of manufacturing tolerances when cutting, tracking, and combining materials, the outer leg elastic strands are generally spaced inboard from the longitudinal edge of the article in the crotch region. This prevents inadvertent cutting or exposure of the outer leg elastic strands during the manufacturing process. This design does not result in the outermost portion of the longitudinal edge of the product continuously contacting closely to the skin of the user during wear. Thus, the ability of the elastic strand(s) to control the edge of the article diminishes as the distance between the outermost elastic and the edge increases, leading to a more random distribution of larger gathers which contact the skin at larger intervals or sometimes not at all. This effect can lead to user perception that the diaper may leak where the longitudinal edge does not contact the skin of the user. In addition, many articles currently available contain only two to three outer leg elastics per side to create the gathers, increasing the difficulty of achieving the desired appearance of a wide finished leg cuff or more garment-like cuff such as the elasticized hemmed edge of the arm cuff of a sweater. If the elastics are spaced more closely, the result is a narrow section of elasticized zone, which results in a less finished, less comfortable, and less clothing-like appearance. If the elastics are spaced farther apart, the gathers can appear to separate further from the skin of the user, leading to a perception of potential leakage risk. As discussed above, this is driven by having less control of the gathers between strands of increasing separation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an absorbent article with a folded outer cuff design having finished edges with elastics that are close to the edge to maintain a close proximity to the skin to create improved fit, a more aesthetically pleasing, clothing-like design and improved leakage protection.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, even with the improved leakage protection provided by the cuff designs detailed herein, the most common mode of failure for absorbent articles still occurs when body exudates leak out of the gaps between the article and the wearer's legs and/or waist. When fecal material (e.g., runny bowel movement, a mixture of bowel movement and urine, etc.) is not absorbed into the topsheet and core of absorbent article, the fecal material can leak out of the gaps between the article and the wearer's legs or waist. In situations where a wearer exudes a higher quantity of fecal material&#x2014;which is absorbed by the absorbent core more slowly than urine&#x2014;the fecal material may move laterally along the body-side surface of the absorbent article and reach the barrier leg cuff. Fecal material may also travel longitudinally along the barrier leg cuffs or longitudinally up the gluteal grove of the wearer towards the waist. Due to the movement of the wearer and/or a shortage of available space under the barrier cuffs and/or within the absorbent article, the fecal material may leak out of the gaps between the article and the wearer's legs and/or waist.

in reference to absorbent articles, means that the absorbent articles are generally not intended to be laundered or otherwise restored or reused as absorbent articles (i.e., they are intended to be discarded after a single use and, preferably, to be recycled, composted or otherwise discarded in an environmentally compatible manner).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">&#x201c;Absorbent article&#x201d; refers to devices which absorb and contain body exudates and, more specifically, refers to devices which are placed against or in proximity to the body of the wearer to absorb and contain the various exudates discharged from the body. Exemplary absorbent articles include diapers, training pants, pull-on pant-type diapers (i.e., a diaper having a pre-formed waist opening and leg openings such as illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 6,120,487), refastenable diapers or pant-type diapers, incontinence briefs and undergarments, diaper holders and liners, feminine hygiene garments such as panty liners, absorbent inserts, and the like.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">&#x201c;Proximal&#x201d; and &#x201c;Distal&#x201d; refer respectively to the location of an element relatively near to or far from the longitudinal or lateral centerline of a structure (e.g., the proximal edge of a longitudinally extending element is located nearer to the longitudinal centerline than the distal edge of the same element is located relative to the same longitudinal centerline).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">&#x201c;Body-facing&#x201d; and &#x201c;garment-facing&#x201d; refer respectively to the relative location of an element or a surface of an element or group of elements. &#x201c;Body-facing&#x201d; implies the element or surface is nearer to the wearer during wear than some other element or surface. &#x201c;Garment-facing&#x201d; implies the element or surface is more remote from the wearer during wear than some other element or surface (i.e., element or surface is proximate to the wearer's garments that may be worn over the disposable absorbent article).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">&#x201c;Longitudinal&#x201d; refers to a direction running substantially perpendicular from a waist edge to an opposing waist edge of the article and generally parallel to the maximum linear dimension of the article. Directions within 45 degrees of the longitudinal direction are considered to be &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">&#x201c;Lateral&#x201d; refers to a direction running from a longitudinal edge to an opposing longitudinal edge of the article and generally at a right angle to the longitudinal direction. Directions within 45 degrees of the lateral direction are considered to be &#x201c;lateral.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">&#x201c;Disposed&#x201d; refers to an element being located in a particular place or position.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">&#x201c;Joined&#x201d; refers to configurations whereby an element is directly secured to another element by affixing the element directly to the other element and to configurations whereby an element is indirectly secured to another element by affixing the element to intermediate member(s) which in turn are affixed to the other element.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">&#x201c;Film&#x201d; refers to a sheet-like material wherein the length and width of the material far exceed the thickness of the material. Typically, films have a thickness of about 0.5 mm or less.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">&#x201c;Water-permeable&#x201d; and &#x201c;water-impermeable&#x201d; refer to the penetrability of materials in the context of the intended usage of disposable absorbent articles. Specifically, the term &#x201c;water-permeable&#x201d; refers to a layer or a layered structure having pores, openings, and/or interconnected void spaces that permit liquid water, urine, or synthetic urine to pass through its thickness in the absence of a forcing pressure. Conversely, the term &#x201c;water-impermeable&#x201d; refers to a layer or a layered structure through the thickness of which liquid water, urine, or synthetic urine cannot pass in the absence of a forcing pressure (aside from natural forces such as gravity). A layer or a layered structure that is water-impermeable according to this definition may be permeable to water vapor, i.e., may be &#x201c;vapor-permeable.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">&#x201c;Extendibility&#x201d; and &#x201c;extensible&#x201d; mean that the width or length of the component in a relaxed state can be extended or increased.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">&#x201c;Elasticated&#x201d; and &#x201c;elasticized&#x201d; mean that a component comprises at least a portion made of elastic material.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">&#x201c;Elongatable material,&#x201d; &#x201c;extensible material,&#x201d; or &#x201c;stretchable material&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to a material that, upon application of a biasing force, can stretch to an elongated length of at least about 110% of its relaxed, original length (i.e. can stretch to 10 percent more than its original length), without rupture or breakage, and upon release of the applied force, shows little recovery, less than about 20% of its elongation without complete rupture or breakage as measured by EDANA method 20.2-89. In the event such an elongatable material recovers at least 40% of its elongation upon release of the applied force, the elongatable material will be considered to be &#x201c;elastic&#x201d; or &#x201c;elastomeric.&#x201d; For example, an elastic material that has an initial length of 100 mm can extend at least to 150 mm, and upon removal of the force retracts to a length of at least 130 mm (i.e., exhibiting a 40% recovery). In the event the material recovers less than 40% of its elongation upon release of the applied force, the elongatable material will be considered to be &#x201c;substantially non-elastic&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially non-elastomeric&#x201d;. For example, an elongatable material that has an initial length of 100 mm can extend at least to 150 mm, and upon removal of the force retracts to a length of at least 145 mm (i.e., exhibiting a 10% recovery).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">&#x201c;Elastomeric material&#x201d; is a material exhibiting elastic properties. Elastomeric materials may include elastomeric films, scrims, nonwovens, and other sheet-like structures.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">&#x201c;Pant&#x201d; refers to disposable absorbent articles having a pre-formed waist and leg openings. A pant may be donned by inserting a wearer's legs into the leg openings and sliding the pant into position about the wearer's lower torso. Pants are also commonly referred to as &#x201c;closed diapers&#x201d;, &#x201c;prefastened diapers&#x201d;, &#x201c;pull-on diapers&#x201d;, &#x201c;training pants&#x201d; and &#x201c;diaper-pants.&#x201d;</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Absorbent Article:</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The present disclosure is directed to a disposable absorbent article with a leg gasketing system that comprises a folded outer cuff having neatly finished outer cuff folded edges that creates an aesthetically pleasing design that is garment like, the absorbent article also including a leg gasketing system pocket with an opening towards the interior of the article, wherein the pocket reduces runny bowel movement leaks, the absorbent article also including at least one waist gasketing element. The folded outer cuff design is advantageous in preventing penetration and adhesive bleedthrough without the use of a polymeric film layer in the elasticized region. The absorbent article may comprise an opacity strengthening patch to provide the strength needed to prevent the article from extending excessively during application and wearing, and provide the opacity at the sides and waist to prevent the skin of the user from showing through the article.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>12</b></figref> are plan views of the absorbent article <b>20</b> described herein in a flat, uncontracted state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>12</b></figref> illustrate substantially the same disposable absorbent article, with the difference being that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> also incorporates a waist gasketing element <b>81</b> in the second waist region <b>38</b>.

Leaks of this type often happen because the snug fit between user's body and the attached absorbent article do not allow enough room for the runny bowel movement to remain contained within the absorbent article during the wearer's movement. One advantage of the leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b> as detailed herein, in combination with the leg gasketing system(s) as detailed herein, are the additional pocketed areas that provide extra void volumes within the leg cuffs for containment of bodily extrudate (e.g., fecal material).

Thus, the leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b> detailed herein reduces leaks. Moreover, leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b> provides additional void volume within the leg cuffs to receive the fecal material which helps in isolating the fecal material from wearer's skin and restricts flow towards the front by the separation sheet.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b> may be free of elastic members <b>77</b>.

The overall lateral width of the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> may measure between about 60 mm and about 200 mm in the lateral direction, or any range or distance within the range of about 60 mm to about 200 mm; in some absorbent articles, about 60 mm, about 100 mm, or about 150 mm; and in other absorbent articles the overall lateral width measures between about 50 mm and about 300 mm.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Babies, in particular breast fed babies, often have issues with runny bowel movement (&#x201c;BM&#x201d;) leaking out of the sides and/or back of their diapers. Moreover, an absorbent article user of any age may have an issue from time to time with runny BM leaks. When a wearer of an absorbent article has a runny bowel movement, many times the runny bowel movement spreads upon defecation and leaks out of the absorbent article in an area between the waist region and the wearer's back. These events are generally referred to as &#x201c;blowouts.&#x201d; Blowouts happen because the snug fit between user's body and the attached absorbent article do not allow enough room for the runny bowel movement to remain contained within the absorbent article during the wearer's movement. One advantage of the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> detailed herein, alone or in combination with the leg gasketing systems as detailed herein, are the additional pocketed areas (<b>47</b> and <b>93</b>) that provide extra void volumes within the leg cuffs and waist region for containment of bodily extrudate (e.g., fecal material). When the wearer moves, a portion of the bodily extrudate will migrate into the waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b> for containment and be held/trapped between two layers of nonwoven before it can leak out in an area between the wearer's back and the back waist region of the absorbent article. Thus, the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> detailed herein reduces leaks. Moreover, the waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b> provides additional void volume within the waist region to receive the fecal material which helps in isolating the fecal material from wearer's skin.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Further, the waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b> may work in conjunction with the leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b> to provide even more void volume within the absorbent article to receive fecal material and/or provide an easier path for fecal material to find the leg gasketing system pocket opening <b>51</b>. The gasketing action of any elastic material (e.g., leg elastics <b>87</b>, detailed below) within the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> may function to lift the inboard lateral edge <b>82</b> of the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> away from the chassis <b>22</b> of the absorbent article. The longitudinal edge bonds <b>86</b> of the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> attach the waist gasketing element to the inner cuff <b>71</b> and/or the outer cuff <b>74</b> of the leg gasketing system <b>70</b>. Accordingly, the gasketing action of any elastic material (e.g., leg elastics <b>87</b>) within the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> may also function to lift the inner cuff <b>71</b> and/or outer cuff <b>74</b> of the leg gasketing system <b>70</b> away from the chassis <b>22</b>, therefore amplifying the opening <b>51</b> of the leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b>. With the opening <b>51</b> of the leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b> opened up, the pocket can more readily accept fecal material such as runny bowel movement.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">As detailed above, the leg gasketing system <b>70</b> and/or the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> and/or a combination of both as described herein may assist in reducing runny BM leaks/blowouts. The Blowout Method Test, as defined herein, was developed to quantify how efficient an absorbent article (e.g., a diaper) is at containing runny BM, thus avoiding blowouts.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The combination of the waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b> and the leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b> provides more void volume within the absorbent article that helps in containing more fecal material. Particularly for the waist gasketing element <b>81</b>, the overall longitudinal length of the waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b> multiplied by the overall lateral width of the waist gasketing element pocket (multiplied by the amount the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> is spaced away from the chassis <b>22</b>) define the active void volume under the waist gasketing element <b>81</b>. In the situation of BM blowouts, this active void volume under the waist gasketing element <b>93</b> provides more area for BM containment, thus minimizing and/or avoiding blowouts.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">This active void volume under waist gasketing element <b>93</b> also relates to the size of the absorbent article and the amount/volume of BM it can contain. For larger size absorbent articles, and thus larger users, higher active void volume is required to contain more fecal material and avoid blowouts. This can be achieved by increasing the overall longitudinal length of the waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b> and overall lateral width of the waist gasketing element pocket. Therefore for the Blowout Method Test, as defined herein, larger quantities of artificial BM and saline are required for larger sized absorbent articles.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="308pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Blowout Method Test Results</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Blowout</entry><entry>Blowout</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Diaper</entry><entry>Total</entry><entry>Total Saline</entry><entry>Leakage</entry><entry>Percent</entry><entry>Efficiency Factor =</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Weight</entry><entry>Artificial BM</entry><entry>Volume</entry><entry>Weight</entry><entry>Leakage</entry><entry>(Blowout Leakage</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(Avg.)</entry><entry>Weight added</entry><entry>added</entry><entry>(Avg.)</entry><entry>(Avg.)</entry><entry>Weight/Diaper</entry></row><row><entry>Product</entry><entry>grams</entry><entry>grams</entry><entry>ml</entry><entry>grams</entry><entry>%</entry><entry>Weight) * 100</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="63pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Prototype</entry><entry>25.5</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>4.91</entry><entry>4.91%</entry><entry>19.3</entry></row><row><entry>Absorbent</entry></row><row><entry>Article, Size 2*</entry></row><row><entry>2015 Pampers</entry><entry>22.58</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>18.07</entry><entry>18.07%</entry><entry>80.0</entry></row><row><entry>Swaddlers, Size 2</entry></row><row><entry>2015 Huggies</entry><entry>24.89</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>15.30</entry><entry>15.30%</entry><entry>61.5</entry></row><row><entry>Snug and Dry,</entry></row><row><entry>Size 2</entry></row><row><entry>Huggies Korean</entry><entry>35.3</entry><entry>150</entry><entry>150</entry><entry>14.29</entry><entry>9.53%</entry><entry>40.5</entry></row><row><entry>L, Size 4**</entry></row><row><entry>2015 Pampers</entry><entry>31.47</entry><entry>150</entry><entry>150</entry><entry>25.61</entry><entry>17.07%</entry><entry>81.4</entry></row><row><entry>Swaddlers, Size 4</entry></row><row><entry>2015 Pampers</entry><entry>33.35</entry><entry>150</entry><entry>150</entry><entry>24.60</entry><entry>16.40%</entry><entry>73.8</entry></row><row><entry>Swaddlers, Size 5</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="left" id="FOO-00001">*The Prototype Absorbent Article tested for the data generation tabulated in Table 1 was an absorbent article with a structure as shown in FIGS. 12-16.

The absorbent articles described herein may have a Blowout Percent Leakage of between about 0.1% and about 9.0%, between 1.0% and about 9.0%, between about 2.0% and about 9.0%, between about 3.0% and about 9.0%, between about 4.0% and about 9.0%, between about 5.0% and about 9.0%, or any range of Blowout Percent Leakage within such ranges.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">After being tested by the Blowout Method Test as described herein, the absorbent articles described herein may have a Efficiency Factor=(Blowout Leakage Weight/Diaper Weight)*100 of less than about 40.0, less than about 35.0, less than about 30.0, less than about 25.0, less than about 20.0, less than about 15.0, less than about 10.0, less than about 5.0, or less than about 2.0, or any range of Efficiency Factor within the previous ranges. The absorbent articles described herein may have an Efficiency Factor of between about 0.1 and about 40.0, between 5.0 and about 35.0, between about 10.0 and about 35.0, between about 15.0 and about 35.0 between about 20.0 and about 35.0, between about 20.0 and about 30.0, between about 0.1 and about 25.0, or any range of Efficiency Factor within such ranges. Absorbent articles with lower values for Efficiency Factor indicate a balance of high prevention of blowouts, while also using less diaper materials (the diaper weighs less and therefore uses less material). Accordingly, the absorbent articles described herein are better performing in preventing runny BM blowouts, while costing less and having less environmental impact (i.e., having better economic efficiency and environmental efficiency).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112">The prototype absorbent article tested, and the data reflected in Table 1 above, weighed under 30.0 g and therefore 100.0 ml of saline (two separate 50.0 ml applications) and 100.0 g of artificial BM was used for testing. The prototype absorbent article included the leg gasketing system <b>70</b> and the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> which comprise N-fiber material. The combination of waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b> and leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b> provides more void volume within the prototype absorbent article that assists in reducing Blowout Percent Leakage. Particularly for the waist gasketing element <b>81</b>, the overall longitudinal length of the waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b> tested was 34 mm and the overall lateral width of the waist gasketing element pocket tested was 140 mm. The overall lateral width of the leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b> in the prototype absorbent article was 20 mm. This active void volume under waist gasketing element <b>93</b> can be increased by increasing overall longitudinal length of the waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b> and overall lateral width of the waist gasketing element pocket. Therefore, for other prototype absorbent articles as described herein with higher active void volume waist gasketing element designs, the Blowout Percent Leakage will be further reduced (and therefore further avoid BM blowouts) when tested under the Blowout Method Test.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">While not being bound by theory, it is believed that the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> can provide a seal to the body which is created by multiple aspects of the invention. First, the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> is elasticated and designed to be under tension in use. The tension in use is created by the caregiver in the process of applying the product as she/he is trying to achieve a snug fit. Through the Capstan effect, the tension created during application and the radius of the body provides a force between the waist gasketing element and the body which is in the normal direction with respect to the body. This normal force between the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> and the body provides the initial seal that causes bodily extrudate to run between the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> and the chassis or topsheet, and causes the bodily extrudate to be forced into the waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b>. Furthermore, it is known that rapidly excreted bodily extrudate has a pressure which causes the distribution of the bodily extrudate throughout the absorbent article <b>20</b>. If the bodily extrudate is trapped between the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> and the chassis <b>22</b>, then the pressure created from the bodily extrudate will act to further seal the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> against the body, adding to the normal force created by the aforementioned Capstan effect and creating an even better seal. Since the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> is sealed to the body, bodily extrudate can't escape and then an amount of the bodily extrudate is forced laterally sideways into the leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b> for storage.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">To achieve the maximum effectiveness from the Capstan effect, which leads to the sealing of the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> to the body, the leg gasketing system should ideally be positioned in an area of the body which has a continuous convex surface or a continuous cylindrical shape or approximation thereof. If the body surface becomes concave or &#x201c;valley-like&#x201d; at any point, the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> will not be able to form a proper seal between the body and the waist gasketing element. This will allow exudates to escape through the space between the body and the waist gasketing element <b>81</b>. Therefore, it important to position the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> above the gluteal groove, in such a way as to ensure that the body has the right geometry to enable the seal to be adequately formed. Ideally, the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> can be positioned at the top of the gluteal groove, 10 mm above the gluteal grove, 25 mm above the gluteal groove, or 50 mm above the gluteal groove.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">In addition, it may be useful to make the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> tall enough so that if the chassis <b>22</b> does not fit close to the body, the waist gasketing element can still remain in contact. Additionally, it may be useful to provide enough void volume in the waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b> such that sufficient amounts of bodily extrudate can reside there. To ensure that the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> is sufficiently above the gluteal groove and also is tall enough to seal to the body and create enough void volume, it is advantageous to position the waist gasketing element at the top of the absorbent article <b>20</b>, near or coincident to the waist edge <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, or as close as possible to the waist edge. With variability in the placement of the materials in high speed diaper making applications, it may be necessary to position the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> in such a way as to enable it to be cut apart as a part of the manufacturing process such that a portion of the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> is attached to a first absorbent article and the remainder is attached to the next absorbent article in the manufacturing process. This ensures that the top edge of the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> is coterminous to the waist edge <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. Thus, the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> is not spaced down from the waist edge of the absorbent article. The outboard lateral edge <b>83</b> of the waist gasketing element <b>81</b> may be placed 5 mm inboard of the second waist edge <b>14</b> of chassis <b>22</b>; whereas in some absorbent articles, the outboard lateral edge <b>83</b> of the waist gasketing element is placed at least 10 mm inboard from the waist edge <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of the chassis <b>22</b>; at least 20 mm inboard from the waist edge of the chassis; at least 50 mm inboard from the waist edge of the chassis; or any range or distance within the range of about 2 mm to about 100 mm inboard from the waist edge of the chassis.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">The waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b> may include a thermal or compression bond that defines at least a portion of the perimeter of the pocket (e.g., the entire perimeter of the pocket), such that the at least a portion of the pocket <b>93</b> (e.g., the entire pocket), can be made visible to a wearer or caregiver as to signal the functionality of the pocket <b>93</b> prior to use.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">Alternately, the waist gasketing element pocket <b>93</b> may include a glue or bond that defines at least a portion of the perimeter of the pocket (e.g., the entire perimeter of the pocket), such that the at least a portion of the pocket <b>93</b> (e.g., the entire pocket), can be made visible to a wearer or caregiver as to signal the functionality of the pocket <b>93</b> prior to use.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">Alternately, the hydrophobic properties, such as Low Surface Tension Strikethrough or Hydro Head, can be increased in a least a portion of the waist gasketing element <b>81</b>, or in the whole waist gasketing element, in such a way that prevents exudates from leaking through the materials that comprise the waist gasketing element. Accordingly, this will maintain separation of the contained fecal material from the wearer. Increasing hydrophobic properties can be accomplished by applying hydrophobic coatings, inks, glues, silicones, additional materials, or any combination thereof, or by any other means known in the art. Additionally, it may be advantageous to include an N-fiber material in the waist gasketing element to provide the similar benefits as associated with the leg cuff, as detailed herein.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">The waist gasketing element <b>81</b> and the leg gasketing system <b>70</b> may be the same color.

As with the waist gasketing element located in the rear waist region, a waist gasketing element in the front waist region (i.e., first waist region <b>36</b>) can also work in conjunction with a leg gasketing system pocket for the storage of urine as needed to prevent leakage out of the front of the product.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Opacity Strengthening Patch:</heading><p id="p-0131" num="0129">An opacity strengthening patch <b>80</b> may be included as part of the chassis <b>22</b>. The opacity strengthening patch <b>80</b> is an additional layer of material. The opacity strengthening patch <b>80</b> may be connected to the leg gasketing system <b>70</b>, the polymeric film layer, or the backsheet <b>26</b>. The opacity strengthening patch <b>80</b> may be disposed between the backsheet <b>26</b> and leg gasketing system <b>70</b> in either the first waist region <b>36</b>, the second waist region <b>38</b>, or both the first waist region <b>36</b> and the second waist region <b>38</b> of the article; the opacity strengthening patch <b>80</b> may overlap at least one of the leg gasketing system <b>70</b> and/or the polymeric film layer (i.e., inner layer of the backsheet <b>26</b>). The opacity strengthening patch <b>80</b> may be attached to one or both of the leg gasketing system <b>70</b> or the polymer film layer using any suitable means such as glue, mechanical bonds, thermal bonds, or the like, so that loads generated during the application process or during wear can be transferred from the lateral edge of the article to the leg gasketing system <b>70</b> and/or the polymeric film layer. The opacity strengthening patch is useful in providing the strength needed to prevent the article from extending excessively during application and wearing; it also may provide opacity at the sides and waist to prevent the skin of the user from showing through the article. Thus, the patch <b>80</b> may be located at any portion of the chassis <b>22</b> where strength and opacity is desirable. Materials suitable to act as the opacity strengthening patch include materials having a basis weight of at least about 10 gsm, at least about 15 gsm, at least about 25 gsm. An opacity strengthening patch useful herein may exhibit the following tensile properties in the cross direction: at 2% engineering strain for a 1 inch wide sample, 0.4 N; at 5% engineering strain for a 1 inch wide sample, 1.25 N; at 10% engineering strain for a 1 inch wide sample, 2.5 N.

The opacity strengthening patch may overlap the polymeric film layer in the lateral direction such that it can be affixed to the polymeric film in order to transmit laterally directed application and wearing forces from the opacity strengthening patch to the polymeric film layer. Any suitable bonding means known in the art may be used to affix the opacity strengthening patch to the polymeric film layer.

These layers may include the topsheet, backsheet nonwoven, cuff, absorbent assembly, leg gasketing system, or any other layer that is located in a region adjacent to the polymeric film layer.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">The material of the leg gasketing system <b>70</b> may be made from a substantially liquid impervious material.

The leg gasketing cuff <b>70</b> may comprise a nonwoven component layer having fine fibers (&#x201c;N-fibers&#x201d;) with an average diameter of less than 1 micron (an &#x201c;N-fiber layer&#x201d;) may be added to, or otherwise incorporated with, other nonwoven component layers to form a nonwoven web of material. The N-fiber layer may be used to produce a SNS nonwoven web or SMNS nonwoven web, for example.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">The leg gasketing cuff <b>70</b> may comprise a first nonwoven component layer comprising fibers having an average diameter in the range of about 8 microns to about 30 microns, a second nonwoven component layer comprising fibers having a number-average diameter of less than about 1 micron, a mass-average diameter of less than about 1.5 microns, and a ratio of the mass-average diameter to the number-average diameter less than about 2, and a third nonwoven component layer comprising fibers having an average diameter in the range of about 8 microns to about 30 microns. The second nonwoven component layer is disposed intermediate the first nonwoven component layer and the third nonwoven component layer.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">The N-fibers may be comprised of a polymer, e.g., selected from polyesters, including PET and PBT, polylactic acid (PLA), alkyds, polyolefins, including polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polybutylene (PB), olefinic copolymers from ethylene and propylene, elastomeric polymers including thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) and styrenic block-copolymers (linear and radial di- and tri-block copolymers such as various types of Kraton), polystyrenes, polyamides, PHA (polyhydroxyalkanoates) and e.g. PHB (polyhydroxubutyrate), and starch-based compositions including thermoplastic starch, for example. The above polymers may be used as homopolymers, copolymers, e.g., copolymers of ethylene and propylene, blends, and alloys thereof. The N-fiber layer may be bonded to the other nonwoven component layers by any suitable bonding technique, such as the calender bond process, for example, also called thermal point bonding.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">The use of an N-fiber layer in a nonwoven web may provide a low surface tension barrier that is as high as other nonwoven webs that have been treated with a hydrophobic coating or a hydrophobic melt-additive, and still maintain a low basis weight (e.g., less than 15 gsm or, alternatively, less than 13 gsm). The use of the N-fiber layer may also provide a soft and breathable (i.e., air permeable) nonwoven material that may be used in single web layer configurations in applications which previously used double web layer configurations. Furthermore, the use of the N-fiber layer may at least reduce the undesirable migration of hydrophilic surfactants toward the web and, therefore, may ultimately result in better leak protection for an associated absorbent article. Also, when compared to an SMS web having a similar basis weight, the use of a nonwoven web comprising the N-fiber layer may decrease the number of defects (i.e., holes or pinholes through the mechanical bond site) created during the mechanical bonding process. N-fibers are further discussed in WO 2005/095700 and U.S. patent application Ser.

The specimen is then covered with the white standard plate. A reading is taken, then the white tile is removed and replaced with the black standard tile without moving the specimen.

The thickness tester is configured so that the horizontal sliding plate moves freely in a vertical direction with the horizontal sliding plate always maintained in a horizontal orientation directly above a flat, rigid horizontal base plate. The thickness tester includes a suitable device for measuring the gap between the horizontal sliding plate and the horizontal base plate to within &#xb1;0.5 mm. The horizontal sliding plate and the horizontal base plate are larger than the surface of the absorbent article package that contacts each plate, i.e. each plate extends past the contact surface of the absorbent article package in all directions. The horizontal sliding plate exerts a downward force of 850&#xb1;1 gram-force (8.34 N) on the absorbent article package, which may be achieved by placing a suitable weight on the center of the non-package-contacting top surface of the horizontal sliding plate so that the total mass of the sliding plate plus added weight is 850&#xb1;1 grams.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="2">Test Procedure</heading><p id="p-0207" num="0227">Absorbent article packages are equilibrated at 23&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. and 50&#xb1;5% relative humidity prior to measurement.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0228">The horizontal sliding plate is raised and an absorbent article package is placed centrally under the horizontal sliding plate in such a way that the absorbent articles within the package are in a horizontal orientation (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>). Any handle or other packaging feature on the surfaces of the package that would contact either of the plates is folded flat against the surface of the package so as to minimize their impact on the measurement. The horizontal sliding plate is lowered slowly until it contacts the top surface of the package and then released. The gap between the horizontal plates is measured to within &#xb1;0.5 mm ten seconds after releasing the horizontal sliding plate. Five identical packages (same size packages and same absorbent articles counts) are measured and the arithmetic mean is reported as the package width. The &#x201c;In-Bag Stack Height&#x201d;=(package width/absorbent article count per stack)&#xd7;10 is calculated and reported to within &#xb1;0.5 mm.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="1">Examples</heading><p id="p-0209" num="0000"><ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0229">A.
