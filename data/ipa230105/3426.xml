For that reason, the pressure on the opening side of the V-shaped cross-section of the seal member <b>132</b> tends to be higher than that on the closed side, and a force that presses and expands the V-shaped cross-section is applied, thereby improving the sealing performance.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The pressing member <b>133</b> is formed in a ring shape in a cross-sectional view in the axial direction and a plan view.
