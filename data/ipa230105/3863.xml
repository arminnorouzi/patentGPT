For instance, automated charging systems for electric vehicles (EVs), which may be installed at such a predefined location, often require minimal driver interaction. To this end, the charging system should be equipped with a system to guide the vehicle to the charging unit. The guiding of the vehicle should be performed correctly and safely, in the sense that the vehicle is guided to the correct location and in the sense that no collisions occur between the vehicle and any external object or human being.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a vehicle charging site <b>100</b>. As EVs and electric-hybrid vehicles are increasingly gaining market popularity, there is a need to develop automated charging systems which require minimal driver interaction and thus enable high driver comfort. Furthermore, such automatic charging stations may enable the widespread adoption of automated EVs and automated driving functions. A typical example is a fully automated park-and-charge system in a large parking facility, where a driver enters the facility and the automatic charging system establishes a wireless connection to the EV and guides it to the next free charging spot, either by providing directions on the driver's display or by taking full control of the EV (e.g. in case of autonomous EVs). Optionally, the driver can also select the desired charging unit. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a plurality of charging units <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> is installed at different predefined locations. Furthermore, an approaching vehicle <b>106</b> should be guided to the predefined location at which the first charging unit <b>108</b> is installed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a scenario as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the charging system should support different functions. For instance, a wireless connection should be established between the vehicle and the charging station, for the purposes of authorization, payment, and other transaction-related tasks. Furthermore, the vehicle should be localized to facilitate the execution of a guiding or routing procedure. In addition, the actual vehicle guiding should be performed, based on a planned path between the current position of the vehicle and the predefined location to which the vehicle should be guided. More specifically, based on the current position of the vehicle, the optimal route may be estimated, and the vehicle may be guided to the charging unit. The latter may require a continuous tracking of the vehicle's position relative to the charging unit. Besides the ranging feature of estimating the distance between multiple modules in the charging unit and the vehicle, the charging unit may also have to be capable of estimating the angle of arrival to refine the position estimation. An example of a UWB-based vehicle guiding system has been described in the article <i>Ultra</i>-<i>Wideband Aided Precision Parking for Wireless Power Transfer to Electric Vehicles in Real Life Scenarios</i>, written by Janis Tiemann et al. and published at the IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall), 18-21 Sep. 2016.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Finally, a process such as radar-based vehicle sensing may have to be performed, in order to meet safety requirements. More specifically, a foreign body detection may have to performed, e.g. to detect a combustion engine vehicle blocking the charging unit or other obstacles hindering a successful charging procedure. Furthermore, a collision detection process should be executed, to detect potential collisions with objects or humans passing by. In case of a detection of a potential collision, the route should be recalculated.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Typically, these different functions are executed by different units or components integrated in the vehicle and the charging station. This, however, is not efficient in terms of resource usage. More specifically, a cost-efficient and space-efficient vehicle guiding system is desirable, which combines at least some of the above-mentioned functions in a single system or device at the side of the vehicle and a single system or device at the side of the predefined location to the which the vehicle should be guided (e.g. a charging station).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Now discussed are systems and methods for facilitating guiding a vehicle to a predefined location. In particular, said systems and methods facilitate combining the functions of connection establishment, vehicle localization, vehicle guiding and foreign object detection in a single system or device at the side of the vehicle and a single system or device at the side of the predefined location to the which the vehicle should be guided.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an illustrative embodiment of a vehicle <b>200</b> including a system for facilitating guiding the vehicle to a predefined location. The system comprises a plurality of ultra-wideband (UWB) communication units <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> configured to establish UWB communication with a UWB-enabled system (not shown) installed at said predefined location.

The method <b>500</b> facilitates performing various functions in a single system at the side of the predefined location, as explained above with reference to the corresponding system.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">UWB is a technology that uses a high signal bandwidth, in particular for transmitting digital data over a wide spectrum of frequency bands with very low power. For example, UWB technology may use the frequency spectrum of 3.1 to 10.6 GHz and may feature a high-frequency bandwidth of more than 500 MHz and very short pulse signals, potentially capable of supporting high data rates. The UWB technology enables a high data throughput for communication devices and a high precision for the localization of devices. In particular, UWB technology may be used for so-called ranging operations, i.e. for determining the distance between communicating devices. Therefore, UWB technology may be used to advantage in various applications, such as automotive applications.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">UWB technology&#x2014;also referred to as impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB)&#x2014;is a RF communication technology that uses pulses having a short duration for data communication. An important feature of IR-UWB technology is that it can be used for secure and accurate distance measurements between two or more devices. Typical distance measurement methods are the so-called single-sided two-way ranging (SS-TWR) method and the double-sided two-way ranging (DS-TWR) method.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Because UWB technology has an accurate distance measurement capability, it may be used to advantage in access systems in which the position of devices should be determined to enable access to an object. For instance, a vehicle access system may comprise a user's smart device (e.g., key fob) and another smart device (e.g., an anchor embedded in the vehicle). To enable access to the vehicle, the user's smart device must have a predefined range relative to the other smart device. Therefore, UWB transceivers are typically configured to operate in a ranging mode. In another example, UWB technology may be used for accessing a building or a predefined space within a building.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the ranging mode of operation, frames will typically be exchanged between two devices via at least one antenna on each device, and at least a SS-TWR operation will be carried out (which may also be referred to as a ping-pong operation). In particular, channel impulse responses (CIRs) are estimated on both devices, timestamps will be generated based on the CIRs on both devices, and those timestamps are exchanged. Then, a time of flight (ToF) is calculated based on the timestamps and a range (i.e., a distance) is calculated based on the ToF. Alternatively, a DS-TWR operation may be carried out (which may also be referred to as a ping-pong-ping operation). The AoA mode of operation is similar to the ranging mode, but it involves at least two antennas on one device. In particular, in the AoA mode of operation, two phase values associated with at least two CIRs are calculated on one device. Then, a phase difference of arrival (PDoA) is calculated based on the two-phase values, and an AoA is calculated based on the PDoA. The AoA mode of operation may facilitate a more accurate determination of the position of an object and may thus complement ranging operations performed in the ranging mode. As used in this description, the ranging mode of operation may therefore be extended to include the AoA mode of operation, in the sense that when a device operates in the ranging mode, it may optionally perform additional operations which are typically performed in the AoA mode of operation.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the radar mode of operation, frames are transmitted by at least one device and those frames are received by the same device and/or by one or more other devices. Then, the CIRs are estimated on the device or devices receiving the frames, and the range and/or velocity and/or AoA are calculated based on the estimated CIRs. The radar mode of operation may be used to advantage to detect (i.e., sense) the presence of objects or human beings. The skilled person will appreciate that the given examples are non-limiting examples of how the different modes of operation can be implemented. In other words, the modes may be implemented differently, depending on the requirements imposed by the application, for example.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In accordance with the present disclosure, various functions may be integrated in a single system or device at the side of the vehicle and at the side of the predefined location. More specifically, the main functions of (i) communication, (ii) localization/ranging, (iii) path planning, and (iv) sensing/radar may be integrated in a single system or device. This is achieved by causing the UWB communication units of said system or device to switch between a communication mode of operation, a ranging mode of operation and a radar mode of operation. In particular, these different modes of operation support the aforementioned different functions. Accordingly, a cost-efficient and space-efficient charging control unit may be realized, allowing the widespread adoption of automatic EV charging systems. Furthermore, an already existing smart car access infrastructure in the vehicle may be reused for the purpose of vehicle guiding and collision detection. More specifically, the aforementioned UWB communication units may be the same units as used for smart access applications. For instance, to enable these smart access applications, UWB anchors are typically already integrated into vehicles. Accordingly, the existing infrastructure in the vehicles may be reused and the value and purpose of UWB-enabled anchors within the vehicles may be increased.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For instance, in a charging station use case, both a vehicle and a charging station may contain a guiding and sensing system including UWB-enabled modules that can be configured to operate in a communication mode and ranging mode for localizing and guiding the vehicle, and in a radar mode (i.e., a sensing mode) for foreign body detection and collision detection and avoidance. Furthermore, both the vehicle and the charging station may contain control units, which may comprise algorithms for path planning, collision detection, and foreign body detection. Furthermore, these control units may configure the UWB mode depending on the state of the guidance procedure and recalculate the vehicle path depending on the output of the detection algorithms.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an illustrative embodiment of a vehicle charging system <b>600</b>. In particular, an example is shown of a situation in which a vehicle approaches a charging unit. A system at the side of the vehicle and a system at the side of the charging station, which may be interrelated in the sense that they may interact with each other, support the execution of functions such as path planning, foreign body detection (FPD) and collision detection and avoidance. Accordingly, the vehicle charging system <b>600</b> contains a system at the side of the charging station, which includes a charging unit (CU) <b>602</b> and a charging control unit (CCU) <b>604</b>. The charging control unit <b>604</b> comprises a control module <b>606</b> and a plurality of UWB modules <b>608</b>, <b>610</b>, <b>612</b>. In accordance with the present disclosure, the control module <b>606</b> is configured to cause the UWB modules <b>608</b>, <b>610</b>, <b>612</b> to switch between a communication mode of operation, a ranging mode of operation and a radar mode of operation. Furthermore, the vehicle charging system <b>600</b> contains a system at the side of the vehicle, which includes a vehicle unit (VU) <b>614</b> and a vehicle control unit (VCU) <b>616</b>. The vehicle control unit <b>616</b> comprises a control module <b>618</b> and a plurality of UWB modules <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>. In accordance with the present disclosure, the control module <b>618</b> is configured to cause the UWB modules <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>624</b> to switch between a communication mode of operation, a ranging mode of operation and a radar mode of operation.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The charging unit <b>602</b> and the vehicle unit <b>614</b> perform the vehicle charging, i.e. they transfer electrical energy to the vehicle's batteries, which may be done wirelessly or in a conducted manner. In a conducted charging system, for example, the charging unit <b>602</b> may be comprised of a base and a movable arm which dock onto a conductor on the vehicle unit <b>614</b>. The charging control unit <b>604</b> and the vehicle control unit <b>616</b> support the vehicle guidance procedure. Each of the charging control unit <b>604</b> and the vehicle control unit <b>616</b> comprises a control module coupled to multiple UWB modules <b>608</b>, <b>610</b>, <b>612</b>, <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>. A control module may contain algorithms for safe guidance of the vehicle to the charging spot. For example, the control module <b>618</b> of the VCU <b>616</b> may include a path planning algorithm which uses local maps of the charging facility (obtained from the CCU <b>604</b> after a connection has been established or from the parking infrastructure) for the guidance. The path planning does not necessarily have to be executed on the VCU <b>616</b> but could also be performed on path planning control units integrated in automated vehicles.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Multiple UWB modules may be used for the RF communication and localization between the CCU <b>604</b> and the VCU <b>616</b> and for the radar sensing operations. For this purpose, each module may be operated in a communication mode, a ranging mode, an angle-of-arrival mode, a radar mode, and any combination of those modes (e.g., in a combined ranging/radar mode). For instance, when a UWB module operates in a ranging mode, the transmitter of the module may transmit a frame comprising a SYNC field and a payload, and the receiver of the module may be turned off. Furthermore, when the UWB module operates in a combined ranging/radar mode, the following operations may be performed: the transmitter of the module transmits a frame comprising a SYNC field and a payload, the receiver of the module is turned on and receives the SYNC field reflected by the environment, the receiver is turned off after receiving the SYNC field, and the responder answers with a response message to finish the ranging procedure. During the guidance procedure a UWB module may be configured in any of those modes. In addition, a UWB module on the vehicle side may be part of the VCU <b>616</b> or of any existing vehicle anchors used for smart car access (e.g. anchors mounted inside the bumpers). Similarly, a UWB module on the charging unit <b>602</b> may be part of the CCU <b>604</b> or of any additional external infrastructure (e.g. UWB anchors mounted on a garage ceiling to enhance localization accuracy).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an illustrative embodiment of a vehicle guiding method <b>700</b> for use at a charging station. In particular, a method <b>700</b> is shown in which a system included in a vehicle and a system installed at a predefined location, which is a charging location, interact with each other, to facilitate correctly and safely guiding the vehicle to said charging location. More specifically, an exemplary flow chart is shown for a guiding and sensing procedure involving the CCU and VCU depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The flow chart contains three main parts. The first part relates to the establishment of a connection between the VCU and the CCU. Initially, with the UWB modules configured <b>702</b> in the communication mode, the VCU sends a connection request to a CCU. Alternatively, the CCU may send a connection request to the VCU. Upon receiving the request, the UWB modules of the CCU are configured <b>704</b> in a radar mode, and the foreign body detection (FBD) algorithm checks <b>706</b> whether a foreign body blocks the charging spot (in which case the connection request is denied). If no foreign body is detected, the UWB modules of the CCU are reconfigured <b>708</b> in the communication mode, allowing the VCU to connect to the CCU. The establishment of this connection may include performing a secure authentication process, exchanging local map information for route planning, and performing other preparatory functions.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The second part of the flow chart relates to the localization of the vehicle. After successful connection, the UWB modules are configured <b>710</b> in a ranging mode to perform distance estimation between the CCU and VCU (the procedure used for ranging can for instance be double-sided two-way ranging (DS-TWR)). The VCU uses the range and/or angle information to determine <b>712</b> the position of the vehicle relative to the CCU. Optionally, also the CCU can estimate the position of the VCU and transmit the position information to the vehicle. Knowing the position, the VCU proceeds with estimating or calculating <b>714</b> the optimal path to the charging spot based on, for example, the previously received local map information.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The third part of the flow chart relates to guiding the vehicle to the charging spot. After computing the optimal path, the UWB modules of the CCU and the VCU are configured <b>716</b> in a combined ranging/radar mode, allowing them, during <b>718</b> the ensuing guidance procedure, to (i) perform continuous frame exchanges to update the determined vehicle position, (ii) anticipate a collision of the vehicle with e.g. a pedestrian, and (iii) detect a foreign body on the charging spot. If a collision is anticipated <b>720</b>, it is determined <b>728</b> whether a cancellation of the vehicle guidance is required. If so, then the selection of a new charging spot is initiated <b>732</b>. If no collision is anticipated, then the vehicle is guided until it is determined <b>726</b> that the targeted charging spot has been reached. If the targeted charging spot has been reached, then docking at the targeted charging spot is initiated <b>734</b>. For example, the VU may dock to the CU to allow start of the charging process (e.g. in case of a conductive charging system). If a foreign body is detected <b>724</b> by the CCU, then the CCU sends a request to cancel the vehicle guidance to the VCU. If the VCU has received <b>722</b> a cancellation request, then it determines <b>730</b> whether a cancellation of the vehicle guidance is required. If so, then the selection of a new charging spot is initiated <b>732</b>. If not, then the VCU denies the request from the CCU to cancel the vehicle guidance. It is noted that the path planning may also be done on the charging spot side (CCU), in which case no local map information needs to be sent to the VCU.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The systems and methods described herein may at least partially be embodied by a computer program or a plurality of computer programs, which may exist in a variety of forms both active and inactive in a single computer system or across multiple computer systems.
