Furthermore, the present disclosure relates to a method for charging an electric vehicle by means of an electric vehicle charging arrangement.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such an electric vehicle charging arrangement for charging an electric vehicle is known from the prior art. For example, the Applicant of the present application offers such an electric vehicle charging arrangement under the name &#x201c;Terra High Power Gen II Charger&#x201d;. The known electric vehicle charging arrangement includes a power cabinet configured for receiving an alternating current (AC) from a utility grid and for converting the AC to a direct current (DC), and an electric vehicle charger configured for providing a DC to the electric vehicle to be charged. Furthermore, the electric vehicle charging arrangement includes a DC bus that is arranged between the power cabinet and the electric vehicle charger and configured for transporting the DC from the power cabinet to the electric vehicle charger.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The known electric vehicle charging arrangement is great at charging an electric vehicle. However, when during use of the known electric vehicle charging arrangement, a load dump/shedding occurs, there is a lot of electrical energy in the inductance of the DC bus between the power cabinet and the electric vehicle charger. A load dump/shedding is an unexpected disconnection of a battery of the electric vehicle. The electrical energy in the inductance of the DC bus between the power cabinet and the electric vehicle charger disadvantageously results in a large overvoltage spike to the electric vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides an electric vehicle charging arrangement and a method for charging an electric vehicle, in which large overvoltage spikes are prevented from occurring.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, the present disclosure provides an electric vehicle charging arrangement for charging an electric vehicle, the electric vehicle charging arrangement including:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">an electric vehicle charger configured for providing a DC to the electric vehicle,</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a power cabinet configured for providing a DC to the electric vehicle charger, and</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a direct current bus arranged between the power cabinet and the electric vehicle charger and configured for transporting the DC from the power cabinet to the electric vehicle charger,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">wherein a capacitive filter is installed on the DC bus and in the electric vehicle charger.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">During use, when an electric vehicle is connected to the electric vehicle charger by means of a charging cable, the power cabinet converts an alternating current (AC) to a direct current (DC). The converted DC is transported to the electric vehicle charger via the DC bus extending between the power cabinet and the electric vehicle charger. When arrived at the electric vehicle charger, the DC is transported from the electric vehicle charger to the electric vehicle via the charging cable to charge the electric vehicle, in particular the battery thereof. The capacitive filter is arranged in the electric vehicle charger to compensate for an induction on a section of the DC bus from the power cabinet to the electric vehicle charger in case of a load dump. When the electric vehicle, in particular the battery thereof, is disconnected unexpectedly from the electric vehicle charger (load dump), i.e. during charging the electric vehicle, the electrical energy in the inductance of the DC bus between the power cabinet and the electric vehicle charger is at least partially absorbed by the capacitive filter, such that the overvoltage to the electric vehicle is kept below a maximum limit of, for example, 2,500 V. Therewith, an overvoltage to the electric vehicle due to a load dump is advantageously limited, and may be limited such that the overvoltage meets predetermined standards.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, inductance of the DC bus may create delays in current control in case of the electric vehicle also including a DC-DC convertor. The capacitive filter, which has a capacitance, may prevent any interaction between control loops present within the electric vehicle charging arrangement and the electric vehicle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A further advantage of the electric vehicle charging arrangement according to the present disclosure may be that the capacitive filter may reduce effects of transients between a DC+line and a DC&#x2212;line of the DC bus, such that transient requirements may be met.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, it is noted that most electric vehicles are provided with one or more pyrofuses, for example, for protecting the electric vehicle from fire due to overcharging. The capacitive filter in the electric vehicle charger may effectuate that the electric vehicle only sees the inductance of the charging cable between the electric vehicle charger and the electric vehicle. This may be advantageous, since it may limit the energy that the pyrofuses of the electric vehicle need in order to break, which is the electric energy on the charging cable between the electric vehicle charger and the electric vehicle. Therefore, the capacitive filter in the electric vehicle charger may protect the pyrofuses within the electric vehicle.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the context of the present disclosure, an electric vehicle charger may be referred to as an electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) also referred to as electric vehicle, EV, charging station, electric recharging point, charging point, charge point, charge post or electronic charging station (ECS). The electric vehicle charger is an element in an infrastructure that supplies electric energy for recharging of electric vehicles, including electric cars, neighborhood electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, via a charging cable and a charging connector to the EV. Electric vehicle chargers usually comply with standards for electric vehicle fast charging, such as the so-called Combined Charging System (CCS) protocol according to IEC 61851-23 and SAE J1772 standard for charging electric vehicles both in the US and in the European Union, EU. The Combined Charging System (CCS) protocol is a fast-charging method for charging electric vehicles delivering high-voltage direct current via a charging connector derived from SAE J1772 standard (IEC Type 1) or IEC Type 2 connector. The proposed electric vehicle charging arrangement may be advantageously used with even higher charging currents such as or more than 500 A, 600 A or 3000 A, voltages such as or higher than 1000V, 1500V or 3000V and/or in combination with newer standards not yet defined requiring higher currents.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, the power cabinet is located at a distance from the electric vehicle charger. The power cabinet may be at a distance of 50m or more, may be at a distance between 50m and 300m, or may be at a distance between 50m and 200m.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, the capacitive filter includes one or more capacitors. Since the capacitive filter includes one or more capacitors, the capacitive filter may be adjusted to one or more predetermined applications of the capacitive filter. This is advantageous, as it increases the usability of the capacitive filter.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment, the one or more capacitors include one or more X capacitors and/or one or more Y capacitors. In an embodiment thereof, the capacitive filter includes an X capacitor, a first Y capacitor arranged downstream of the X capacitor, and a second Y capacitor arranged downstream of the first Y capacitor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inventors have surprisingly found that providing an X capacitor on the DC bus and in the electric vehicle charger may be sufficient for limiting an overvoltage, in case of a load dump, such that the overvoltage is at or below a predetermined maximum limit. For example, an indication of a capacitance of an X capacitor needed for limiting the voltage to 2,500 V in case of a load dump of 3000 A is 150 &#x3bc;F, when the power cabinet and the electric vehicle charger are at a distance of 50m from each other, or 1,000 &#x3bc;F, when the power cabinet and the electric vehicle charger are at a distance of 200m from each other</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Additionally, it is noted that, during use, each electric device or component thereof irradiates electromagnetic fields by itself or via cables thereof. Other electric devices or components thereof may receive these electromagnetic fields, which may result in noise on the DC that may make operation of the electric vehicle charger unstable. Providing one or more Y capacitors may result in the noise on the DC being allowed to pass through the ground, therewith filtering the DC. The capacitive filter, thus, may work as an EMC filter while keeping the overvoltage below a maximum limit. This advantageously results in improvement of the electromagnetic compatibility of the electric vehicle charger.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, the capacitive filter includes a filter controller configured for controlling the capacitance of the capacitive filter. The capacitive filter may be configurable and/or adjustable by means of the filter controller. This is advantageous, as it provides the capacitive filter to be adjustable like a passive Power Factor Correction (PFC), for example, according to the model, installation, or other specific requirements of the electric vehicle charger.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, the capacitive filter includes a discharge circuit configured for discharging the capacitor of the capacitive filter in case of a fault or at an end of a charge session. The discharge circuit may be used for discharging the capacitive filter in case of a load dump or at the end of a charging session, such that the capacitive filter becomes depleted. This is advantageous, as it may prevent bystanders from receiving an electric shock from the electric vehicle charger, when the electric vehicle charger is disconnected from the electric vehicle.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment, the capacitive filter includes a surge protector configured for protecting the electric vehicle connected to the electric vehicle charger from any voltage spikes from the electric vehicle charger.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment, the capacitive filter includes a resonance compensator. An advantage of this embodiment is that the capacitive filter also may prevent resonance at particular frequencies within the electric vehicle charger, while keeping an overvoltage below a maximum limit in case of a load dump.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment, the capacitive filter includes a voltage regulator configured for regulating a substantially fixed voltage at the output thereof. An advantage of this embodiment is that the DC output of the capacitive filter is substantially always or always the same, regardless of whether any ripples occur in the DC that enters the capacitive filter.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, the electric vehicle charger includes a disconnection device arranged downstream of and electrically connected to the capacitive filter. In an embodiment thereof, the electric vehicle charger further includes a pre-charge circuit. In particular, the pre-charge circuit is connected in parallel to the disconnection device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an embodiment, the capacitive filter includes an LC filter that is provided on a DC output of the capacitive filter. The LC filter may be used for removing high frequency harmonics from the DC flowing through the capacitive filter. This is advantageous, as the capacitive filter according to this embodiment is also enabled to compensate for an output current ripple.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to a second aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for charging an electric vehicle by means of an electric vehicle charging arrangement according to the first aspect of the present disclosure, wherein the method includes the step of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0029">by means of the capacitive filter, compensating an induction on a section of the DC bus from the power cabinet to the electric vehicle charger in case of a load dump and/or a load shedding.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0030" num="0030">The method has at least the same technical advantages as described in relation to the electric vehicle charging arrangement according to the first aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031">The various aspects and features described and shown in the specification can be applied, individually, wherever possible. These individual aspects, in particular the aspects and features described in the attached dependent claims, can be made subject of divisional patent applications.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0032">The present disclosure will be elucidated on the basis of an exemplary embodiment shown in the attached drawings.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic overview of an electric vehicle charging arrangement having a power cabinet and an electric vehicle charger according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic overview of an electric circuit of the electric vehicle charging arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> provided with a filter in the electric vehicle charger.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic overview of an electric circuit of the filter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an alternative embodiment of the electric circuit of the filter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a schematic overview of the electric circuit of an electric vehicle charger according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0038">A schematic overview of an electric vehicle (EV) charging arrangement <b>1</b>, also known as an electric vehicle charging infrastructure, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.
