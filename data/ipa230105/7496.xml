Accordingly, the statements of this section are to be read in this light and are not to be understood as admissions about what is prior art or what is not prior art.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a shared-spectrum Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) network, a Spectrum Access System (SAS) is used to allocate radio resources (i.e., one or more portions of the wireless CBRS spectrum) to an associated CBRS service device (CBSD) based on a request from the CBSD, where allocated spectrum grants are in chunks of 10 MHz up to the maximum supported by the CBSD and available to be assigned by SAS. According to the Wireless Innovation Forum (WINNF) &#x201c;Signaling Protocols and Procedures for CBRS: SAS-CBSD Interface Technical Specification&#x201d; (Document WINNF-TS-0016, Version V1.2.6, 25 November 2020), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, CBRS networks support three different types of spectrum grants, in order of highest to lowest priority: Incumbent licenses, Priority Access licenses (PALs), and General Authorized Access (GAA) licenses.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">After a SAS allocates a spectrum grant to a CBSD under a GAA license, the CBSD transmits periodic heartbeat messages to the SAS to inform the SAS that the CBSD is still using that spectrum grant, and the SAS responds to each heartbeat message by transmitting a heartbeat acknowledgment message back to the CBSD. The SAS maintains a separate week-long timer for each GAA spectrum grant allocated to one of its associated CBSDs. When the SAS receives a heartbeat message from a CBSD for a particular GAA spectrum grant, the SAS re-sets the corresponding timer. If and when the SAS fails to receive a heartbeat message for a particular GAA spectrum grant for a week, the corresponding timer will expire and the SAS will de-allocate that spectrum grant from that CBSD.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A CBRS network may have multiple SASs, where each SAS is associated with a different set of one or more CBSDs. According to the WINNF &#x201c;Signaling Protocols and Procedures for CBRS: SAS-SAS Interface Technical Specification&#x201d; (Document WINNF-TS-0096, Version V1.3.2, 11 March 2020), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, the multiple SASs perform a nightly inter-SAS CPAS (Coordinated Periodic Activity among SASs) procedure, during which each SAS shares its current set of spectrum grants with each other SAS such that each SAS maintains a local database of all of the different spectrum grants for all of the SASs in order to coordinate its future spectrum grants to avoid wireless interference between different CBSDs associated with different SASs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For business or other possible reasons, a service provider operating a set of CBSDs may decide to migrate one or more or even all of its CBSDs from being associated with a current SAS to being associated with a different SAS. In order to migrate a CBSD from its current SAS to a different SAS, the SAS Uniform Resource Locator (URL) stored at the CBSD is updated to point the CBSD to the new SAS. If the CBSD had been operating on a GAA channel allocated by the old SAS, then the old SAS will keep that GAA spectrum grant allocated for a week after the CBSD has been migrated to the new SAS until the corresponding week-long timer for that existing spectrum grant expires, at which time the old SAS de-allocates the spectrum grant and makes those radio resources available in the common spectrum pool via the inter-SAS CPAS procedure. At that time, the new SAS may be able to allocate that same spectrum to the CBSD that migrated to it a week earlier (assuming that that portion of the CBRS spectrum has not already been allocated to another CBSD by another SAS). As a result, from the time of migration until the following week, the original CBSD will not be able to use that spectrum. This inability to operate on the same spectrum can cause operational issues, especially when the CBRS network is designed to operate on the same frequency with a re-use factor of <b>1</b>. There is even a possibility that the CBSD migration process may take weeks to execute with a lot of service degradation or disruption.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Problems in the prior art are addressed in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure by providing a technique for a new SAS to request immediate relinquishment of an existing GAA spectrum grant from an old SAS in the case of inter-SAS CBSD migration so that the migrating CBSD does not have to wait a week to be able to use that same spectrum grant. Moreover, the procedure ensures that the spectrum grant is retained by the migrating CBSD instead of being allocated to some other CBSD.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the disclosure will become more fully apparent from the following detailed description, the appended claims, and the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals identify similar or identical elements.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing an example communications network;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a simplified hardware block diagram showing a generic node that may be used to implement each individual SAS, CBSD, and domain proxy in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a signal flow diagram that represents the processing involved in a CBSD registering and requesting allocation of a spectrum grant from a SAS;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a signal flow diagram that represents the processing involved in a service provider migrating one of its CBSDs from a current SAS to a new SAS; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows Table I, which identifies the fields that may be included in the new grant transfer request and response messages of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a signal flow diagram that represents the processing involved in a service provider migrating a number of its CBSDs from a current SAS to a new SAS; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows Tables II-VI, which identify the fields that may be included in the new messages of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Detailed illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure are disclosed herein.
