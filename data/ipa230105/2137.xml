These lids can in particular assume a closed position in which the lid blocks the stowage volume of the box.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">In order to allow the protection of the objects transported, certain packages comprise means for retaining the object to be transported in the box.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Known are retention means which take the form of foam panels integrated into the box and the lid. The foam panels can, if necessary, be applied to the box. In other words, the foam panels can be integrated into the box only if their presence is required.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">More precisely, the foam panels are integrated into the bottom of the box, possibly into its peripheral rim, and into the lid.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">The object to be transported is then inserted into the stowage volume so as to come into contact with the foam and to be blocked at a minimum by the foam of the bottom and the foam of the lid.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">This type of retaining means presents, as a major disadvantage, its thickness, or in other words the bulk that it occupies in the stowage volume of the box, and the management of the waste of this type of single-use product.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">IN fact, the foam takes up a major part of the stowage volume of the box. However, the foam has elastic characteristics to as to form deformable retention means to effectively mold itself to the contour of the object to be transported, and thus chock it.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">However, depending on the size of the object, several packages must be provided for.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">The same box cannot be used, for example, for a voluminous object and for an object of small size.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">In the case of the object of small size, if a box or a package appropriate for an object of large size is used, the foam is not suitably deformed in contact with the object of small size, and the latter can then move within the stowage volume of the box, risking damage.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">On the contrary, if an object of large size is introduced into the stowage volume of a box intended to contain an object of small size, the package can become unusable for lack of sufficient space in the stowage volume, the lid then not being able to be closed correctly so as to actually block the stowage volume of the box. The result is then that the object is not actually protected. It is, in addition, visible by any person transporting the package, which can lead to the risk of the object being stolen.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Transporters or packaging professionals must consequently possess packages of different sizes depending on the size of the objects to be transported.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">Moreover, the presence of the foam makes the package bulky when it is not in use, even if the package is foldable to bring it into a &#x201c;flattened&#x201d; stowage or storage condition.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">In fact, folding the package allows optimizing its bulk when it is not in use. However, the compression of the foam during the folding of the device can harm the effectiveness of the foam for protecting the object to be transported. When the foam is compressed, it loses its elasticity and may not expand correctly upon decompression; this is all the more true if the duration of the compression of the foam is great.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">To avoid this loss of elasticity, it is therefore necessary to avoid too great a compression of the foam, which allows only a partial reduction of the bulk of the package when it is not used.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">The storage of the packages, either in the operating configuration or partly folded, or dissociated, therefore necessitates having large-sized premises. In fact, the foam is separated from the box, this for the different sizes of package. This therefore represents a high storage cost which is generally charged to the final consumer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">According to another known technique, the retaining means appear in the form of a plastic envelope within which the object to be transported is slid; the envelope is then deformed so that its walls come into contact with the object to be transported and hold it in its position.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">According to a first type, the envelopes can be integrated on the bottom of the box and their deformation can be accomplished for example by heating so as to shrink the material so that it stiffens in contact with the object.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">One disadvantage of this solution resides in the fact that the deformation of the envelope, when it is accomplished by heating, cannot be accomplished by everyone because this technique involves the use of specific heating equipment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">In fact, heating means, such as thermal heaters for example, must be used and may need special training so that only professionals can deform the envelope.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">Moreover, when the envelope is secured to the bottom of the box, this can be a major disadvantage for the integrity of the box, particularly if it is a carton, too high a heat being able to destroy the carton by burning it.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">Moreover, the introduction of the object to be transported into the envelope can prove to be difficult or impossible (depending on the respective dimensions of the object and of the envelope).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">This is particularly verified if the object to be transported is inserted into the envelope once the box is formed, i.e. the stowage volume is defined, the peripheral rim of the box presenting in particular a major obstacle to the insertion of the object into the envelope.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">To mitigate this, it may be necessary to, first, insert the object into the envelope, then form the box and finally deform the envelope.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">This represents a long handling time which can be detrimental for professionals and also be impossible to carry out for individuals, particularly for deforming the envelope or forming the box.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">According to a second type, the envelope can also be secured with a tray intended to be housed in the box. In this case, the object is introduced into the envelope, then, in order to secure and retain the object, the envelope is deformed by folding the edges of the tray so as to stretch the two walls of the envelope to imprison the object. Once this is completed, the folded tray can be inserted into the box, then the lid can be closed over the box.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">These retaining means also have certain disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">In fact, the insertion of the object into the envelope poses no problems, but the deformation of the tray, particularly the folding of its edges represents a complicated manipulation, or even impossible to carry out when the object is voluminous and the envelope to be deformed offers a high resistance to deformation. The deformation of the envelope can then become a time-waster and repel the professionals who will then carry out a partial deformation or even propose a package of greater sized, generating an increase in the cost of transportation for the final consumer.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">In addition, this requires the simultaneous storage of the box, of the lid and of the retention means, which represents a detrimental total bulk and therefore a supplementary cost which is often passed on to the final client.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">To respond to these disadvantages, means for pulling the tray toward the lid have been designed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">These pulling means comprise in particular elastics secured to the tray, on which the user pulls to move the tray closer to the lid and thus block the object to be transported between the tray and the lid.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">When the object is blocked, the fastening means are then used to retain the pulling force initiated by the user and thus free the latter.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">These fastening means appear in the form of a hook intended to retain the elastics with respect to one another.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">If this solution contributes good retention of the object in the package, it can however still be improved.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">In fact, these retention means require an effort from the user, who must at the same time accomplish traction and then maintain the initiated traction to use the fastening means.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">It then happens that the user can lose the advantage of the initiated traction during the handling of the fastening means.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">The invention has in particular the object of mitigating the disadvantages of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">More precisely, the invention has as its object to propose a solution for automatic retention of an object to be transported inside a package.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">The invention also has as its object to supply a solution of this type which is simple to implement and does not require particular handling for a user.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The invention also has as its object to supply a solution of this type that lasts over time.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">These objects, as well as others which will appear hereafter, are achieved due to the invention which has as its object a package for transporting an object comprising:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0046">a box having a stowage volume defined by a bottom and a peripheral rim substantially perpendicular to the bottom;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0047">a lid able to occupy a position closing the box;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0048">a tray housed in the stowage volume and movable with respect to the bottom between a rest position in which it is located in proximity to the bottom and an operating position in which it is separated from the bottom and holds the object against the lid;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0049">means for returning the tray to its operating position,<br/>characterized in that the return means comprise:</li>        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0050">a cross-brace movable between a flattened position in which it is crushed between the tray and the bottom, and a deployed position in which it pushes back the tray with respect to the bottom;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0006" num="0051">a return member secured to the cross-brace and tending to position the cross-brace in its deployed position from its flattened position.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">The cross-brace and the return member allow pushing back the tray automatically toward its operating position. The object positioned on the tray is then held between the lid and the tray when the lid closes the stowage volume.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">Thus the object can be dispatched without the risk of being damaged during transportation and being able to strike the peripheral rim of the box when the latter is vigorously handled.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">Moreover, the chocking of the object in the box requires no effort from the user because it is the return member which provides the blocking of the object between the tray and the lid, beginning with the instant that the lid is in its position closing the stowage volume.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">According to a first advantageous embodiment, the cross-brace comprises a first arm and a second arm articulated with respect to one another, each arm comprising a first end articulated with respect to the tray and a second end movable along the bottom, and the return member appears in the form of an elastic connecting the second end of the first arm or the second end of the second arm to the box to move the second end of the first arm closer to the second end of the second arm.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">Due to the tension in the elastic, the tray is positioned automatically in its operating position.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">By adjusting the tension of the elastic, it is therefore possible to control the force pressing the object against the lid by the tray when the lid closes the stowage volume.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">Preferably, the connection between the elastic and the box is located vertically, or practically so, above the first end of the arm to which the elastic is connected.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">This favors the traction of the first end on the bottom to push the tray back toward its operating position.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">According to a preferred embodiment, the package comprises two elastics each connected to an arm on the one hand and to the bottom of the box on the other hand.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061">The use of two elastics ensures a synchronized movement of the two arms to push back the tray toward its operating position.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0062">Thus, the risks of the tray forming an abutment inside the package are limited, or even eliminated.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0063">The object to be transported is then correctly retained in the stowage volume between the tray and the lid.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0064">According to a second advantageous embodiment, the cross-brace comprises a first arm and a second arm articulated with respect to one another, each arm comprising a first end articulated with respect to the tray and a second end movable along the bottom, and in that the return member appears in the form of an elastic connecting the second end of the first arm to the second end of the second arm to move them closer to one another.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0065">This allows in particular being able to extract the tray and the return means out of the package when these have no need to be used, or for stowing the package.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0066">Moreover, access to the return means is facilitated in particular for their maintenance.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0067">According to a third advantageous embodiment, the cross-brace comprises a first arm and a second arm articulated with respect to one another, and in that the return member is a torsion spring secured to the first arm and to the second arm, the torsion spring tending to separate the first arm with respect to the second arm.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0068">This allows in particular being able to extract the tray and the return means out of the package when these no longer need to be used or for stowing the package.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0069">Moreover, access to the return means is facilitated, in particular for their maintenance.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0070">In addition, a torsion spring can easily be calibrated based on need and can be embedded in the first arm and the second arm, to protect it for example.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0071">Preferably, the package comprises two torsion springs.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0072">The use of two torsion springs, wisely positioned, allows reducing the risks of kinking the arms during their movement.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0073">Advantageously, the box comprises grooves for guiding the arms in translation with respect to the bottom.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0074">The first arm and the second arm can thus be guided during their movement to push back the tray toward its operating position.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0075">The buttressing of the arms is thus avoided to the benefit of good blocking of the object between the tray and the lid.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0076">Preferably, the box is of the foldable type.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0077">When the package is not used, the box can thus be folded to facilitate its storage and limit the bulk of the package when it is not used.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p
