The container <b>1</b> is made using the method detailed below and is intended to form part of a fluid substance dispensing device <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) together with a ring nut <b>9</b>, a hermetic pump P, and&#x2014;optionally&#x2014;a seal <b>14</b> envisaged between the pump body and the container <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The container <b>1</b> is made from a preform <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The preform <b>2</b> is heated in a conventional way and blow-moulded inside a mould which gives the said preform the external shape of the container <b>1</b> (or recipient) visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The container in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> has, by way of example, a cylindrical shape, but the final shape of the container may be of any kind, and may even have a square, rectangular, or elliptical plan, or the shape known as a &#x2018;tottle&#x2019; (i.e. with a tapered bottom section, for top-down positioning).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The preform <b>2</b> is formed of an external body <b>3</b> and an internal body <b>4</b>, which are mutually assembled before being blow-moulded.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">To facilitate assembly, the external body may feature a step G which has a corresponding step G<b>1</b> on the internal body.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The external body <b>3</b> (shaped like a preform) is cup-shaped and is endowed with a first free end <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The internal body <b>4</b> is also cup-shaped and is endowed with a second free end <b>6</b> which has a flange <b>7</b> configured so that, when the internal body <b>4</b> is assembled with the external body <b>3</b>, the flange <b>7</b> abuts against the first free end <b>5</b> and protrudes (see the distance denoted S in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) along an external perimeter of the external body <b>3</b>, precisely in the vicinity of the said free end <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Once heated and blow-moulded &#x2018;at the same time&#x2019;, the external body <b>3</b> is shaped so as to form the exterior <b>3</b>A of the container <b>1</b> (i.e. a separate recipient) while the internal body <b>4</b> is shaped so as to form a deformable bag <b>4</b>A inside the recipient <b>3</b>A.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The formation of the deformable bag <b>4</b>A in the recipient <b>3</b>A takes place in an essentially automatic manner during the said blow-moulding step, which leads to the formation of the external recipient <b>3</b>A.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Indeed, the internal body <b>4</b> and the external body <b>3</b> may be heated together and blow-moulded within a single step to form the container <b>1</b>; the ring nut <b>9</b> and the pump P are coupled with the pre-formed container <b>1</b> once the bag <b>4</b>A has been filled.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It should be pointed out that the internal body <b>4</b> and the external body <b>3</b> may be first assembled together to form the preform <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The preform <b>2</b>, formed by the internal body <b>4</b> and the external body is then heated up to make it easily blowable.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Then the preform <b>2</b> (again formed by the internal body <b>4</b> and the external body <b>3</b>) is blowed to form in a single step the container <b>1</b>. This means that the internal body <b>4</b> and the external body <b>3</b>, are blow-molded together, to form the container.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Before blow-moulding them, the internal body <b>4</b> and the external body <b>3</b> are heated together, at least for a final heating step just before blowing them.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Possibly, before the final heating step, the internal body <b>4</b> and the external body <b>3</b> may be pre-heated separately, and then assembled together, before receiving a final heating step together, just before blow-moulding.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">This technique offers significant advantages over that used conventionally, i.e. that of inserting an already formed deformable bag into the external recipient or container. Indeed, the bag formed in this manner copies the internal shape of the external recipient perfectly, thereby increasing the volume usable to house the fluid substance to dispense.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">During blow-moulding, the wall of the deformable bag <b>4</b>A adheres only partially to the external recipient <b>3</b>A due to the presence of a gap created by the air already present in the preform <b>2</b>. Appropriate air passageways <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, which will be described below, allow the air to be vented during the step in which the external body <b>3</b> and the internal body <b>4</b> are coupled to form the preform <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. During the step to blow-mould the preform <b>2</b>, the said air passageways <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, may be closed to ensure an air gap is maintained during the forming of the container. The presence of the air gap and the different chemical nature of the materials used, which may shrink at different rates after blow-moulding, facilitates the mechanical/physical detachment of the bag <b>4</b>A from the recipient <b>3</b>A.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For this purpose, a blow-moulding head may be used to make a seal on the flange <b>7</b> on the internal body, thereby closing the air passageways <b>11</b>A.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Even in the presence of any &#x2018;glue seams&#x2019; between the bag <b>4</b>A and the external recipient <b>3</b>A, these are eliminated once a vacuum is created in the bag <b>4</b>A with the hermetic pump P, thereby allowing the substance housed within the bag to be pumped out entirely.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Incidentally, the substance housed in the bag may be any type of fluid or liquid, in particular a fluid or liquid used in the cosmetic or medical field; but the deformable bag <b>4</b>A may be filled (advantageously before installing the pump P) with any type of substance that can be dispensed by a pump.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Between the internal body <b>4</b> and the external body <b>3</b>, the aforesaid air passageways <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B may be envisaged so that the exterior of the internal body <b>4</b> is placed in communication with the exterior of the container <b>1</b>, which may be done in order to allow an intake of air and therefore a gap between the recipient <b>3</b>A and the deformable bag <b>4</b>A during use of the pump P.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The air passageways can also facilitate effective detachment of the bag from the recipient, as already explained above.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Advantageously, the air passageways <b>11</b>A open onto an upper surface <b>120</b> of the flange <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this case, the air passageways <b>11</b>A can also be used to pressurise (in a step prior to filling, by means of the blow-moulding head, for example) the gap outside the bag <b>4</b>A, so as to detach the sad bag completely before filling or during the blow-moulding.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Alternatively, the air passageways <b>11</b>B may be featured (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>) on a lower surface <b>13</b> of the flange <b>7</b>, abutting against the said first free end <b>5</b> of the external body <b>3</b></p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Advantageously, there are channels <b>12</b> between the internal body <b>4</b> and the external body <b>3</b>, located in an area which will form a neck <b>13</b> of the container <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition to facilitating the intake of air into the gap area (or the venting of air) through the passageways <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, the said channels <b>12</b> improve detachment when the bag has to be extracted.
