Each example is provided by way of explanation and is not meant as a limitation. For example, features and/or method steps illustrated or described as part of one example embodiment and/or example method can be used on or in conjunction with other example embodiments and/or method steps to yield yet further example embodiments or methods. It is intended that the present disclosure includes such modifications and variations. In this specification, the word &#x201c;about&#x201d; is sometimes used in connection with numerical values to indicate that mathematical precision is not intended. Accordingly, where the word &#x201c;about&#x201d; is used with a numerical value, that numerical value should be interpreted to include a tolerance &#xb1;10% of the stated numerical value. In this specification, the word &#x201c;or&#x201d; is used inclusively.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Example embodiments disclosed herein are directed to a reseal label with adhesives for application to a pack to convert the pack into a resealable pack. The reseal label can be applied to a hinged lid pack such that a resealable portion of the reseal label can be peeled off of a surface of the hinged lid pack to open the hinged lid. After opening, the hinged lid can be closed and the hinged lid pack can be resealed by pressing the resealable portion against the surface from which it was peeled. The reseal label can provide a hinged lid pack with a resealable closure, and in some embodiments, additional graphical applications.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some example embodiments, a reseal label can be sized to cover an outer surface of a hinged lid pack, either all outer surfaces of the hinged lid pack, or one or more outer surfaces of the hinged lid pack, or portions thereof. In an example embodiment, a reseal label can be a flexible film of polymer material with cut lines that align with portions of the pack such as edges where the hinged lid opens. In some examples, the reseal label can include connections between the cuts which may assist in application of the reseal label to the pack, but which can break when the reseal label is folded around the pack. In some examples, the label can include a barrier type film such as a metallized film, coated film or other type of high WVTR (water vapor transmission rate) material.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> each illustrate a succession of reseal labels <b>10</b> carried on a backing tape <b>20</b> according to an example embodiment.

In another example, the label can include a layer of resealable adhesive, a layer of deadener, and/or a layer of permanent adhesive applied to the base film. However, one or more of these layers may be omitted. For example, the layer of deadener can be omitted if the resealable adhesive and permanent adhesive are applied directly to the base film, such as, for example, applying the resealable adhesive and permanent adhesive in different locations (e.g., apply resealable adhesive in the pull tab portion, and permanent adhesive in a remaining portion of the label).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an example embodiment (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), the reseal label <b>10</b> can include cut lines (CL) separating the respective side flaps.
