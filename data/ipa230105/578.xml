INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to surgical systems used in performing surgery, and methods for using such systems, and particularly to controlling the bending and rotating of portions of articulated mechanical arms using multiple operating modes and input devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art that may be related to various aspects of the present invention, which are described and/or claimed below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present invention. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is well established that there are benefits of minimally invasive surgery. Instruments for such surgery typically have a surgical end effector located at the distal end of an articulated surgical arm (preferably with minimum diameter) that is inserted through a small opening (e.g., body wall incision, natural orifice) to reach a surgical site. In some instances, surgical instruments can be passed through a cannula and an endoscope can be used to provide images of the surgical site.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Surgical instruments have been developed that utilize an end effector (e.g., a surgical tool such as for tissue fusing or cutting, or a measurement tool) for convenience, accuracy, and wellbeing of the subject. In some cases, articulated surgical arms have one or more bending portions which are controlled remotely using various input devices (e.g., hand and foot controls) to ultimately control the location of the end effector and change its orientation with reference to the surgical arm's longitudinal axis. In some case, the surgical arm is capable of retroflected bending relative to the surgical arm longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Clinical studies have demonstrated that the minimally invasive transvaginal approach to gynecological surgery is superior compared to the abdominal approach. Advantages include post-surgical recovery time, morbidity, infections, death rate, complications, blood loss and patient satisfaction. To this day, the policy of American College of Gynecology (ACOG) states that vaginal approaches to gynecological surgery are preferred whenever feasible. To enable a medical device entering trans-vaginally to perform gynecological surgery, articulated surgical arms are required to bend into a retroflected position.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The current state of the art is lacking devices and methods that can provide optimal control elements and methods of use to ensure that a preliminary retroflecting step is performed in a de-risked approach that does not affect the ergonomic comfort and convenience afforded by an input device optimized for arduous surgical procedures. Thus, there is a need for solutions which are suitable for restricting risk during retroflecting of surgical arms and provide maximal freedom of movement during surgical procedures while not impacting surgeon ergonomics.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method is disclosed, of operating a surgical system, the surgical system comprising (i) an articulated mechanical arm having a surgical end effector at a distal end thereof, the arm comprising a plurality of arm segments connected serially by arm joints having respective degrees of freedom and configured to flex and rotate, and (ii) first and second input-devices, the second input-device comprising a handle member configured to be oriented in any one of a plurality of selectable orientations in an x-y-z space, the handle member comprising respective segment members and joint members that correspond, respectively, to the arm segments and arm joints of the arm, each of the respective arm joints actuatable by, and having the same degrees of freedom as, the corresponding joint member, the method comprising: (a) retroflecting the arm in response to an electronic control-output from the first input device, the electronic control-output being effective to regulate flexing and rotating of an arm joint so as to deliver the end effector to a retroflex operating position; (b) subsequent to the retroflecting of the arm, transitioning control of the arm from the first input device to the second input device; and (c) after the transitioning, performing a surgical action using the end effector by reorienting the handle member to displace and reorient, respectively, the segment members and joint members, thereby causing respective displacement and reorientation of the corresponding arm segments and arm joints of the retroflected arm, the orientation of the handle member being such that a displacement vector or a reorientation arc of the handle member through the x-y-z space is translated to a corresponding displacement vector or corresponding reorientation arc of the end effector in the same x-y-z space.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, carrying out the retroflecting step using the first input device may not include, i.e., may exclude, reorienting the handle member from a selected orientation in the x-y-z space.

The proximal end, therefore, is the end opposite the distal end, closest to the motor unit <b>108</b>. The term &#x2018;distal portion&#x2019; as used herein means any portion of the arm <b>102</b> which includes the distal end/tip (optionally including the end effector <b>174</b>) and less than half the length of the arm <b>102</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a bendable portion <b>170</b> of the arm <b>102</b>, i.e., a portion that contains one or more bendable joints, is located along the length of the arm, closer to the distal end. The bendable portion <b>170</b> can comprise a series of &#x2018;stacked links&#x2019; <b>199</b> that enable flexibility for the outer contour/surface of the arm <b>102</b>; an example of a plurality of stacked links <b>199</b> in a bendable portion <b>170</b> of an arm <b>102</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As used herein, an &#x2018;operating mode&#x2019; or its equivalent &#x2018;mode&#x2019; (which can be used in conjunction with various non-limiting descriptive words, e.g., &#x2018;retroflexing mode&#x2019;, &#x2018;surgical-operating mode,&#x2019; etc.) means an operating regime imposed on the use of a surgical system or an arm, either by hardware, firmware or software design or by control circuitry of the surgical system or in other ways. To clarify: The word &#x2018;operating&#x2019; in &#x2018;operating mode&#x2019; means &#x2018;working&#x2019; or &#x2018;functioning/al&#x2019; and describes the operating of, e.g., an arm, and does not mean the performance of surgery, i.e., an &#x2018;operating mode&#x2019; may happen to include the performance of surgery but not necessarily. The imposed operating regime can include, and not exhaustively, restricting or not restricting certain actions or certain portions of the surgical system that perform one or more actions, and the restricting or not restricting can include and/or can be equivalent to enabling or disabling, locking or unlocking, and precluding or permitting or similar words and phrases. In some embodiments herein, a mode is dedicated or directed to accomplishing a single goal, for example retroflecting a distal portion of an arm, and may be limited to one or more specific time periods. In other embodiments, a mode can incorporate an unlimited number of goals and actions and unlimited or undefined time periods.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Operation of the surgical system can be differentiated between different modes, in various ways, as further described hereinbelow. For example, the differentiation can be on the basis of (and not exhaustively): having a different input device (or multiple input devices) dedicated to each mode; having various restrictions or limitations on specific arm movements and/or on specific arm joints and segments; having different translation schemes for displacement of input devices or control elements of input devices to arm movements, e.g., displacement-to-speed vs. displacement-to-displacement, whether the translation from user inputs to arm movements is robotic/semi-autonomous or tele-operated; and whether the manipulation of the input device addresses (via the mechanics and electronics of the surgical system) the flexing and rotating of arm joints directly, or indirectly by addressing the displacements of arm segments which in turn causes the necessary flexions and rotations to occur in order to displace the arm segments as directed. The differentiations can be used in combination, and they can vary from arm to arm in a multi-arm system. In some embodiments, the differentiations can change while the system is in a given mode.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Some differentiations between modes can be implemented in more than one way. As a non-limiting example, if the differentiation between modes involves restricting or limiting certain arm movements (e.g., flexing and rotating of certain joints) or permitting only certain arm movements, the differentiation can be implemented by using different input devices for each mode, or by using one input device in both modes but enforcing, on the one input device, a software or hardware restriction that can be user-switchable or system-enforced. Regardless of whether an embodiment calls for one input device or more, a software-implemented or hardware-implemented solution may actively permit the actuation of a single given arm joint, or may actively prevent or preclude the actuation of any arm joint (of the same arm) that is not the single arm joint.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">It should be noted that wherever actuation or movement of a singular &#x2018;arm&#x2019; (as opposed to the plural &#x2018;arms&#x2019; is discussed herein, this is for convenience only and is not intended to indicate whether or not a second arm (or other multiple arms) is/are being likewise or otherwise actuated or moved. Each arm can be controlled and actuated independently of any other arms by a respective input device. On the other hand, wherever an &#x2018;arm&#x2019; (singular) is disclosed as being restricted or limited as to actuation or movement, e.g., when in an operating mode characterized by such a limitation or restriction, the limitation or restriction may apply equally to both/all arms of a surgical system. In some embodiments, however, a restriction or limitation may apply to one or more given arms while other arms are not restricted or limited at all, or not restricted or limited in the same way.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In embodiments in which two different operating modes are employed, a first operating mode is typically used when introducing or exiting and/or navigating the surgical arm or arms into or out of the body (or from a first point to a second point within the body) and more specifically towards or away from a target surgical site. The second operating mode is typically used when performing surgical actions (e.g. dissecting tissue, manipulating tissue, suturing tissue, taking measurements, imaging, etc.). The &#x2018;navigating&#x2019; of the first mode may include retroflexing the arm or arms so as to put at least a portion of the arm or a distal portion thereof in a retroflex position or, equivalently, to put an end effector in a retroflex operating position (working position).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">It can be desirable to have a clearly defined transition or &#x2018;handoff&#x2019; from one operating mode to another. In some embodiments, the transition includes a handoff from one input device (or plurality of input devices) to another. In other embodiments, the transition is entirely concerned with changing control aspects that are differentiated between one mode and another wherein the tasks assigned to both modes can be accomplished by a single input device, or by the same input devices. A transition can be initiated and managed by the surgical system, or it can be initiated by a user.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In a non-limiting example with respect to a transition from a first mode to a second mode, a transition may include ending restrictions or limitations imposed during first-mode operation, such as limiting joint flexion and rotation to a given single arm joint of any particular arm, e.g. the elbow joint. Additionally or alternatively, a transition can include enabling the actuation of arm joints that were disabled (or not specifically enabled) in the first-mode operation, i.e., in addition to the single given joint that was enabled in the first mode. Enablement can include enablement of joints to move unrestrictedly in accordance with respective degrees of freedom of each joint. For example, if a given arm joint is only configured for rotation and not flexion, the enablement will enable it only for rotation. Additionally or alternatively, a transition can enable actuation of all arm joints. Additionally or alternatively, a transition can change a processing of control-outputs from user-input devices from a displacement-to-velocity translation to a displacement-to-displacement translation. In further non-limiting examples, the transition can be implemented automatically by control circuitry in response to an event, it can be implemented based on a user input such as, for example, a depressed button or a rotated switch, or it can be implanted by noting that a user has ceased using a first input device and begun using a second input device. In a further non-limiting example, the transition is a user interface-based mediated transitioning.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In a non-limiting example with respect to a transition from a second mode to a first mode, a transition may include restoring restrictions or limitations removed during a transition to second-mode operation, such as limiting joint flexion and rotation to a given single arm joint of any particular arm, e.g. the elbow joint. Additionally or alternatively, a transition can include disabling the actuation of arm joints that were enabled for the second-mode operation. Additionally or alternatively, a transition can change back a processing of control-outputs from user-input devices from a displacement-to-displacement translation to a displacement-to-velocity translation. In further non-limiting examples, the transition can be implemented based on a user input such as, for example, a depressed button or a rotated switch, or it can be implanted by noting that a user has ceased using an input device dedicated to second-mode operation and begun using a different input device that is dedicated to first-mode operation.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In embodiments, and especially in embodiments in which the input device employed in the second mode is avatar-like and translates input arm displacements to surgical arm displacements, transitioning from a first operating mode to a second operating mode can include an alignment calibration. In an alignment calibration, which is discussed in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref>, the orientation of the surgical arm, including the &#x2018;internal&#x2019; orientation of arm elements (e.g., arm joints and/or arm segments) with respect to each other is modified so as to match a &#x2018;shape&#x2019; or &#x2018;curve&#x2019; which describes the corresponding orientation of the input arm which will take over actuation control of the surgical arm in the transition to the second operating mode. There is not necessarily a corresponding alignment calibration in the case of transitioning back from the second operating to the first operating mode.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Translation of user inputs to arm movements (flexion and rotation) can be accomplished in various ways. For example, the displacement (or the force of displacement) of an input device or of a control element of an input device can be translated to a velocity (e.g., velocity, speed, angular velocity) of arm movement. It can be desirable in a first mode that includes insertion/extraction and retroflexing (or retroflexing/unflexing) to use this type of translation. These limited and, in some embodiments, less precise, movements can be conducive to being performed not in a tele-operated or avatar mode but to simpler robotic or semi-autonomous mode. In contrast, the movements required in a second mode dedicated to performing various surgical actions may be more conducive to a controlled displacement-displacement translation, where displacement of an input device or a control element of an input device is suitably translated to displacement of arm segments and indirectly to rotation and flexing of joints. For example, in the second more, it can be desirable to ensure that the articulation of an articulatable input device corresponds in internal orientation (i.e., segment-to-segment orientation) to the surgical arm, so that the translation of displacement to displacement is more intuitive, ergonomic and precise.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">It can be desirable, in a first mode, to restrict arm movements to flexing and/or rotating a single given arm joint of an arm (or of each arm). This can be suitably implemented by configuring the surgical system to receive, from the input device used in the first mode, inputs which directly address the flexing and rotating of specific arm joints such as the single given arm joint that is permitted (in the operating mode) to be actuated. In other words, the user is &#x2018;controlling&#x2019;, via the input device and suitable control circuitry, the arm joint itself. The movement intended to be actuated in this case is specifically a flexion and/or rotation of the arm joint. Regardless of whether the actual arm movements are performed semi-autonomously in response to the user's control inputs, the user understands that she is controlling the actuation of the joint. The attending displacement and reorientation of the end effector is a presumably intended consequence of the control of the joint.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In contrast, it can be desirable, in a second mode, and especially in embodiments in which the input device employed in the second mode is avatar-like and translates input arm displacements to surgical arm displacements, for the surgical system to receive and process inputs which directly address the displacement of arm segments. The flexing and rotating of arm joints are then indirectly addressed by the surgical system by controlling the arm joints to flex and rotate to the extent necessary for achieving the required arm segment displacement and reorientation. In other words, the user is &#x2018;controlling&#x2019; the displacement and reorientation of arm segments (or of the end effector which for the purpose of this discussion plays a role similar to that of any arm segment in that controlling its position and orientation is a user goal), and the control circuitry of the surgical system uses this information to determine the necessary flexion and rotation of each affected arm joint. In an embodiment, an avatar-like input arm can be manipulated by a user into a shape or configuration that anticipates or drives the intended shape of the surgical arm post-manipulation.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In an exemplary first operating mode, surgical arm movement can be at least partially limited or restricted, and certain types of movements can be precluded while others are permitted. For clarity, &#x2018;movement&#x2019; of an arm can include displacement and/or reorientation of any portion of the arm, such as, for example, one or more segment members of the arm.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The terms &#x2018;elbow joint&#x2019;, &#x2018;wrist joint&#x2019; and &#x2018;shoulder joint&#x2019; where used herein refer to particular joints of a mechanical arm, according to a specific implementation in which the arm comprises three actuatable joints. In such a case, the joint nearest a distal-end effector is known as the &#x2018;wrist joint&#x2019;, the middle joint of the three is the &#x2018;elbow joint&#x2019; and the most proximal joint is known as the &#x2018;shoulder joint&#x2019;. In some embodiments, a wrist joint is limited to rotation only, i.e., is not configured to flex. The various joints are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, which is discussed hereinbelow.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The meaning of the term &#x2018;joint&#x2019; unless otherwise specified and as used in this disclosure and in the appended claims in the case of arm joints, i.e., joints of an arm, means any actuatable member capable of causing a flexion (e.g., planar bending) and/or a rotation. It should be noted that articulatable/avatar-like input arms (a type of input device) can also have joints, and they are referred to as &#x2018;joint members&#x2019; of the input devices. Typically, arm segments are non-actuatable (with respect to flexing/rotating) members of an arm which can be joined serially by actuatable arm joints, where the term &#x2018;joined serially&#x2019; means only that a joint is interposed between two consecutive segment members. A joint can be actuated, e.g., mechanically and/or electronically, to cause a flexion of one arm segment (and every portion of the arm disposed distally therefrom) relative to a base arm segment (<b>2181</b> In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) or another (adjacent) arm segment, and/or to cause a rotation of one arm segment (and every portion of the arm disposed distally therefrom) relative to the base arm segment or another arm segment. In some embodiments, a joint includes multiple components, and in some examples can include both a flexion-facilitating component (or sub-assembly and a rotation-facilitating component (or sub-assembly). For the sake of readability, a combination of such components is referred to herein, in combination, as a joint or an arm joint.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In embodiments, arm movements may be limited according to types of articulations (e.g., rotations vs. flexions), speed of movement, which portions of the surgical arm can move, etc. Movement of the surgical arm during the first operating mode can be restricted to movement of a given single arm joint&#x2014;an elbow joint only&#x2014;(including, for example, flexion and/or rotation of the elbow joint) and to linear movement of the surgical arm as a single unit (including, for example, linearly advancing and retracting the arm). It can be desirable to limit arm movements during the first operating mode to facilitate introducing the surgical arms with minimized volume through a narrow path and to the target surgical site.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">It can also be desirable to limit arm movements during the first operating mode to facilitate retroflexing of the arm in a minimum volume so as to avoid collision and potential tissue damage within the human body. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a simplified schematic side view of a surgical mechanical arm <b>102</b> in different configurations, explained here for illustrative purposes. The dashed line <b>2177</b> represents an obstacle, for example patient tissue.

Arm <b>102</b> comprises proximal segment <b>2181</b> and distal bendable portion <b>170</b>.

For example, joint <b>2103</b><i>a </i>is the elbow joint position in scenario A. Thus, scenario A involves the bending of only elbow joint <b>2103</b><i>a </i>(shoulder joint <b>2101</b><i>a </i>remains unactuated and unbent), and specifically one can see that the bending of only elbow joint <b>2101</b><i>a </i>does not cause a collision between end effector <b>174</b> and the obstacle <b>2177</b>. On the other hand, in Scenario B, in which only the shoulder joint <b>2101</b><i>b </i>is bent, there is a collision between end effector <b>174</b> with the obstacle <b>2177</b>. The difference between the collision/no-collision results of Scenarios A and B is because the portion of the arm <b>102</b> distal from the elbow joint <b>2103</b> is shorter than the portion of the arm distal from the shoulder joint <b>2101</b>. The wrist joint <b>2105</b> of arm <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is not involved in any of the three scenarios, as being designed or configured in the non-limiting example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> to rotate but not flex. In scenario C, which is a continuation of scenario A, it can be seen that flexing shoulder joint <b>2101</b><i>c </i>after the flexion of elbow joint <b>2103</b><i>a </i>(now <b>2103</b><i>c</i>) can facilitate the continued avoidance of collision between end effector <b>174</b> and obstacle <b>2177</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates examples of elbow joint <b>2103</b> flexion from an unflexed orientation to various post-flexion orientations ranging from less than 90&#xb0; to more than 180&#xb0; relative to proximal arm base segment <b>2181</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In embodiments, the flexion range of movement for an elbow joint is &#x3e;90&#xb0;, &#x3e;120&#xb0;, &#x3e;140&#xb0;, &#x3e;160&#xb0;, &#x3e;180&#xb0;, &#x3e;190&#xb0;, &#x3e;200&#xb0; or about 210&#xb0;&#xb1;10&#xb0;.

Additionally or alternatively, different operating modes can be characterized by different restrictions on surgical arm articulation, for example, limiting articulation (e.g. flexion) of one or more surgical arm joints; limiting a range of movement; or limiting arm articulation to selected degrees of freedom. Additionally or alternatively, different operating modes can be characterized by different types of feedback to the user, for example, feedback sensed by a user controlling the surgical arms via one or more input devices.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In some embodiments, selecting and/or switching between operating modes is controlled by a user, e.g. a surgeon. Optionally, selection of operating modes can be carried out via a user interface of the system, for example via a touch screen and/or via buttons or other input devices disposed on or in proximity to another input device, or a control console or display screen. Additionally or alternatively, selecting operating modes can be automatic, for example, carried out by suitable control circuitry, such as by a system controller or processor. In some embodiments, selecting and/or switching an operating mode is triggered by and contingent upon: one or more of, and not exhaustively: identifying the current &#x2018;anatomical&#x2019; position of the surgical arm or of the end effector of the arm, for example, by using electromechanical instruments such as encoders or other sensors (NOT SHOWN) associated with the actuators and/or motors (e.g. of <b>104</b> or <b>108</b>) of the arms, or by accessing and analyzing images of arm <b>102</b> obtained by a camera&#x2014;through image processing or visually, upon identifying a current position of the input device, upon performing a certain articulation of the surgical arms, upon receiving an indication of one or more position sensors of the surgical arms, upon a timed indication, for example by setting a time point by which an operating mode is changed.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> describes a method of operating surgical mechanical arms using two operating modes, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The method includes:</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Step S<b>01</b>: inserting and navigating surgical arm(s) to a predetermined location in a first operating mode.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In a first operating mode, the surgical arms are introduced into the body and navigated to a selected anatomical location and/or to a selected arm position.

For example, one or more arm joints can be restricted or precluded from articulating (flexing and rotating). In an example, the arm comprises 3 joints: a shoulder joint, an elbow joint and a wrist joint that rotates but doesn't flex, and one or two of the joints are prevented from articulating.

In some embodiments, the base position is one in which the arms are positioned to allow a user to perform surgical acts from a selected orientation (e.g. corresponding to an abdominal orientation) which the user may be more comfortable or familiar with.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some embodiments, control of surgical arm movement in the first operating mode comprises robotic control. Optionally, manipulation of an input device by a user in the first operating mode involves only limited types of user movement, for example, limited movement of an input device along a defined axis and/or pressing of buttons. In an example, moving the input device along a first defined axis actuates rotation of selected arm joint, e.g. elbow; moving the input device along a second defined axis actuates flexion of a selected arm joint, e.g. elbow; pushing one or more buttons actuates linear advancement or retraction of the surgical arm.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In some embodiments, manipulation of an input device by a user in the first operating mode is translated to the speed of movement of the surgical arm. For example, when the user moves an input device relative to the rest position of the input device, the extent to which the input device was moved relative to its rest position sets the relative speed of movement of the surgical arm.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Step S<b>03</b> Transition to a second operating mode, then carrying out surgical actions using the surgical arm(s)</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In a second operating mode, the user carries out surgical acts via the surgical arms, for example grasping tissue, dissecting tissue, moving tissue, suturing tissue. In some embodiments, the second operating mode is initiated at the end of step S<b>02</b>, once the arms have been moved into a selected base position, for example, a retroflected position.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In some embodiments, the user switches an input device when transferring from the first operating mode to the second operating mode. Alternately, the user uses the same input device for both the first or navigation operating mode and the second or surgical operating mode.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In some embodiments, at the second operating mode, surgical arm movement is not as restricted as in the first operating mode. In an example, all arm joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist) are allowed to articulate, e.g. bend and/or rotate. In some embodiments, the extent and/or speed of arm movement during the second operating mode is limited based on safety considerations, for example, not to damage surrounding tissue, not to perform a movement at a speed that is too high and may risk damage.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some embodiments, control of the surgical arms at the second operating mode involves tele-operated control. Optionally, displacement of an input device by the user is mimicked by a respective displacement of the surgical arm. Optionally, the speed of displacement of an input device by the user is reflected in the respective speed of surgical arm movement.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Step S<b>04</b> Transition back to the first operating mode, then retract the surgical arm(s) from the body</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In accordance with some embodiments, optionally when the surgical acts have been accomplished, the arms are retracted outwardly from the patient body. In some embodiments, retraction is performed in the first operating mode. Optionally, before and/or during retraction, the arms are straightened.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Retracting in the first operating mode may be advantageous as it limits the extent and/or type of arm movement, thereby potentially reducing damage to tissues surrounding an anatomical passage (e.g. the vagina) through which the arms are retracted.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a control console <b>118</b> can comprise a display screen <b>407</b>, with input devices <b>405</b> positioned in proximity thereto&#x2014;on opposite sides of screen <b>407</b> in the non-limiting example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Each of the input devices <b>405</b> (in the form of &#x2018;thumbsticks&#x2019;) comprises a nipple-type controller <b>409</b> suitable for manipulation by a user's thumb. In embodiments, the extent of movement of the nipple <b>409</b> relative to a central rest position can be translated to a velocity of a chosen surgical arm movement, as discussed hereinabove. In one example, the further the nipple <b>409</b> is pushed away from its central rest position, the higher the resulting speed of the movement of the surgical arm. In another example, the more force is applied to the nipple <b>409</b>, the higher the resulting speed of the movement of the surgical arm.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In some embodiments, when controlling the surgical arms via the thumbsticks <b>405</b>, one or more of the surgical arm joints (e.g. a shoulder joint, a wrist joint) are restricted from movement, and only flexion and/or rotation of the elbow joint are enabled. In some embodiments, linear movement of the surgical arm (as a single body) is also enabled, for example to advance or retract the arm. In some embodiments, movement of the nipple <b>409</b> actuates flexion and/or rotation of the elbow joint. In some embodiments, linear movement of the arm <b>102</b> is actuated by separate actuators, for example using another pair of input devices such as input devices <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> which are implemented as push buttons disposed, in the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, along the body of the input devices (thumbstick assembly) <b>405</b> themselves. In other examples the push buttons <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> can be provided independently, or on (or in closer proximity to) the display screen <b>407</b>. In an example, button <b>406</b> advances the surgical arm distally (e.g. in an abdominal direction) and button <b>408</b> retracts the surgical arm proximally. In embodiments, input devices <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> may be used while in a first mode in which flexing and rotating arm joints that are not the elbow joint is precluded, as the linear motion does not require any flexing or rotating.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In some embodiments, during use of the thumbsticks <b>405</b>, other input devices such as avatar-input arms <b>411</b> provided for use in the second mode without any first-mode restrictions, are locked at a rest position, for example by solenoid locks. In some embodiments, the rest position of the input arms <b>411</b> is selected as the retroflected position of the surgical arm <b>102</b>, so that once the surgical arms <b>102</b> have been retroflected (e.g. using the thumbsticks), a user may pick up the avatar input arms <b>411</b> and continue the procedure directly. In some embodiments, when the avatar-like input arms <b>411</b> are enabled while in the second mode, operation of the thumbsticks is disabled.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In some embodiments, during insertion of the surgical arms <b>102</b> into the body of a patient <b>106</b>, the surgical arms are straight, i.e., unflexed. In some cases insertion is via a cannula. At the same time, the avatar input arms are at a rest position, which can be a locked position and which can be a retroflexed position. Optionally, following retroflection of the surgical arms using the thumbsticks <b>405</b>, the surgeon may release the thumbsticks <b>405</b> and moves her hands to the avatar input arms <b>411</b>. Once the avatar input arms <b>411</b> are grasped and optionally lifted by the surgeon, control over the surgical arms <b>102</b> can be automatically transferred or transitioned from the first user-input device <b>405</b> to the second <b>411</b>, and the surgeon may continue the procedure using the avatar input arms <b>411</b>.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some embodiments, when one or more avatar input arm joints are locked by solenoid locks, lifting of the avatar input arm by the surgeon automatically releases the solenoid locks. Additionally or alternatively, manual locks of the avatar input arm joints are released, for example via a sensor that detects an avatar input arm position.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In some embodiments, the system (e.g. a system processor) is configured to recognize one or more positions of the input devices, for example a current position of the thumbsticks and/or a current position of the avatar input arms, and optionally to present the position on the user interface screen. In some embodiments, identifying a position is assisted by the use of position sensors.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an image of an example of a thumb-operated input device <b>501</b> comprising a gripping handle <b>503</b> and, optionally, a textured surface to facilitate gripping, such as a surface comprising ridges <b>505</b>. One or more control buttons <b>507</b> can be disposed along the gripping handle <b>503</b>. For example, the thumbstick input device <b>501</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> comprises two control buttons <b>507</b>&#x2014;one for actuating linear advancement of the surgical arm distally, and one for actuating linear retraction of the arm proximally.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In some embodiments, thumbstick <b>501</b> comprises a nipple <b>509</b>, extending for example from a proximal end of the gripping handle <b>503</b>. In some embodiments, nipple <b>509</b> is shaped and/or sized for a user's thumb. In some embodiments, nipple <b>509</b> comprises a rounded profile. In some embodiments, a proximal surface of the nipple <b>509</b> is formed with circumferential protrusions <b>511</b>. The circumferential protrusions may assist in maintaining the thumb placed on the nipple <b>509</b>, potentially preventing or reducing sliding of the thumb away from the nipple <b>509</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">In some embodiments, the nipple <b>509</b> moves in a spring-like manner. Optionally, after pushing the nipple <b>509</b> away from its initial rest position (e.g a central position, in which the nipple <b>509</b> is centrally aligned with long axis <b>513</b> of the thumbstick), the nipple springs back to its central position.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of control of the thumb-operated input <b>501</b>, according to some embodiments.

Additionally or alternatively, linear movement of the arm may be actuated via a screen interface of the control console (e.g. via a touch screen interface).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">In some embodiments, a set of two avatar input arms are provided, for controlling left and right arms respectively. For example, a first avatar input arm <b>701</b> can control a first motor unit <b>108</b> associated with a first surgical arm <b>102</b> (e.g. a &#x201c;right&#x201d; arm) and a second avatar input arm <b>701</b> can control a second motor unit <b>108</b> associated with a second surgical arm <b>102</b> (e.g. a &#x201c;left&#x201d; arm).

In embodiments, alignment of an input device such as the avatar input arm with the current position of the surgical mechanical arm is performed. In an example, alignment is performed when the user switches between different input devices, for example when switching from thumb operated input to the avatar input arm. In another example, alignment of an input device with the surgical arm position is performed upon initialization of the system, for example at the beginning or prior to surgery. In another example, an alignment of the input device with the current position of the surgical mechanical arm is performed when resuming control following a pause. Optionally, in the paused mode, movement of the input device does not actuate relative movement of the surgical mechanical arm, and upon resuming control, it may be required to adjust a position of the input arm so that it matches the current position of the surgical mechanical arm, to continue operation in a smooth, non-interrupted manner.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">In some embodiments, resumed control is gained in an automatic or semi-automatic manner. For example, a user performs a selected articulation of the input device (e.g. straightens an elbow joint of the avatar input arm) and control of the surgical arm is resumed.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref>, the relative position of an input device (i.e., input arm) is represented using a cross shaped diagram <b>801</b>. In some embodiments, there are two sets of crosses, one for the shoulder joint and one for the elbow joint. In some embodiments, the cross represents a specific single joint (e.g. a shoulder joint, an elbow joint) of the surgical mechanical arm. In some embodiments, each line of the slot represents a different type of articulation, for example, the horizontal line <b>803</b> represents rotation of the joint; the vertical <b>805</b> line represents flexion of the joint. During use, a user manipulates the input device according to the joint position indicated at the cross by the two colored dots <b>807</b>. As the position of the input device (in response to manipulation by the user) becomes closer to that of the surgical mechanical arm, the colored dots move closer to the center of the cross (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>). Optionally, once sufficient alignment between the input device position and the surgical arm position is obtained, the dots change color, for example, from red to green as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In embodiments, the control apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref> can be used in an alignment calibration as part of a transitioning from a first mode using a first input device to a second mode using the avatar-like input arm.

In step S<b>101</b>, surgical system <b>999</b> is operated in a first operating mode. In step S<b>121</b>, surgical system <b>999</b> is operated in a second operating mode. As discussed elsewhere, in different embodiments the first and/or second operating mode may relate to specific capabilities of and/or specific restrictions on one or more of the input devices.

The input arm is used in a restricted mode for retroflecting the arm as explained hereinabove, at which point a transition is made to fully enabled use in the second mode. However, at this point, the input arm, or at least a handle member (e.g., handle member <b>702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) may have been flipped around by as much as 180&#xb0; or more than 180&#xb0; in accordance with the angle of flexion employed in the retroflexion. This means that (a) the handle <b>702</b> is uncomfortably &#x2018;upside down&#x2019; from the perspective of the surgeon, and (b) the coordinate system used by the surgical system is &#x2018;backwards&#x2019;. The surgeon's perspective has switched from looking &#x2018;distally&#x2019; to retroflex the arm, to looking &#x2018;proximally&#x2019; to perform a surgery with arm in a retroflex position, and as a result a displacement vector or reorientation arc of a segment member is not translated to a corresponding (e.g., parallel) displacement vector or reorientation arc in the same x-y-z space.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">It should be noted that the exemplary design of the input device <b>701</b> and handle member <b>702</b> is provided for illustrative purposes, while in other examples and in other embodiments, input devices and handle members can be designed and implemented in different ways. For example, in some embodiments a handle member can be physically detached from an input device of which it is functionally a part. As another example, in some embodiments, an avatar-like or joystick-like input device be wholly or almost wholly or mostly comprised of a hand-operated and/or hand-graspable handle member. As another example, in some embodiments, a handle member can incorporate multiple operating functions in its design by including, and not exhaustively, buttons, switches, toggles, wheels, knobs, and/or small sticks such as thumbsticks so as to &#x2018;combine&#x2019; multiple input devices and their respective functions into what appears visually to be a single input device. The repeated presentation herein of the input device <b>701</b> and handle member <b>702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is for convenience and easier comprehension, and should not be understood as a limitation of input device and handle member design.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">It is now disclosed that transitioning from a first input device of an array of one or more input devices to a second input device of the array when transitioning from the first mode to the second mode can overcome the aforementioned shortcomings. The handle member <b>702</b> of the second input device (the avatar-like input arm <b>701</b>) can be placed in advance in an orientation that is not &#x2018;upside down&#x2019; from the surgeon's perspective; the retroflexing can performed with an input device (e.g., input device <b>501</b>/<b>405</b>), the use of which does not include or require that the handle member <b>702</b> of the second input device be moved, or if moved then not moved more than the 90&#xb0; that might be a &#x2018;tipping point&#x2019; to becoming &#x2018;upside down&#x2019; from the surgeon's perspective. Moreover, the control circuitry controlling the second input device (the input arm <b>701</b>) can be set (e.g., programmed) to use a &#x2018;direct&#x2019; coordinate translation matrix, one in which a displacement vector of a segment member of the input arm is translated to a corresponding (e.g., parallel or, at minimum, retaining the same sign in each of the x, y and z directions or at least two out of three directions) displacement vector of the corresponding surgical arm segment, and/or in which a reorientation arc of a segment member of the input arm is translated to a corresponding reorientation arc of the corresponding surgical arm segment.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">It can therefore be desirable, in some embodiments, to ensure a handoff (transition) from a first mode to the second mode, in which control of arm movement transfers from a first input device (such as the &#x2018;thumbsticks&#x2019; detailed hereinabove) to an avatar-like input arm, that ensures ergonomic comfort and convenience based on the optimally oriented handle member and directly translatable (input arm to surgical arm) coordinate translation matrix.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, a user-input device <b>701</b> is oriented in an x-y-z space that corresponds to the same x-y-z space in which an arm <b>102</b>, or at least a distal portion thereof, is oriented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. The arm <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, which an end effector <b>174</b> connected at the distal end of the arm <b>102</b>, is shown as not flexed, indicating an orientation of an arm at the beginning, or prior to, a surgical operation. Controlling the arm <b>102</b> and positioning the end effector <b>174</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>18</b></figref> is straightforward; leftwards displacement of the input device <b>701</b> translates to leftwards displacement of the arm <b>102</b> (e.g., along the x-axis), forward translates to forward (e.g., along the y-axis), rightwards means rightwards (again, along the x-axis), and backwards translates backwards (again, along the y-axis). Upwards displacement of the input device <b>701</b> translates to upwards displacement of the arm <b>102</b> (e.g., along the z-axis) and downwards translates to downwards.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b> and <b>20</b></figref>, the distal portion of the arm <b>102</b> is retroflected, placing the arm (and the attached surgical end effector <b>174</b>) in a retroflex position. The handle member <b>702</b> of the user-input device <b>701</b> has been rotated in order to effect the retroflexing movement of the arm <b>102</b>. If one were to transition at this point to a surgical-operation mode, the user-input device <b>701</b> would be oriented in the rotated x-y-z coordinate system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, which does not match the x-y-z coordinate system of the end-effector <b>174</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> (which has rotated in accordance with the retroflecting of the arm <b>102</b> and now matches the retroflex orientation/position of the end effector <b>174</b>). Note: the x-y-z coordinate system of the retroflex arm <b>102</b> has &#x2018;flipped&#x2019; so as to match what in typical surgical systems is the surgeon's perspective. For example, if a camera, e.g., an endoscopic camera at the end of an arm, does not &#x2018;flip&#x2019;, then the surgeon cannot see the surgical workspace or see whatever needs to be seen. However, the flipped handle <b>702</b> and &#x2018;flipped&#x2019; (retroflected) end effector no longer orient in a shared three-dimensional x-y-z space. As discussed, hereinabove, there are two choices available at this point: either grasp the device <b>701</b> from a different perspective in a different manner than is usually taken, or perform surgical operations such that motions of the input device <b>701</b> (specifically, of the handle member <b>702</b>) do not ergonomically translate easily to the surgical arm <b>102</b> in the same x-y-z coordinate system. For example, a leftward displacement of the device <b>701</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> (according to its x-y-z coordinate system) would result in a rightward displacement of the end effector <b>174</b> according to its x-y-z coordinate system, while up would mean down and so on.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">As previously discussed, a first solution to the &#x2018;flipped handle&#x2019; is to use a different user-input device for the retroflecting of the arm. This results in an un-flipped handle such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> controlling, in a subsequently assumed post-transition surgical-operation mode, the arm and end effector such as are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. The skilled artisan will understand that the x-y-z coordinate systems appear to be the reverse of each other, but in actuality align the input device <b>701</b> and the arm <b>102</b> such that a leftwards displacement (e.g., of the device <b>701</b> in the surgeon's hand) translates to a leftwards displacement of the end effector <b>174</b> (from the perspective of the surgeon), and so on in all the directions of the shared x-y-z coordinate system&#x2014;unless, for example, the surgeon can grasp the handle member from the opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">A second solution to the &#x2018;flipped handle&#x2019; is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. As previously discussed, the handle member <b>702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> has been flipped, i.e., rotated, so as to rotate the x-y-z coordinate system of the input device <b>701</b>.

That x-y-z space is rotated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> (due to the &#x2018;flipped handle&#x2019;), making the input device <b>701</b> difficult to use in the second surgical-operation mode (e.g., left is right, up is down, etc.). Therefore the surgical system replaces the original but flipped x-y-z coordinate system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> with a new x-y-z coordinate system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>&#x2014;which appears to match the original x-y-z coordinate system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, but it is now navigable not by an input device oriented as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> but by the flipped-handle input device as oriented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">We now refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A-C</figref>, which has already been discussed hereinabove with respect to certain embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>A</figref> shows an input device <b>701</b> having a curve shape <b>2810</b>.

The arm <b>102</b> has a curve-shape <b>2830</b> which clearly does not match the curve shape <b>2810</b> of the input device <b>701</b> at Time=T<b>1</b>. After manipulating the arm <b>102</b> with a different user-input device (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A-C</figref>), the arm <b>102</b> is retroflected prior to Time=T<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>C</figref>. At this point the curve-shape <b>2830</b> of the arm <b>102</b> matches the curve shape <b>2810</b> of the input device <b>701</b>.

In some embodiments, a first user input (in this example, thumbsticks <b>4005</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>) is used for introducing the surgical arms into the patient body, for example through the vagina, and then for retroflecting the surgical arms (<b>4001</b>). In some embodiments, retroflecting (for example, bending backwards) of the surgical arms within the patient body is performed to reduce an area within which the surgical arm is located. Optionally, retroflecting is performed during a surgical procedure to avoid obstacles such as certain organs or portions thereof, for example, an inner wall of the abdomen. Optionally, retroflecting is performed to position the surgical arms at an orientation in which a laparoscopic surgeon is familiar with, for carrying out the operation.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">In some embodiments, a second user input, in this example in the form of input arms <b>4011</b> (e.g. avatar joysticks) is then used for performing the rest of the surgical procedure (<b>4003</b>).</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">In some embodiments, thumbsticks <b>4005</b> are positioned adjacent the control console screen <b>4007</b>, for example on opposing sides of the screen. In some embodiments, each of the thumbsticks <b>4005</b> comprises a nipple type controller <b>4009</b> shaped and sized for the user's thumb. In some embodiments, the nipple of the thumbsticks is at rest position when centered, and is configured to spring back to the rest position upon release of the thumb. In some embodiments, the extent of movement of the nipple relative to its central rest position determines a resulting velocity of the surgical arm movement. For example, the further the nipple is pushed away from its central rest position, the higher the velocity of the movement of the surgical arm (and vice versa&#x2014;the closer the nipple is to its central rest position, the lower the velocity of the arm).</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">In some embodiments, when controlling the surgical arms via the thumbsticks, one or more of the surgical arm joints (e.g. a shoulder joint, a wrist joint) are restricted from movement. In some embodiments, all surgical arm joints except an elbow joint are prevented from moving, and only flexion and/or rotation of the elbow joint are enabled. In some embodiments, linear movement of the surgical arm (as a single body) is also enabled, for example to advance or retract the arm. In some embodiments, movement of the nipple actuates flexion and/or rotation of the elbow joint. In some embodiments, linear movement of the arm is actuated by separate actuators, for example using push buttons such as <b>4006</b>, <b>4008</b>, configured for example along a body of the thumbstick <b>4005</b>. In an example, button <b>4006</b> advances the surgical arm distally (e.g. into the abdomen); button <b>4008</b> retracts the surgical arm proximally.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">In some embodiments, during use of the thumbsticks, the input arms <b>4011</b> are locked at a rest position, for example by solenoid locks. In some embodiments, the rest position of the input arms is selected as the retroflected position. Optionally, this position allows the surgeon to continue the procedure directly following retroflection using the thumbsticks. In some embodiments, when the input arms are operated, operation of the thumbsticks is disabled.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">A potential advantage of using the thumbsticks for navigation into the body and for retroflecting the surgical arms while selected arm joints such as the shoulder joint remain stationary may include reducing a bending radius of the surgical arm, thereby reducing a likelihood of encountering surrounding obstacles such as the inner abdominal wall. Another potential advantage of using the thumbsticks for navigation and/or retroflection processes may include improved control over the surgical arms, for example as compared to navigating and retroflecting with the input arms in which the ergonomics of the handle may be less suitable for supporting the rotational movement that the surgeon needs to perform while holding the handle in order to carry out retroflection.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">In some embodiments, during introducing of the surgical arms into the body the surgical arms are straight (optionally to provide for insertion via a cannula), while the input arms are at a rest, locked, retroflected position. Optionally, following retroflection of the surgical arms using the thumbsticks, the surgeon releases the thumbsticks and moves their hands to the input arms. Once the input arms are grasped and optionally lifted by the surgeon, control over the surgical arms is automatically gained, and the surgeon may continue the procedure using the input arms. In some embodiments, when one or more input arm joints are locked by solenoid locks, lifting of the input arm by the surgeon automatically releases the solenoid locks. Additionally or alternately, manual locks of the input arm joints are released, for example via a sensor that detects an input arm position.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">In some embodiments, the system (e.g. a system processor) is configured to recognize one or more positions of the input arms, for example when the input arms are at their rest position, and optionally display to the current position to the user.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">We now refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>. In some embodiments, haptic handles which provide force feedback to the user (a suitable example of which being the &#x2018;omega.7&#x2019; haptic device available from Force Dimension of Nyon, Switzerland) are used throughout the operation for controlling movement and articulation of the surgical arms. In some embodiments, the haptic handles are set to provide counter resistance for preventing the user from moving in directions that are not supported by the surgical arm, for example bending the elbow joint of the surgical arm backwards; touching a joint (e.g. an elbow joint) with a different segment of the same arm; and/or other. In some embodiments, the handles are set to provide counter resistance which varies in accordance with a current anatomical position and/or orientation of the surgical arms. In an example, resistance may be increased if the user attempts a disallowed anatomical area, such as an organ that should be avoided.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">In some embodiments, the haptic handles are programmed to operate according to various control modes. Optionally, the control mode is selected in accordance with a current stage in the surgical operation. In some embodiments, switching between different modes is performed via one or more of a screen interface, one or more buttons on the control console or handles, a foot pedal, and/or other.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">In some embodiments, during a first stage of the procedure, during which the surgical arms are introduced into the patient body and optionally retroflected, the haptic handles are used in &#x201c;speed&#x2014;control&#x201d; mode (<b>5001</b>). Optionally, in the speed-control mode, relative movement of a handle with respect to the handle rest position sets the speed in which the surgical arm is moved. As the user moves the handle further away from the rest position, the speed is raised, and vice versa. For example, movement of the handle to the right of its rest position may result in rotation of an arm joint (e.g. elbow joint) to the right, at a speed determined according to the distance of the handle from its rest position. In some embodiments, in the speed-control mode, the haptic handles are set to provide an elastic (spring-like) counter resistance to the movement of the user. In some embodiments, in the speed control mode, a control algorithm is applied, converting a current configuration of the haptic handle into speed commands issued to the actuators (e.g. motors) of the surgical arm, such as to increase a rotation speed of one or more motor gears.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">A potential advantage of using the speed control mode during introducing and optionally retroflecting the surgical arms in the body may include that during retroflecting the directions are reversed (e.g. upwards/downwards), yet that change can be ignored and the motion can be naturally continued, since the resulting movement of the surgical arms is limited and what changes is the speed of movement.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">In some embodiments, during a second stage of the surgical procedure, optionally during the rest of the procedure, the haptic handles are set to &#x201c;position-control&#x201d; mode (<b>5003</b>). Optionally, in the position control mode, a spatial position of the handles sets a respective position of the surgical arms. In the position control mode, a user's displacement of the haptic handle is translated to a relative displacement command to the surgical arm. In some embodiments, converting the displacement of the haptic handle is controlled according to an algorithm. In some embodiments, control is according to known algorithms (e.g. the Inverse Jacobian algorithm). Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, control is according to custom algorithms. In an example, a custom algorithm is set to scale the user's motion, such as to increase accuracy of movement. Such scaling may include amplifying the movement required on the user end by a selected coefficient to produce a similar non-amplified movement of the surgical arm. For example, the for the arm to move a distance X, the user will need to move the handle by A*X (A&#x3e;1). In another example, an algorithm is selected to filter signals, for example filtering using a low-pass filter to reduce user hand tremors.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">In some embodiments, in the position control mode, a clutch mechanism is provided, allowing a user to temporarily disconnect from the surgical arm (such that movement of the input haptic handle no longer controls the surgical arm). Optionally, when disconnected, the user may freely re-position the haptic handle. In an example, the user re-positions the haptic handle to a position and/or orientation in which it is more comfortable for the user to carry out and control the next movement.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">In some embodiments, the extent of resistance sensed by the user in response to movement of the handles is selected and controlled. In an example, a floating mode is set, in which the user substantially does not encounter resistance and is free to move the handle in all directions. Additionally or alternatively, a level of resistance sensed by the user is adjusted, for example so that the user senses a high resistance in response to one movement and a low or no resistance in response to another movement.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">In some embodiments, the amount of resistance is controlled based on the anatomical location of the surgical arms. For example, a high resistance may be set where obstacles (e.g. the abdominal wall) are found near the surgical arm. In a specific example, if an obstacle is found on the right of the surgical arm, the user may encounter high resistance in response to moving the handle to the right; if no obstacles are found on the left of the arm, the user may encounter low or no resistance in response to moving the handle to the left. Optionally, the extent of resistance is defined by setting system definitions such as producing wall type resistance, rubber like resistance, sand type resistance and/or other.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Second Additional Discussion</heading><p id="p-0230" num="0229">A method is disclosed, according to embodiments, for operating a surgical system comprising (i) an articulated mechanical arm comprising a plurality of arm joints, and (ii) first and second user-input devices for controlling the arm, and (iii) a surgical end effector at the distal end of the arm.
