For example, the mobile terminal may support a voice over LTE (VoLTE) call for transmitting and receiving voice data through an LTE network.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The mobile terminal may include a radio frequency front end (RFFE) module to support various communications. For example, the RFFE module may include a radio frequency (RF) component such as a power amplifier (PA) for amplifying a signal to be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The mobile terminal may supply power to RFFE components (e.g., PA) using a power management integrated circuit (PMIC). For example, the PMIC may supply a driving voltage Vcc to the PA of the RFFE. The power amplifier may amplify and output an input signal based on the driving voltage Vcc.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A magnitude of the driving voltage used for the PA included in a transmission path of the RFFE may vary depending on the strength of a wireless signal transmitted by the mobile terminal. The PMIC may provide various output voltages to supply the driving voltage to the PA. For example, the output voltage output from the PMIC to the PA may be changed according to a condition (e.g., channel state or communication quality) of the electronic device. The output voltage of the PMIC may be changed based on average power tracking (APT) and/or envelope tracking (ET). As the output voltage supplied from the PMIC to the PA is changed, the amount of a charge in a capacitor electrically connected to the PMIC may vary. That is, charging and discharging of the capacitor may occur repeatedly. Due to the charging and discharging of the capacitor, a physical shaking of the capacitor may be caused. Also, noise due to shaking may occur.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the noise caused in the capacitor belongs to an audible frequency band, a user of the electronic device may recognize the noise. For example, noise in the audible frequency band may be included in a received voice when a voice call is performed using an electronic device to deteriorate call quality.</p><heading id="h-0005"
