computer systems. For example, a user of a computing device (e.g., a smartphone, a tablet computer, etc.) may acquire ownership of a non-fungible digital asset (e.g., a digital photograph, digital artwork, a meme, a video clip, an audio clip, etc.). Information associated with such ownership may be recorded in a distributed ledger (e.g., a blockchain) that certifies the non-fungible digital asset as being unique and that provides proof of ownership of the non-fungible digital asset.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The accompanying drawings illustrate various embodiments and are a part of the specification.

For example, an exemplary digital asset management system may perform one or more operations associated with a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets that, when combined together, form a layered scene.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In certain examples, for instance, an exemplary method may include generating, by a digital asset management system, a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets. The method may further include generating, by the digital asset management system, metadata specifying that non-fungible digital assets included the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets are configured to combine together to form a layered scene configured to be presented by a computer system. The method may further include recording, by the digital asset management system in a distributed record configured to track ownership of non-fungible digital assets, ownership information associated with the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As used herein, a &#x201c;non-fungible digital asset&#x201d; may include any digital asset that is not interchangeable in terms of value and/or content with other digital assets. For example, a non-fungible digital asset may include a digital token, a still image (e.g., a digital trading card, a digital poster, etc.), a digital signature or identifier, augmented reality content, a live photo, an audio file, a video file, and/or any other suitable non-fungible digital asset or combination of non-fungible digital assets. In certain examples, a non-fungible digital asset may be unique. The non-fungibility of a digital asset may be due to any suitable attribute of the digital asset. For example, the non-fungibility of a digital asset may be due to intrinsic attributes of the digital asset that distinguish the digital asset from other digital assets so as to make the digital assets not readily interchangeable with each other. For example, a first live photo of a first person (e.g., a celebrity, an athlete, etc.) may be intrinsically visually different from and thus not readily interchangeable with a second live photo of a second person that is different than the first person.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In certain examples, the non-fungibility of a non-fungible digital asset may be based solely on an identifier (e.g., a token identifier (&#x201c;ID&#x201d;)) of the non-fungible digital asset. For example, a first non-fungible digital asset may have a first identifier and a second non-fungible digital asset may have a second identifier. The first non-fungible digital asset and the second non-fungible digital asset may be identical in every way except that the first identifier is different than the second identifier.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In certain examples, the non-fungibility of non-fungible digital assets may be further differentiated based on present or past ownership of the non-fungible digital assets. For example, a certain non-fungible digital asset may have previously been owned by a celebrity, which may render that particular non-fungible digital asset relatively more valuable/collectible than other non-fungible digital assets.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain examples, a non-fungible digital asset may be unique with a certain number of them being available (e.g., a certain number of the same digital trading card may be available). Such non-fungible digital assets may be considered as being part of the same series and may be implemented in any suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In certain examples, non-fungible digital assets such as those described herein may each include a common attribute and/or association. For example, each non-fungible digital asset may be from the same year or season. Additionally or alternatively, each non-fungible digital asset may be associated with the same athlete and/or celebrity, the same intellectual property group, the same type of award, etc.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As will be described further herein, non-fungible digital assets such as those described herein may be included as part of a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets. Each non-fungible digital asset included in a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets may represent a separate and distinct non-fungible digital asset that may be combined with one or more other non-fungible digital assets included in the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets to form a layered scene.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A set of collectible non-fungible digital assets such as described herein may include or otherwise be associated with metadata that specifies that non-fungible digital assets included in the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets are configured to combine together to form a layered scene. Such metadata may be represented in any suitable format and may include any suitable information and/or attributes associated with non-fungible digital assets and their combinability to form a layered scene. Examples of metadata that may be used to define a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets are described herein.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, a &#x201c;layered scene&#x201d; may include any suitable representation of a combination of non-fungible digital assets that may be included in a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets. Layered scenes such as those described herein may include any suitable type or combination of non-fungible digital assets such as those described herein. For example, a layered scene may include non-fungible digital assets in the form of 2D images, 3D images, augmented reality content, audio clips, animations, video clips, visual effects, movements (e.g., emotes), and/or any other suitable type of content or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In certain examples, in addition or alternative to including non-fungible digital assets, a layered scene may also include or otherwise be augmented by one or more fungible digital assets. For example, a layered scene may include or otherwise be augmented by one or more fungible digital assets in the form of digital stickers, user generated content, public domain content, sounds, special effects, and/or any other content that may be considered as a fungible digital asset. Although fungible digital assets may not be tracked individually due to their fungible nature, if a user owns any instance of a fungible digital asset, a digital asset management system may include the fungible digital asset in a layered scene, without being aware of which particular instance of the fungible digital asset is owned by the user.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In certain examples, a layered scene may be unique with a certain number of them being available. Such layered scenes may be considered as being part of the same series and may be implemented in any suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">To illustrate an example, a layered scene may represent a collectible 2D image of a &#x201c;dunk&#x201d; action performed in a professional basketball game. Such a layered scene may be formed of a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets including a first non-fungible digital asset representing a background image of the basketball game, a second non-fungible asset representing a first player in the basketball game, a third non-fungible digital asset representing a second player in the basketball game, and a fourth non-fungible digital asset representing a third player in the basketball game. The first through fourth non-fungible digital assets may be individually collectible by a user of a computer system. Once the user of the computer system collects at least two of the non-fungible digital assets included in the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets, the collected non-fungible digital assets may be combined in any suitable manner, such as described herein, to form at least part of the layered scene. For example, the first non-fungible digital asset representing a background image of the basketball game may be combined with the third non-fungible digital asset to form at least part of the layered scene. As the user collects more non-fungible digital assets, they may be added to the layered scene to complete the layered scene.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Various advantages and benefits are associated with the systems and methods for digital asset management described herein. For example, systems and methods such as those described herein provide a new type of non-fungible digital asset that is collectible by a user in the form of a layered scene. In addition, systems and methods such as those described herein may facilitate generating optional or alternative configurations of non-fungible digital assets represented as part of a layered scene. Such optional or alternative configurations may beneficially increase value of the non-fungible digital assets included in the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets represented in a layered scene. Moreover, systems and methods such as those described herein may facilitate generating analytics information, which may be used to track popularity, ownership, and/or use of digital assets in different market segments. These and other benefits that may be provided by systems and methods described herein will be evident from the disclosure that follows.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary digital asset management system <b>100</b> (&#x201c;system <b>100</b>&#x201d;). As shown, system <b>100</b> may include, without limitation, a memory <b>102</b> and a processor <b>104</b> selectively and communicatively coupled to one another. Memory <b>102</b> and processor <b>104</b> may each include or be implemented by hardware and/or software components (e.g., processors, memories, communication interfaces, instructions stored in memory for execution by the processors, etc.). In some examples, memory <b>102</b> and/or processor <b>104</b> may be implemented by any suitable computing device. In other examples, memory <b>102</b> and/or processor <b>104</b> may be distributed between multiple devices and/or multiple locations as may serve a particular implementation. An illustrative implementation of system <b>100</b> is described herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Memory <b>102</b> may maintain (e.g., store) executable data used by processor <b>104</b> to perform any of the operations described herein. For example, memory <b>102</b> may store instructions <b>106</b> that may be executed by processor <b>104</b> to perform any of the operations described herein. Instructions <b>106</b> may be implemented by any suitable application, software, code, and/or other executable data instance.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Memory <b>102</b> may also maintain any data received, generated, managed, used, and/or transmitted by processor <b>104</b>. Memory <b>102</b> may store any other suitable data as may serve a particular implementation. For example, memory <b>102</b> may store data representative of sets of collectible digital assets such as sets of collectible non-fungible digital assets, analytical information associated with use of digital assets, information regarding augmentation of digital assets, metadata associated with digital assets, notifications, graphics, and/or any other suitable data.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Processor <b>104</b> may be configured to perform (e.g., execute instructions <b>106</b> stored in memory <b>102</b> to perform) various processing operations associated with digital asset management. For example, processor <b>104</b> may record, in a distributed record configured to track ownership of non-fungible digital assets, ownership information associated with a non-fungible digital asset that is included in a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets. These and other operations that may be performed by processor <b>104</b> are described herein.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">System <b>100</b> (e.g., processor <b>104</b>) may be configured to provide any suitable service and/or feature that may be associated with digital assets as may serve a particular implementation. For example, system <b>100</b> may be configured to generate digital assets, manage ownership transfer of digital assets, facilitate sharing of digital assets, facilitate augmentation of digital assets, facilitate use of digital assets, and/or provide any other suitable service and/or feature that may facilitate management of one or more digital assets.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">System <b>100</b> may be configured to generate a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets. This may be accomplished in any suitable manner. For example, system <b>100</b> may provide any suitable user interface to facilitate a user indicating which content (e.g., images, videos, audio, etc.) is to be used to generate the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets. Any suitable protocol (e.g., blockchain protocol) may be used to facilitate generating a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets as may serve a particular implementation. For example, system <b>100</b> may use an Ethereum-based non-fungible token (&#x201c;NFT&#x201d;) standard such as ERC-721 to facilitate generating a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A set of collectible non-fungible digital assets such as described herein may include any number or combination of non-fungible digital assets as may serve a particular implementation. To illustrate, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows set of collectible non-fungible digital assets <b>202</b> including non-fungible digital assets <b>204</b> (e.g., non-fungible digital asset <b>204</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>204</b>-N) that may be generated by system <b>100</b>. In certain examples, each of non-fungible digital assets <b>204</b> may correspond to a same type of non-fungible digital asset. For example, each of non-fungible digital assets <b>204</b> may correspond to a two-dimensional (&#x201c;2D&#x201d;) non-fungible digital asset. In certain alternative implementations, non-fungible digital assets <b>204</b> may include a combination of different types of non-fungible digital assets. For example, non-fungible digital assets <b>204</b> may include a combination of <b>2</b>D non-fungible digital assets, audio non-fungible digital assets, three-dimensional (&#x201c;3D&#x201d;) non-fungible digital assets, etc.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In certain examples, system <b>100</b> may encrypt non-fungible digital assets <b>204</b>. This may be accomplished in any suitable manner. For example, system <b>100</b> may use any suitable form of digital rights management (&#x201c;DRM&#x201d;), tokenized authorization, encrypted manifests, watermarking/steganography, and/or any other suitable form of content security to secure non-fungible digital assets <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In certain examples, system <b>100</b> may also generate metadata that specifies attributes of non-fungible digital assets <b>204</b> included in set of collectible non-fungible digital assets <b>202</b> and that indicates that non-fungible digital assets <b>204</b> in the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets <b>202</b> are configured to combine together to form a layered scene. For example, metadata associated with non-fungible digital assets <b>204</b> and a layered scene may include layer level information, file type information, positioning information, layered scene type (e.g., a 2D layered scene, a 3D layered scene, an augmented reality (&#x201c;AR&#x201d;) layered scene, a static layered scene, a moving layered scene, etc.), dimensions of a non-fungible digital asset, information defining a relative position of non-fungible digital assets with respect to each other, information defining a relative angle of non-fungible digital assets with respect to each other, information defining boundaries of an area (e.g., of a base layer non-fungible digital asset) where non-fungible digital assets may be positioned, rendering rules for combining layers of a layered scene (e.g., that define combining order of layers, overlap characteristics of layers, occlusion characteristics of layers, etc.), and/or any other suitable information and/or attribute. Additionally or alternatively, attributes specified by the metadata may include depth maps, bump maps, texture maps, displacement maps, and/or attributes that govern ray-tracing, specular highlights, shading/reflections, and/or other rendering properties for dynamic lighting and special effect objects/filters.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In certain examples, the metadata may additionally or alternatively include one or more conditional or trigger parameters that may activate depending on a predefined condition associated with set of collectible non-fungible digital assets <b>202</b> being satisfied.

Non-fungible digital assets <b>502</b>-<b>4</b> and <b>502</b>-<b>5</b> on the other hand may be moved in any suitable manner, such as described herein, to the positions indicated by dashed lines within non-fungible digital asset <b>502</b>-<b>1</b>. Non-fungible digital asset <b>502</b>-<b>6</b> is not configured to be positioned at a predefined position and may be moved to any suitable user selected position within non-fungible digital asset <b>502</b>-<b>1</b>. In certain examples, the signature represented by non-fungible digital asset <b>502</b>-<b>6</b> may represent a topmost layer of layered scene <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In certain examples, system <b>100</b> may use any suitable algorithm or method (e.g., artificial intelligence (&#x201c;AI&#x201d;), computer vision, machine learning, etc.) to detect objects and positions of objects in a layered scene and recommend positions and/or modifications of non-fungible digital assets and/or other objects within the layered scene based on the detection. For example, system <b>100</b> may use computer vision to detect faces/bodies, light/dark backgrounds, surface planes, occluding objects, etc. within an AR layered scene. Based on the detection, system <b>100</b> may reposition a non-fungible digital asset within the AR scene to improve visibility, prevent occlusion, and/or for any other suitable purpose. Additionally or alternatively, system <b>100</b> may occlude, remove, or blur one or more objects detected in a layered scene. For example, system <b>100</b> may detect an unlicensed logo and/or inappropriate content within a layered scene and may blur or otherwise obscure that content in real time to prevent them from being viewable within the layered scene.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In certain examples, a layered scene such as layered scene <b>500</b> may include optional or alternative non-fungible digital assets that may be added or changed by a user. For example, the uniform of the batter represented by non-fungible digital asset <b>502</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may correspond to a separate non-fungible digital asset that is optionally or alternatively replaceable. In such an example, there may be a first non-fungible digital asset for a home uniform, a second non-fungible digital asset for an away uniform, and a third non-fungible digital asset for a uniform of a different team. The different uniform options may be alternatively represented as being worn by the batter based on user input. System <b>100</b> may present such different optional non-fungible digital assets for user selection in any suitable manner. For example, system <b>100</b> may present the optional non-fungible digital assets in a dropdown list or in a carousel in which icons, graphics, or text representative of the different alternative non-fungible digital assets are selectable by a user.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The exemplary layered scene <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is provided for illustrative purposes only. It is understood that a layered scene may be implemented in different ways in different examples. For example, a layered scene may be used in a wayfinding implementation to guide users through a physical environment (e.g., a museum, a zoo, a park, etc.) and enhance their understanding of and/or experience in the physical environment. In such an example, non-fungible digital assets associated with the layered scene may correspond to virtual badges that may be collected to track completion of an experience at the physical environment. Other possible implementations in which a layered scene may be used may include an escape room implementation, a geocapture implementation, a puzzle implementation in which different pieces of the puzzle correspond to different non-fungible digital assets of a layered scene, a loyalty program implementation in which loyalty points may be used to unlock/reveal different non-fungible digital assets of a layered scene, a story narrative implementation, a live wallpaper implementation, and/or in any other suitable type of implementation.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow diagram <b>600</b> that depicts exemplary operations that may be performed by system <b>100</b> in certain implementations. At operation <b>602</b>, content creator computer system <b>302</b> may generate a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets (e.g., set of collectible non-fungible digital assets <b>202</b>). In certain examples, the generating of the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets may include generating a base layer non-fungible digital asset and a plurality of additional non-fungible digital assets.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">At operation <b>604</b>, content creator computer system <b>302</b> may record ownership information associated with the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets in distributed record <b>310</b>. Such ownership information may indicate that user <b>308</b>-<b>2</b> of user computer system <b>304</b>-<b>2</b> owns at least some non-fungible digital assets included in the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">At operation <b>606</b>, content creator computer system <b>302</b> may make the non-fungible digital assets that are included in the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets and that are owned by user <b>308</b>-<b>2</b> accessible to user computer system <b>304</b>-<b>2</b>. In certain examples, content creator computer system <b>302</b> may transmit the non-fungible digital assets owned by user <b>308</b>-<b>2</b> of user computer system <b>304</b>-<b>2</b> to user computer system <b>304</b>-<b>2</b> in any suitable manner. Alternatively, content creator computer system <b>302</b> may provide information to user computer system <b>304</b>-<b>2</b> that indicates where the non-fungible digital assets owned by user <b>308</b>-<b>2</b> of user computer system <b>304</b>-<b>2</b> may be accessed. For example, content creator computer system <b>302</b> may provide a website address where the non-fungible digital assets owned by user <b>308</b>-<b>2</b> are hosted. In certain examples, information regarding the website address may be recorded in distributed record <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">At any given time, user <b>308</b>-<b>2</b> of user computer system <b>304</b>-<b>2</b> may only own a subset of the non-fungible digital assets included in a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets. Accordingly, at operation <b>608</b>, user computer system <b>304</b>-<b>2</b> may determine whether all of the non-fungible digital assets included in the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets are owned by user <b>308</b>-<b>2</b>. This may be accomplished in any suitable manner. For example, user computer system <b>304</b>-<b>2</b> may access distributed record <b>310</b> to determine which non-fungible digital assets included in the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets are owned by user <b>308</b>-<b>2</b>. If the answer at operation <b>608</b> is &#x201c;YES,&#x201d; the flow may return to before operation <b>608</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">If the answer at operation <b>608</b> is &#x201c;NO,&#x201d; user computer system <b>304</b>-<b>2</b> may provide a notification including information associated with missing non-fungible digital assets included in the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets. Such a notification may be provided in any suitable manner. For example, user computer system <b>304</b>-<b>2</b> may provide a text notification, an audio notification, a graphical notification, and/or any other suitable notification. The notification may provide any suitable information as may serve a particular implementation. For example, the notification may point out which non-fungible digital asset(s) is/are needed to complete the layered scene, may encourage the user to obtain the missing non-fungible digital asset(s), and/or may provide information regarding how to obtain the missing non-fungible digital asset(s).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In certain examples, a layered scene may include unlockable content that may be accessed and/or revealed based on satisfaction of a predefined condition. In such examples, the predefined condition may include a threshold number of non-fungible digital assets in the layered scene being owned by a user, satisfaction of an interaction requirement (e.g., a time requirement, a volume requirement, a value requirement, number of social interactions with other users, a transaction requirement, a geolocation visitation requirement, a viewing requirement (e.g., to avoid spoilers), an event requirement (e.g., an outcome of a championship game), etc.), and/or any other suitable condition. To illustrate an example, a layered scene may include a first non-fungible digital asset that is a base layer non-fungible digital asset, a second non-fungible digital asset, and a third non-fungible digital asset that are each images that may be positioned with respect to the first non-fungible digital asset. The layered scene may also include a fourth non-fungible digital asset in the form of an audio track (e.g., music, a sound effect, etc.) that is unlockable and may owned and experienced by the user as part of the layered scene only once the user already owns each of the first, second, and third non-fungible digital assets.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In certain examples, system <b>100</b> may automatically generate optional or alternative configurations of non-fungible digital assets represented as part of a layered scene. In such examples, system <b>100</b> may use any suitable algorithm to automatically generate content to recommend to a user. For example, system <b>100</b> may access ownership information, user information, interaction information, and/or any other suitable information associated with a user. System <b>100</b> may then use such information in any suitable manner to automatically generate optional or alternatively configured layered scenes that may be recommended to the user.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In certain examples, system <b>100</b> may facilitate an owner of a layered scene such as described herein sharing the layered scene with a third party. In such examples, system <b>100</b> may implement a share function as an ownership function associated with a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets that may be represented in a layered scene. Such a share function may specify one or more use restrictions associated with the shared use of the layered scene. For example, such use restrictions may include, but are not limited to, time restrictions for viewing and/or accessing the layered scene, ownership transfer restrictions, modification restrictions, and/or any other suitable use restriction. With a share function, there may be a main owner of the layered scene and one or more partial owners that have restricted ownership. The share function may beneficially permit the main owner to share a layered scene with one or more partial owners without having to worry that the one or more partial owners will modify the layered scene and/or transfer one or more of the non-fungible digital assets included in the layered scene to a third party.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">To illustrate an example in which a share function may be implemented, a layered scene may correspond to a digital poster that depicts a team picture of a plurality of athletes on a professional sports team. Each image of an athlete in the digital poster may correspond to a separate distinct non-fungible digital asset. After a user collects at least some of the non-fungible digital assets of the athletes on the team, the user may want to share the digital poster with one or more friends and/or family. In such an example, the share function may facilitate system <b>100</b> providing restricted use sharing of the digital poster with the one or more friends and/or family of the user according to operations similar to those such as those described herein. Accordingly, the user may be able to selectively share partial ownership of the digital poster with the one or more friends and/or family subject to certain restrictions such as a time restriction. A user account of the user may then receive full ownership of the digital poster back after, for example, a predefined time period expires.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In certain examples, the share function may include providing indicators and/or notifications to a partial owner that indicate the restricted use and/or partial ownership of a shared non-fungible digital asset. For example, a shared digital poster may be provided for display in a graphical user interface together with an indicator in the form of a lock icon, a watermark, and/or any other suitable indicator that may inform a partial owner that they are merely sharing the non-fungible digital asset and do not own the non-fungible digital asset. Additionally or alternatively, a timer indicator or graphic may be provided for display together with the shared digital poster to indicate how much time remains to view the shared digital poster.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In certain examples, the share function may facilitate combining non-fungible digital assets owned by two or more different users together to generate a layered scene. For example, a first user may own a first non-fungible digital asset included in a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets and a second user my own a second non-fungible digital asset included in the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets. The second user may share the second non-fungible digital asset with the first user such that the first user has restricted use of the second non-fungible digital asset. In such an example, system <b>100</b> may combine the first non-fungible digital asset and the second non-fungible digital asset in any suitable manner such as described herein to form a layered scene in which different users own different portions of the layered scene. The second non-fungible digital asset may then be returned to the second user, for example, after expiration of a predefined amount of time.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In certain examples, system <b>100</b> may facilitate transferring ownership of non-fungible digital assets between users. This may be accomplished in any suitable manner. For example, in certain instances ownership transfer may occur on an individual basis where ownership of each non-fungible digital asset included in a set of collectible non-fungible digital assets may be transferred separately. Alternatively, ownership transfer may occur on a set basis where ownership is transferable only for the entire set of collectible non-fungible digital assets or for some threshold sub-combination of non-fungible digital assets included in the set of collectible non-fungible digital assets.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In certain examples, system <b>100</b> may facilitate providing optional or alternative non-fungible digital assets in a layered scene. For example, the signature represented by non-fungible digital asset <b>502</b>-<b>6</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may correspond to an optional non-fungible digital asset that may be provided with respect to layered scene <b>500</b>. In certain examples, non-fungible digital assets may be selectively viewable together with the layered scene. For example, when the optional non-fungible digital asset includes a signature provided with a layered scene that is a digital poster, system <b>100</b> may facilitate a user turning the signature on or off such that the user may view the digital poster in any suitable manner together with the signature or without the signature in a graphical user interface.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In certain examples, system <b>100</b> may collect analytics information associated with use of digital assets. Such analytics information may include anonymous data from digital asset transactions performed according to principles described herein. The analytics information may be used in any suitable manner as may serve a particular implementation. For example, the collected analytics information may be used to provide advertisements to users, evaluate the effectiveness of promotional items, track popularity of digital assets, evaluate sponsorships, and/or for any other suitable purpose.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref> illustrate exemplary implementations <b>702</b>, <b>802</b>, and <b>902</b> of metadata that may be generated by system <b>100</b> as a specification for a layered scene.
