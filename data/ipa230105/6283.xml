In such a battery, a Li-ion cell is an elementary component, which contains a certain amount of electrolyte, through which lithium ions can migrate between a cathode and an anode, in order to store or deliver electrical energy. In a Li-ion battery, a plurality of Li-ion cells are first assembled and connected in series and/or in parallel to form a module, and then a plurality of modules are assembled and connected in series and/or in parallel to form a &#x2018;pack&#x2019;. Thus, a battery pack generally comprises a plurality of interconnected modules, which are in turn formed by a plurality of interconnected cells, and a support structure for its various elements.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the event of a failure of one or more cells in a battery pack, a thermal runaway phenomenon may be triggered inside the cells. In the absence of safety devices such as those implemented by the applicant, this thermal runaway phenomenon can spread to the entire pack and lead to a fire as soon as the cells cross a temperature threshold. As this is a chemical fire, it is very difficult to extinguish, especially considering the fact that it confined in the almost hermetically sealed chamber formed by the pack.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent document CN106110537 discloses a device for protecting against the risk of fire in the event of thermal runaway of a Li-ion battery, The battery is provided with a temperature sensor as well as a water supply circuit and a liquid nitrogen supply circuit, allowing water and liquid nitrogen respectively to be circulated in the battery pack. When the temperature detected exceeds a certain threshold, one or the other of the two water and liquid nitrogen supply circuits is activated in order to cool the battery during an initial phase of thermal runaway of a battery cell and, if necessary, to extinguish a fire when the battery is on fire. In particular, when the temperature is between a low and a high temperature threshold, the liquid nitrogen supply circuit is activated, causing liquid nitrogen to be sprayed from above onto the battery cells, and when the temperature becomes higher than the high threshold, the liquid nitrogen spray is stopped, whereas the water supply circuit is activated, causing a water mist to be sprayed from above onto the battery cells.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This device is relatively complex to produce since it requires providing the battery with two different cooling circuits, specifically the liquid nitrogen supply circuit and the water supply circuit, to the detriment of space and cost. Moreover, the simple action of spraying liquid nitrogen or water from above onto the cells of the battery modules might not be sufficient to prevent a Lire in the event of an excessive rise in temperature, or to ensure that it is completely extinguished.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An objective of the invention is thus to propose a battery pack free of at least one of the previously mentioned limitations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To this end, the invention relates to a battery pack for an electric or hybrid motor vehicle, said battery pack being formed by an upper housing and a lower housing delimiting an internal chamber in which there is housed at least one battery module comprising a plurality of interconnected electrochemical cells, the pack being provided with a cooling circuit allowing the circulation in the pack of a cooling fluid intended to be sprayed onto said at least one module by means of spray nozzles, characterized in that the cooling circuit is suitable for ensuring circulation of the cooling fluid in a closed circuit within the pack, with a pump arranged in the internal chamber being capable of recirculating, to the spray nozzles by means of discharge orifices formed in the base wall of the lower housing, the cooling fluid sprayed onto said at least one module and collected in a double base provided under a base wall of the lower housing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thanks to this arrangement with, on the one hand, discharge orifices formed in the base wall of the lower housing, allowing the cooling fluid flowing down along the cells of said at least one module to be collected in a double base of the lower housing, and, on the other hand, the pump allowing this collected fluid to be recirculated to the spray nozzles, the cooling fluid is circulated in a closed circuit inside the pack. The pack is thus particularly compact and less bulky.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantageously, a hot-melt sealing element is placed inside each discharge orifice, said sealing element being capable of melting so as to allow the sealing of said at least one discharge orifice when a determined temperature threshold is reached, preventing the discharge, towards the double base of the lower housing, of the cooling fluid sprayed onto said at least one module, so as to allow the cells of said at least one module to be immersed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thanks to this arrangement, each discharge orifice towards the double base can be closed in case of an excessive temperature rise. The temperature threshold is suitable for causing the hot-melt sealing elements to melt upon initiation of a thermal runaway phenomenon within the cells, which may then ignite within the pack. This allows the level of cooling fluid that continues to be sprayed onto the cells in said at least one module to rise until the cells are submerged. This effectively stops the spread of the cell fire.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Advantageously, the spray nozzles are arranged on an inner wall of the upper housing, said upper housing comprising an outer wall spaced from said inner wall so as to form an internal cavity in said upper housing, the pump being connected to the spray nozzles by means of a conduit opening into said internal cavity in order to inject said cooling fluid therein.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Advantageously, a through-hole opening into the double base of the lower housing is formed in the base wall of the lower housing for the passage of the cooling fluid, the pump having a suction spout engaged through said through-hole and dipping into the double base.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Advantageously, the plurality of cells is juxtaposed in a receiving volume of each module with at least one space between two elementary cells of said at least one module, so as to allow the passage of the cooling fluid between two cells of said at least one module.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Advantageously, the space is formed by a partition plate extending between two cells, the opposite faces of said plate being grooved to create fluid passage channels along the cells.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The invention also relates to a motor vehicle comprising an electric drive train, characterized in that said motor vehicle comprises a battery pack as described above.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further features and advantages of the invention will become clear from the description hereinafter, which is provided by way of example and no way in a limiting manner, with reference to the appended drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a battery pack according to an exemplary embodiment according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a battery pack module shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> an exploded, perspective, cross-sectional view of a detail of a lower portion of the battery pack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a non-exploded, perspective, cross-sectional view of a detail of the lower portion of the battery pack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective, cross-sectional view of a detail of the lower portion of the battery pack with two discharge orifices formed at the base of the lower housing, shown in the plugged and unplugged configuration, respectively.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the side of a traction battery pack <b>1</b> of an electric or hybrid motor vehicle, provided with at least one electric drive train. The pack <b>1</b> is formed substantially by a lower housing <b>2</b>, for example made of aluminum, closed by an upper housing <b>3</b>, also made of aluminum. The lower housing <b>2</b> and upper housing <b>3</b> delimit an internal chamber in which there is disposed at least one and preferably a plurality of modules <b>4</b> of interconnected electrochemical cells <b>5</b>, of the Li-ion type. According to the example, the pack <b>1</b> encloses two modules <b>4</b> of ten interconnected electrochemical cells <b>5</b>, preferably of parallelepiped shape. For each of the modules <b>4</b>, the cells <b>5</b> are held parallel to each other and at a distance from each other by partition plates <b>6</b>, the role of which is to allow the passage of a cooling fluid, sprayed from above the modules, between the cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a detail of a module <b>4</b>, and inside the latter the partition plates <b>6</b>, regularly spaced and arranged parallel to each other, between which the cells as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> will be inserted. The module <b>4</b> is formed by a casing with a substantially square cross-section, with an upper opening <b>41</b>, opposite a lower opening <b>42</b>. Inside the casing <b>4</b>, each of the partition plates <b>6</b> extends substantially over the full height of the casing <b>4</b> and has two opposite surfaces <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>. The two opposite surfaces <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> of the plates <b>6</b> are grooved. Thus, they have grooves <b>63</b> that extend over the entire height of the plates <b>6</b> between the upper and lower openings of the module casing <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the upper housing <b>3</b> has an internal cavity <b>33</b> formed by two opposite walls, specifically an external wall <b>31</b> and an internal wall <b>32</b>, spaced apart from each other, extending in line with the two modules <b>4</b> of cells <b>5</b> housed in the battery pack <b>1</b>. The inner wall <b>32</b> is provided with a plurality of spray nozzles <b>30</b> facing the upper opening <b>41</b> of the modules and the cells arranged therein. The spray nozzles <b>30</b> are provided to allow the spraying of a cooling fluid injected into the internal cavity <b>33</b> of the upper housing <b>3</b>, as will be described in more detail later, onto the battery modules <b>4</b> arranged in the internal chamber of the pack below the upper housing <b>3</b> thereof. The cooling fluid is a dielectric fluid, that is to say it is not a charge carrier, so as not to short-circuit the cells. The heat transfer fluid is, for example, a polyethylene glycol or a mineral oil.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cooling fluid thus sprayed by the spray nozzles <b>30</b> onto the upper portion of the battery modules <b>4</b> flows between the cells <b>5</b> and the partition plates <b>6</b> of the battery modules, along the grooves, to the base <b>20</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b>. In this way, a heat exchange takes place between the cells and the cooling fluid, so that the thermal energy released by the cells can be dissipated.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As can be best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, which illustrate a perspective view of a detail of the lower portion of the pack <b>1</b>, in an exploded and non-exploded view respectively, it is provided that the heated cooling fluid then flows by gravity through discharge orifices <b>21</b> formed in a base wall <b>20</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b>, preferably comprising at least one discharge orifice formed opposite the lower opening <b>42</b> of each of the modules <b>4</b> arranged in the pack. The heated cooling fluid collected by the discharge orifices <b>21</b> is conveyed through these orifices <b>21</b> into a double base <b>23</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b> formed by a lower wall <b>22</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b> opposite the base wall <b>20</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b>, the two walls, that is to say lower wall <b>22</b> and base wall <b>20</b>, of the lower housing being spaced apart from each other. The double base <b>23</b> of the lower housing thus extends under the base wall <b>20</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b>, facing the lower opening of the modules.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The double base <b>23</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b> and the internal cavity <b>33</b> of the upper housing are connected to each other by means of a pump <b>7</b>, located in the chamber of the battery pack <b>1</b>, next to the modules <b>4</b>. For this purpose, the inner wall <b>32</b> of the upper housing <b>3</b> has, substantially in line with the pump <b>7</b>, an orifice <b>34</b>, opening into the inner cavity <b>33</b> of the upper housing <b>3</b>. There is mounted on said orifice <b>34</b> a connector fitted into a supply pipe <b>8</b>, extending to the pump <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, the base wall <b>20</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b> has a through-hole <b>26</b> in the region of the pump <b>7</b>, said through-hole opening into the double base <b>23</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b>. The pump <b>7</b> has a suction spout <b>71</b>, which is inserted through the through-hole <b>26</b> and dips into the double base <b>23</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The switching-on of the pump <b>7</b> thus causes the cooling fluid to circulate in a closed circuit inside the pack <b>1</b> as follows. First, the cooling fluid is drawn into the double base <b>23</b> of the lower housing through the through-hole <b>26</b>. The cooling fluid is considered to be cold at the through-hole <b>26</b>. It is then sucked in through the suction spout <b>71</b> of the pump <b>7</b>, and is delivered under pressure through the supply line <b>8</b>, as shown by the arrow F. The cooling fluid then flows under pressure into the inner cavity <b>33</b> of the upper housing <b>3</b>. It is then injected under pressure through the spray nozzles <b>30</b> so as to form a spray mist P above the modules <b>4</b>. The cooling fluid then flows by gravity along the cells <b>5</b> in the passage channels formed by the grooves <b>63</b> of the partition plates <b>6</b>, arranged between the cells <b>5</b>, according to the arrows T. On contact with the cells <b>5</b>, the cooling fluid stores the thermal energy produced by them, then flows by gravity over the base wall <b>20</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b>, to then flow through the discharge orifices <b>21</b> inside the double base <b>23</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b>. The thermal energy accumulated from contact with the cells then tends to be lost from the heated cooling fluid to the lower wail <b>22</b>, which is for example exposed to the ambient air. As the distance between the lower wall <b>22</b> and the base wall <b>20</b> is small compared to their surface area, the cooling fluid is in the form of a thin layer through the double base <b>23</b> of the lower housing, and therefore its cooling is rapid. Consequently, when the cooling fluid is again sucked through the through-hole <b>26</b>, it is considered to be cold, thus starting another cooling cycle of the cells <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">However, in the event of a thermal runaway of a cell in one or more battery modules, the battery cells may ignite within the pack, once they cross a temperature threshold. The cooling cycle of the battery cells just described might not be sufficient to prevent or contain the spread of this fire.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, the discharge orifices <b>21</b> are each provided with a hot-melt sealing element <b>24</b>, incorporated within the orifice and intended to allow said discharge orifices to be sealed in the event of an excessive rise in temperature and thus allow the modules to be submerged. The hot-melt sealing elements <b>24</b> are in the form of a pellet made of hot-melt material, placed inside each discharge orifice <b>21</b> and having a central bore <b>25</b> to allow the passage of the cooling fluid towards the double base <b>23</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b>, each pellet having the ability to melt in order to block the discharge orifice <b>21</b> when a predetermined temperature is reached.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">By way of example and as can be seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, each discharge orifice <b>21</b> formed in the base wall <b>20</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b> is delimited by a substantially frustoconical inner peripheral face <b>210</b>, converging from top to bottom, between an upper opening <b>211</b> on the side of the internal chamber and a lower opening <b>212</b> on the side of the double base <b>23</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b>. The hot-melt pellets <b>24</b> are incorporated within the discharge orifices <b>21</b> in such a way as to match their inner peripheral face <b>210</b>, while the central bore <b>25</b> of the pellets provides a passage for the cooling fluid between the upper openings <b>211</b> and lower openings <b>212</b> of the discharge orifices <b>21</b>. Thus, by melting when a predetermined temperature is reached, the hot-melt material of the pellet <b>24</b> flows into the double base <b>23</b> and agglomerates upon contact with the inner wall <b>22</b> at the lower opening <b>212</b> of the discharge orifice <b>21</b>, until it forms a plug that closes said opening. The discharge orifice <b>21</b> on the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is illustrated in this plugged configuration. The hot-melt pellet <b>24</b> associated with each discharge orifice <b>21</b> thus makes it possible to block the fluid passage formed below a module towards the double base <b>23</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b>, when a predetermined temperature is reached, preventing the discharge of the cooling fluid into the double base <b>23</b> of the lower housing <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The melting of a hot-melt pellet <b>24</b> associated with a discharge orifice <b>21</b> located below a module <b>4</b> of the battery causes the module to be filled with the cooling fluid, which continues to spray the cells from above, thus allowing the cells to be at least partially submerged within the module. This arrangement is particularly effective in stopping the spread of a fire in the event of the initiation of a thermal runaway phenomenon inside the cells.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-001-8" num="001-8"><claim-text><b>1</b>.-<b>8</b>.
