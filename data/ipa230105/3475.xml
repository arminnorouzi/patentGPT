Hammer and trigger are rotatably mounted in a housing, which is fixedly secured within the weapon; the disconnector is rotatably mounted on the elongated rear side of the trigger. A sear is rotatably mounted on the trigger in an area between and above the trigger axis and the hammer axis. Various springs are provided to bring the complex in working position, all mentioned parts are positioned side by side.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since such trigger units can be used interchangeably as modules in existing weapons and the weapons themselves only provide the geometric and functional boundary conditions, the present disclosure primarily relates to such a trigger unit and only secondarily to a weapon with such a trigger unit.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a rule, a modern trigger unit should be easy to operate, reliable, easy to maintain and adjustable between a &#x201c;safe&#x201d; and at least an &#x201c;operational&#x201d; state. A large number of such trigger units, especially for AR15 rifles, which are primarily addressed here, have a design which prevents the selector from being moved into the &#x201c;safe&#x201d; position when the hammer is in the striking position. This is often due to the fact that the trigger lever, comprising a selector (also often referred to as a safety lever), the trigger and the trigger catch (usually referred to as a &#x201c;sear&#x201d;) interacting with the hammer (also referred to as a striking piece) is designed in one piece. Examples are U.S. Pat. No. 10,330,413 B2, EP 2 950 033 B1, U.S. Pat. No. 7,600,338 B2, from which these correlations are very clearly evident.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is also a concern to provide the shooter with a trigger unit that requires a two-stage resistance structure to discharge the firearm. These trigger resistances should be perceptible and distinguishable by the shooter when the trigger is actuated. Here, too, a large number of two-stage trigger units are known, which have a first trigger resistance (e.g. &#x201c;pre-pull resistance&#x201d;) and a second trigger resistance (e.g. &#x201c;main trigger resistance&#x201d;). Overcoming the first and second trigger resistance is often referred to as &#x201c;first stage&#x201d; and &#x201c;second stage&#x201d; in English. U.S. Pat. No. 7,600,338 B2 and US 2019/257606 A1 should be mentioned as representative for the many different design possibilities, since very different components are responsible for the mode of action.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The content of DE 20 2011 004 556 U1, EP 2 950 033 B1, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,600,338 B2, 10,330,413 B2, US 2016/0363401 A1 and US 2019/257606 A1 is incorporated by reference into this application and description for the jurisdictions where this is possible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed is therefore a trigger unit which enables the firearm to be secured when the hammer is struck. A further object of the present disclosure is to provide a two-stage trigger unit with different trigger resistances. Another object of the present disclosure is to provide a trigger unit that is easy to handle, easy to maintain and relatively easy to replace as a &#x201c;drop-in trigger unit.&#x201d;</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure provides two-stage trigger units suitable for use in firearms, and in particular suitable for firearms of the rifle type M4/M16/AR15.

In other words, the sear with its sear axis and the trigger lever with its trigger axis form a common axis of rotation, wherein the sear has on its upper side a bearing recess for receiving and limited rotation about a disconnector axis of a disconnector pivot joint formed on the underside of the disconnector and wherein the bearing recess is formed surrounding the disconnector pivot at least partially in the direction of rotation about the disconnector axis.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In still other words, the parts are not positioned side by side as in US 2016/0363401 A1, but are nested one inside the other. Further, the disconnector is rotatably mounted on the sear, and not on the trigger. Finally, the sear axis and the trigger axis are one and the same, which is possible due to the nesting.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this way, the hammer, which is mounted rotatably about a hammer axis and can be prestressed by means of a hammer spring, is no longer blocked by the trigger in the struck state. The trigger lever, which is mounted rotatably about the trigger axis, integrally comprises a trigger and a trigger rear, which is designed to accommodate at least one disconnector. The design and arrangement according to the present disclosure, or the interaction of sear, disconnector and trigger lever allow an adjustment of the selector in the struck state up to the &#x201c;safe position&#x201d;, since the trigger rear is easily deflectable in this state.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The bearing recess and the disconnector pivot are substantially complementary in shape to each other to allow rotation about the disconnector axis within limits. The assembly can be done relatively easily by pushing the disconnector together sideways, as explained in further detail with reference to the drawings. When installed, this also reduces the likelihood that any of the components of the trigger unit are lost.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Throughout the description and the claims &#x201c;front&#x201d; or &#x201c;(to the) front&#x201d; are used as a direction towards the muzzle of the barrel, &#x201c;(to the) rear&#x201d; as a direction towards the well, &#x201c;(downwards) down&#x201d; as a direction for the latch towards the magazine, and &#x201c;(upward) up&#x201d; as a direction away from the magazine. The terms &#x201c;weapon center plane,&#x201d; &#x201c;barrel core,&#x201d; &#x201c;barrel axis,&#x201d; &#x201c;core axis,&#x201d; etc. have the usual meaning that the person skilled in the art attaches to them in the prior art. &#x201c;Left&#x201d; thus refers to the weapon center plane, &#x201c;from left&#x201d; corresponds to a movement, actuation, exertion of force in the direction of the center plane of the weapon, starting from a starting position to the &#x201c;left&#x201d; of it, etc. After a shot has been fired, the latch is moved &#x201c;to the rear&#x201d; under the effect of the gases and then &#x201c;to the front&#x201d; again under the effect of a closing spring, etc.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the context of the present disclosure, a trigger unit which is suitable for placement in a firearm, preferably a rifle, is referred to as &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d; in its entirety. This should explicitly include a &#x201c;drop-in trigger unit,&#x201d; i.e. an &#x201c;installation or retrofit module,&#x201d; which summarizes the trigger unit <b>2</b> according to the present disclosure in a trigger unit housing <b>23</b> in advance and facilitates the installation in a firearm.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the figures of the drawings, an attempt was made to designate everything that concerns trigger unit <b>2</b> as &#x201c;<b>2</b><i>n</i>,&#x201d; as well as analogously &#x201c;<b>21</b><i>n</i>&#x201d; for the hammer, &#x201c;<b>3</b><i>n</i>&#x201d; for the disconnector, &#x201c;<b>4</b><i>n</i>&#x201d; for the sear, &#x201c;<b>5</b><i>n</i>&#x201d; for the continuous firing unit and &#x201c;<b>6</b><i>n</i>&#x201d; for the selector.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is clear to the person skilled in the art that the embodiments depicted were chosen as schematic and/or exemplary representations and that it is easily possible for a person having ordinary skills in the art with the benefit of the present disclosure, to transfer the connections according to the present disclosure also to embodiments not explicitly shown, which is why these implicitly disclosed embodiments can be gleaned both from the description of the figures and from the claims.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>11</b></figref> primarily show exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure which are suitable for use in an AR15 or M4 rifle.

In the normal direction <b>93</b> (vertical) above the trigger unit <b>2</b>, a bolt carrier <b>11</b> is shown, which in the rest position of the weapon, i.e. before firing, is mounted above the trigger unit <b>2</b> in an upper housing (not shown). In addition, a grip <b>12</b>, a magazine catch <b>14</b> and a bolt catch lever <b>15</b> can be seen on the lower housing <b>1</b> when installed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also shows an auto sear unit <b>5</b> and a selector <b>6</b> in exploded view, which are not to be seen as part of the trigger unit <b>2</b> according to the present disclosure, but are to be described for their function.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the auto sear unit <b>5</b> usually comprises an auto sear <b>51</b> and a continuous fire spring <b>52</b>, as well as a sleeve and a pin for fixing in the housing <b>1</b>. Likewise, the selector <b>6</b> in the form shown comprises two actuating members and a control shaft <b>61</b>, whereby the control shaft <b>61</b> is arranged inside the housing <b>1</b> and can be adjusted by the two actuating members from the outside in its angular position, i.e. by rotation about the transverse direction <b>92</b>. The control shaft <b>61</b> has a geometry which, by forming differently shaped cams along the control shaft <b>61</b>, interacts with different parts of the trigger unit <b>2</b> depending on the position of the selector <b>6</b>. The control shaft <b>61</b> is substantially designed as can be seen, for example, from DE 20 2011 004 556 U1 or EP 2 950 033 B1.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a composite drop-in trigger unit can be seen in a perspective view, which is shown in the rest position. At this point it should again be noted that the trigger unit <b>2</b> according to the present disclosure can theoretically also be installed without a trigger unit housing <b>23</b>, i.e. directly in the lower housing <b>1</b>, provided that smaller adaptations, such as a support for the sear spring <b>41</b> are provided in housing <b>1</b>. The illustrations show the preferred embodiment as a drop-in trigger unit.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the rest position of the trigger unit <b>2</b> can be seen in a plan view and explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>: A hammer <b>21</b>, also often referred to as striking pin, is mounted in the trigger unit housing <b>23</b>, or more precisely in a bearing sleeve <b>24</b>, so that it can rotate about a hammer or hammer axis <b>212</b>. The disconnector <b>3</b>, which is located inside the trigger <b>26</b>, is also very clearly visible. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> also shows the superimposed illustration of the trigger unit <b>2</b> with the auto sear unit <b>5</b> and the selector <b>6</b>, as it corresponds to the installation situation and becomes clear in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows another exemplary representation of the trigger unit <b>2</b> in an exploded view, whereby the dashed lines are to be seen as reference lines to illustrate the position of the components in relation to each other in the installation situation. From the illustration, the multi-part nature of the trigger unit <b>2</b> according to the present disclosure can be seen very clearly, whereby the trigger lever <b>26</b> in particular has no specific shape, i.e. no dedicated front section, in the barrel direction <b>91</b> to the front, as can very often be seen in the prior art. The mechanical engagement on the hammer <b>21</b> or its hammer cams <b>215</b> (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) does not take place directly with the trigger lever <b>26</b>, but indirectly via a separately designed sear <b>4</b>. According to the present disclosure, the sear <b>4</b> and the trigger lever <b>26</b> have a common axis of rotation in the installation situation which, accordingly, is designated both as the trigger axis <b>262</b> and as the sear axis <b>43</b>. In addition, according to the present disclosure, the sear <b>4</b> is connected to a disconnector <b>3</b> in such a way that the sear <b>4</b> has on its upper side a bearing recess <b>42</b> for receiving and limited rotation of a disconnector pivot <b>32</b> formed on the underside of the disconnector <b>3</b>. A bearing recess <b>42</b> encloses the disconnector pivot <b>32</b> at least partially in the direction of rotation about the disconnector axis <b>35</b>, which runs through the disconnector pivot <b>32</b> in the transverse direction <b>92</b>. In the installation situation, this permits a limited rotation of the disconnector about the disconnector axis <b>35</b> and, due to the formation of a common sear axis <b>43</b> or trigger axis <b>262</b>, the sear <b>4</b> and the disconnector <b>3</b> can be tilted individually and jointly or rotated within limits. The sear <b>4</b> and the disconnector <b>3</b> are at least partially laterally mounted by the trigger <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It can also be seen that in the installation situation a sear spring <b>41</b> is held on both sides of the trigger <b>26</b> by the bearing sleeve <b>24</b> in the trigger unit <b>2</b>. The curved rear continuous leg of the sear spring <b>41</b> engages on the underside of the trigger housing <b>23</b> in the exemplary embodiment shown (see also e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). This type of spring support can also be provided by the person skilled in the art in other ways, such as by means of appropriate support points on the inside of the lower housing <b>1</b>. However, according to the present disclosure, the two loose ends of the sear spring <b>41</b> are supported on the sear <b>4</b> on the underside of the sear spring supports <b>412</b> provided for this purpose. This causes a sear edge <b>44</b> of the sear <b>4</b> to be prestressed upwards in the direction of the hammer <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The hammer <b>21</b> is prestressed in the installation situation using the corresponding hammer spring <b>211</b>. The hammer spring <b>211</b> is stretched in the usual way against the hammer <b>21</b> with the center connecting piece from below and can be supported by the bearing sleeve <b>24</b>, which holds the trigger <b>26</b>. In the embodiment shown, e.g. in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, projecting hammer spring supports <b>261</b> can be provided laterally on the trigger <b>26</b>, which act as abutments for the hammer spring <b>21</b> and thus prevent the hammer spring <b>21</b> from resting on the sear spring <b>41</b>. Due to the support of the hammer spring <b>21</b>, according to the present disclosure, on the hammer spring supports <b>261</b> provided for this purpose, but basically also on the bearing sleeve <b>24</b> or the sear spring <b>41</b>, there is also a force transmission which pushes the trigger lever <b>26</b> with its trigger rear <b>263</b> downwards in the normal direction <b>93</b>. This connection is advantageous for the design of the trigger unit <b>2</b> according to the present disclosure, since it transmits a force to be overcome to the trigger <b>26</b> and thus noticeably to the shooter on the trigger <b>264</b>, which is perceived as the &#x201c;first stage&#x201d; and defines the resistance in the pull, which will be explained later.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The analysis of the following <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>11</b></figref> makes it clear to the person skilled in the art that the tasks according to the present disclosure can be solved by means of the one-piece components shown as examples, in particular the trigger <b>26</b>, the sear <b>4</b>, the disconnector <b>3</b> and the hammer <b>21</b>. It should be noted at this point that multi-part sears <b>4</b> and/or disconnectors <b>3</b> are also conceivable, which interact in an analogous way.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>the sear lever <b>4</b> and the disconnector <b>3</b> are shown enlarged. The disconnector <b>3</b> has a hook <b>31</b> on the upper side which interacts with the hammer hook <b>213</b>. At its rear end the disconnector <b>3</b> has a back end <b>33</b>, which in transverse direction <b>92</b>, as shown, can have a smaller extension than the center or front section. This makes accommodation/insertion in the rear of the trigger <b>263</b> easier. The disconnector <b>3</b> can, as shown, have formed a kind of support lug in the front section for guiding along the upper side of the sear <b>4</b>. The guide and/or also the support on the upper side of the sear <b>4</b> can also be achieved by an alternative, functionally identical design of the pairing bearing recess <b>42</b> and disconnector pivot <b>32</b>. Further, one may see the distance <b>442</b>, d, between the axis <b>262</b> which is the same as the axis <b>43</b> and the outermost end of sear <b>4</b>. The meaning of this distance will be explained in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>D</figref> and the detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The disconnector <b>3</b> has a disconnector pivot <b>32</b> on its underside, which serves to accommodate and rotatably mount on the upper side of the sear <b>4</b> and which defines a disconnector axis <b>35</b> in the transverse direction <b>92</b>. In addition, a receptacle for a disconnector spring <b>34</b> is provided on the underside of the disconnector <b>3</b>. The diameter and depth of this receptacle, which is better visible in cross-section e.g. in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, is adapted to the disconnector spring <b>34</b> in such a way as to decrease the risk of it slipping out sideways.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a special embodiment, the sear <b>4</b>, as enlarged in detail C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, also has a spring recess <b>46</b>. This spring recess <b>46</b> is formed on the upper side, i.e. facing the disconnector <b>3</b>, and serves, like the mounting in the disconnector <b>3</b>, to at least partially mount and loss protect the disconnector spring <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the advantageous further embodiment shown, the spring recess <b>46</b> is partially open in at least one transverse direction <b>92</b>, which facilitates assembly, as the disconnector spring <b>34</b> does not have to be compressed to the point where it can be inserted into the recess or receptacle.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A further aid for the assembly is provided by a ramp <b>461</b> provided at the side in the area of the opening to the spring recess <b>46</b>. Because the ramp <b>461</b> rises in the direction of the spring recess <b>46</b>, the disconnector spring <b>34</b> can be inserted more easily from the side, i.e. moved over it.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In all the cases described, however, the function of the disconnector spring <b>34</b> is the same in that it prestresses the disconnector <b>3</b> around the disconnector axis <b>35</b>, i.e. substantially upwards in the direction of the hammer hook <b>213</b>. The bearing recess <b>42</b> is substantially complementary in shape and function to the disconnector pivot <b>32</b>, whereby a partial rotation of the disconnector <b>3</b>, i.e. within defined limits, is made possible in addition to the mounting. The assembly of the sear <b>4</b> and the disconnector <b>3</b> is therefore carried out by shifting from one side in the transverse direction <b>92</b>, whereby an independent disassembly or disintegration during operation is avoided by the lateral limitation within the trigger unit housing <b>23</b> or also lower housing <b>1</b> of the firearm.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>8</b></figref> describe the function of the trigger unit <b>2</b> in more detail. The sectional views of the different rest and working positions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>C, <b>6</b>A, <b>7</b>A, <b>8</b>A</figref>, and <b>8</b>B correspond to a side view through the center plane along the section line A-A&#x2032;, as shown as an example for the rest position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The sectional views of the different resting and working positions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B, <b>5</b>D, <b>6</b>B, and <b>7</b>B</figref> correspond to a side view through the plane along the section line B-B&#x2032;, as shown as an example for the rest position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, which substantially corresponds to a side view without the &#x201c;left side wall&#x201d; of the trigger unit housing <b>23</b>. The rest position <b>71</b>, the first trigger stage <b>72</b> (1st stage) and the second trigger stage <b>73</b> (2nd stage) are illustrated by dotted lines in the area of the trigger <b>264</b> and/or the trigger rear <b>263</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> show the rest position <b>71</b> of the trigger unit. The hammer <b>21</b> is tensioned, i.e. the hammer spring <b>211</b> attempts to rotate the hammer head counter-clockwise around the hammer axis <b>212</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and rests on the hammer spring supports <b>261</b>. The hammer <b>21</b> has at least one hammer cam <b>215</b> on its outer surface in the area of the hammer axis <b>212</b>, which is held in the rest position by a sear edge <b>44</b> of the sear <b>4</b>. The sear edge <b>44</b> is prestressed by the sear spring <b>41</b> against the hammer <b>21</b> by engaging in the sear spring supports <b>412</b>. As shown, the trigger lever <b>26</b> is preferably integrally designed and has a trigger <b>264</b> which projects substantially downward in the normal direction <b>93</b>. In addition, the trigger lever <b>26</b> has an opening in its center section and in the rear direction in the rear <b>263</b> to accommodate the sear <b>4</b> and the disconnector <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> it can be seen very clearly that the trigger <b>264</b> of the rest position <b>71</b> is prestressed by the hammer spring <b>211</b>, because the trigger lever <b>26</b> is pushed down. It can also be seen very clearly that the selector <b>6</b> is in the &#x201c;safe&#x201d; position, whereby the control shaft <b>61</b> in one section blocks the disconnector <b>3</b> on the back end <b>33</b> on the upper side and prevents a deflection upwards.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A comparative examination of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C and <b>5</b>D</figref> shows that a slight deflection to the rear is possible when a first force is applied to the trigger <b>264</b>, whereby the trigger rear <b>263</b> is rotated upwards until the trigger lever <b>26</b> comes into contact on its inner surface <b>25</b> with the underside of the sear <b>4</b> in the contact area of detail D. This slight idle travel is also referred to as pull and can be clearly perceived by the shooter through the retention force of the hammer spring <b>211</b> on the trigger <b>26</b>. This first trigger resistance is thus perceived between the rest position <b>71</b> and the end of the pull. The end of the pull is thus referred to as the first trigger stage <b>72</b>, which is also often referred to as the &#x201c;first stage&#x201d; in the Anglo-American linguistic area. The first trigger stage <b>72</b> of this two-stage trigger unit <b>2</b> can be perceived, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C and <b>5</b>D</figref>, for example. The design according to the present disclosure allows the same perception of the first trigger stage <b>72</b> even in the unsecured condition of the firearm, e.g. when the selector <b>6</b> is moved to the position &#x201c;single fire&#x201d; or &#x201c;continuous fire,&#x201d; as a comparison with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> shows.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C and <b>5</b>D</figref>, the rest position <b>71</b> of the trigger <b>264</b> and the trigger rear <b>263</b> is clearly marked in dotted lines. A further deflection of the trigger <b>264</b> to the rear via the first trigger stage <b>72</b> is prevented in the &#x201c;securing&#x201d; position by the rear trigger part <b>263</b> resting on both sides with its upper side against correspondingly designed sections of the control shaft <b>61</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Detail D from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is shown enlarged in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. This shows particularly advantageous embodiments, which e.g. consist of a sear protrusion <b>45</b> formed on the underside of the sear <b>4</b>. This allows a defined contact position between the inner surface <b>25</b> of the trigger level <b>26</b> and the underside of the sear <b>4</b>, whereby the friction can be minimized and the reaching of the first trigger stage <b>72</b> can be perceived better. A further embodiment is the incline of the inner surface <b>25</b> sloping backwards, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. This inclined surface can also have an advantageous influence on the force transmission between the trigger rear <b>263</b> and the sear protrusion <b>45</b> by being substantially at right angles&#x2014;provided that the incline is formed at the corresponding angle. This allows a very precise triggering of the trigger unit and the reaching of the first trigger stage <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">From the context and the description, it is easy to understand the fact that it is possible to provide different sears <b>4</b>, which have sear protrusions <b>45</b> which protrude to different extents. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, these sear protrusions <b>45</b> can be integrally formed on sear <b>4</b>. In this way a fine adjustment of the pull can be carried out by selecting the desired remaining distance between the inner surface <b>25</b> and the sear protrusion <b>45</b> of the respective sear <b>4</b>. Similarly, an adjustable adjustment device <b>451</b>, preferably designed as an adjustment screw (e.g. grub screw, worm screw) or also as a prismatic adjustment member <b>451</b>, can function to adjust the part of the sear protrusion <b>45</b> that protrudes from the underside.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> show two prismatic adjustment members <b>451</b> as examples, which can be inserted laterally into a recess of the sear <b>4</b> corresponding to the rough outer contour of the prism. Due to the differently rounded edges of the prismatic adjustment member <b>451</b>, a sear protrusion <b>45</b> projecting from the sear <b>4</b> on the underside to different extents can be formed by pushing it into the desired position, as a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> clearly shows. The adjustment members <b>451</b> are sufficiently wide in the transverse direction <b>92</b> to ensure a stable bearing in the corresponding recess of the sear <b>4</b>. The prismatic adjustment members <b>451</b> are listed as examples of three-sided prisms, whereby four-, five- or even multi-sided prisms are basically also conceivable.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A complementary, or also alternative, possibility for fine adjustment would be to provide different trigger levers <b>26</b> with correspondingly adapted inner surfaces <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the situation where the selector <b>6</b> is put in the &#x201c;single fire&#x201d; position and the control shaft <b>61</b> with the corresponding sections allows a slight further rotation of the trigger rear <b>263</b> about the trigger axis <b>262</b>. Due to the function of the trigger unit <b>2</b>, which has already been sufficiently described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> until the first trigger stage <b>72</b> is reached, a second, usually higher trigger resistance is perceived when the trigger <b>264</b> is deflected further back. This second trigger resistance results in part from the direct force transmission of the trigger lever <b>26</b> on the sear <b>4</b>, since after contacting the sear <b>4</b> with the inner surface <b>25</b> it must be rotated together about the trigger axis <b>262</b>. The hammer spring <b>211</b> still attempts to push the trigger <b>26</b> downwards. On the other hand, the sear edge <b>44</b> of the sear <b>4</b> must be disengaged from the trigger cam <b>215</b> of the hammer <b>21</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>, the rest position <b>71</b> and the first trigger stage <b>72</b> are therefore schematically indicated as dotted lines on the trigger <b>264</b> before the second trigger stage <b>73</b> is reached by releasing the sear edge <b>44</b> from the trigger cam <b>215</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the auto sear unit <b>5</b> is still in its rest position.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A further deflection of the trigger <b>264</b> to the rear, i.e. a further upward movement of the trigger rear <b>263</b>, is limited by the control shaft <b>61</b>. When the hammer <b>21</b> is released, it rotates around the hammer axis <b>212</b> (see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>) and accelerates to the firing pin within the central recess of the bolt carrier <b>11</b>. The disconnector <b>3</b> attempts to rotate upwards around the disconnector axis <b>35</b> by prestressing the disconnector spring <b>34</b>, which is made possible at least within certain limits by the position of the selector <b>6</b>, until the back end <b>33</b> contacts the corresponding section of the control shaft <b>61</b> at the top. Of course, this only applies in the case of the pulled trigger <b>264</b>&#x2014;a release of the trigger would require a renewed overcoming of the first trigger resistance, etc.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Since the lock opens after the shot is fired and the bolt carrier <b>11</b> moves backwards, the hammer <b>21</b> rotates backwards again and is caught in this position with its hammer hook <b>213</b> by the hook <b>31</b> of the disconnector <b>3</b>. The bolt carrier <b>11</b> is moved forward again by a closing spring, whereby a new cartridge is fed from the magazine into the cartridge chamber of the barrel and the locking head is locked with the barrel.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The hammer <b>21</b> is thus caught by the disconnector <b>3</b> after each shot in &#x201c;single fire.&#x201d; Before firing another shot, the prestressing of the disconnector <b>3</b> must first release the trigger <b>264</b> forward until the sear edge <b>44</b> is again positioned in front of the trigger cam <b>215</b>. If the trigger <b>264</b> continues to move forward, the hook <b>31</b> is disengaged with the hammer hook <b>213</b>. Thus again, at least the second trigger resistance must be overcome to reach the second trigger stage <b>73</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Another situation is described by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in which the position &#x201c;continuous fire&#x201d; of the selector <b>6</b> is set. Due to the (in most cases) slide-like design of the section of the control shaft <b>61</b> corresponding to the back end <b>33</b>, in this position the disconnector <b>3</b> is pressed down after the release of the hammer <b>21</b>. With the previously described shot firing in &#x201c;single firing mode&#x201d; the disconnector <b>3</b> can engage with the hammer <b>21</b>, while with &#x201c;continuous firing&#x201d; an engagement of the hook <b>31</b> in the hammer hook <b>213</b> is suppressed. In order to prevent the hammer <b>21</b> from scratching the underside when the bolt carrier piece <b>11</b> moves forward in the case of &#x201c;continuous fire,&#x201d; the auto sear unit <b>5</b> comes into play in a manner known to persons skilled in the art. In the &#x201c;continuous fire&#x201d; position, the prestressing of the auto spring <b>52</b> causes the auto sear <b>51</b> to engage briefly with the auto sear hook <b>214</b> of the hammer <b>21</b> during the return movement of the bolt carrier <b>11</b>. When the bolt carrier <b>11</b> is advanced, the hammer <b>21</b> is held until the locking process is completed and the bolt carrier <b>11</b> strikes the bottom of the auto sear <b>51</b>, whereby the hammer <b>21</b> is automatically released again.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A significant advantage of the trigger unit of the present disclosure is considered to be the possibility of moving the selector <b>6</b> into the &#x201c;secure&#x201d; position when the hammer <b>21</b> is in the &#x201c;struck&#x201d; position and therefore the trigger unit <b>2</b> is not stressed. This situation is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the hammer <b>21</b> is in the striking position, as can be the case with a fire retardant, i.e. a non-ignited cartridge. The selector <b>6</b> is shown in the &#x201c;continuous firing position,&#x201d; whereby the situation is analogous to the &#x201c;single firing position.&#x201d; Due to the design of the trigger unit <b>2</b> according to the present disclosure, i.e. due to the separation of the sear <b>4</b> and trigger lever <b>26</b>, despite the use of a common trigger lever axis <b>262</b> or sear axis <b>43</b>, the trigger rear <b>263</b> can be moved downwards into the &#x201c;securing&#x201d; position when the selector <b>6</b> is adjusted, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>. In this way the sear <b>4</b> can be applied from below to the hammer <b>21</b> under prestress without obstructing the hammer <b>21</b> during a new loading process and immediately engaging again in the hammer cam <b>215</b>. The auto sear unit <b>5</b> can also be brought back into the rest position unaffected by the position of the struck hammer <b>21</b> by adjusting the selector <b>6</b>. This would be impossible with a one-piece trigger lever, which would engage the hammer <b>21</b> directly &#x201c;forward.&#x201d; The situation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> thus shows the selector <b>6</b> in the &#x201c;safe&#x201d; position, whereby the trigger <b>264</b> is deflected at least until reaching the second trigger stage <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Another embodiment of the present disclosure concerns the formation of the sear edge <b>44</b>, which has a special shape in the contact area with the hammer cam <b>215</b>. An enlarged, albeit schematic, representation of the detail E from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> shows the sear edge <b>44</b>, which preferably has an inclined and/or a convex shape on the surface facing the hammer cam <b>215</b>. A convex curvature of this surface makes it possible for the substantially arcuate movement of the sear <b>4</b> about the trigger axis <b>262</b>, from the time the first release stage <b>71</b> is reached, to cause the reduction in the contact surface between the sear edge <b>44</b> and the trigger cam <b>215</b> to lead to a homogeneous increase in the second trigger resistance. The resulting increase in the surface pressure thus increases substantially linearly with the remaining contact surface, whereas an inhomogeneous increase in the trigger resistance would occur with a sear edge <b>44</b> with a right-angled design.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It may be advantageous in certain cases if, as shown, the sear edge <b>44</b> has a convex curvature with a radius r <b>441</b>. Measured from the trigger axis <b>262</b> or sear axis <b>43</b> to the vertex of the curvature, the distance is d <b>442</b>. This radius r is about the distance d, preferably smaller than the normal distance d <b>442</b> between the vertex of the convex curvature (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>n</i></figref>) and the sear axis <b>43</b>. In addition, the vertex of smaller radii in the direction of rotation around the sear axis <b>43</b> can also be off-center on the sear edge <b>44</b>. These correlations can be easily optimized by the person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the surface of the sear edge (<b>44</b>) is convex in regard to an axis parallel to sear axis <b>43</b>. Its radius r <b>441</b>, in relation to the distance d, <b>442</b>, (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) between its apex and the trigger axis <b>262</b> or sear axis <b>43</b> (which is the same) lies in the range 0.8 d&#x3c;r&#x3c;1.2 d, preferably 0.85 d&#x3c;r&#x3c;1.1 d.
