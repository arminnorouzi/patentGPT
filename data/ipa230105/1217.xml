Cochlear implants may include components that are worn externally by the patient and components that are implanted internally in the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cochlear implants may stimulate the cochlear tissue using electrical signals. Accuracy and precision of the electrical signals used to stimulate the cochlear nerve may be desired to ensure accurate and precise representations of sound. A lack of accuracy and precision of the electrical signals may not only lead to a lack of accuracy and precision of the representations of sound, but may also lead to undesired and unexpected charge accumulation within the tissue. This can cause damage to the cochlear tissue and/or implanted components. Cochlear implants may be calibrated before they are implanted internally in the patient, but may lose accuracy and precision after they have been implanted.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some aspects of the disclosure are generally directed toward cochlear implant systems.

The middle ear sensor <b>110</b> can be configured to detect incoming sound waves, for example, using the ear structure of a patient. The signal processor <b>120</b> can be configured to receive a signal from the middle ear sensor <b>110</b> and produce an output signal based thereon. For example, the signal processor <b>120</b> can be programmed with instructions to output a certain signal based on a received signal. In some embodiments, the output of the signal processor <b>120</b> can be calculated using an equation based on received input signals. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the output of the signal processor <b>120</b> can be based on a lookup table or other programmed (e.g., in memory) correspondence between the input signal from the middle ear sensor <b>110</b> and the output signal. While not necessarily based explicitly on a function, the relationship between the input to the signal processor <b>120</b> (e.g., from the middle ear sensor <b>110</b>) and the output of the signal processor <b>120</b> is referred to as the transfer function of the signal processor <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In various examples, the signal processor <b>120</b> can comprise any variety of components, for example, digital and/or analog processing components.

The cochlear electrode <b>116</b> is in electrical communication with an electrical stimulator <b>130</b>, which can be configured to provide electrical signals to the cochlear electrode <b>116</b> in response to input signals received by the electrical stimulator <b>130</b>. In some examples, the cochlear electrode <b>116</b> is fixedly attached to the electrical stimulator <b>130</b>. In other examples, the cochlear electrode <b>116</b> is removably attached to the electrical stimulator <b>130</b>. As shown, the electrical stimulator <b>130</b> is in communication with the signal processor <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the electrical stimulator <b>130</b> provides electrical signals to the cochlear electrode <b>116</b> based on output signals from the signal processor <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In various embodiments, the cochlear electrode <b>116</b> can include any number of contact electrodes in electrical contact with different parts of the cochlear tissue.

Some such examples are described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013/0018216, which is incorporated by reference. In other examples, processor <b>220</b> is configured to receive power and/or data from other sources, such as an implantable battery and/or communication module as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Such battery and/or communication module can be implanted, for example, into the pectoral region of the patient in order to provide adequate room for larger equipment (e.g., a relatively large battery) for prolonged operation (e.g., longer battery life). Additionally, in the event a battery needs eventual replacement, a replacement procedure in the patient's pectoral region can be performed several times without certain vascularization issues that can arise near the location of the cochlear implant. For example, in some cases, repeated procedures (e.g., battery replacement) near the cochlear implant can result in a decreased ability for the skin in the region to heal after a procedure. Placing a replaceable component such as a battery in the pectoral region can facilitate replacement procedures with reduced risk for such issues.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates embodiments of an exemplary middle ear sensor for use in conjunction with anatomical features of a patient.

The battery charger <b>102</b> can wirelessly charge the battery in the implantable battery and/or communication module <b>140</b> when brought into proximity with the implantable battery and/or communication module <b>140</b> in the pectoral region of the patient. Such charging can be accomplished, for example, using inductive charging. The programmer <b>100</b> can be configured to wirelessly communicate with the implantable battery and/or communication module <b>140</b> via any appropriate wireless communication technology, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and the like. In some examples, the programmer <b>100</b> can be used to update the system firmware and/or software. In an exemplary operation, the programmer <b>100</b> can be used to communicate an updated signal processor <b>120</b> transfer function to the implantable battery and/or communication module <b>140</b>.

In some embodiments, lead <b>170</b> can provide communication between the signal processor <b>120</b> and the middle ear sensor <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, lead <b>170</b> can include a plurality of isolated conductors providing a plurality of communication channels between the middle ear sensor <b>110</b> and the signal processor <b>120</b>. The lead <b>170</b> can include a coating such as an electrically insulating sheath to minimize any conduction of electrical signals to the body of the patient. In various embodiments, one or more communication leads can be detachable such that communication between two components can be disconnected in order to electrically and/or mechanically separate such components. For instance, in some embodiments, lead <b>170</b> includes a detachable connector <b>171</b>. Detachable connector <b>171</b> can facilitate decoupling of the signal processor <b>120</b> and middle ear sensor <b>110</b>. Example detachable connectors are described in PCT patent application No. PCT/US20/19166, which is incorporated by reference. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some embodiments, lead <b>170</b> can include a first lead extending from the middle ear sensor <b>110</b> having one of a male or a female connector and a second lead extending from the signal processor <b>120</b> having the other of the male or female connector. The first and second leads can be connected at detachable connector <b>171</b> in order to facilitate communication between the middle ear sensor <b>110</b> and the signal processor <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In other examples, a part of the detachable connector <b>171</b> can be integrated into one of the middle ear sensor <b>110</b> and the signal processor <b>120</b>. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, the signal processor <b>120</b> can include a female connector integrated into a housing of the signal processor <b>120</b>. Lead <b>170</b> can extend fully from the middle ear sensor <b>110</b> and terminate at a corresponding male connector for inserting into the female connector of the signal processor <b>120</b>. In still further embodiments, a lead (e.g., <b>170</b>) can include connectors on each end configured to detachably connect with connectors integrated into each of the components in communication. For example, lead <b>170</b> can include two male connectors, two female connectors, or one male and one female connector for detachably connecting with corresponding connectors integral to the middle ear sensor <b>110</b> and the signal processor <b>120</b>. Thus, lead <b>170</b> may include two or more detachable connectors.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Similar communication configurations can be established for detachable connector <b>181</b> of lead <b>180</b> facilitating communication between the signal processor <b>120</b> and the stimulator <b>130</b> and for detachable connector <b>191</b> of lead <b>190</b> facilitating communication between the signal processor <b>120</b> and the implantable battery and/or communication module <b>140</b>. Leads (<b>170</b>, <b>180</b>, <b>190</b>) can include pairs of leads having corresponding connectors extending from each piece of communicating equipment, or connectors can be built in to any one or more communicating components.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In such configurations, each of the electrical stimulator <b>130</b>, signal processor <b>120</b>, middle ear sensor <b>110</b>, and battery and/or communication module can each be enclosed in a housing, such as a hermetically sealed housing comprising biocompatible materials. Such components can include feedthroughs providing communication to internal components enclosed in the housing. Feedthroughs can provide electrical communication to the component via leads extending from the housing and/or connectors integrated into the components.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a module configuration such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, various components can be accessed (e.g., for upgrades, repair, replacement, etc.) individually from other components. For example, as signal processor <b>120</b> technology improves (e.g., improvements in size, processing speed, power consumption, etc.), the signal processor <b>120</b> implanted as part of the system can be removed and replaced independently of other components. In an exemplary procedure, an implanted signal processor <b>120</b> can be disconnected from the electrical stimulator <b>130</b> by disconnecting detachable connector <b>181</b>, from the middle ear sensor <b>110</b> by disconnecting detachable connector <b>171</b>, and from the implantable battery and/or communication module <b>140</b> by disconnecting detachable connector <b>191</b>. Thus, the signal processor <b>120</b> can be removed from the patient while other components such as the electrical stimulator <b>130</b>, cochlear electrode <b>116</b>, middle ear sensor <b>110</b>, and battery and/or communication module can remain in place in the patient.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">After the old signal processor is removed, a new signal processor can be connected to the electrical stimulator <b>130</b>, middle ear sensor <b>110</b>, and implantable battery and/or communication module <b>140</b> via detachable connectors <b>181</b>, <b>171</b>, and <b>191</b>, respectively. Thus, the signal processor (e.g., <b>120</b>) can be replaced, repaired, upgraded, or any combination thereof, without affecting the other system components. This can reduce, among other things, the risk, complexity, duration, and recovery time of such a procedure. In particular, the cochlear electrode <b>116</b> can be left in place in the patient's cochlea while other system components can be adjusted, reducing trauma to the patient's cochlear tissue.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Such modularity of system components can be particularly advantageous when replacing a signal processor <b>120</b>, such as described above. Processor technology continues to improve and will likely continue to markedly improve in the future, making the signal processor <b>120</b> a likely candidate for significant upgrades and/or replacement during the patient's lifetime. Additionally, in embodiments such as the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the signal processor <b>120</b> communicates with many system components. For example, as shown, the signal processor <b>120</b> is in communication with each of the electrical stimulator <b>130</b>, the middle ear sensor <b>110</b>, and the implantable battery and/or communication module <b>140</b>. Detachably connecting such components with the signal processor <b>120</b> (e.g., via detachable connectors <b>181</b>, <b>171</b>, and <b>191</b>) enables replacement of the signal processor <b>120</b> without disturbing any other components. Thus, in the event of an available signal processor <b>120</b> upgrade and/or a failure of the signal processor <b>120</b>, the signal processor <b>120</b> can be disconnected from other system components and removed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">While many advantages exist for a replaceable signal processor <b>120</b>, the modularity of other system components can be similarly advantageous, for example, for upgrading any system component. Similarly, if a system component (e.g., the middle ear sensor <b>110</b>) should fail, the component can be disconnected from the rest of the system (e.g., via detachable connector <b>171</b>) and replaced without disturbing the remaining system components. In another example, even a rechargeable battery included in the implantable battery and/or communication module <b>140</b> may eventually wear out and need replacement. The implantable battery and/or communication module <b>140</b> can be replaced or accessed (e.g., for replacing the battery) without disturbing other system components. Further, as discussed elsewhere herein, when the implantable battery and/or communication module <b>140</b> is implanted in the pectoral region of the patient, such as in the illustrated example, such a procedure can leave the patient's head untouched, eliminating unnecessarily frequent access beneath the skin.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">While various components are described herein as being detachable, in various embodiments, one or more components configured to communicate with one another can be integrated into a single housing. For example, in some embodiments, signal processor <b>120</b> can be integrally formed with the stimulator <b>130</b> and cochlear electrode <b>116</b>. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, processing and stimulation circuitry of a signal processor <b>120</b> and stimulator <b>130</b> can be integrally formed as a single unit in a housing coupled to a cochlear electrode. Cochlear electrode and the signal processor/stimulator can be implanted during an initial procedure and operate as a single unit.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, while the integral signal processor/stimulator/cochlear electrode component does not get removed from a patient due to potential damage to the cochlear tissue into which the cochlear electrode is implanted, system upgrades are still possible. For example, in some embodiments, a modular signal processor may be implanted alongside the integral signal processor/stimulator component and communicate therewith. In some such examples, the integral signal processor may include a built-in bypass to allow a later-implanted signal processor to interface directly with the stimulator. Additionally or alternatively, the modular signal processor can communicate with the integral signal processor, which may be programmed with a unity transfer function. Thus, in some such embodiments, signals from the modular signal processor may be essentially passed through the integral signal processor unchanged so that the modular signal processor effectively controls action of the integral stimulator. Thus, in various embodiments, hardware and/or software solutions exist for upgrading an integrally attached signal processor that may be difficult or dangerous to remove.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">While often described herein as using an electrical stimulator to stimulate the patient's cochlear tissue via a cochlear electrode, in some examples, the system can additionally or alternatively include an acoustic stimulator. An acoustic stimulator can include, for example, a transducer (e.g., a piezoelectric transducer) configured to provide mechanical stimulation to the patient's ear structure. In an exemplary embodiment, the acoustic stimulator can be configured to stimulate one or more portions of the patient's ossicular chain via amplified vibrations. Acoustic stimulators can include any appropriate acoustic stimulators, such as those found in the ESTEEM&#x2122; implant (Envoy Medical Corp., St. Paul, Minn.) or as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,729,366, 4,850,962, and 7,524,278, and U.S. Patent Publication No. 20100042183, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary implantable system including an acoustic stimulator. The acoustic stimulator can be implanted proximate the patient's ossicular chain and can be in communication with a signal processor via lead <b>194</b> and detachable connector <b>195</b>. The signal processor can behave as described elsewhere herein and can be configured to cause acoustic stimulation of the ossicular chain via the acoustic stimulator in in response to input signals from the middle ear sensor according to a transfer function of the signal processor.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The acoustic stimulator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> can be used similarly to the electrical stimulator as described elsewhere herein. For instance, an acoustic stimulator can be mechanically coupled to a patient's ossicular chain upon implanting the system and coupled to the signal processor via lead <b>194</b> and detachable connector <b>195</b>. Similarly to systems described elsewhere herein with respect to the electrical stimulator, if the signal processor requires replacement or repair, the signal processor can be disconnected from the acoustic stimulator (via detachable connector <b>195</b>) so that the signal processor can be removed without disturbing the acoustic stimulator.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In general, systems incorporating an acoustic stimulator such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> can operate in the same way as systems described elsewhere herein employing an electrical stimulator and cochlear electrode only substituting electrical stimulation for acoustic stimulation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Some systems can include a hybrid system comprising both an electrical stimulator and an acoustic stimulator in communication with the signal processor. In some such examples, the signal processor can be configured to stimulate electrically and/or acoustically according to the transfer function of the signal processor. In some examples, the type of stimulation used can depend on the input signal received by the signal processor. For instance, in an exemplary embodiment, the frequency content of the input signal to the signal processor can dictate the type of stimulation. In some cases, frequencies below a threshold frequency could be represented using one of electrical and acoustic stimulation while frequencies above the threshold frequency could be represented using the other of electrical and acoustic stimulation. Such a threshold frequency could be adjustable based on the hearing profile of the patient. Using a limited range of frequencies can reduce the number of frequency domains, and thus the number of contact electrodes, on the cochlear electrode. In other examples, rather than a single threshold frequency defining which frequencies are stimulated electrically and acoustically, various frequencies can be stimulated both electrically and acoustically. In some such examples, the relative amount of electrical and acoustic stimulation can be frequency-dependent. As described elsewhere herein, the signal processor transfer function can be updated to meet the needs of the patient, including the electrical and acoustic stimulation profiles.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Additionally or alternatively, while many examples show a middle ear sensor being in communication with an implanted signal processor, in various embodiments, one or more additional or alternative input sources can be included. For instance, in some embodiments, a microphone can be implanted under a user's skin and can be placed in communication with the signal processor (e.g., via a detachable connector such as <b>171</b>). The signal processor can receive input signals from the implanted microphone and provide signals to the stimulator based on the received input signal and the signal processor transfer function. Additionally or alternatively, systems can include a middle ear sensor as an input source, wherein the middle ear sensor is configured to detect stimuli (e.g., pressure signals) from the wearer's inner ear (e.g., within the cochlear tissue).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, in some examples, a system can include a shut-off controller <b>104</b>, which can be configured to wirelessly stop an electrical stimulator <b>130</b> from stimulating the patient's cochlear tissue and/or an acoustic stimulator <b>150</b> from stimulating the patient's ossicular chain. For example, if the system is malfunctioning or an uncomfortably loud input sound causes an undesirable level of stimulation, the user may use the shut-off controller <b>104</b> to cease stimulation from the stimulator <b>130</b>. The shut-off controller <b>104</b> can be embodied in a variety of ways. For example, in some embodiments, the shut-off controller <b>104</b> can be integrated into other external components, such as the programmer <b>100</b>. In some such examples, the programmer <b>100</b> includes a user interface by which a user can select an emergency shut-off feature to cease stimulation. Additionally or alternatively, the shut-off controller <b>104</b> can be embodied as a separate component. This can be useful in situations in which the patient may not have immediate access to the programmer <b>100</b>. For example, the shut-off controller <b>104</b> can be implemented as a wearable component that the patient can wear at all or most times, such as a ring, bracelet, necklace, or the like.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The shut-off controller <b>104</b> can communicate with the system in order to stop stimulation in a variety of ways. In some examples, the shut-off controller <b>104</b> comprises a magnet that is detectable by a sensor (e.g., a Hall-Effect sensor) implanted in the patient, such as in the processor and/or the implantable battery and/or communication module <b>140</b>. In some such embodiments, when the magnet is brought sufficiently close to the sensor, the system can stop stimulation of the cochlear tissue or ossicular chain.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">After the shut-off controller <b>104</b> is used to disable stimulation, stimulation can be re-enabled in one or more of a variety of ways. For example, in some embodiments, stimulation is re-enabled after a predetermined amount of time after it had been disabled. In other examples, the shut-off controller <b>104</b> can be used to re-enable stimulation. In some such examples, the patient brings the shut-off controller <b>104</b> within a first distance of a sensor (e.g., a magnetic sensor) to disable stimulation, and then removes the shut-off controller <b>104</b>. Subsequently, once the patient brings the shut-off controller <b>104</b> within a second distance of the sensor, stimulation can be re-enabled. In various embodiments, the first distance can be less than the second distance, equal to the second distance, or greater than the second distance. In still further embodiments, another device such as a separate turn-on controller (not shown) or the programmer <b>100</b> can be used to re-enable stimulation. Any combination of such re-enabling of stimulation can be used, such as alternatively using either the programmer <b>100</b> or the shut-off controller <b>104</b> to enable stimulation or combining a minimum &#x201c;off&#x201d; time before any other methods can be used to re-enable stimulation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, rather than entirely disable stimulation, other actions can be taken, such as reducing the magnitude of stimulation. For example, in some embodiments, the shut-off sensor can be used to reduce the signal output by a predetermined amount (e.g., absolute amount, percentage, etc.). In other examples, the shut-off sensor can affect the transfer function of the signal processor to reduce the magnitude of stimulation in a customized way, such as according to frequency or other parameter of an input signal (e.g., from the middle ear sensor).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some examples, implantable battery and/or communication module can be used to provide power and/or data (e.g., processing instructions) to other system components via lead <b>190</b>. Different challenges exist for communicating electrical signals through a patient's body. For example, safety standards can limit the amount of current that can safely flow through a patient's body (particularly DC current). Additionally, the patient's body can act as an undesired signal path from component to component (e.g., via contact with the housing or &#x201c;can&#x201d; of each component).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a high-level electrical schematic showing communication between the implantable battery and/or communication module and the signal processor. In the illustrated embodiment, the implantable battery and/or communication module includes circuitry in communication with circuitry in the signal processor. Communication between the circuitry in the implantable battery and/or communication module and the signal processor can be facilitated by a lead (<b>190</b>), represented by the lead transfer function. The lead transfer function can include, for example, parasitic resistances and capacitances between the leads connecting the implantable battery and/or communication module and the signal processor and the patient's body and/or between two or more conductors that make up the lead (e.g., <b>191</b>). Signals communicated from the circuitry of the implantable battery and/or communication module to the circuitry in the signal processor can include electrical power provided to operate and/or stimulate system components (e.g., the middle ear sensor, signal processor, electrical and/or acoustic stimulator, and/or cochlear electrode) and/or data (e.g., processing data regarding the transfer function of the signal processor).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Various systems and methods can be employed provide communication between system components. Some examples of possible communication techniques are described in PCT patent application No. PCT/US20/19166, which is incorporated by reference. In some examples, data can be communicated to the implantable battery and/or communication module from an external component, such as a programmer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In an exemplary process, a programmer, such as a clinician's computer, can be used to communicate with a patient's fully implanted system via the implantable battery and/or communication module, which can communicate information to other system components, such as via lead <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">During such processes, a clinician can communicate with the signal processor, and, in some cases, with other components via the signal processor. For example, the clinician can cause the signal processor to actuate an electrical and/or an acoustic stimulator in various ways, such as using various electrical stimulation parameters, combinations of active contact electrodes, various acoustic stimulation parameters, and various combinations thereof. Varying the stimulation parameters in real time can allow the clinician and patient to determine effectiveness of different stimulation techniques for the individual patient. Similarly, the clinician can communicate with the signal processor to update transfer function. For example, the clinician can repeatedly update the transfer function signal processor while testing the efficacy of each one on the individual patient. In some examples, combinations of stimulation parameters and signal processor transfer functions can be tested for customized system behavior for the individual patient.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, various internal properties of the system may be tested. For instance, various impedance values, such as a sensor impedance or a stimulator impedance can be tested such as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2015/0256945, entitled TRANSDUCER IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENT FOR HEARING AID, which is assigned to the assignee of the instant application, the relevant portions of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As discussed elsewhere herein, the body of the patient provides an electrical path between system components, such as the &#x201c;can&#x201d; of the implantable battery and/or communication module and the &#x201c;can&#x201d; of the signal processor. This path is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> by the flow path through R<sub>Body</sub>. Thus, the patient's body can provide undesirable signal paths which can negatively impact communication between components. To address this, in some embodiments, operating circuitry in each component can be substantially isolated from the component &#x201c;can&#x201d; and thus the patient's body. For example, as shown, resistance R<sub>Can </sub>is positioned between the circuitry and the &#x201c;can&#x201d; of both the implantable battery and/or communication module and the signal processor.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">While being shown as R<sub>Can </sub>in each of the implantable battery and/or communication module and the signal processor, it will be appreciated that the actual value of the resistance between the circuitry and respective &#x201c;can&#x201d; of different elements is not necessarily equal. Additionally, Rcan need not include purely a resistance, but can include other components, such as one or more capacitors, inductors, and the like. That is, Rcan can represent an insulating circuit including any variety of components that act to increase the impedance between circuitry within a component and the &#x201c;can&#x201d; of the component. Thus, R<sub>Can </sub>can represent an impedance between the operating circuitry of a component and the respective &#x201c;can&#x201d; and the patient's tissue. Isolating the circuitry from the &#x201c;can&#x201d; and the patient's body acts to similarly isolate the circuitry from the &#x201c;can&#x201d; of other components, allowing each component to operate with reference to a substantially isolated component ground. This can eliminate undesired communication and interference between system components and/or between system components and the patient's body.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, as described elsewhere herein, in some examples, an electrical stimulator can provide an electrical stimulus to one or more contact electrodes on a cochlear electrode implanted in a patient's cochlear tissue. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrates an exemplary schematic diagram illustrating a cochlear electrode having a plurality of contact electrodes and fixedly or detachably connected to an electrical stimulator. As shown, the cochlear electrode <b>500</b> has four contact electrodes <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, and <b>508</b>, though it will be appreciated that any number of contact electrodes is possible. As described elsewhere herein, the electrical stimulator can provide electrical signals to one or more such contact electrodes in response to an output from the signal processor according to the transfer function thereof and a received input signal.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Because each contact electrode <b>502</b>-<b>1008</b> is in contact with the patient's cochlear tissue, each is separated from the &#x201c;can&#x201d; of the electrical stimulator (as well as the &#x201c;cans&#x201d; of other system components) via the impedance of the patient's tissue, shown as R<sub>Body</sub>. Thus, if the circuitry within various system components did not have sufficiently high impedance (e.g., Rcan) to the component &#x201c;can&#x201d;, electrical signals may stimulate undesired regions of the patient's cochlear tissue. For instance, stimulation intended for a particular contact electrode (e.g., <b>502</b>) may lead to undesired stimulation of other contact electrodes (e.g., <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>), reducing the overall efficacy of the system. Minimizing the conductive paths between system components (e.g., to the contact electrodes of a cochlear electrode) due to the patient's body, such as by incorporating impedances between component circuitry and the corresponding &#x201c;can&#x201d; via R<sub>Can</sub>, can therefore improve the ability to apply an electrical stimulus to only a desired portion of the patient's body.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">It will be appreciated that the term R<sub>Body </sub>is used herein to generally represent the resistance and/or impedance of the patient's tissue between various components and does not refer to a specific value.

Return electrode <b>630</b> can comprise a conductive material suitable for contact with a wearer's tissue, such as platinum. In the illustrated example, the return electrode <b>630</b> wraps around to both sides of the housing of the processor/stimulator <b>620</b> so that the return electrode <b>630</b> is coupled to the outer surface of the housing on the first side <b>619</b> and the second side <b>621</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">This can facilitate implanting onto either side of a wearer's anatomy, since in some cases, only one side of the processor/stimulator electrically contacts conductive tissue of the wearer while the other side contacts, for instance, the skull of the wearer, and does not easily provide the return path (e.g., <b>632</b>). Thus, a single processor/stimulator design can be implanted in either side of a wearer's anatomy while providing an adequate return path via a return electrode <b>630</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In various examples, the return electrode <b>630</b> can extend around a perimeter edge of the processor/stimulator <b>620</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>.

Additionally, while shown as being embedded in the housing of the processor/stimulator <b>620</b>, in some examples, return electrode <b>630</b> can protrude outwardly from the housing. Return electrode <b>630</b> can generally be any of a variety of shapes and sizes while including an electrical contact section on opposing sides of the housing to provide usability on either side of a wearer's anatomy. In other embodiments, return electrode can be positioned only one side of the housing for a customized right-side or left-side implementation.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As described elsewhere herein, in various embodiments, the processor generally receives an input signal, processes the signal, and generates a stimulation signal, which can be applied via an integrated stimulator (e.g., via a processor/stimulator such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>) or a separate stimulator in communication with the processor (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>4</b></figref>). In some such embodiments, the input signal received via the signal processor is generated by an implantable sensor, such as a middle ear sensor (e.g., as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">However, such sensors often measure or otherwise receive some stimulus that is converted into an output that is read and processed by the signal processor. For example, some middle ear sensors may produce a different output signal for a given stimulus depending on a variety of factors, such as variability in a wearer's inner-ear anatomy and motion. Thus, the output of a sensor for a given input may be not predictable while designing a system, especially across a range of frequencies and/or magnitudes.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">It can be desirable to ensure the applied stimulation signal is a correct interpretation of a prescribed signal for accuracy and safety reasons. For example, for a given prescribed current to be applied via an electrode, the actual applied current may depart from the prescribed current. This can be due to various factors, such as electronics imprecisely calibrated, the behavior of electronics over time, and variability driven mismatches between various electronic components. However, it can be desirable to ensure electrical pulses generated by the cochlear implant system are charge-balanced. Charge-balanced means that the amount of charge sourced to the wearer's tissue is the same amount of charge sunk as delivered from the tissue over time. For example, to balance charge applied to patient tissue, a first current (e.g., in the form of pulses) put into the tissue via contact electrodes for an amount of time would be the same magnitude as a second current taken out of the tissue via the contact electrodes for the same amount of time. Discrepancies between a prescribed current that the system believes is being sourced/sunk and the actual current being sourced/sunk can result in unexpected and undetected charge accumulation over time. Such charge accumulation can cause damage to the wearer's tissue and/or the implanted electronics and/or the deterioration of the interface between the electrode and the tissue and/or fluid.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a high-level electrical schematic showing communications between a source element <b>710</b>, a switch <b>715</b>, a controller <b>700</b>, a testing circuit <b>720</b>, and a contact electrode <b>730</b>.

In various embodiments, source element <b>710</b> can source or sink current, for example, as prescribed by controller <b>700</b>, which can provide a signal to the source element <b>710</b> to control an amount of current sourced or sunk thereby. Unless specified otherwise, descriptions of embodiments herein in which a source element (e.g., <b>710</b>) provides a current (e.g., to contact electrode <b>730</b>) can similarly describe times or embodiments in which a source element sinks current.

During example stimulation, current from the source element <b>710</b> can flow through contract electrode <b>730</b> via switch <b>715</b>, through a wearer's tissue, and return to a return electrode (e.g., return electrode <b>630</b> via path <b>632</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As described elsewhere herein, the source element <b>710</b> can be included as part of a stimulator (e.g. <b>130</b> and <b>150</b>). In some embodiments, the source element <b>710</b> comprises a digital to analog converter (DAC) which can convert digital signals to analog signals. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, the source element <b>710</b> is in communication with controller <b>700</b>. In some examples, controller <b>700</b> is part of a signal processor (e.g. <b>120</b>), which can send a digital stimulation signal to the source element <b>710</b>. In some such examples, the DAC of the source element <b>710</b> can convert the digital signal to an analog signal and provide the converted signal to the contact electrode <b>730</b> or to another element that outputs a current to the contact electrode <b>730</b> based on the received analog signal from the DAC. For instance, in some embodiments, such a DAC can be configured to output an analog signal (e.g., an analog voltage) to one or more current source or sink components in order to source or sink current via the contact electrode based on the received digital signal from the controller <b>700</b>. In general, the digital stimulation signal sent by the signal processor to the source element <b>710</b> can comprise an amount of current to be delivered to the contact electrode, and can control an amount of current provided therefrom over time.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The DAC of the source element <b>710</b>, can convert the digital stimulation signal into an analog signal using a number of bits. In some embodiments, the least significant bits (LSB's) of the digital signal can be considered trim bits which can be used to fine-tune the amount of current delivered to the contact electrode. In various embodiments any number of bits can be used to provide a stimulation signal. For example, in some embodiments, the stimulation signal provided to the DAC of the source element <b>710</b> can include at least six bits of precision. In some such embodiments, the DAC can have seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, or more bits of precision. By using more bits, the source element <b>710</b> can have a higher output precision of the digital input signal. For instance, in some examples, using by using 8 bits for the DAC (source element <b>710</b>), up to 256 distinct levels of current to the contact electrode <b>730</b> can be output or otherwise initiated by the DAC via the analog signal provided by the DAC.

Further, in some embodiments, the source element <b>710</b> can source (e.g. deliver) more current to the contact electrode <b>730</b> than it sinks (e.g. receives) from the contact electrode. An imbalance in current sourced and sunk by source element <b>710</b> to the contact electrode can lead to accumulated electrical charge in the wearer's tissue and/or across the electrode interface, which can cause damage to the wearer (e.g., including damage to the cochlear tissue) and/or damage to the electrode(s) implanted therein.

PMOS and NMOS devices do not behave the same way over time and may not track each other. The disparity in behavior can result in inaccuracies in the prescribed current from source element <b>710</b>. In such cases, even when the prescribed amount of current to be sourced/sunk should in theory result in a net-zero charge accumulation, inaccurate current application can lead to the total charge provided to the contact electrode <b>730</b> being different than desired and can lead to undesired charge accumulation over time.

By adjusting the amount of current output by the source element <b>710</b> such that the measured current matches the prescribed current, the accuracy of the signal output by source element <b>710</b> can be increased. In some embodiments, a controller <b>700</b> adjusts the output current of the source element <b>710</b> based on the determined (e.g. calculated) amount of electrical current which flows through the precision load.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Adjusting (e.g. calibrating) the output current of the source element <b>710</b> can be repeated any number of times. For example, in some embodiments, after adjusting the output of the source element <b>710</b> based on a measured current, the same source element can be tested again using the same prescribed current to confirm that the updated operation is accurate, or to further refine the operation of the source element <b>710</b>. Additionally or alternatively, in some examples, the adjustment of the output current of the source element <b>710</b> is done using a variety of prescribed current values.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some examples, the controller can instruct the source element <b>710</b> to output a first prescribed current. The controller <b>700</b> can then compare the first prescribed current with the corresponding measured current flowing through the precision impedance of the testing circuit <b>720</b>. The controller can also instruct the source element <b>710</b> to output a second prescribed current. The controller <b>700</b> can then compare the second prescribed current with the corresponding measured current flowing through the precision impedance of the testing circuit <b>720</b>. From these two comparisons, a line of best fit (e.g. calibration curve) can be used to adjust the output current of the source element accordingly. In some examples, more than two prescribed current values can be used to create the line of best fit for a source element. In some embodiments, a range of output currents which encompasses the entire range of the DAC of the source element can be used to create the line of best fit. By using a line of best fit for calibrating the output current of the source element, the accuracy of the current output from the source element relative to the prescribed current across a range of values can be increased.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">After the adjustment of the output current of source element <b>710</b> using testing circuit <b>720</b> has been completed, the switch <b>715</b> can be switched to connect source element <b>710</b> to contact electrode <b>730</b>. Thus, the calibrated source element <b>710</b> can be used with the contact electrode <b>730</b> to accurately provide prescribed current to the cochlear tissue. In some embodiments, by calibrating source element <b>710</b>, the charge delivered to the cochlear tissue by contact electrode can remain neutral can be accurately controlled to maintain charge neutrality over time.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some embodiments, adjustment of the source element <b>710</b> is done in vivo. Additionally, in some embodiments, adjustment of the source element <b>710</b> is done after the source element <b>710</b> has been calibrated in a factory or other space outside of a patient's body. Alternatively, in some embodiments, adjustment of the source element <b>710</b> is done in lieu of any calibration outside of a patient's body. Being able to adjust the source element <b>710</b> in vivo has many benefits over exterior calibration including that the adjustment can be performed at any time without removal of the source element from the patient and that charges can be more easily balanced, possibly leading to less damage of the cochlear nerve.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In an example operation of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, the source element <b>710</b> is initially connected to contact electrode <b>730</b> through switch <b>715</b>. After a period of time (or before the first use), it may be desired to calibrate the amount of output current generated by the source element <b>710</b> and delivered to the contact electrode <b>730</b> to ensure the prescribed amount of current is provided during stimulation. At such a time, the controller <b>700</b> directs the switch <b>715</b> such that the connection between the source element <b>710</b> and the contact electrode <b>730</b> is severed and a connection between the source element <b>710</b> and the testing circuit <b>720</b> is made. The controller <b>700</b> then causes the source element <b>710</b> to deliver a prescribed current through the testing circuit <b>720</b>. The current from the source element <b>710</b> can be directed to a precision load (e.g., <b>732</b>) within the testing circuit <b>720</b>. The controller <b>700</b> determines the amount of electrical current flowing through the precision load by measuring a voltage across the known impedance of the precision load (e.g., by measuring a voltage on one side of the precision load relative to a system ground). The controller <b>700</b> compares the prescribed current with the determined current (e.g. measured current) and adjusts the operation of the source element <b>710</b> so that the measured current matches the prescribed current. After at least one adjustment, the controller <b>700</b> switches the switch <b>715</b> to connect the source element <b>710</b> with the contact electrode <b>730</b>.

In some examples, testing circuit <b>860</b> can include a way to measure the voltage across the precision load or otherwise communicate the voltage to the controller <b>850</b>. In some cases, controller <b>850</b> can measure a voltage across the precision load directly. While the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> only includes a single testing circuit <b>860</b>, multiple testing circuits can be used.

However, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> can be advantageous over other configurations including multiple testing circuits and/or multiple precision loads as it can require fewer resources and take up less physical space.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a controller <b>850</b> is in communication with the plurality of source elements in addition to the plurality of switches.

The controller <b>850</b> can be in communication with testing circuit <b>860</b>. In such a configuration, the controller <b>850</b> can control and/or determine different aspects of the testing circuit <b>860</b>.

In some embodiments, the controller <b>850</b> can use the determined amount of current flowing through the testing circuit <b>860</b> to adjust a source element such as described herein.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some embodiments, multiple controllers can be used and, in some embodiments, a controller can be a part/portion of other elements of the cochlear implant system.

The operation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is disclosed relative to a single source element which can be connected to a single contact electrode. However, the operation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> can be repeated for multiple source elements connected to multiple contact electrodes.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In an example operation of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a first source element <b>810</b> can initially be connected to a first contact electrode <b>814</b> through a first switch <b>812</b>. The first source element <b>810</b> can deliver an output current to the first contact electrode <b>814</b>. The controller <b>850</b> can be configured to direct the first switch <b>812</b> to sever connection between the first source element <b>810</b> and the first contact electrode <b>814</b> and establish a connection between the first source element <b>810</b> and the testing circuit <b>860</b>. The controller <b>860</b> can cause the first source element <b>810</b> to deliver a prescribed output current through the testing circuit <b>860</b>, which in some examples flows through a precision load within the testing circuit <b>860</b>. The controller can determine the amount of electrical current flowing through the precision load, for example, by measuring a voltage across the known impedance of the precision load. The controller <b>860</b> can compare the prescribed current from the first source element <b>810</b> with the determined current, and adjust the output current of the first source element <b>810</b> such that the determined current matches the prescribed current. This process can be repeated any number of times for the first source element <b>810</b>. Once the first source element <b>810</b> has been adjusted (e.g. calibrated), the controller can adjust a second source element <b>820</b> connected to a second electrode <b>824</b> or the testing circuit <b>860</b> in a similar manner as the first source element <b>820</b> is adjusted as described above. Adjusting the second source element <b>820</b> can be done any number of times. Further, the process of adjusting a source element can be repeated n times for each of n number of source elements, for example, until all source elements have been adjusted. In such a process, each individual source element can be adjusted one after another (e.g. consecutively) until all the source elements are adjusted. In some embodiments, eight or more source elements are adjusted to output current for eight or more contact electrodes. In some embodiments, ten or twelve source elements can be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In an alternative operation of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the controller <b>850</b> causes a source element to emit a prescribed electrical current to the testing circuit <b>860</b> and through a precision load. The controller determines the current flowing through the precision load. However, instead of comparing and adjusting the output current of the source element relative to a known current, the controller <b>850</b> causes another source element to emit a prescribed electrical current to the testing circuit <b>860</b> and through the precision load. The controller determines the current flowing through the precision load for the second source element. This process can be repeated until the controller <b>850</b> has determined the respective current flowing through the precision load for all the source elements given the prescribed current. In some examples, the respective prescribed current for each of the source elements is the same during such a process.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Once the controller <b>850</b> has the determined currents for each of the source elements, it can determine characteristics of the determined currents. For example, the controller <b>850</b> can determine a first current flowing through testing circuit <b>860</b> from a first source element and determine a second current flowing through testing circuit <b>860</b> from a second source element. The controller <b>850</b> can then determine various characteristics, such as the minimum amount of electrical current, the maximum amount of electrical current, and the average amount of electrical current. Further, this process can be expanded to include n number of determined currents flowing through testing circuit <b>860</b> from an n number of source elements.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The controller <b>850</b> can use the determined characteristics (e.g. average amount of current) and compare them to the prescribed current. For example, an average current of 1.5 milliamps applied to testing circuit <b>860</b> can be compared to a prescribed current of 1.0 milliamps, a difference of 0.5 milliamps. If the average current is not equal to the prescribed current, the controller can adjust each source element such that the average current of all the source elements is the same as the prescribed current. In some embodiments, the controller <b>850</b> adjusts all the source elements the same amount to shift the average amount of current toward the prescribed current. In some embodiments, adjusting the output of each source element includes adjusting the LSB of each DAC of the source elements by the same amount.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Adjusting all the source elements in example operation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> can be advantageous as the adjustment is only done in one step instead of on a per-source element basis. However, in some examples, adjusting all the source elements in the same step can be a first step before the controller <b>850</b> adjusts each individual source element. For example, all the source elements can be adjusted the same amount such that their average output current is equal to a desired (e.g. prescribed) current. Each individual source element can be subsequently adjusted such that each individual output current is equal to a prescribed current. In such an example, the initial adjusting of all the source elements can put their respective output currents closer to the prescribed current, with the secondary, individual adjusting of each source element putting the output currents at the prescribed current. Thus, in some examples, a bulk calibration of the output currents of the source elements can be performed before a fine calibration.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Adjustment of the source elements can be done at any time, however, in some embodiments, adjustment is done at specific times. For example, it can be advantageous to adjust the source elements soon after the cochlear implant system is implanted into a wearer to ensure accurate stimulation and avoid charge accumulation as soon as possible, limiting any possible damage to the cochlear tissue or implanted components. Additionally or alternatively, calibration can be done after an audiologist determines specific settings (e.g. setting a transfer function) of the cochlear implant system after it is implanted. Further, in some embodiments, adjustment can be done periodically, such as at auto-programmed times, or at discrete times, such as when a user initiates an adjustment (e.g., via a charger or other external component in communication with the implanted system). Other periods of time for when adjustment is performed are contemplated, such as when prescribed by an audiologist, and a person of ordinary skill will understand that the present disclosure is not limited to the examples provided.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Moving to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of an example fully implantable cochlear implant system with an external device for programming.
