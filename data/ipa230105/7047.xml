Vendors, typically suppliers of goods and services, can supply these goods and services locally or remotely via a communications network. For example, companies may use vendors to manage the payroll, human resources, or data storage aspects of its respective business. These management services can be conducted by remotely accessing data of the company and processing such data according to the needs of the company. Off-loading particular aspects of a business to third-party vendors can often result in increased efficiency and profit for the company.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The process of entering into agreements with such vendors itself is an inefficient, time-consuming and expensive process. For example, companies often need to conduct due diligence or reviews of each vendor before, during or after entering into a business arrangement with the vendor. Evaluating the fitness or suitability of a vendor can introduce significant delays in executing the business relationship.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In part, this delay comes from the customer's own risk management and compliance procedures. An aim of risk management and compliance procedures is to determine what risks the vendor presents to the company. For example, where a customer is seeking a vendor to process data for the customer's own clients, the risk management and compliance procedures are used to determine if the vendor is compliant with various industry standard information security practices. In the past, failure to properly evaluate the operational practices of vendors has resulted in the customer facing data breaches or allegations of consumer protection law violations. Such breaches can cost the customer money and reputational harm.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is recognized herein that delays associated with vendor compliance are further compounded when a customer utilizes the services of multiple vendors, or when vendors themselves utilize the services of multiple vendors. A customer is faced with the possibility of spending significant time and money in evaluating vendors. Alternatively, customers may only focus oversight and evaluation efforts on the most critical or high value vendors. Such an approach can result in cost savings, but with a corresponding increase that risks posed by the vendor go unnoticed until it is too late.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, what is needed in the art are systems, methods and computer products that permit customers, agencies, vendors, and other interested parties to evaluate the operational, information and security practices of various vendors. Furthermore, what is needed in the art are fully implemented solutions that allow customer evaluate a vendor, and if necessary, prevent the vendor from receiving customer data if the vendor fails to use proper information security procedures and practices.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A computer-implemented system and method are disclosed that monitor and determine vendor compliance with at least some aspects of information and security criteria. In one or more implementations, at least one computing device is configured by executing code to access information and security criteria respectively associated with a vendor that provides a good and/or service. At least some aspects of the information and security criteria are provided by an organization considering the vendor and, further, the information and security criteria include at least one of cybersecurity criteria, regulatory criteria, intellectual property criteria, data management criteria, and policy criteria. In one or more implementations, the at least one computing device is further configured to access a plurality of remotely located computing devices to obtain information associated with the vendor's performance in connection with the at least some of the aspects of the information and security criteria. Further, the at least one computing device is further configured to automatically evaluate the vendor's compliance with at least some of the aspects of the information and security criteria. The evaluating can include comparing a predetermined standard or threshold of at least one of the aspects of the information and security criteria and at least some of the information obtained from the plurality of remotely located computing devices. Furthermore, the at least one computing device can be further configured to automatically determine, as a function of the evaluating, that the vendor has not complied with a first subset of the aspects of the information and security criteria, wherein the first subset includes at least one of the aspects of the information and security criteria. Still further, the at least one computing device can be further configured to automatically determine, as a function of the evaluating, that the vendor has complied with a second subset of the aspects of the information and security criteria, wherein the second subset includes at least one other of the aspects of the information and security criteria. Moreover, the at least one computing device can be further configured to determine, based at least on an evaluation of the first subset and the second subset, whether the vendor is in compliance or is out of compliance with the information and security criteria.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other aspects, features, and advantages can be appreciated from the accompanying description of certain embodiments of the invention and the accompanying drawing figures and claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further aspects of the present disclosure will be more readily appreciated upon review of the detailed description of its various embodiments, described below, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, of which:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic block diagram of devices and components in accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> provides a flow diagram in accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>12</b></figref> illustrate example data entry display screens in accordance with one or more example implementations of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ONE OR MORE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">By way of overview and introduction, there exists a need to obtain accurate information about vendor-related security and information handling practices to make decisions on which vendors to use and in what capacity. Present solutions require significant investigation, such as responses to lengthy questionnaires and documentation, that take too long to review and process, thus holding up the process of contracting with vendors. Unfortunately, failing to evaluate the information criteria, such as cybersecurity and privacy, for any given vendor can have extremely negative consequences. For instance, the lack of vendor diligence can expose a company to fines or reputational harm for failure to ensure that sensitive (e.g., privacy) information remained secure. Furthermore, present solutions often employ proprietary and hidden algorithms to provide scores, such as credit scores. The present disclosure improves upon such solutions by being transparent about the data points that are discovered and employed in accordance with the teachings herein. Moreover, providing access to respective information used for various calculations enables customers to verify data independently, which has heretofore been unavailable.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The systems, methods and computer products described herein address drawbacks that are inherent to traditional evaluation of third party vendors. For example, the present application includes systems and methods to access information regarding security posture and related criteria for various vendors and, thereafter, processing that information in a manner that allows improved speed and resource use relative to existing solutions. Accordingly, the systems, methods and computer products described herein can operate to cause a computer or software platform to utilize fewer resources in the course of evaluating a compliance state of one or more vendors, while also achieving improved results relative to existing implemented systems.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">More particularly, the systems, methods and computer products described herein are directed to identifying public and/or private information security and other criteria that are relevant to one or more vendors that provide a good or service. The identified information and security criteria are then used to determine the compliance state of a specific vendor. For instance, the vendor operational or information security practices are evaluated against a list of attributes. The results of this evaluation are used to determine if the vendor is compliant with information and security criteria, or a portion thereof, relevant to a customer, agency or other party. By comparing the information security data for a specific vendor against the one or more standards, regulations or policies for information security, an accurate and transparent determination regarding the vendor information security practices can be obtained. Thus, the systems, methods and computer products described are directed to a specific application that allows for rapid assessment of a vendor's information security practices and thus enables customer and vendors to confidently enter into commercial relationships therewith.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The systems, methods and computer products shown and described herein provide an improvement in compliance determination technology, including by contextualizing the information and security criteria so that only those criteria that are relevant or responsive to a given vendor of a specific type are evaluated. Through standardizing types of the information and security criteria, a full picture assessment of the vendor's compliance state is achieved. As provided in more detail herein, the information and security criteria used to evaluate the vendor can include a number of different categories, including: cybersecurity criteria, regulatory criteria, intellectual property criteria, data management criteria and policy criteria. One particular approach determines vendor compliance with each of the plurality of the identified information and security criteria. However, in an alternative approach contextual information is used to identify a subset of the information and security criteria that is relevant and responsive to the type of vendor being evaluated. For instance, data relating to the vendor can be queried from databases. Public registries and other public data stores can be queried, for example, using contextual data, to determine if a respective vendor is compliant with the various information and security criteria. The systems and methods here include technologies to access various data sources to evaluate vendors, which eliminates or otherwise reduces labor intensive data acquisition, reduces error rates, and provides more granular information beyond ambiguous qualifier statements, which provides the ability to independently verify or validate the information security status of a vendor.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Based on results of an evaluation data, such as returned from one or more executed queries, a vendor can be flagged as compliant or non-compliant with customer specific, industry specific, or mandated information security practices. Likewise, specific shortcomings in connection with a vendor's non-compliance can be identified and one or more processes can be implemented to resolve such non-compliance. Such processes can depend, for example, on the degree and severity of respective non-compliance. For example, automatic notification procedures can be implemented to resolve non-compliance. More aggressive actions, such as to automatically implement corrective measures, can be taken in other contexts. For example, specific details associated with a status of non-compliance of the vendor can be used to revoke or temporally suspend the vendor's access pending one or more remediation actions. In a further example illustrating an extreme case, a vendor may be determined to be non-compliant and a domain name reference to the vendor is deleted or altered to as to prevent public access to the network domain of a non-compliant vendor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to the drawings and turning to a particular configuration of the systems, methods and approaches described herein, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a system diagram representing an information security compliance platform in accordance with an implementation of the present application. A compliance platform <b>102</b> is shown, which can include one or more computing device(s), and configured to communicate over a network <b>104</b> with one or more databases and one or more remote computer device(s) <b>106</b>. In one example, a customer wishing to evaluate various vendors uploads, transmits, provides access or otherwise makes available a list of venders to the compliance platform <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example series of steps that can be executed in accordance with an example the compliance platform <b>102</b>. Platform <b>102</b> can be configured by one or more modules to receive vendor information as shown in step <b>202</b>. In a more detailed example the compliance platform <b>102</b> can be configured, such as by one or more modules operating or executing as code therein, to identify search parameters and/or data storage locations for use in accessing operational criteria for a respective vendor. For instance, the compliance platform <b>102</b> is configured to transform or utilize a given vendor name to determine the network identity, address or footprint of a vendor. Such a network identity can include a website used by the vendor, one or more domains associated with the vendor, and/or one or more network accessible application user interfaces associated with the vendor. By way of example, where a vendor is XYZ LLC, identifying the XYZ network identity includes determining the existence of one or more websites owned by XYZ LLC, such as but not limited to XYZ.com, or another domain. In another configuration, the identification of the vendor is received by the user. For example, a user of the platform <b>102</b> uses one or more user interfaces to submit or enter a vendor name as well as the network identity of the vendor.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Continuing with the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the compliance platform <b>102</b> is utilized to receive or identify a list or collection of the information and security criteria that is relevant for a given vendor, customer or agency as shown in step <b>204</b>. For instance, different customers may have different vendor requirements. In such scenarios, the compliance platform <b>102</b> is configured by one or more software modules to access a list of the information and security criteria from a datastore for evaluation.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">By way of further example detail, using a supplied list of vendors, the compliance platform <b>102</b> can be configured to evaluate the information and security criteria of the vendor to determine compliance of the information and security criteria with an information security compliance standard or threshold. By way of non-limiting example, the information and security criteria can include any operational status, standard, criteria, or configuration of the vendor's business activities, network footprint, contractual obligation or presence or public statement. For instance, the information and security criteria can include at least one of cybersecurity criteria, regulatory criteria, intellectual property criteria, data management criteria and policy criteria.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Cybersecurity criteria can relate to whether a vendor has a secure network presence. For instance, the cybersecurity criteria can include information regarding an encryption status of a vendor website or application programming interface (API). In a more detailed evaluation, cybersecurity criteria can also include information regarding the SSL status of the vendor's website. Furthermore, cybersecurity criteria can concern information about the verification and authentication status of a vendor website. For instance, the cybersecurity criteria include information relating to whether domain name service (&#x201c;DNS&#x201d;) security protocols have been enabled for the vendor website. In another configuration, the cybersecurity criteria include information regarding the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) of the vendor e-mail server. For instance, cybersecurity criteria information can include information representing a determination of whether methods used by the vendor's email server are capable of detecting forged sender addresses.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">While cybersecurity criteria can relate to one or more network protocols used to exchange data between computers, the cybersecurity criteria can also include other information, such as a location of the vendor's domain name registration. Such cybersecurity criteria can further include information regarding the versions of the software used by the vendor and if the relevant patch or updates have been applied.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, the information and security criteria can include, for example, regulatory criteria. Such regulatory criteria can include information on vendor activities that are governed by federal, state, or local governmental laws or regulations. For instance, regulatory criteria can include information representing a determination of whether the vendor's operational practices are appropriate under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDRP). Likewise, the vendor's compliance under other local regulations or laws, such as (for non-limiting examples), HIPPA, COPPA, FINRA, CCPA, and CAN-SPAM, can also be incorporated into the regulatory criteria component of the information and security criteria.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one or more further configurations, the information and security criteria can also include information associated with intellectual property. For example, intellectual property criteria can include information regarding one or more licenses or other intellectual property rights that are utilized by the vendor in operation of the vendor's business. Information regarding any open-source software or general public license (GPL) covered software, for example, can be included in the intellectual property rights criteria. Such intellectual property rights criteria can, in one or more arrangements, can include information on any patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights that are applicable to goods and/or services that are delivered by a vendor to a customer.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, data management criteria can include information relating to data that are provided to or accessed by a vendor, and how data are managed and/or handled. For example, data management criteria can include information representing a determination of whether data are stored in redundant back-ups, in encrypted form, and in particular storage location(s), subject to various criteria, such as a particular legal regulation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Moreover, policy management criteria can include information relating to the existence and or compliance of a vendor with one or more operational policies that the vendor has drafted or implemented. For example, the policy management criteria include information representing a determination vendor compliance with one or more terms of service or terms of use, privacy policy, data use policy, customer agreement and end-user license agreement. The present application includes one or more implementations that are focused heavily on supporting privacy of information, including as a function of various technical and policy-based security measures. Moreover, the present application can include one or more modules to evaluate whether a website is properly collecting consent from its users, whether membership is in place for third-party privacy monitoring (e.g., PRIVACY SHIELD), whether and how many data breaches have occurred or that a vendor has had, and whether alerts can be timely provided in response to new breaches.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a particular implementation, information and security criteria, or information necessary to evaluate the information and security criteria as described herein is stored in one or more database or data storage locations. For instance, with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the information criteria used to evaluate a vendor is stored in database <b>108</b> that is accessible to the software platform <b>102</b> via a network <b>104</b>, such as the internet.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, while the compliance platform is configured to receive a complete list of attributes, such as relating to the information and security criteria, each specific attribute may not be relevant or needed for a given vendor. As such, for each received and identified vendor a respectively defined set of information and security criteria can be generated. For example, where large organizations have different classes of vendors (e.g., human resources, accounting, technology, or the like), different collections of information and security criteria are defined which are relevant for efficient processing of the vendor. In one or more implementations, each vendor is assigned a type or category of vendor. Using the category, the relevant information and security criteria for the vendor is accessed. For example, a database, such as database <b>108</b>, is queried for the information and security criteria associated with a given vendor type. Alternatively, a given vendor has a specific set of the information and security criteria associated with that vendor. Here, a query to identify the vendor from a vendor database returns a defined set of the information and security criteria associated with the given vendor. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the compliance platform <b>102</b> is configured by one or more modules to obtain a subset of the information and security criteria used to evaluate a given vendor as shown in step <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Once the information and security criteria associated with the vendor is accessed, the compliance platform <b>102</b> can be configured to access one or more databases <b>108</b>, services, remote computers, or information stores (including remote computer <b>106</b>), to determine vendor compliance in connection with the information and security criteria. In a particular configuration, such as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the compliance platform <b>102</b> is configured by one or more modules to query data stores for data regarding the information security posture of a given vendor (step <b>208</b>). Such query can be conducted on an on-demand basis, or on a periodic schedule, or some combination thereof. For instance, one or more DNS servers (such as a DNS host server <b>106</b>A) are queried by the compliance platform <b>102</b>, or a processor configured by one or more modules thereof. In a particular configuration, the query includes the domain name used by the vendor. The response to the query includes data values corresponding to particular information and security criteria relevant to cybersecurity posture of the vendor. In an alternative configuration, the query parses the web domain such as hosted by web host server <b>106</b>B) of the vendor for one or more privacy policies or terms of use. In another configuration, the compliance platform queries a vendor website host to determine if the queried website has SSL enabled, the website's DNS security status, and the status of the associated DNS record associated record.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in step <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, response data are obtained from the one or more queries and are compared to a threshold value, status or value, which is indicative of compliance with the information and security criteria. For example, the information and security criteria for a given vendor includes information on whether the vendor website transfers data in an encrypted state. The compliance platform evaluates the query response to determine if, in fact, the vendor website does transfer data in the encrypted state. If true, the vendor is deemed compliant with that particular aspect of the information and security criteria. This process can occur iteratively, in parallel, and partially and/or completely, depending on a particular implementation, for the information and security criteria associated with the given vendor to be evaluated.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a further configuration, one or more contextual modules configure the compliance platform <b>102</b> to evaluate the text of the privacy policy, license or other document provided by the vendor to determine salient characteristics, features or statuses relevant to the information and security criteria. For instance, the privacy policy for a given vendor is accessed from the vendor's web host. The accessed privacy policy can be parsed, for example, using one or more text processing or natural language processing modules to determine if the policy includes specific provisions or statements relevant to the information and security criteria.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Data obtained for a given vendor can be compared to one or more relevant thresholds, values or statuses, to determine whether the vendor is compliant with the information and security criteria. Where a vendor has previously been evaluated by the compliance platform <b>102</b>, the vendor's record can be updated to represent a current evaluation status. Alternatively, multiple versions of the vendor's compliance status can be stored along with metadata indicating the date and/or time when evaluation was conducted.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The results of the information and security criteria evaluation can be stored and made accessible to a customer, agency or other interested party. For example, a customer wishing to execute a contract with a given vendor is provided an interactive graphical user interface that indicates the evaluated information and security criteria, the vendor's compliance state relative to the evaluated information and security criteria, the relevance of the information and security criteria evaluated, and any comments, notes or metadata associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Depending on a particular outcome of the information and security criteria evaluation of step <b>210</b>, the compliance platform <b>102</b> can be configured to either permit the vendor to access data from a customer-controlled data source or deny access to the customer-controlled data source. For instance, as shown in step <b>212</b>, where the vendor has been evaluated as compliant with the information and security criteria, the vendor is granted access to customer-controlled data. For example, where a vendor is processing payroll for a customer, upon a determination of compliance, the vendor is given API keys to access the payroll database of a specific customer. In another arrangement, where the vendor is in a pre-existing relationship with the customer, a determination of compliance will cause the access previously granted to the customer data to be maintained.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an alternative configuration, where the evaluation of the information and security criteria indicates that a vendor is non-compliant with the one or more information and security criteria, the vendor can be denied access to the customer-controlled data, as in step <b>214</b>. For instance, the compliance platform <b>102</b> is configured to revoke API keys associated with a vendor that is non-compliant. In an alternative configuration, the compliance platform <b>102</b> causes the DNS registration or domain access of the vendor to be suspended. Alternatively, the compliance platform <b>102</b> is configured to disable public access to the vendor domain until a subsequent evaluation indicates that the vendor is complaint with all the information and security criteria.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a further configuration, the software platform can be configured to send a message to a non-compliant vendor, where the message includes data relating to the non-compliant status. In a further implementation, the message also includes data or information indicating or suggesting remediation of the non-compliant status. In a further implementation, the message includes an interactive feature or functionality that causes a message to be sent back to the compliance platform <b>102</b>, wherein the return message includes an indication that an attempt at remediation of the non-compliant status has been undertaken. In turn, upon receiving the return message, the compliance platform <b>102</b> re-evaluates the vendor's information security posture to determine if the vendor is compliant. This process can proceed iteratively until it is complete and/or otherwise terminated.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>12</b></figref> illustrate example data entry display screens associated with one or more example implementations of the present disclosure.

For example, device(s) can be configured to access information and security criteria respectively associated with a vendor that provides a good and/or service. At least some aspects of the information and security criteria can be defined and/or provided by an organization considering the vendor, and can include a set of rules that are required for compliance. The information and security criteria can include at least one of cybersecurity criteria, regulatory criteria, intellectual property criteria, data management criteria, and policy criteria.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Computing device(s) can be configured to access a plurality of other remotely located computing devices to obtain information associated with the vendor's performance and operations in connection with at least some of the aspects of the information and security criteria. The device(s) can automatically evaluate vendor compliance with at least some of the aspects of the information and security criteria, including by comparing a predetermined standard or threshold of at least one of the aspects of the information and security criteria with at least some of the information obtained from the plurality of remotely located computing devices.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, computing devices can be configured, such as by executing one or more modules, to automatically determine that the vendor has not complied with a first subset of the aspects of the information and security criteria. The determination can be based on the results of an evaluation and determination that a vendor has or has not complied with aspects of the information and security criteria, such as whether certain privacy and data encryption methodologies are in place and operational. Based on the compliance, subsets of aspects can be defined or determined based on one or more filtering operations. Computing devices can filter aspects of the information and security criteria that the vendor did not comply with from all aspects of the information and security criteria and, thereafter, perform additional operations on the reduced filtered dataset. This improves computer functionality, including by reducing processing time, computing resources and associated costs.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">More generally, in one or more implementations, at least one computing device can determine, based at least on an evaluation of the first and second subsets, whether the vendor is in compliance or is out of compliance with the information and security criteria. For example, vendor may be out of compliance with one or more specific aspects of the information and security criteria (e.g., a respective firewall setting), but is in compliance with all other respective aspects. Based on the organization's history or specific rules set forth in a profile or other resource, the vendor may be in compliance with the organization's overall hiring rules under the information and security criteria, notwithstanding the vendor not complying with one or more aspects. Alternatively, one or more additional rules can be implemented, such as timeframes for a vendor to be brought into compliance with one or more of the various aspects.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one or more implementations, at least one computing device automatically transmits to a remotely located computing device, a report identifying that the vendor is in compliance or out of compliance with the information and security criteria.

Further, at least one computing device can identify that the at least one remedial action has been taken, and that the vendor is in compliance with the information and security criteria. An updated or new report can be transmitted, by at least one computing device to a remotely located computing device, to identify that the vendor is in compliance with the information and security criteria.
