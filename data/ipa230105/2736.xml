Specifically, described herein are methods and apparatuses for identifying one or more drug formulations that may be effective to treat a particular patient.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Model cell and tissue systems are useful for biological and medical research. The most common practice is to derive immortalized cell lines from tissue and culture them in two-dimensional (2D) conditions (e.g., in Petri dish or well plate). However, although immensely useful for basic research, 2D cell lines do not correlate well with individual patient response to therapy. In particular, three-dimensional cell culture models are proving particularly helpful in developmental biology, disease pathology, regenerative medicine, drug toxicity and efficacy testing, and personalized medicine. For example, spheroids and organoids are three-dimensional cell aggregates that have been studied. Both organoids and spheroids have limitations that reduce their efficacy, however.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Multicellular tumor spheroids were first described in the early 70s and obtained by culture of cancer cell lines under non-adherent conditions. Spheroids are typically formed from cancer cell lines as freely floating cell aggregates in ultra-low attachment plates. Spheroids have been shown to maintain more stem cell associated properties than 2D cell culture.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Organoids are in-vitro derived cell aggregates that include a population of stem cells that can differentiate into cell of major cell lineages. Organoids typically have a diameter of more than one mm diameter, and are cultured through passages. It is typically slower to grow and expand organoid culture than 2D cell culture. To generate organoids from clinical samples, it requires sufficient number of viable cells (e.g., hundreds to thousands) to start with, so it is often challenging to derive organoids from low volume samples such as biopsy, and&#x2014;even if successful&#x2014;it will take considerable time to expand the culture for applications such as drug testing. In addition, there is a large amount of variability in organoid size, shape and cell number. Organoids may require complex cocktails of growth factors and culture conditions in order to grow and express desired cell types.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Neither tumor spheroids nor organoids are optimal for rapid and reliable screening, particularly for personalized medicine, such as performing ex-vivo testing of drug response. For example, the practice of oncology continually faces an immense challenge of matching the right therapeutic regimen with the right patient, in addition to balancing relative benefit with risk to achieve the most favorable outcome. Patient-Derived Models of Cancer (PDMC) may include the use of organoids (including patient-derived organoids) to facilitate the identification and development of more individualized therapeutic targets. However, although retrospective studies have shown that organoid derived from resected or biopsied patient tumors correlate with patient response to therapy, there are major limitations in using organoids to guide therapy. As mentioned above, it takes months to derive and expand organoids, and particularly patient-derived organoids, from tumor samples for drug sensitivity tests, which decreases the clinical applicability, as patients cannot wait that long to receive treatment. In addition, the number of organoids needed to perform a drug screen with more than dozens of compounds currently cannot be obtained in a clinically feasible timeframe from a core biopsy specimen, which is often the only available form of tissue from patients with metastatic or inoperable cancer. The significant failure rate for deriving organoids from biopsies also prevents its use as a reliable diagnostic assay. Further, there may be a high degree of variability in the size (and potentially the response) of organoids, particularly with longer culture times, and therefore many passages.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due to their better correlations with patient outcomes, PDMC are also being exploited to replace 2D cell lines as high-throughput screen platform for drug discovery, such as RNAi, CRISPR, and pharmacological small molecule screens. However, compared to cell lines, these PDMC models (including spheroids and organoids) are typically much slower to expand and manipulate, making it challenging and costly for high-throughput applications. The longer time required to expand these models to amplify the cell numbers also tend to allow the fastest growing clone in plastics to dominate and outcompete other clones, hence making the model more homogeneous and losing the original tissue compositions and clonal diversity. Furthermore, their relatively larger and heterogeneous sizes and limited diffusibility make them challenging for many automated fluorescence and imaging based readout assays.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, what is needed are methods, compositions and apparatuses for generating patient derived tissue models (e.g., tumor models and/or non-tumor tissue models) from resection or biopsies. In particular, it would be useful to provide methods and apparatuses that may enable a large number of patient-derived tissue models having predictable and clinically relevant properties from a single biopsy, such as an 18-gauge core biopsy, which could be completed within, e.g., 7-10 days after obtaining a biopsy. This would permit robust and reliable testing and minimize delays in guiding patient-specific therapies. Furthermore, it will also be useful to generate patient derived models that can expand quickly in a highly parallel manner, generating units with smaller and more uniform sizes, better controllability for cell number per unit, and better diffusibility (e.g., via increase surface to volume ratio), for high-throughput screen applications.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Described herein are Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres (PMOSs), apparatuses and methods of making PMOSs, and apparatuses and methods of using PMOSs. Also described herein are methods and systems for screening a patient using these Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres, including personalized therapy methods.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In general, described herein are methods and apparatuses that form and grow Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres containing cells originating from a patient, for example, extracted from a small patient biopsy, (e.g., for quick diagnostics to guide therapy), from resected patient tissue, including resected primary tumor or part of a dysfunctional organ (e.g., for high-throughput screening), and/or from already established PDMCs, including patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and organoids (e.g., to generate Micro-Organospheres for high-throughput screening).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">These PMOSs may be formed from primary cells that are normal (e.g., normal organ tissue) or from tumor tissue. For example, in some variations, these methods and apparatuses may form PMOSs from cancerous tumor biopsy tissue, enabling tailored treatments that can selected using the particular tumor tissue examined. Surprisingly, these methods and apparatuses permit the formation of hundreds, thousands or even tens of thousands (e.g., 500, 750, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000 or more) of PMOSs from a single tissue biopsy, within a few hours of the biopsy being removed from the patient. Dissociated primary cells from the patient biopsy may be combined with a fluid matrix material, such as a substrate basement membrane matrix (e.g., MATRIGEL), to form the micro-organosphere. The resulting plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may have a predefined range of sizes (such as diameters, e.g., between 10 &#x3bc;m and 700 &#x3bc;m and any sub-range therewithin), and initial number of primary cells (e.g., between 1 and 1000, and in particular lower numbers of cells, such as between 1-200). The number of cells and/or the diameter may be controlled within, e.g., +/&#x2212;5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, etc. These PMOSs, when formed as described herein, have an exceptionally high survival rate (&#x3e;75%, &#x3e;80%, &#x3e;85%, &#x3e;90%, &#x3e;95%) and are stable for use and testing within a very short period of time, including within the first 1-10 days after being formed (e.g., within 1 day, within 2 days, within 3 days, within 4 days, within 5 days, within 6 days, within 7 days, within 8 days, within 9 days, within 10 days, etc.). This allows for rapid tests on a potentially huge number of patient-specific and biologically relevant PMOSs which may save critical time in developing and deploying a patient therapy, such as a cancer treatment plan. The PMOSs described herein rapidly form 3D cellular structures that replicate and correspond to the tissue environment from which they were biopsied, such as a three-dimensional (3D) tumor microenvironment. The PMOSs described herein may also be referred to as &#x201c;droplets&#x201d;. Each PMOSs may include, e.g., as part of the fluid matrix material, growth factors and structural proteins (e.g., collagen, laminin, nidogen, etc.) that may mimic the original tissue (e.g., tumor) environment. Virtually any primary cell tissue may be used, including virtually any tumor tissue.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, to date, all tumor types and sites tested have successfully produced PMOSs (e.g., current success rate of 100%, n=32, including cancer of the colon, esophagus, skin (melanoma), uterus, bone (sarcoma), kidney, ovary, lung, and breast from the primary site or metastatic sites including liver, omentum, and diaphragm). The tissue types used to successfully generate Micro-Organopheres may be metastasized from other locations. In some variations the PMOSs described herein can be grown from fine needle aspirate (FNA) or from circulating tumor cells (CTCs), e.g., from a liquid biopsy. Proliferation and growth is typically seen in as few as 3-4 days, and the PMOSs can be maintained and passaged for months, or they may be cryopreserved and/or used for assays immediately (e.g., within the first 7-10 days).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In particular, described herein are methods of forming Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres. Generally, these methods include combining dissociated primary tissue cells (including, but not limited to cancer/abnormal tissue, normal tissue, etc.) with a liquid matrix material to form an unpolymerized material, and then polymerizing the unpolymerized material to form micro-Organospheres that are typically less than about 1000 &#x3bc;m (e.g., less than about 900 &#x3bc;m, less than about 800 &#x3bc;m, less than about 700 &#x3bc;m, less than about 600 &#x3bc;m, and in particular, less than about 500 &#x3bc;m) in diameter in which the dissociated primary tissue cells are distributed. The number of dissociated cells may be within a predetermined range, as mentioned above (e.g., between about 1 and about 500 cells, between about 1-200 cells, between about 1-150 cells, between about 100 cells, between about 1-75 cells, between about 1-50 cells, between about 1-30 cells, between about 1-20 cells, between about 1-10 cells, between about 5-15 cells, between about 20-30 cells, between about 30-50 cells, between about 40-60 cells, between about 50-70 cell, between about 60-80 cells, between about 70-90 cells, between about 80-100 cells, between about 90-110 cells, etc., including about 1 cell, about 10 cells, about 20 cells, about 30 cells, about 40 cells, about 50 cells, about 60 cells, about 70 cells, etc.). Any of these methods may be configured as described herein to produce Micro-Organospheres of repeatable size (e.g., having a narrow distribution of sizes).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The dissociated cells may be freshly biopsied and may be dissociated in any appropriate manner, including mechanical and/or chemical dissociation (e.g., enzymatic disaggregation by using one or more enzymes, such as collagenase, trypsin, etc.). The dissociated cells may optionally be treated, selected and/or modified. For example, the cells may be sorted or selected to identify and/or isolate cells having one or more characteristics (e.g., size, morphology, etc.). The cells may be marked (e.g., with one or more markers) that may be used to aid in selection. In some variations the cells may be sorted by a known cell-sorting technology, including but not limited to microfluidic cell sorting, fluorescent activated cell sorting, magnetic activated cell sorting, etc. Alternatively, the cells may be used without sorting.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some variations, the dissociated cells may be modified by treatment with one or more agents. For example the cells may be genetically modified. In some variations the cells may be modified using CRISPR-Cas9 or other genetic editing techniques. In some variations the cells may be transfected by any appropriate method (e.g., electroporation, cell squeezing, nanoparticle injection, magnetofection, chemical transfection, viral transfection, etc.), including transfection with of plasmids, RNA, siRNA, etc. Alternatively, the cells may be used without modification.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">One or more additional materials may be combined with the dissociated cells and fluid (e.g., liquid) matrix material to form the unpolymerized mixture. For example, the unpolymerized mixture may include additional cell or tissue types, including support cells. The additional cells or tissue may originate from different biopsy (e.g., primary cells from a different dissociated tissue) and/or cultured cells. The additional cells may be, for example immune cells, stromal cells, endothelial cells, etc. The additional materials may include medium (e.g., growth medium, freezing medium, etc.), growth factors, support network molecules (e.g., collagen, glycoproteins, extracellular matrix, etc.), or the like. In some variations the additional materials may include a drug composition. In some variations the unpolymerized mixture includes only the dissociated tissue sample (e.g., primary cells) and the fluid matrix material.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The methods may rapidly form a plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres from a single tissue biopsy, so that greater than about 500 Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres are formed from per biopsy (e.g., greater than about 600, greater than about 700, greater than about 800, greater than about 900, greater than about 1000, greater than about 2000, greater than about 2500, greater than about 3000, greater than about 4000, greater than about 5000, greater than about 6000, greater than about 7000, greater than about 8000, greater than about 9000, greater than about 10,000, greater than about 11,000, greater than about 12,000, etc.). The biopsy may be a standard size biopsy, such as an 18G (e.g., 14G, 16G, 18G, etc.) core biopsy. For example, the volume of tissue removed by biopsy and used to form the plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be a small cylinder (taken with a biopsy needle) of between about 1/32 and &#x215b; of an inch diameter and about % inch to &#xbc; inch long, such as a cylinder of about 1/16 inch diameter by &#xbd; inch long. The biopsy may be taken by needle biopsy, e.g., by core needle biopsy. In some variations the biopsy may be taken by fine needle aspiration. Other biopsy types that may be used include shave biopsy, punch biopsy, incisional biopsy, excisional biopsy, and the like. Typically the material from a single patient biopsy may be used to generate the plurality (e.g., greater than about 2000, greater than about 5000, greater than about 7500, greater than about 10,000, etc.) of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres as described above. The plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be formed using an apparatus (as described herein) that may be configured to generate this large number of highly regular (size, cell number, etc.) Micro-Organospheres as described herein. In some variations these methods and apparatuses may generate the plurality or Micro-Organospheres at a rapid rate (e.g., greater than about 1 Micro-Organosphere per minute, greater than about 1 Micro-Organosphere per 10 seconds, greater than about 1 Micro-Organosphere per 5 seconds, greater than about 1 Micro-Organosphere per 2 seconds, greater than about 1 Micro-Organosphere per second, greater than about 2 Micro-Organospheres per second, greater than about 3 Micro-Organospheres per second, greater than about 4 Micro-Organospheres per second, greater than about 5 Micro-Organospheres per second, greater than about 10 Micro-Organospheres per second, greater than 50 Micro-Organospheres per second, greater than 100 Micro-Organospheres per second, greater than 125 Micro-Organospheres per second, etc.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, in some variations, these methods may be performed by combing the unpolymerized mixture with a material (e.g., liquid material) that is immiscible with the unpolymerized material. The method and apparatus may control the size and/or cell density of the Micro-Organospheres by, at least in part, controlling the flow of one or more of the unpolymerized mixture (and/or the dissociated tissue and fluid matrix) and the material that is immiscible with the unpolymerized mixture (e.g., a hydrophobic material, oil, etc.). For example, in some variations, these methods may be performed using a microfluidics apparatus. In some variations, multiple Micro-Organospheres may be formed in parallel (e.g., 2 in parallel, 3 in parallel, 4 in parallel, etc.). The same apparatus may therefore include multiple parallel channels, which may be coupled to the same source of unpolymerized material, or the same source of dissociated primary tissue and/or a source of fluid matrix.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The unpolymerized material may be polymerized in order to form the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres in a variety of different ways. In some variations the methods may include polymerizing the Micro-Organospheres by changing the temperature (e.g., raising the temperature above a threshold value, such as, for example greater than about 20 degrees C., greater than about 25 degrees C., greater than about 30 degrees C., greater than about 35 degrees C., etc.).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Once polymerized, the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be allowed to grow, e.g., by culturing and/or may be assayed either before or after culturing and/or may be cryopreserved either before or after culturing. The Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be cultured for any appropriate length of time, but in particular, may be cultured for between 1 day and 10 days (e.g., between 1 day and 9 days, between 1 day and 8 days, between 1 day and 7 days, between 1 day and 6 days, between 3 days and 9 days, between 3 days and 8 days, between 3 days and 7 days, etc.). In some variations, the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be cryopreserved or assayed before six passages, which may preserve the heterogeneity of the cells within the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres; limiting the number of passages may prevent the faster-dividing cells from outpacing more slowly dividing cells.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In general, since the same patient biopsy may provide a high number (e.g., greater than 2,000, greater than 3,000, greater than 4,000, greater than 5,000, greater than 6,000, greater than 7,000, greater than 8,000, greater than 9,000, greater than 10,000, etc.) cells, some of the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be cryopreserved (e.g., over half) while some are cultured and/or assayed. As will be described in greater detail herein, cryopreserved Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be banked and used (e.g., assayed, passaged, etc.) later.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Thus, described herein are methods, including methods of forming a plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres. For example, a method of forming a plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may include: combining a dissociated tissue sample and a fluid matrix material to form an unpolymerized mixture; forming a plurality of droplets of the unpolymerized mixture; and polymerizing the droplets to form a plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres each having a diameter of between 50 and 500 &#x3bc;m with between 1 and 200 dissociated cells distributed therein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A method, e.g., of forming a plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres, may include combining a dissociated tissue sample and a fluid matrix material to form an unpolymerized mixture; forming a plurality of droplets from a continuous stream of the unpolymerized mixture wherein the droplets have less than a 25% variation in size; and polymerizing the droplets by warming to form a plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres each having between 1 and 200 dissociated cells distributed within each Patient-Derived Micro-Organosphere.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some variations, a method as described herein for forming a plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may include: combining a dissociated tissue sample and a fluid matrix material to form an unpolymerized mixture; forming a plurality of droplets having less than a 25% variation in size of the droplets by converging a stream of the unpolymerized mixture with one or more streams of a fluid that is immiscible with the unpolymerized mixture; polymerizing the droplets to form a plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres having a diameter of between 50 and 500 &#x3bc;m with between 1 and 200 dissociated cells distributed therein; and separating the plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres from the fluid that is immiscible.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Any of these methods may include modifying the cells within the dissociated tissue sample prior to forming the droplets.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Forming the plurality of droplets may comprise forming a plurality of droplets of the unpolymerized mixture of uniform size with less than about 25% variation in size (e.g., less than about 20% variation in size, less than about 15% variation in size, less than about 10% variation in size, less than about 8% variation in size, less than about 5% variation in size, etc.). The variations in size may also be described as a narrow distribution of size variation. For example, the distribution of sizes may include a Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres size distribution (e.g., Micro-Organosphere diameter vs. the number of formed Micro-Organospheres) having a low standard deviation (e.g., a standard deviation of 15% or less, a standard deviation of 12% or less, a standard deviation of 10% or less, a standard deviation of 8% or less, a standard deviation of 6% or less, a standard deviation of 5% or less, etc.).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Any of these methods may also include plating or distributing the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres. For example, in some variations, the method may include combining Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres from various sources into a receptacle prior to assaying. For example, the Micro-Organospheres may be placed into a multi-well plate. Thus, any of these methods may include dispensing the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres into a multi-well plate prior to assaying the Patient-Derived Micro-Organosphere. One or more (or in some variations in equal amounts of) Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be included per well. In some variations applying the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres into a receptacle may include placing the Organospheres into a plurality of chambers that are separated by an at least partially permeable membrane to permit circulation of supernatant material between the chambers. This may allow the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres to share the same supernatant.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In any of these methods the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be assayed. An assay may generally include exposing or treating individual Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres to conditions (e.g., drug compositions) to determine if the drug composition has an effect on the cells of the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres (and in some cases, what effect it has). Assays may include exposing a subset of the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres (individually or in groups) to one or more concentrations of a drug composition, and allowing the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres to remain exposed for a predetermined time period (minutes, hours, days, etc.) and/or exposing and removing the drug composition, then culturing the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres for a predetermined time period. Thereafter the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be examined to identify any effects, including in particular toxicity on the cells in the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres, or a change in morphology and/or growth of the cells in the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres. In some variations assaying may include marking (e.g., by immunohistochemistry) live or fixed cells within the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres. Cells may be assayed (e.g., examined) manually or automatically. For example, cells may be examined to determine any toxicity (cell death) using an automated reader apparatus. In some variations assaying the plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may include sampling one or more of a supernatant, an environment, and a microenvironment of the Patient-Derived Micro-Organosphere for secreted factors and other effects. In any of these variations, the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be recovered following the assay for further assaying, expansion or preservation (e.g., cryopreserving, fixation, etc.) for subsequent examination.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As mentioned, virtually any assay may be used. For example, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomics, or meta-genomic markers (such as methylation) may be assayed using the PMOSs described herein.

For example, in some variations, the methods described herein may include combining the dissociated tissue sample and the fluid matrix material so that the dissociated tissue cell are distributed within the fluid matrix material to a density of less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>cells/ml (e.g., less than 9&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, 7&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, 5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, 3&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, 9&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml, 7&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml, 5&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml, etc.).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In general, forming the droplet may comprise forming the droplet from a continuous stream of the unpolymerized mixture. For example, forming the droplet may comprise applying one or more convergent streams of a fluid that is immiscible with the unpolymerized mixture to the stream of unpolymerized mixture. The streams may be combined in a microfluidic device, e.g., a device having a plurality of converging channels into which the unpolymerized mixture and the immiscible fluid interact to form droplets having a precisely controlled volume. In some variations the droplets are formed (e.g., pinched off) in an excess of the immiscible material, and the droplets may be concurrently and/or subsequently polymerized to form the Patient-Derived Micro-Organosphere. For example, the region in which the streams converge may be configured to polymerize the unpolymerized mixture after the droplet has been formed, e.g., by heating, and/or the regions downstream may be configured to polymerize the unpolymerized mixture after the droplets have been formed and are surrounded by the immiscible material. In some variations the immiscible material is heated (or alternatively cooled) to a temperature that promotes polymerization of the unpolymerized material, forming the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres. For example, polymerizing may comprise heating the droplet to greater than 35 degrees C.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thus, in any of these methods, forming the droplet may include forming the droplet in a fluid that is immiscible with the unpolymerized mixture.

Any of these methods may include adding the second fluid to a second reservoir in fluid communication with the second port. In some variations, receiving the second fluid comprises receiving an oil.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In general, these methods may include separating the second fluid (e.g., the immiscible fluid) from the plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres. This fluid may be manually or automatically separated. For example, the second (immiscible) fluid may be removed by washing, filtering, or any other appropriate method.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Combining the streams may comprise driving the stream of the unpolymerized mixture at a first flow rate across one or more streams of the second fluid which is traveling a second flow rate. In some variations the first flow rate is greater than the second flow rate. Either or both the flow rate and/or the amount of material (e.g., the unpolymerized mixture may be present in smaller amount than the second fluid, so that the unpolymerized mixture is encapsulated in a precisely-controlled droplet, as described herein, that may then be polymerized, e.g., within the second fluid.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some variations, combining the streams comprises driving the stream of the unpolymerized mixture across a junction into which the one or more streams of the second fluid also converge. Polymerizing the droplets may comprise heating the droplets to greater than a temperature at which the unpolymerized material polymerizes (e.g., greater than about 25 degrees C., greater than about 30 degrees C., greater than about 35 degrees C., etc.).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Any of these methods may include aliquoting the plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres. For example, aliquoting into a multi-well dish.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also described herein are methods of treating a patient using these Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres and methods of assaying them. For example a method may include: receiving a patient biopsy from a tumor; determining, within 2 weeks of taking of the biopsy, that the tumor will respond to a drug formulation by: forming, from the patient biopsy, a plurality of micro-organospheres having a diameter of between 50 and 500 &#x3bc;m with between 1 and 200 dissociated tumor cells distributed through a polymerized base material, and exposing at least some of the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres to the drug formulation before the dissociated tumor cells have undergone more than five passages; and measuring an effect of the drug formulation on the cells within the at least some of the micro-organospheres to determine if the drug will treat the tumor based on the determined effect.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some variations, these methods may include determining that the tumor is still responding to the drug formulation after one or more administrations of the drug by receiving a second patient biopsy after the patient has been treated with the drug formulation and forming a second plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres from the second patient biopsy, exposing at least some of the second plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres to the drug formulation, and measuring the effect of the drug formulation on cells within the at least some of the second plurality of micro-organospheres.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Determining that the tumor will respond to a drug formulation may include exposing at least some of the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres to a plurality of drug formulations, and reporting the measured effects for each of the drug formulations. In some variations, determining further comprises dispensing the micro-organospheres into a multi-well plate prior to assaying the Patient-Derived Micro-Organosphere.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Any of these methods may include biopsying the patient to collect the patient biopsy (or otherwise taking a tissue sample from a patient or a sample of a patient-derived tissues or cells) and/or treating the patient with the drug formulation, or assisting a physician in treating the patient (e.g., advising the physician as to which drug formulations would be effective). In general, the time between receiving the biopsy and reporting may be less than about 21 days (e.g., less than about 15 days, less than about 14 days, less than about 13 days, less than about 12 days, less than about 11 days, less than about 10 days, less than about 9 days, less than about 8 days, less than about 7 days, etc.).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The novel features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the claims that follow.

These Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres (&#x201c;PMOSs&#x201d; or &#x201c;Organospheres&#x201d;) may have a diameter of between about 50 &#x3bc;m and about 500 &#x3bc;m (e.g., between about 50 &#x3bc;m and about 400 &#x3bc;m, about 50 &#x3bc;m and about 300 &#x3bc;m, about 50 &#x3bc;m and about 250 &#x3bc;m, etc.), and may initially contain between about 1 and 1000 dissociated primary cells distributed within the base material (e.g., between about 1 and 750, between about 1 and 500, between about 1 and 400, between about 1 and 300, between about 1 and 200, between about 1 and 150, between about 1 and 100, between about 1 and 75, between about 1 and 50, between about 1 and 40, between about 1 and 30, between about 1 and 20, etc.).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Surprisingly, despite their small size (often between about 50-250 &#x3bc;m), and low cell density (e.g., often less than 100 cells per Micro-Organosphere), these Micro-Organosphere may be used immediately or cultured for a very brief period of time (e.g., 14 days or less, 10 days or less, 7 days or less, 5 days or less, etc.) and may allow the cells within the Micro-Organosphere to survive while maintaining much, if not all, of the characteristics of the tissue, including tumor tissue, from which they were extracted. The survival rate of the cells within the Micro-Organospheres is remarkably high, and the Micro-Organospheres may be cultured for days (or weeks) through multiple passages, in which the cells will divide, cluster and form structures similar to the parent tissue. Also surprisingly, in some variations, the cells from the dissociated tissue within the Micro-Organosphere forms morphological structures inside even the smallest Micro-Organospheres; although in some applications, the presence of such structures is not necessary for the utility of these Micro-Organospheres (e.g., they may be used before substantial structural reorganization has occurred) in some variations they may be particularly useful.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The methods and apparatuses described herein for forming and using Micro-Organospheres may be used to create many (e.g., greater than 10,000) Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres from a single biopsy. These Micro-Organospheres may be used screen for drug compositions that may predict what therapies may be effectively applied to the patient from whom the biopsy was taken. This may be useful, for example, in toxicity screen for drugs or other chemical compositions, from healthy normal tissue and/or from cancerous (e.g., tumor) tissue. In particular, the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres, methods and apparatuses for forming them and methods and apparatuses for testing them may be used for screening to identify one or more drug compositions that may effectively treat the patient (e.g., a cancer patient) prior to undergoing the drug therapy. This may allow, for example, very rapid screening of a cancer patient before they would otherwise undergo months of chemotherapy that may not be effective for them.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Thus, described herein are high-throughput drug screening methods (and apparatuses for performing these methods) using a single patient-specific biopsy (or other appropriate tissue/cell source). Described herein are droplet formed Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres that may be formed from patient-derived tumor samples that have been dissociated and suspended in a basement matrix (e.g., MATRIGEL). The Micro-Organospheres can be patterned onto a microfluidic microwell array, to be incubated, and dosed with drug compounds. This miniaturized assay maximizes the use of tumor samples, and enables more drug compounds to be screened from a core biopsy at much lower cost per sample.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Patient-derived models of cancer (PDMC), such as cell lines, organoids and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are increasingly being accepted as &#x201c;standard&#x201d; preclinical models to facilitate the identification and development of new therapeutics. For example, large-scale drug screens of cell lines and organoids derived from cancer patients have been used to identify sensitivity to a large number of potential therapeutics. PDXs are also used to predict drug response and identify novel drug combinations. Although precision medicine strategies are in development through the exploration of these various PDMC models, there are substantial barriers to their effective use. For example, patient derived organoids (PDO) are believed to be the most accurate in depicting patient tumors, as studies have shown that phenotypic and genotypic profiling of organoids often show a high degree of similarity to the original patient tumors. Unfortunately, at least two limitations hinder the use of PDO to guide therapy. Firstly, it takes several months to develop and test drug sensitivity in organoids, which decreases the clinical applicability. Secondly the number of organoids obtained from a clinically relevant 18-gauge core biopsy is not sufficient to perform high throughput drug screen. Ideally, an assay should be performed from a single core biopsy within 7-10 days. The Micro-Organospheres and methods of making and using them described herein may address these clinical limitations.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The details of one or more embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter are set forth in this document.

Exemplary materials that can be used to form a biocompatible medium in accordance with the presently-disclosed subject matter include, but are not limited to, polymers and hydrogels comprising collagen, fibrin, chitosan, MATRIGEL&#x2122; (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.), polyethylene glycol, dextrans including chemically crosslinkable or photo-crosslinkable dextrans, and the like, as well as electrospun biological, synthetic, or biological-synthetic blends. In some embodiments, the biocompatible medium is comprised of a hydrogel.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The term &#x201c;hydrogel&#x201d; is used herein to refer to two- or multi-component gels comprising a three-dimensional network of polymer chains, where water acts as the dispersion medium and fills the space between the polymer chains. Hydrogels used in accordance with the presently-disclosed subject matter are generally chosen for a particular application based on the intended use of the structure, taking into account the parameters that are to be used to form the Micro-Organospheres, as well as the effect the selected hydrogel will have on the behavior and activity of the biological materials (e.g., cells) incorporated into the biological suspensions that are to be placed in the structure. Exemplary hydrogels of the presently-disclosed subject matter can be comprised of polymeric materials including, but not limited to: alginate, collagen (including collagen types I and VI), elastin, keratin, fibronectin, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, polylactide, polyethylene glycol, polycaprolactone, polycolide, polydioxanone, polyacrylates, polyurethanes, polysulfones, peptide sequences, proteins and derivatives, oligopeptides, gelatin, elastin, fibrin, laminin, polymethacrylates, polyacetates, polyesters, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyanhydrides, polyamino acids carbohydrates, polysaccharides and modified polysaccharides, and derivatives and copolymers thereof as well as inorganic materials such as glass such as bioactive glass, ceramic, silica, alumina, calcite, hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate, bone, and combinations of all of the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">With further regard to the hydrogels used to produce the Micro-Organospheres described herein, in some embodiments, the hydrogel is comprised of a material selected from the group consisting of agarose, alginate, collagen type I, a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer (e.g., Pluronic&#xae; F127 (BASF Corporation, Mount Olive, N.J.)), silicone, polysaccharide, polyethylene glycol, and polyurethane. In some embodiments, the hydrogel is comprised of alginate.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The Micro-Organospheres described herein may also include biologically-relevant materials. The phrase &#x201c;biologically-relevant materials&#x201d; may describe materials that are capable of being included in a biocompatible medium as defined herein and subsequently interacting with and/or influencing biological systems. For example, in some implementations, the biologically-relevant materials are magnetic beads (i.e., beads that are magnetic themselves or that contain a material that responds to a magnetic field, such as iron particles) that can be combined as part of the unpolymerized material to produce Micro-Organosphere that can be used in the methods and compositions (e.g., for the separation and purification of Micro-Organospheres). As another example, in other implementations, the biologically-relevant materials may include additional cells, in addition to the dissociated tissue sample (e.g., biopsy) material. In the unpolymerized mixture the dissociated tissue sample and the additional biologically relevant material in a uniform mixture or as a distributed mixture (e.g., on just one half or other portion of the Micro-Organosphere, including just in the core or just in the outer region of the formed Micro-Organosphere). In some variations the additional biologically-relevant material within the unpolymerized material may be suspended with the dissociated tissue sample in suspension, e.g., prior to polymerization of the droplet forming the Micro-Organosphere.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In some variations the biologically relevant material that may be included with the dissociated tissue sample (e.g., biopsy) material may contain a number of cell types, including preadipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), endothelial progenitor cells, T cells, B cells, mast cells, and adipose tissue macrophages, as well as small blood vessels or microvascular fragments found within the stromal vascular fraction.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In general, with respect to the dissociated tissue sample, e.g., biopsy, material that is included in the Micro-Organospheres described herein, these tissues may be any appropriate tissue from a patient, typically taken by biopsy. Although non-biopsy tissue may be used, in general, these tissues (and the resulting dissociated cells) may be primary cell taken from a patient biopsy as described above, e.g., by a needle biopsy. Tissues may be from a healthy tissue biopsy or from cancerous (e.g., tumor) cell biopsy. The dissociated cells may be incorporated into a Micro-Organosphere of the presently-disclosed subject matter, based on the intended use of that Micro-Organosphere. For example, relevant tissues (e.g., dissociated biopsy tissue) may typically include cells that are commonly found in that tissue or organ (or tumor, etc.). In that regard, exemplary relevant cells that can be incorporated into Micro-Organosphere of the presently-disclosed subject matter include neurons, cardiomyocytes, myocytes, chondrocytes, pancreatic acinar cells, islets of Langerhans, osteocytes, hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, fibroblasts, myoblasts, satellite cells, endothelial cells, adipocytes, preadipocytes, biliary epithelial cells, and the like. These types of tissues may be dissociated by conventional techniques known in the art. Suitable biopsied tissue can be derived from: bone marrow, skin, cartilage, tendon, bone, muscle (including cardiac muscle), blood vessels, corneal, neural, brain, gastrointestinal, renal, liver, pancreatic (including islet cells), lung, pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, lymphatic, salivary, ovarian, testicular, cervical, bladder, endometrial, prostate, vulval and esophageal tissue. Normal or diseased (e.g., cancerous) tissue may be used. In some variations, the tissue may arise from tumor tissue, including tumors originating in any of these normal tissues.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Once formed the Micro-Organospheres may be cryopreserved and/or cultured. Cultured Micro-Organospheres may be maintained in suspension, either static (e.g., in a well, vial, etc.) or in motion (e.g., rolling or agitated). The Micro-Organosphere may be cultured using known culturing techniques. Exemplary techniques can be found in, among other places; Freshney, Culture of Animal Cells, A Manual of Basic Techniques, 4th ed., Wiley Liss, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, 2000; Basic Cell Culture: A Practical Approach, Davis, ed., Oxford University Press, 2002; Animal Cell Culture: A Practical Approach, Masters, ed., 2000; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,516,681 and 5,559,022.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In some variations the Micro-Organospheres are formed by forming a droplet of the unpolymerized mixture (e.g., in some variations a chilled mixture) of a dissociated tissue sample and a fluid matrix material in an immiscible material, such as a fluid hydrophobic material (e.g., oil). For example, a Micro-Organosphere may be formed by combining a stream of unpolymerized material with one or more streams of the immiscible material to form a droplet. The density of the cells present in the droplet may be determined by the dilution of the dissociated material (e.g., cells) in the unpolymerized material. The size of the Micro-Organosphere may correlate to the size of the droplet formed. In general, the Micro-Organosphere is a spherical structure having a stable geometry.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The practice of the presently disclosed subject matter can employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of cell biology, cell culture, molecular biology, transgenic biology, microbiology, recombinant DNA, and immunology, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature.

In some variations a drug formulation refers to a formulation comprising a mixture of a drug and one or more inactive ingredients.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">As used here the term &#x201c;passaged&#x201d; may refer to the average number of doublings of the cells within the Micro-Organospheres. Although traditional passage number refers to the transfer or subculture of cells from one culture vessel to another, the cells within a Micro-Organospheres may be stably retained within the same Micro-Organospheres, and may continue to grow and divide. Thus, the passage number as used herein typically refers to the average number of doublings undergone by the dissociated cells from the biopsied tissue within the Micro-Organospheres. The population doubling number is the approximate number of doublings that the cell population has undergone since isolation (e.g., since forming of the Micro-Organospheres from the freshly dissociated biopsy tissue). In general, the Micro-Organospheres described herein may be cultured for a short period of time relative to the growth, e.g., doublings, of some or all of cells within the Micro-Organospheres (e.g., fewer than 10 passages, fewer than 9 passages, fewer than 8 passages, fewer than 7 passages, fewer than 6 passages, fewer than 5 passages, fewer than 4 passages, fewer than 3 passages, etc.).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">During culturing, the cells from the dissociated, biopsied tissue in the Micro-Organospheres can aggregate, cluster or assemble within the Micro-Organospheres. Aggregates of cells may be highly organized, and may form defined morphology or may be a mass of cells that have clustered or adhered together. The organization may reflecting the tissue of origin. Although in some variations the Micro-Organospheres may contain a single cell type (homotypic), more typically these Micro-Organospheres may contain more than one cell type (heterotypic).</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">As mentioned, the (e.g., biopsy) tissue used to form the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres (e.g., the dissociated tissue) may be derived from a normal or healthy biological tissue, or from a biological tissue afflicted with a disease or illness, such as a tissue or fluid derived from a tumor. The tissue used in the Micro-Organospheres may include cells of the immune system, such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. The cells may be stem cells, progenitor cells or somatic cells. The tissue may be mammalian cells such as human cells or cells from animals such as mice, rats, rabbits, and the like.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In general, these tissue (and resulting cells) may generally be taken from a biopsy to form the Micro-Organospheres. Thus, the tissue may be derived from any of a biopsy, a surgical specimen, an aspiration, a drainage, or a cell-containing fluid. Suitable cell-containing fluids include any of blood, lymph, sebaceous fluid, urine, cerebrospinal fluid or peritoneal fluid. For example, in patients with transcoelomic metastasis, ovarian or colon cancer cells may be isolated from peritoneal fluid. Similarly, in patients with cervical cancer, cervical cancer cells may be taken from the cervix, for example by large excision of the transformation zone or by cone biopsy. Typically, such Micro-Organospheres will contain multiple cell types that are resident in the tissue or fluid of origin. The cells may be obtained directly from the subject without intermediate steps of subculture, or they may first undergo an intermediate culturing step to produce a primary culture. Methods for harvesting cells from biological tissue and/or cell containing fluids are well known in the art. For example, techniques used to obtain cells from biological tissue include those described by R. Mahesparan (Extracellular matrix-induced cell migration from glioblastoma biopsy specimens in vitro. <i>Acta Neuropathol </i>(1999) 97:231-239).</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Generally, the cells are first dissociated or separated from each other before forming the Micro-Organospheres. Dissociation of cells may be accomplished by any conventional means known in the art. Preferably, the cells are treated mechanically and/or chemically, such as by treatment with enzymes. By &#x2018;mechanically&#x2019; we include the meaning of disrupting connections between associated cells, for example, using a scalpel or scissors or by using a machine such as an homogenizer. By &#x2018;enzymatically&#x2019; we include the meaning of treating the cells with one or more enzymes disrupt connections between associated cells, including for example any of collagenase, dispases, DNAse and/or hyaluronidase. One or more enzymes may be used under different reaction conditions, such as incubation at 37&#xb0; C. in a water bath or at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The dissociated tissue may be treated to remove dead and/or dying cells and/or cell debris. The removal of such dead and/or dying cells may be accomplished by any conventional means known to those skilled in the art, for example using beads and/or antibody methods. It is known, for example, that phosphatidylserine is redistributed from the inner to outer plasma membrane leaflet in apoptotic or dead cells. The use of Annexin V-Biotin binding followed by binding of the biotin to streptavidin magnetic beads enables the separation of apoptotic cells from living cells. Similarly, removal of cell debris may be achieved by any suitable technique in the art, including, for example, filtration.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The dissociated cells may be suspended in a carrier material prior to combining with the fluid matrix material, and/or the fluid matrix material may be referred to as a carrier material. In some variations the carrier material may be a material that has a viscosity level that delays sedimentation of cells in a cell suspension prior to polymerization and formation of the Micro-Organospheres. A carrier material may have sufficient viscosity to allow the dissociated biopsy tissue cells to remain suspended in the suspension until polymerization. The viscosity required to achieve this can be optimized by the skilled person by monitoring the sedimentation rate at various viscosities and selecting a viscosity that gives an appropriate sedimentation rate for the expected time delay between loading the cell suspension into the apparatus forming the Micro-Organospheres forming the Micro-Organospheres by polymerizing the droplets of the unpolymerized material including the cells. In some variations the unpolymerized material may be flowed or agitated by the apparatus even where lower viscosity materials are used, in order to keep the cells in suspension and/or distributed as desired.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">As mentioned above, in some variations the unpolymerized mixture, including the dissociated tissue sample and the fluid matrix material may include one or more components, e.g., biologically-relevant materials. For example, a biologically-relevant material that may be included may include any of: an extracellular matrix protein (e.g. fibronectin), a drug (e.g. small molecules), a peptide, or an antibody (e.g., to modulate any of cell survival, proliferation or differentiation); and/or an inhibitor of a particular cellular function. Such biologically-relevant materials may be used, for example, to increase cell viability by reducing cell death and/or activation of cell growth/replication or to otherwise mimic the in vivo environment. The biologically-relevant materials may include or may mimic one or more of the following components: serum, interleukins, chemokines, growth factors, glucose, physiological salts, amino acids and hormones. For example, the biologically-relevant materials may supplement one or more agents in the fluid matrix material. In some variations, the fluid matrix material is a synthetic gel (hydrogel) and may be supplemented by one or more biologically-relevant materials. In some variations the fluid matrix is a natural gel. Thus, the gel may be comprised of one or more extracellular matrix components such as any of collagen, fibrinogen, laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin, hyaluronic acid, fibrin, alginate, agarose and chitosan. For example, MATRIGEL comprises bioactive polymers that are important for cell viability, proliferation, development and migration. For example, the matrix material may be a gel that comprises collagen type 1 such as collagen type 1 obtained from rat tails. The gel may be a pure collagen type 1 gel or may be one that contains collagen type 1 in addition to other components, such as other extracellular matrix proteins. A synthetic gel may refer to a gel that does not naturally occur in nature. Examples of synthetic gels include gels derived from any of polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate (PHEMA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly ethylene oxide (PEO).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres</heading><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Examples of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C, <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C, <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>E</figref>.

As mentioned above, this matrix material may be natural polymers, such as one or more of: alginate, agarose, hyaluronic acid, collagen, gelatin, fibrin, elastin; or a synthetic polymer, such as one or more of: polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyacrylamide. Both organic and inorganic synthetic polymers may be used.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some variations the number of cells initially included in the Micro-Organospheres may be selected from between 1 cell up to several hundred. In particular, in some assays (e.g., drug toxicity assays) it may be beneficial to include between about 1-75 or between about 1-50 (e.g., lower numbers of cells). The number of cells per Micro-Organosphere may be set or selected by the user. In some variations, as described below, the apparatus will include one or more controls to set the number of cells from the primary tissue to include in each Micro-Organosphere. The number of cells may be chosen or set based on how the user intends to use the Micro-Organospheres. For example, Micro-Organospheres having very low number of cells (e.g., 1 cell per Micro-Organosphere, 1-5 cells per Micro-Organosphere, etc.) may be particularly suitable for studying clonal diversity (e.g., for tumor heterogeneity). Since each Micro-Organosphere grows from a single cell, we can observe which clones are drug resistant and these specific Micro-Organospheres may be examined (e.g., by genomic sequencing) to determine the genomic (mutation) diversity related to the particular clone. A low to moderate number of cells per Micro-Organosphere (e.g., between about 3-30 cells, 5-30 cells, 5-25 cells, 5-20 cells, 10-25 cells, etc.) may be particularly useful for rapid drug testing, including toxicity testing as these Micro-Organospheres typically grow quickly. A larger number of cells per Micro-Organosphere (e.g., between about 20-100 cells, e.g., 30-100 cells, 40-100 cells, greater than 50 cells, etc.) may be particularly suitable for mimicking tissue composition in each Micro-Organosphere, as the Micro-Organosphere may contain different lineages, potentially including epithelial (or cancer, etc.) and mesenchymal (or stromal, immune, blood vessel, etc.) cells.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The Micro-Organospheres may be formed in any appropriate size, which may be matched to the number of cells to be included. For example, the size may be as small as about 20 &#x3bc;m, up to 500 &#x3bc;m in diameter (e.g., 50 or 100 &#x3bc;m on average, e.g., between about 100-200 &#x3bc;m, etc.). In some variations the size is about 300 &#x3bc;m in which between about 10-50 cells (e.g., between about 10-30 cells) are included in each Micro-Organosphere. The number of cells and the size may be varied and/or may be controlled. In some variations the number of cells and/or the size of the Micro-Organospheres may be set by one or more controls on the apparatus forming the Micro-Organospheres. For example, the size of the Micro-Organospheres and/or the density of cells within the Micro-Organospheres may be adjusted by adjusting the flow rates and/or the concentration of the dissociated tissue sample (e.g., the cells from a biopsy).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref>, even after culturing the Micro-Organospheres described herein allow for viable and healthy cells through the entire volume of the Micro-Organosphere. The size of the Micro-Organospheres and/or the number of cells to be included in the Micro-Organospheres may be selected based on how the Micro-Organospheres are expected or intended to be used. For example, in variations in which the Micro-Organospheres is to be used to examine relationships between cells of the biopsied material the Micro-Organospheres may be formed having multiple cells and may be cultured for extended periods of time (e.g., up to one week or more).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres described herein may be made by combining a dissociated tissue sample, e.g., a biopsy sample, with a fluid matrix that may be polymerized in a controlled manner to form the Micro-Organospheres. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates one method of forming Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres. Optionally, the method may include taking the sample from a patient, such as taking a biopsy from a patient tissue <b>601</b>. As mentioned above, the biopsy may be taken, e.g., using a biopsy needle or punch. For example, the biopsy may be taken with a 14-gauge, a 16-gauge, an 18-gauge, etc. needle that is inserted into the patient tissue to remove the biopsy. After removing the tissue from the patient, the tissue may be processed to dissociate the material, either mechanically and/or chemically. The dissociated cells may be immediately used to form the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres, as described; in some variations, all or some of the cells may be modified, such as by genetically modifying the cells <b>603</b>, for example, by transfection, electroporation, etc.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The dissociated tissue sample from the biopsy material may be combined with the fluid (e.g., liquid) matrix material to form the unpolymerized mixture <b>605</b>. This unpolymerized mixture may be held in an unpolymerized state, so that the cells from the dissociated tissue may remain suspended within the mixture. In some variations the cell may remain suspected and unpolymerized by keeping them chilled, e.g., at room temperature of below (e.g., between 1-25 degrees C.).</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The unpolymerized mixture may then be dispensed as droplets, e.g., into an immiscible material, such as an oil, in a manner that controls the formation of the size of the droplets and therefore the size of the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres formed <b>607</b>. For example, uniformly-sized droplets may be formed by combining a stream of the unpolymerized material into one or more (e.g., two converging) streams of the immiscible material (e.g., oil) so that the flow rates and/or pressures of the two streams may determine how droplets of the unpolymerized material are formed as they intersect the immiscible material. The droplets may be polymerized <b>609</b> to form the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres (PMOSs) in the immiscible material. In some variations the immiscible material may be heated or warmed to a temperature that causes the unpolymerized mixture (e.g., the fluid matrix material in the unpolymerized material) to polymerize. Once formed, the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be separated from the immiscible fluid, e.g., the PMOSs may be washed to remove the immiscible fluid <b>611</b>, and placed in a culture media to allow the cells within the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres to grow. The Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be cultured for any desired time, or may be cryopreserved and/or assayed immediately. In some variations the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be cultured for a brief period of time (e.g., for between 1-3 days, between 1-4 days, between 1-5 days, between 1-6 days, between 1-7 days, between 1-8 days, between 1-9 days, between 1-10 days, between 1-11 days, between 1-14 days etc.). This may allow the cells derived from the dissociated biopsy tissue to grow and/or divide (e.g., double) for up to five or six passages. After culturing, the cells may be either or both cryopreserved <b>615</b> and/or assayed <b>617</b>. Examples of assays that may be used are also described herein.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In any of these methods and apparatuses described herein, the Micro-Organospheres may be recovered from the immiscible fluid (e.g., oil) after polymerization. For example, in some variations, the Micro-Organospheres may be recovered by demulsficiation and/or de-emulsification, for example, by forming emulsified droplets and recovering the Micro-Organospheres after the droplets are formed to remove any oil (and other contaminants). This may allow the cells to grow within the polymerized droplet (the Micro-Organosphere) without being inhibited by the immiscible fluid.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Although the methods and apparatuses described herein illustrate methods of forming the plurality of droplets, and thus the plurality of Micro-Organospheres, by streaming the unpolymerized mixture into one or more streams of immiscible fluid (such as an oil or other hydrophobic material), ins some variations the droplets may be formed by other methods that may allow for the size of the droplet to be controlled as described herein. For example in some variations the droplets may be formed by printing (e.g., by printing droplets onto a surface). This may reduce or eliminate the need for an additional recovery step of emulsification/de-emulsification. For example, the droplets may be printed onto a surface, such as a flat or shaped surface, and polymerized. In any of these variations, the droplets may be dispensed using pressure, sound, charge, etc. In some variations, the droplets may be formed using an automatic dispenser (e.g., pipetting device) adapted to release the small amount of the unpolymerized mixture onto a surface, into the air, and/or into a liquid medium (including an immiscible fluid).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The method for forming the Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be automated, or performing using one or more apparatuses.

Thus, in some variations, a minced (e.g., dissociated) clinical (e.g., biopsy or resected) sample of tissue, such as &#x3c;1 mm in diameter, may be is mixed with a temperature-sensitive gel (i.e. MATRIGEL, at 4 degrees C.) to form the unpolymerized mixture. This unpolymerized mixture may be placed into the microfluidic device that may generates droplets (e.g., water-in-oil droplets) that are uniform in volume and material composition. Simultaneously, the dissociated tumor cells may be partitioned into these droplets. The gel in the unpolymerized material may solidify upon heating (e.g., at 37 degrees C.), and the resulting Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres may be formed.

These Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres are compatible with traditional 3D cell culture techniques. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a plurality of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres <b>1005</b> formed as described above, suspended in the immiscible material <b>1008</b> (e.g., oil).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In the exemplary microfluidics chip illustrated above, the junction is shown as a T- or X-junction in which the flow focusing of the microfluidics forms the controllable size of the Micro-Organospheres.

Alternatively in some variations the droplets of unpolymerized material may be formed in the requisite dimensions and reproducibility by micro-capillary generation. Other example of techniques that may alternatively be used for forming the Micro-Organospheres in the specified size range and reproducibility from the unpolymerized material may include colloid manipulation, e.g., via external forces such as acoustics, magnetics, inertial, electrowetting, or gravitational.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> shows examples of Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres in oil formed as described above.

For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref> illustrates Micro-Organospheres having tumor cells (similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref>) that may be washed to remove the immiscible material (e.g., oil). This immiscible material may be removed relatively quickly after forming the Micro-Organospheres in order to prevent harm to the cells within the Micro-Organosphere.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In these examples, the gel droplets are recovered from the oil phase and resuspended, e.g., into PBS via PFO (perfluoro octanol) and centrifugation. This may separate the immiscible fluid from the Micro-Organospheres. Thus, these Micro-Organospheres, including tumor-based Micro-Organospheres, can be successfully grown, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C, <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C, <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>E</figref>, above, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. This is an important improvement, as drug screening has to be performed on viable and growing primary tumor cells that retain their properties from patient tumors to predict patient outcomes. The high number and uniformity of these Micro-Organospheres makes screening both possible and reliable, as will be described below.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In any of the microfluidic chips or devices described herein, the channels may be coated. For example, the channel of the microfluidic device may be coated with a hydrophobic material.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">In general, the Micro-Organospheres described herein are highly uniform in diameter, and may have a very low size, e.g., diameter, variance.

The Micro-Organospheres formed as droplets in this manner may contain growth-factors and matrix to mimic the biological environment from which the tissue arose. Patient samples (e.g., biopsy samples) may be formed in to Micro-Organospheres (including hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of Micro-Organospheres) within a few hours of acquiring the tissue. The Micro-Organospheres may have as few as 1 or between 4-6 cells (e.g., cancer cells when sampling a tumor) per Micro-Organospheres or as many as hundreds of cells. These methods have been shown to work for virtually all types of cancer and non-cancer tissues tested to date (n=20), including colon, esophagus, melanoma, uterus, sarcoma, renal, liver, ovary, lung, diaphragm, omentum, mediastinal lung, and breast cancer tissues. The Micro-Organospheres may be cultured for any desired period of time, and typically show proliferation and growth in as few as 3-4 days. They may be maintained and passaged for months. As will be described in greater detail below, they may be used to screen thousands of drug compositions within as few as 4-6 days from taking the tissue (e.g., biopsy).</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">The Micro-Organospheres described herein may, at any point after they are formed, be banked, e.g., by cryopreserving them. Tumor Micro-Organospheres may be collect from many different patients and may be used individual or collectively to screen multiple drug formulations to determine toxicity and/or efficacy. Non-tumorous cells (healthy tissue) may be biopsied, banded and/or screened in parallel. Thus, these methods and apparatuses may allow for high throughput screening. In some variations, the Micro-Organospheres may be formed and allowed to passage twice (e.g., two doublings), and cryopreserved. As mentioned normal, healthy tissue may be use to form these same Micro-Organospheres to generate hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of Micro-Organospheres that may be used for assaying drug effects, drug response, biomarkers, proteoimic signals, genomic signals, etc.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">It is of particular significance that these Micro-Organospheres survive in a biologically significant manner, allowing them to provide clinically and physiologically relevant data, particularly with respect to drug response, as will be described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A-<b>22</b>D and <b>23</b>A-<b>23</b>D</figref>. In particular, the Micro-Organospheres described herein permit tissue extract/biopsy originated cells to grow exceptionally well and provide more representative data, especially as compared to organoids or spheroids. Without being bound by a particular theory, this may be because the cells may have a more constrained cell density in the Micro-Organospheres, permitting cells to communicate without inhibiting each other while sharing signals. The Micro-Organospheres also have a very large surface to volume ratio, more readily permitting transmission of growth factors and other signals to penetrate into the Micro-Organospheres (e.g., the Micro-Organospheres are less diffusion limited).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Assays</heading><p id="p-0157" num="0156">The Patient-Derived Micro-Organospheres described herein may be used in a variety of different assays, and in particular may be used to determine drug formulation effects, including toxicity, on normal and/or abnormal (e.g., cancerous) tissue. For example, drug screening may include applying Micro-Organospheres into all or some wells of multi-well (e.g., a 96-well) plate. Alternatively custom plates may be used (e.g., a 10,000 micro-well array may be formed of a 100&#xd7;100 wells). The Micro-Organospheres (e.g., gel droplets) may be applied into, or in some variations onto the multiple microwell arrays and incubated with culture medium. The Micro-Organospheres may be cultured over the course of 3-5 days. In some variations, on day 5, the wells (e.g., micro-reactors) may then be dosed with drug compounds, e.g., based on a set of FDA-approved anticancer drugs, to examine the effects of the drug panel. For example, the drugs texted may be based on the National Cancer Institute (Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (11)) screen, consisting of 147 agents intended to enable cancer research, drug discovery and combination drug studies. On Day 7, the Micro-Organospheres may be imaged via standard fluorescent microscopy and ranked based on drug response.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">An example of this assaying technique is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>E</figref>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">In this example, the screening assay may be automated.

Thereafter, the Micro-Organospheres may be recovered and washed (e.g., to remove the immiscible (e.g., oil) material in which they were formed.

Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>E</figref>, on day 7, the cells in the Micro-Organospheres may be imaged and/or automatically or manually scored to identify drug effects (e.g., drug screening and growth profiling).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">The workflow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>E</figref> may enable an integrated device to be used for growing, dosing and/or reviewing the Micro-Organospheres. In one exemplary device, freshly biopsied or resected patient tumor samples may be disassociated and seeded into gel with regents to form the Micro-Organospheres (as described above). A portion of the Micro-Organospheres formed may be cryopreserved. The rest may be recovered and incubated until seeded into microwell plates for drug testing or screening as just described. Growth and viability assays may be performed on the Micro-Organospheres, which may be imaged and tracked. Their response to drug treatments, such as IC-50, cytotoxicity, and growth curves, may be measured to identify effective therapeutics against the patient's tumor.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">The methods and apparatuses described herein have numerous advantages, including reproducibility. The sample preparation process may be automated by the microfluidic sample partitioning which may reduce the need for specialized personnel for diagnostic testing and manual pipetting. This may be particularly helpful in a clinical setting. Moreover, this may enable uniformity among signal droplets, increasing assay sensitivity. In addition, these assays may minimize the time required to generate Micro-Organospheres. Based on preliminary data, these methods may be able to generate a library of over 100,000 MATRIGEL-tumor droplets (Micro-Organospheres) in less than about 15 minutes. These methods are also highly scalable, and can be multiplexed to run multiple patient biopsies in parallel.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Finally, these methods are flexable and compatible with other techniques. As a research tool, droplet-based microfluidics is generally compatible with a wide range of hydrogel materials such as agarose, alginate, PEG, and hyaluronic acid). As such, the starting gel composition can easily be modified to accompany and encourage Micro-Organospheres growth. Moreover, the droplet-size can be adjusted by modifying the size of our microfluidic device. Together, these allow a large selection of gel material composition and micro-reactor sizes.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">The miniaturized assays described here, e.g., using the Micro-Organospheres, may maximizes the patient tumor biopsy, enabling more drug compounds to be screened. For example, a 600 uL tumor sample can be partitioned into &#x2dc;143,000 individual micro-reactors that are &#x2dc;4 nL in volume. By maximizing the tissue sample, multiple experimental replicates may be examined, increasing statistical power. These techniques may allow the inspection of intra-tumor heterogeneity, drug perturbation and identify rare cellular events, such as drug resistance. The Micro-Organospheres may generally be compatible with downstream assays including single cell RNA transcriptome analysis and epigenetic profiling. In addition, by maximizing the tissue (e.g., biopsy) sample efficiency as provided by the Micro-Organospheres, a portion of the Micro-Organospheres may be banked (e.g., by cryopreservation for biobanking) for future novel drug assays and/or for confirmation analysis, including genetic screening.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref> illustrate example of therapeutic methods that use the methods and apparatuses, including the Micro-Organospheres, described herein. For precision and personalized medicine, these methods and apparatuses can be used as a clinical indicator for appropriate drug selection to improve clinical outcome and drug response. As one embodiment, a patient diagnosed with metastatic cancer will take a biopsy for histopathology and for screening of a plurality of Micro-Organospheres formed from a biopsy as described herein. Within 7&#x2dc;10 days, the screening may be performed from the biopsy to identify the most effective standard-of-care therapy so the patient can start treatment around 14 days.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">An example of this is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>.

This same step (forming the Micro-Organospheres and screening) may be used to guide precision medicine at multiple clinical decision points throughout disease progression. In this example, therapy using the identified one or more drug compositions may be started on day 14 <b>1809</b>, and the patient may later be monitoring during the course of treatment (e.g., a follow-up CT scan on about day 90) to confirm that the tumor is responding to the treatment <b>1811</b>.

This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. For example, when a patient is first diagnosed <b>1907</b> with a resectable primary tumor, this technique (e.g., generation of Micro-Organospheres and screening <b>1905</b>) can be used to determine the most effective neoadjuvant therapy <b>1921</b>. Thus, a biopsy may be taken and hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of Micro-Organospheres may be formed and screened with a panel of potential drug compositions. Once the primary tumor is resected <b>1923</b>, this technique <b>1905</b>&#x2032; may indicate whether and which adjuvant therapy should be chosen <b>1925</b>. If recurrence or metastasis happens after the surgical removal of the primary tumor <b>1927</b>, the same technique (e.g., generating and screening Micro-Organospheres from a fresh biopsy <b>1905</b>&#x2033;, <b>1905</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;, <b>195</b>&#x2033;&#x2033;) can be used to guide standard-of-care therapy, including 1st 1929, 2nd 1931, and 3rd line <b>1933</b> therapies. If the patient eventually becomes tolerant or resistant to all standard-of-care therapy, this technique <b>1905</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;&#x2033; can be performed to identify off-label drugs to treat resistant tumors <b>1935</b>. This technique can also be used as companion diagnostics to identify patients for a specific treatment. Lastly, the technique can be used to derive and preserve patient-derived Micro-Organospheres to establish Organosphere-base living cancer bank for screening, genomic profiling, new drug discovery, drug testing and clinical trial design.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Because these techniques, and the generation of a huge number of Micro-Organospheres may be done relatively low-invasively (e.g., by resection or biopsy), to provide reasonably fast results from the screening, these methods may be easily adapted for standard of care. For example, the volume of cellular material from the tissue (e.g., biopsy) input is quite small, and may be dissociated into a volume of, e.g., between 10 &#x3bc;L to 5 ml.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In general, the use of the Micro-Organospheres described herein for screening may be automated or manually performed.
