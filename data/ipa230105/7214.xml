These ferrite splitter circuits are structured in many different ways to include additional intermediate circuits to achieve acceptable in-home performance for the CATV bandwidths (e.g., 5-1002 MHz) and MoCA bandwidths (e.g., 1125-1675 MHz). In such ferrite core splitters, however, the extension of bandwidth and/or the addition of intermediate circuits both increase input-to-output losses and have high isolation in the output-to-output MoCA band with notches that may cause loss of in-band signals. The notches are prevalent in both the CATV and MoCA bandwidths. The notches are amplified by circuit mismatches and altering intra-device line lengths. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a new reflection-less adapter that will absorb or attenuate the out-of-band signals, preventing such transmitted or reflected signals from introducing noise into a coupled access or CATV network.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A system includes a first device.

The RNA may also provide (e.g., complete) isolation of the non-in-home network signals (e.g., the CATV access network signals and/or noise). The RNA may provide isolation in a number of ways more desirable than with the use of a reflective filter, and thus, in some embodiments, the reflective filter may be omitted. The RNA creates a path that absorbs, attenuates, or terminates the CATV access signals (i.e., non-in-home signals) from reflecting at the input or transmitting through from the output to the input to prevent them from creating interference reflections back into the coupled network. The coupled network is the &#x201c;CATV access network&#x201d; which is coupled at the output of an access network device (such as a MoCA amplifier or splitter) and the input on an in-home network device. The RNA passes the in-home signals.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The RNA may be used to couple the CATV network and the MoCA (i.e., in-home) network, which is new to the industry because the industry is transitioning to a more isolated in-home network architecture, which includes MoCA-only devices and isolation from the CATV access network. In the past, coupling or cascading devices typically passed all of the CATV and MoCA network signals, for example, using a CATV/MoCA entry amplifier and a passive CATV/MoCA splitter. The RNA may be used in the conventional ferrite-based CATV/MoCA splitter devices and in in-home-only resistive splitter devices to improve service and coupling between the networks. The RNA minimizes or eliminates interference and noise signals.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The RNA may create a coupling or common point where an in-home splitter can adapt to existing access equipment that also passes the MoCA signals. One way to accomplish this is to first pass the high-frequency (e.g., MoCA) signals but not the low-frequency (e.g., CATV) signals in the upstream direction. This may help with noise mitigation. Secondly, because the access network passes all frequencies, it needs a good match at all frequencies. The RNA may absorb, attenuate, or terminate the low-frequency (e.g., CATV) signals so that they are not passed into the in-home network. This may prevent reflections outside the in-home network. Thus, when the two networks are attached together with the RNA positioned therebetween, neither network is disrupted. The RNA also helps to maintain good return loss and minimize interference. This is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, which are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment, the RNA may be constructed with a diplexer that terminates the low frequency band into a matched terminator. The RNA may also incorporate an attenuator in the low frequency band. The low frequency band may be an isolated output or a coupled output. The high-pass section may provide adequate rejection to block ingress noise.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic view of a system <b>100</b> including a RNA <b>110</b>, according to an embodiment.

The CATV device <b>120</b> may be or include an active entry device that passes back and forth non-in-home signals in the CATV bandwidth (e.g., 5-1002 MHz).

It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as &#x201c;open&#x201d; terms (e.g., the term &#x201c;including&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;including but not limited to,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;having&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;having at least,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;includes but is not limited to,&#x201d; etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; or &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and indefinite articles such as &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;a&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;an&#x201d; should be interpreted to mean &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; or &#x201c;one or more&#x201d;); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of &#x201c;two recitations,&#x201d; without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, and C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c; a system having at least one of A, B, and C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, or C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c; a system having at least one of A, B, or C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase &#x201c;A or B&#x201d; will be understood to include the possibilities of &#x201c;A&#x201d; or &#x201c;B&#x201d; or &#x201c;A and B.&#x201d; In addition, where features or aspects of the disclosure are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
