The motor usually has a drive shaft, which transmits the force applied by the motor to an output shaft via a gear mechanism. Gear mechanisms are known to be elastic and non-linear, which means that the speed of the motor does not behave linearly either after the transmission ratio has been increased or reduced by the gear mechanism. Therefore, the elasticity of the gear mechanism under load causes an rotary angle displacement between the expected rotary angle position of the output shaft and the actual rotary angle position of the output shaft. In known systems, in order to avoid such a rotary angle offset, a second rotary angle measuring system is arranged on the output shaft, which system directly detects the movement of the output shaft. Additional sensors such as strain gauges are used to determine the torque that acts between the two shafts. Overall, a large number of sensors is required, and therefore such systems are complicated and expensive.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The object of the invention is therefore to provide a device for determining the torque and/or the rotary angle between a first shaft and a second shaft which has a simpler structure and can be produced more cost-effectively.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The object is achieved according to the invention by a device for determining the torque and/or the rotary angle between a first shaft and a second shaft with the features of claim <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Advantageous embodiments and developments of the invention are specified in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The device according to the invention for determining the torque and/or the rotary angle between a first shaft and a second shaft, which are coupled via a gear mechanism to rotate relative to one another about an axis of rotation, wherein the first shaft has a first end region, a second end region, and an end region parallel to the axis of rotation has a first direction vector pointing from the first end region to the second end region, and the second shaft has a first end region, a second end region, and a second direction vector pointing parallel to the axis of rotation from the first end region to the second end region, is characterized in that the first shaft is designed as a hollow shaft and the second shaft is arranged coaxially in the first shaft in such a way that the first direction vector and the second direction vector have the same orientation, and that the first end region of the first shaft has a first measurement standard and the first end region of the second shaft has a second measurement standard, wherein the first measurement standard is scanned by a first sensor and the second measurement standard by a second sensor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The basic idea of the invention is to insert one shaft into the other shaft, which is designed as a hollow shaft, and to arrange the measurement standards at the same end of the two shafts in close proximity to one another, which can be scanned by two sensors that are also located in close proximity to each other. Instead of two spatially separate rotary angle measuring systems, two measurement standards arranged in close proximity to each other can be scanned, whereby the rotary angle position of each of the two shafts can be determined. At the same time, this arrangement also enables the torque to be determined in a simple manner, which results from a rotary angle offset between the expected rotary angle position of the second shaft, for example the output shaft, and the actual rotary angle position of the second shaft, for example the output shaft, for example at a predetermined torque of a motor connected to the first shaft or by fixing the first shaft and measuring the resulting rotary angle on the second shaft under load.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the two sensors are arranged on the face side in front of the first end region of the two shafts, which enables a compact structure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The two sensors are particularly preferably arranged on a single printed circuit board, as a result of which the number of components required can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a particularly advantageous development of the invention, the sensors are designed as optical scanning elements and the measurement standards as reflective measurement standards. Such angle measuring systems are particularly robust and enable a high resolution of the rotary angle to be detected.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The two measurement standards are preferably designed to be circumferential in order to be able to detect the rotary angle in a simple manner</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Particularly preferably, the first measurement standard is arranged on a first element in the shape of a disk ring, which element is arranged on the first end region of the first shaft, and the second measurement standard is arranged on a second element in the shape of a disk ring, which element is arranged on the first end region of the second shaft. This allows for a compact structure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The two measurement standards are advantageously arranged concentrically to one another, which can simplify the evaluation of the detected angles of rotation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the two measurement standards are arranged in the same plane, which can further simplify the evaluation of the detected angles of rotation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first shaft is preferably a drive shaft of the gear mechanism and the second shaft is an output shaft of the gear mechanism. Since the first shaft, which is designed as a hollow shaft, forms the drive shaft of the gear mechanism, the drive can be arranged on the first shaft in a space-saving manner</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In particular, the first shaft can advantageously be non-rotatably connected to the rotor of an electric motor.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the gear mechanism is a tension shaft gear mechanism, which makes high transmission increase or reduction ratios possible in a small space.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The device according to the invention as described above is particularly preferably used in a robot, since it is particularly necessary in the case of robots to control their movement precisely. A robot according to the invention therefore comprises a device according to the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An embodiment of the invention is explained in detail with reference to the following figures, in which:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a longitudinal section through an embodiment of a device according to the invention for determining the torque and/or the rotary angle between a first shaft and a second shaft and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a partially transparent plan view of the device according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> show two views of a device <b>1</b> for determining the torque and/or the rotary angle between a first shaft <b>10</b> and a second shaft <b>20</b>, which are rotatably coupled via a gear mechanism <b>30</b> relative to each other about an axis of rotation A.

The scanning signals detected by the sensors <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> are forwarded to an evaluation unit to determine the rotary angle positions of the first and second shaft <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> and, if necessary, also to determine the torque acting between the shafts <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> as described below. The angular positions can be determined independently of one another, i.e. the angular position of the first shaft <b>10</b> by scanning the first measurement standard <b>11</b> using the first sensor <b>41</b> and the angular position of the second shaft <b>20</b> by scanning the second measuring standard <b>21</b> using the second sensor <b>42</b>. If the elasticity of the gear mechanism <b>30</b> is known, i.e. if it is known which angular difference is present between the two shafts <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> without load during operation at a predetermined speed of the motor <b>50</b>, the torque can be determined on the basis of the angular difference with load during operation between the two shafts <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The device <b>1</b> can have a housing <b>50</b> which is closed by a cover <b>52</b>, for example.

The first shaft <b>10</b> is in particular the motor shaft of a motor <b>50</b> which is preferably designed as an electric motor, in particular as a servomotor. The motor <b>50</b> has a rotor <b>55</b><i>a </i>and a stator <b>55</b><i>b, </i>the rotor <b>55</b><i>a </i>being coupled to the first shaft <b>10</b> in a torque-proof manner</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The gear mechanism <b>30</b> couples the second end region <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the first shaft <b>10</b> to the second end region <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the second shaft <b>20</b>. The gear mechanism can be designed, for example, as a tension shaft gear mechanism. For this purpose, a radial projection <b>31</b>, which has an elliptical cross section perpendicular to the axis of rotation A, can be arranged on the second end region <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the first shaft <b>10</b>, on the outer circumference of which a ball bearing <b>32</b>, which is designed as a roller bearing, for example, is arranged.

A radial projection <b>20</b><i>c </i>is arranged on the second end region <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the second shaft, which as a circumferential projection <b>20</b><i>d </i>on its surface facing in the direction of the first end region <b>20</b><i>a </i>so that a circumferential groove <b>20</b><i>e </i>is formed, which is open in the direction of the first end region <b>20</b><i>a. </i>Internal teeth <b>35</b> are arranged in the groove <b>20</b><i>e, </i>in which the external teeth <b>34</b> of the sleeve <b>33</b> engage. There is a difference in the number of teeth between the external teeth <b>34</b> and the internal teeth <b>35</b>, for example by one or two teeth. When the first shaft <b>10</b> rotates about the axis of rotation A, the elliptical projection <b>31</b> deforms the sleeve <b>33</b>, and, due to the tooth difference, a rotation of the second shaft <b>20</b> relative to the first shaft <b>10</b> is achieved. With a large number of teeth, a high transmission ratio increase or reduction can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The device <b>1</b> is used in particular in a robot, for example in a moving joint of a robot.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The device <b>1</b> enables the angular positions of the first shaft <b>10</b> and the second shaft <b>20</b> to be determined in a simple manner, since the angular positions of the shafts <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, in particular the angular position of the motor <b>50</b> and the angular position of the output shaft <b>20</b> and thus the output of the gear mechanism <b>30</b>, can be determined independently using the sensors <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, in each case. The device <b>1</b> enables, for example, the torque acting between the two shafts <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> to be determined in the manner described below, but also in particular without additional mechanical components. If the first shaft <b>10</b> is fixed in its position and a torque to be determined acts on the second shaft <b>20</b>, an angular difference occurs between the second shaft <b>20</b> and the first shaft <b>10</b>, since the gear mechanism <b>30</b> has elasticity and acts like a torsion bar when the torque is applied. If the elasticity of the gear mechanism is known, the torque can be determined from the size of the angle difference. The known elasticity of the gear mechanism can be determined, for example, by determining the angular difference between the first shaft <b>10</b>, i.e. the motor shaft or the drive shaft, and the second shaft <b>20</b>, i.e. the output shaft, over the entire travel range without an additionally acting torque.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">LIST OF REFERENCE SIGNS</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0033"><b>1</b> Device</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0034"><b>10</b> First shaft</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0035"><b>10</b><i>a </i>First end region</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0036"><b>10</b><i>b </i>Second end region</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0037"><b>11</b> First measurement standard</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0038"><b>12</b> Disk ring-shaped first element</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0039"><b>12</b><i>a </i>Outer region</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0040"><b>12</b><i>b </i>Inner region</li>    <li id="ul0001-0009" num="0041"><b>20</b> Second shaft</li>    <li id="ul0001-0010" num="0042"><b>20</b><i>a </i>First end region</li>    <li id="ul0001-0011" num="0043"><b>20</b><i>b </i>Second end region</li>    <li id="ul0001-0012" num="0044"><b>20</b><i>c </i>Radial projection</li>    <li id="ul0001-0013" num="0045"><b>20</b><i>d </i>Circumferential projection</li>    <li id="ul0001-0014" num="0046"><b>20</b><i>e </i>Groove</li>    <li id="ul0001-0015" num="0047"><b>21</b> Second measurement standard</li>    <li id="ul0001-0016" num="0048"><b>22</b> Disk ring-shaped second element</li>    <li id="ul0001-0017" num="0049"><b>30</b> Gear mechanism</li>    <li id="ul0001-0018" num="0050"><b>31</b> Projection</li>    <li id="ul0001-0019" num="0051"><b>32</b> Ball bearing</li>    <li id="ul0001-0020" num="0052"><b>33</b> Sleeve</li>    <li id="ul0001-0021" num="0053"><b>33</b><i>a </i>Collar</li>    <li id="ul0001-0022" num="0054"><b>34</b> External teeth</li>    <li id="ul0001-0023" num="0055"><b>35</b> Internal teeth</li>    <li id="ul0001-0024" num="0056"><b>40</b> Printed circuit board</li>    <li id="ul0001-0025" num="0057"><b>41</b> Sensor</li>    <li id="ul0001-0026" num="0058"><b>42</b> Sensor</li>    <li id="ul0001-0027" num="0059"><b>50</b> Housing</li>    <li id="ul0001-0028" num="0060"><b>52</b> Cover</li>    <li id="ul0001-0029" num="0061"><b>55</b> Motor</li>    <li id="ul0001-0030" num="0062"><b>55</b><i>a </i>Rotor</li>    <li id="ul0001-0031" num="0063"><b>55</b><i>b </i>Stator</li>    <li id="ul0001-0032" num="0064">A Axis of rotation</li>    <li id="ul0001-0033" num="0065">R<b>1</b> First direction vector</li>    <li id="ul0001-0034" num="0066">R<b>2</b> Second direction vector</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
