More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a mass spectrometer for analyzing single particles, which is capable of improving at least the duty cycle and sensitivity of particle analysis and reducing the burden of data processing device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the fields of life science and environment monitoring, the analysis of single particles is of great significance. Mass spectrometry has many advantages such as high sensitivity, fast analysis speed, multi-parameter measurement and high specificity. Mass spectrometry-based techniques have been developed, which greatly improves the performance of single particle analysis. For example, mass cytometry combining mass spectrometry and flow cytometry is developed for single cells analysis. Since it can simultaneously detect more than 40 kinds of proteins, DNA and other biomarkers in a single cell in one run, the mass cytometry significantly improves the capability of function identification and phenotyping of single cells.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a typical procedure of single-cell analysis based on mass spectrometry, the sample is firstly stained with an antibody reagent binding with specific lanthanide metal elements. The staining process is based on the principle of immune reaction. Different antibodies specifically bind to specific antigens (proteins of cells). Finally, the stained single cells were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-time of flight mass spectrometry (ICP-TOF MS), which is adapted for simultaneous multi-parameter analysis of single cells, to acquire the information of metal elements, and then the information of corresponding proteins in each single cell can be obtained. The duration of an ion cloud or ion packet generated by a single cell is about 300 &#x3bc;s. For most mass analyzers, such as quadrupole mass filter and quadrupole ion trap, the analysis speed is far from meeting the requirements of simultaneous multi-parameter analysis.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Time-of-flight mass analyzer is an ideal single-cell analysis technology. The analysis cycle can be as low as tens of microseconds, so the earliest mass cytometry is developed based on time-of-flight mass analyzer. However, due to the limitation of the working principle of time-of-flight mass analyzer, it suffers from the problem of low duty cycle, which means only a fraction of ions can be utilized by time-of-flight mass analyzer. It also affects the detection limit and quantitative performance, which results in the difficulty of detecting low expression but meaningful proteins of cells.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A need exists for systems and methods capable of improving a duty cycle of the TOF analyzer.

It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Systems and methods for mass spectrometry are provided. The systems and methods can be capable of analyzing single particles and may at least improve a duty cycle and sensitivity of the particle analysis. A mass spectrometer can comprise a sample introduction device, an ionization device, a vacuum interface, an ion guide device, an image current detector, an ion compression device, a time-of-flight mass analyzer, a detector, and a data processing system. The well-prepared particle sample is transferred to the ionization device through the sample introduction device for ionization to derive an individual ion cloud for each particle. After passing through the vacuum interface, the ion cloud enters the vacuum system of mass spectrometer. Then, the ion cloud is transported by the ion guide device to the downstream image current detector. The image current detector is used to determine a timing information, for example the start and end time, of the ion cloud. When the ion cloud arrives, the image current detector picks up a signal higher than the pre-determined threshold value, and it simultaneously triggers the downstream ion compression device to receive and axially compress the ion cloud. When the image current signal falls down to a level lower than the threshold, the ion compression device stops receiving ions. Then, the compressed ion cloud is pushed to the downstream time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. After mass separation in the time-of-flight mass analyzer, the ions arrive at the detector one after another according to the mass sequence (e.g., from low to high) and a corresponding signal sequence is generated. The signal is then processed by the data processing device to obtain the mass spectrum.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Considering that interference ions can affect the sensitivity of the image current detector and the effective capability and storage of the ion compression device, an ion filter device can be added upstream of the ion compression device. The ion filter device can remove ions with specific mass, such as the interference ions.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Systems and methods provided herein may utilize timing information collected by the image current detector to inform operation of the ion compression device. The ion compression device may be able to apply and adjust its operation mode from a non-compression mode into an ion compression mode in response to whether the system predicts a presence of an ion cloud within the ion compression device based on the timing information. By allowing such responsiveness, the systems and methods may be able to improve a duty cycle of the TOF analyzer up to nearly 100%.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a block diagram <b>100</b> of an exemplary mass spectrometer for analysis of single particles in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.

Any of these components are provided by way of example. These components may be provided in a different order. Any of these components may be removed or replaced. In an embodiment, an ion guide device <b>108</b> can be provided at a downstream side of the vacuum interface and at an upstream side of the ion image current detector. In an embodiment, the sample introduction device and the ionization device can be positioned at a substantially atmospheric pressure environment, while the ion guide device, the image detection device, the ion compression device, the time-of-flight mass analyzer and the ion detector can be positioned in a pressure reduced environment or a vacuum environment. The vacuum interface can be the interface between the substantially atmospheric pressure environment and the pressure reduced environment.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sample introduction device <b>102</b> can be configured to sequentially generate and transfer samples from a sample storage device to the ionization device <b>104</b>.

For instance, the sample introduction device can generate single particles from the sample. In an embodiment, the sample introduction device can comprise a droplet generator, which is used to generate single particle droplets from the sample and deliver the generated single particle droplets to the ionization device. Single particles can include single cells, beads, polymer microspheres, biological molecules, polymer microspheres, or aerosols. Metal isotope tagged antibodies can be used to bind antigens found on or within a cell. In some instances, over 10, 50, 100, 200 or more antigens can be simultaneously detected in a single cell using unique metal isotope tags on corresponding antibodies. To avoid interference with elements found in the cells, lanthanide elements are preferred as metal isotope tags. Examples of metal isotope tags can include lanthanum, cerium, prasedymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, or any other isotope.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Single particles can be encapsulated in a carrier. For instance, a single cell can be encapsulated in a carrier. The carrier can form a droplet that partially or completely surrounds the particle. The particle can be suspended within the carrier droplet. The carrier can be a carrier fluid, such as water, mixture of water and oil, and mixture of water and organic solvent. A droplet generator can be used to yield individual sample droplets which may include particles within the carrier fluid droplets.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The ionization device <b>104</b> can be configured to generate an individual ion cloud for each single particle received from the sample introduction device. The ions can be monoatomic or polyatomic ions. Depending on the type of ions to be analyzed, the ionization device can be selected from the group consisting of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) ionization source, a secondary ion mass spectrometry ionization source, an electrospray ionization source, an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source, or an atmospheric pressure photoionization. In an embodiment, the ionization device can be an ICP ionization device where the single particles tagged with metal isotopes are evaporated, atomized, and ionized to generate ion clouds of metal isotopes. An ion cloud can mean a cluster of ions. In an embodiment of the disclosure, an ion cloud or ion packet can mean an individual group of ions derived from a single particle. A density or a generation frequency of ion cloud can depend on a particle density in a sample solution and a flow rate of a sample introduction device. A density of ion cloud can be more than or equal to 10 cells per second, 50 cells per second, 100 cells per second, 500 cells per second, 1000 cells per second, 1500 cells per second, or 2000 cells per second. A size of an ion cloud can be 0.1 millimeter (mm), 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm, 40 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm or 100 mm. A duration time of an ion cloud can be 1 microsecond (&#x3bc;s), 40 &#x3bc;s, 80 &#x3bc;s, 100 &#x3bc;s, 200 &#x3bc;s, 400 &#x3bc;s, 600 &#x3bc;s, 800 &#x3bc;s, 1000 &#x3bc;s, 2000 &#x3bc;s, 4000 &#x3bc;s or 5000 &#x3bc;s.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The vacuum interface <b>106</b> can be configured to transport the ion clouds from the ionization device with aid of a vacuum. The vacuum interface is provided to isolate an atmospheric environment from a vacuum system, and simultaneously serves as an inlet of ions entering the vacuum. The vacuum interface can comprise dual cones, triple cones or capillary columns. In an embodiment, the vacuum interface can comprise two or more cone shaped components which are perforated. The vacuum interface can comprise two or more adjacent vacuum chambers where a corresponding vacuum pump is provided for each of the vacuum chambers.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The ion image current detector <b>110</b> can be configured to receive the ion clouds from the vacuum interface and determine a timing information, for example a start time and an end time, of each of the ion clouds passing through the ion image current detector. The determination of timing information of each ion cloud is effected by detecting an image current generated from image charges accumulated on the ion image current detector due to an electrostatic attraction effect when the ion cloud approaches the image current detector.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment, the ion guide arrangement <b>108</b> can be further provided at a downstream side of the vacuum interface and at an upstream side of the ion image current detector. The ion guide arrangement can be configured to receive the ion clouds from the vacuum interface and transport the ion clouds to downstream devices. The ion guide arrange can be configured to effect ion manipulations to refine the ions. Examples of ion manipulations can include ion noise removal and ion beam focusing. The ion guide arrangement can be selected from the group consisting of quadrupole, hexapole, octupole, ion funnel, ion tunnel, electrostatic lens or a variation or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The ion compression device <b>112</b> can be configured to receive an individual ion cloud from the ion image current detector based upon the start time and the end time of the individual ion cloud as determined by the ion image current detector, axially compress the received ion cloud, and transport the compressed ion cloud to a downstream device. The ion cloud can be stored and compressed individually within the ion compression device, such that a time duration of the ion cloud for each particle can be narrowed down significantly. Thus, the ion cloud of each particle can be transported to the time-of-flight mass analyzer <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The time-of flight mass analyzer <b>114</b> can be configured to receive the compressed ion clouds from the ion compression device and separate ions having different masses within the compressed ion clouds to arrive at the ion detector <b>116</b> at different times. As the ion cloud is axially compressed to have a narrow duration, the ions within the ion cloud can be analyzed by the time-of-flight mass analyzer in one shot instead of multiple shots. When ions arrive at the ion detector <b>116</b> in a mass order (e.g., from low to high), a corresponding signal sequence can be generated, which is processed by the data processing device <b>118</b> to obtain a mass spectrum of the particle.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exemplary structure of a particle mass spectrometry <b>200</b> for analysis of single particles disclosed in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Samples can be transferred from a sample storage device <b>201</b> to the sample introduction device <b>102</b> where single particles can be generated and tagged with metal isotopes in order to generate a sequence of single particles in a gas phase. The tagged particles can be transported from the sample introduction device <b>102</b> to the ionization device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The ionization device <b>104</b> can be an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) ionization device. Within the ICP ionization device, metal isotopes used to tag each of the single particle can be evaporated, atomized and ionized to generate a corresponding ion cloud. The ion cloud can be a metal isotopes cloud. Alternatively, the ICP ionization device can be replaced by a microwave plasma torch (MPT), glow discharge ionization (GDI), or laser ionization (LI) among others.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The ion cloud is then placed into a vacuum system of mass spectrometer through the vacuum interface <b>106</b>. The vacuum interface can be the interface between a substantially atmospheric pressure environment and a pressure-reduced environment. The vacuum interface can comprise two or more cone-shaped components which are perforated. The two or more cone-shaped components can separate two or more adjacent vacuum chambers. A hole size of the perforated cone-shaped component can limit a volume of gas that passes through each component. A corresponding vacuum pump can be provided for each vacuum chamber allowing a gas pressure to gradually decrease from upstream to downstream. The pressure drop gradient can be greatest near the boundary of the two chambers. This pressure drop can cause a supersonic expansion. The shape, hole size, inter distance and voltages applied to the vacuum chamber can be optimized depending on the application.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Then, the ion clouds can be transported to image current detector <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, the ions can be directed to pass through the ion guide device <b>108</b> prior to being transported to image current detector <b>110</b>. The ion guide device can receive the metal isotope ion clouds from the upstream perforated cone-shaped components and guide the ion clouds to travel along a length of the ion guide device. The ion guide device can comprise two or more electrodes. The electrodes can be generally parallel to each other. Each electrode can comprise one or more working surfaces. The working surfaces of the electrodes can face one another. A gap can be provided between the working surfaces. The region between the working surfaces may be an ion channel. Upon proper application of voltages to the electrodes, the electrodes can generate an electric field that manipulates the ions travelling along the gap.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The ion guide device can be chosen from an electrostatic lens, a quadrupole, a multipole, an ion tunnel, an ion funnel, or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, the ion guide device can be configured to effect ion manipulations. The ion manipulations can be determined according to a variety of practical requirements and include at least one of the following: (1) selectively filtering ions with a specific mass, (2) ion bunching; or (3) ion storage. The purpose of effecting ion manipulations is to improve the performance, including duty cycle, resolution, space charge and so on, of the downstream devices.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A linear ion guide device is shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. However, curved ion guide devices can be employed which can provide several advantages including (1) removing neutral noise from a variety of gas molecules in the environment to increase the signal to noise ratio and decrease the gas burden of the vacuum pump, and (2) increasing the flexibility of the instrument design by decreasing the instrument footprint. The ion guide can be shaped so as to provide a 90 degree turn or a 180 degree turn in the focused ion path. Any degree of curvature may be provided. Degrees of curvature can include less than or equal to 90 degrees, 95 degrees, 100 degrees, 105 degrees, 110 degrees, 115 degrees, 120 degrees, 125 degrees, 130 degrees, 135 degrees, 140 degrees, 145 degrees, 150 degrees, 155 degrees, 160 degrees, 165 degrees, 170 degrees, 175 degrees, or 180 degrees.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The ion clouds can then be transported to the image current detector <b>110</b>. The image current detector can be configured to determining a timing information, for example a start time and an end time, of each ion cloud passing through the image current detector. In the process of ion cloud approaching, passing through and/or leaving the image current detector, the image current detector can sense a signal which is correlated with the ion cloud and indicative of the approaching, passing through and/or leaving the image current detector. In some instances, the sense signal may occur when an ion cloud is within a predetermined proximity of the image current detector. In some instances, the sensed signal may occur only or primarily when the ion cloud is within the image current detector or immediately adjacent to the image current detector. In some instances, a sensed signal may be triggered when the ion cloud is entering the image current detector or entering within a proximity of the image current detector. Optionally, a sensed signal may be modified or decreased when the ion cloud is exiting the image current detector or exiting a proximity of the image current detector. The sensed signal can be an image current. The image current is generated from image charges which are accumulated on the ion image current detector. The image charges are induced due to an electrostatic attraction effect when the ion cloud approaches, passes through and leaves the image current detector.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Timing information relating to the presence of the ion cloud may be calculated based on the image current. For instance, when the sensed signal is higher than a predetermined threshold, the timing may be triggered to indicate a start time for the presence of the ion cloud. When the sensed signal falls beneath the predetermined threshold, the timing may be triggered to indicate an end time for the presence of the ion cloud. In some embodiments the timing information may be collected and utilized with a high degree of precision and/or accuracy. The timing information may be provided within an order of miliseconds (ms). The timing information can be provided with a degree of precision and/or accuracy more than or equal to 1 ms, 0.5 ms, 0.1 ms, 0.05 ms, 0.01 ms, 0.005 ms, or 0.001 ms. In some embodiments, timing information may include a start time for a presence of the ion cloud and/or end time for a presence of the ion cloud as it passes the image current detector. In some instances, other timing information such as peak time (e.g., when ion cloud is a greatest density) may be collected. In some instances, timing information when the ion cloud reaches one, two, three, or more specified thresholds of density may be collected. In some instances, a length of time may be calculated relating to the ion cloud. For instance, a difference between a start time and end time may be calculated to determine a length of time it takes for an ion cloud to pass.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">When the sensed signal is higher than a predetermined threshold value, the downstream ion compression device <b>112</b> can be triggered to receive and axially compress the ion cloud. In an embodiment, the ion compression device can switch from a non-compression state into an ion compression state in response to the sensed signal which is higher than the predetermined threshold value. In the non-compression state, the ion compression device may receive ions but apply no compression voltage to the ions. Optionally, in the non-compression state, the ion compression device may not receive ions. In the ion compression state, the ion compression device may apply appropriate compression voltage to the ions. When the sensed signal falls down to a level lower than the threshold, the ion compression device stops receiving ions.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The ion compression device may receive timing information from the image current detector, or may receive instructions from an additional component that may utilize the timing information from the image current detector. The compression device may be immediately adjacent to the image current detector or may be further downstream from the image current detector. In some instances, a distance between the image current detector and the ion compression device may be less than or equal to 10 cm, 5 cm, 3 cm, 2 cm, 1 cm, 5 mm, 3 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.1 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.01 mm or less. In some instances, a distance between the image current detector and the ion compression device may be known. In some instances, an amount of time for an ion cloud to travel from the image current detector to the ion compression device may be known or calculated based on distance and rate of flow, as well as experiment measurements. The timing information may be used in conjunction with known distance and/or travel time from the image current detector to the image compression device to affection operation of the ion compression device.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Operation of the compression device may include varying working conditions, including DC voltages, RF voltages, local gas pressure and a combination thereof, based on the timing information from the image compression device. The ion cloud may be compressed by confinement of DC potential barrier, RF pseudopotential well, and/or gas collisional cooling. The combination of utilizing the timing information in varying the working conditions may allow improvement of duty cycle and signal to noise ratio of particle analysis by targeted compression of ion cloud.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">After compression in the ion compression device, the compressed ion cloud, as a whole, can be pushed into an orthogonal accelerator <b>220</b> of the TOF mass analyzer <b>114</b>. After the compressed ion cloud is accelerated to a specific kinetic energy by the orthogonal accelerator, the accelerated ion cloud can fly into a field-free flight tube <b>221</b> for mass separation. A flight path of the ion cloud can be reflected by a reflector <b>222</b> which is positioned at an opposite end of the orthogonal accelerator in the TOF mass analyzer. Due to a difference in flight speed of ions having different masses in the ion cloud, the ions can arrive at the detector <b>116</b> in a mass order (e.g., from low to high). An ion flow signal can be generated from the detector and further processed by the data processing device <b>118</b>, such that a mass spectrum of the ion cloud, which is derived from a single particle, can be obtained for qualitative and quantitative identification of a composition of the single particle.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The ion guide device, the image detection device, the ion compression device and the time-of-flight mass analyzer can each be positioned within a vacuum chamber. A corresponding vacuum pump can be provided for each of the vacuum chambers. In an embodiment, the image detection device and the ion compression device can be positioned in a same vacuum chamber. A pressure in a vacuum chamber for the ion guide device can be provided in a range from 0.001 to 1000 Pascal (Pa). In an example, the pressure in the vacuum chamber for the ion guide device can be about <b>1</b> Pa. A pressure in a vacuum chamber for the image detection device and the ion compression device can be provided in a range from 0.0001 to 10 Pa.

A pressure in a vacuum chamber for the TOF analyzer can be provided in a range from 0.00001 to 0.001 Pa. In an example, a pressure in the vacuum chamber for the TOF analyzer can be about 0.0001 Pa. The vacuum interface can create an isolation between and a transition from the atmospheric environment to the downstream vacuum system. In an example, a pressure in the vacuum interface can be provided in a range from 0.1 to 2000 Pa. In an example, a pressure in the vacuum interface can be about 100 Pa.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic of image current detector based on single cylinder electrode in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.

The image current detector <b>110</b> can be configured to determine a timing information of a separate ion cloud, for example a time at which a separate ion cloud approaches (e.g., a starting time) and a time at which the separate ion cloud leaves (e.g., an ending time) in a non-destructive manner.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The image current detector can comprise a cylinder metal electrode. When moving ions (e.g., ion cloud) get close to a surface of the metal electrode, due to an electrostatic attraction, an amount of charges with opposite polarity will be accumulated on the surface of the electrode, which is called image charge. The number of image charge is increased with an increase in a number of the moving ions and a proximity of the moving ions relative to the electrode surface. As the moving ions approach and leave, the amount of image charge varies over time. Thus, an image current generated from the image charge can be detected from the electrode, as shown in panel (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the example shown in panel (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a cylinder electrode can be used as the image current detector. When the ion cloud approaches, passes through and leaves the cylinder electrode, a corresponding image current can be detected from the cylinder electrode. Once the ion cloud approaches and enters an entrance opening of the cylinder electrode, an image current can be higher than a predetermined threshold. At this time, a start signal can be generated to instruct the downstream ion compression device to receive and compress ion cloud. Once the ion cloud totally passes through the cylinder electrode and leaves an exit opening of the cylinder electrode, the image current can be lower than the threshold. At this time, a stop signal can be generated to instruct the ion compression device to stop receiving the ion cloud. Alternatively, the image current detector can be provided with a variety of structures such as double cylinders or triple cylinders.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic of ion compression device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure, panel (a) showing an isometric view, and panel (b) showing a sectional view. In an embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the ion compression device <b>112</b> can be constructed on basis of a 3D ion trap.

The front endcap and the rear endcap can each be a perforated cone-shaped component with vertexes thereof being spaced from each other. The ring electrode can comprise a convex inner surface. At least a portion of the inner surface of the ring electrode can be interposed between outer surfaces of the front endcap and the rear endcap, such that an inner space is defined by the inner surfaces of the front endcap and the rear endcap and the inner surface of the ring electrode.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Once receiving the start signal from the upstream image current detector, the ion compression device starts to receive from the front endcap and compress the ion cloud within a space defined by the vertex of the front endcap, the vertex of the rear endcap and the convex inner surface of the ring electrode. Once receiving the stop signal from the image current detector, the ion compression device stops receiving ion cloud. At this time, the entire ion cloud, which is generated from a single particle, can be stored in the ion compression device. Due to a collisional cooling effect in 3D ion trap, a duration (e.g., an axial length) of the ion cloud can be narrowed down significantly. Subsequently, the ion compression device can force the compressed ion cloud out of the ion compression device through the rear endcap into the downstream devices.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Though the ion compression device is shown as a <b>3</b>D ion trap in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the ion compression device can adopt other configuration such as a linear ion trap, an ion funnel, an ion tunnel, an ion carpet, a segmented quadrupole, a segmented multipole and any variants thereof.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic of orthogonal acceleration device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.

Ions with different masses can obtain same kinetic energy but different velocity. The flight of time in the TOF analyzer for ions having different masses can be different after the ions travelling out a same flight path. Information of mass can be deduced based on a flight of time of ions having different mass.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the example shown in panel (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when a substantially continuous ion flow, which is continuous at least during a certain time period, flows into the acceleration field of the orthogonal accelerator, only a small fraction of ions can be accelerated and pushed into the TOF, with the rest of ions being lost. For example, only those ions appearing within a width of the acceleration field can be pushed into the TOF and analyzed. This results in a low duty cycle of the TOF mass analyzer. In the example shown in panel (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, however, due to a shorter duration of the compressed ion cloud, an entirety of the compressed ion cloud can be accelerated by the orthogonal accelerator. By synchronizing the pulsing of the orthogonal accelerator, an entirety of each ion cloud for each single particle can be accelerated by the orthogonal accelerator and analyzed by the ion detector. Therefore, the duty cycle of the TOF mass analyzer can be greatly improved.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The ions accelerated by the orthogonal accelerator then fly into the field-free region of the TOF analyzer for mass separation. Due to a difference in speed among the ions having different masses, the ions can arrive at the ion detector in a predetermined mass order, for example, from low to high. A corresponding signal sequence can then be generated and further processed by the data processing device to obtain the mass spectrum of the ion cloud, which containing a composition information of the single particle.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a block diagram <b>600</b> of mass spectrometer for analysis of single particles in accordance with alternative embodiments of the disclosure.
