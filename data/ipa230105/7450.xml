According to various embodiments, the digital twin incident response system may be configured to retrieve data relating to on-premises building devices, off-premise building devices, and/or non-building devices and use edge-based processing to determine a response to the data relating to the devices. In some embodiments, based on the received data, the digital twin incident response system may be configured to determine one or more potential incidents relating to the on-premises building devices or non-building devices (e.g., wireless routers on traffic lights, wireless routers in vehicles such as cars, trucks, boats, missiles, robots, drones, etc.) For example, the digital twin incident response system may be configured to determine that there is a risk of an incident of a fire starting at the building with the on-premises devices. As another example, the digital twin incident response system may be configured to determine a potential incident of an active threat in the building. The digital twin incident response system may then be configured to determine at least one potential response for each potential incident simulated by the digital twin incident response system. As another example, the digital twin incident response system may be configured to determine the firing order of a plurality of missiles within a missile defense network. As a final example, the digital twin incident response system may be configured to develop and implement a response to a nuclear incident. In this case, the digital twin incident response system may send sensors on drones into the vicinity of a nuclear reactor after an incident to map a radiation cloud and collaborate with the digital twins in nearby building to implement a response to the incident (e.g., evacuating a building if the radiation cloud gets to close). In some embodiments, the digital twin incident response system may be configured to analyze each of the potential responses and determine relative risks of each of the potential responses to a potential incident. For example, the digital twin incident response system may determine that instructing assets to relocate to a certain room or area of a building during an incident of a tornado increases the relative risks of that potential response. The digital twin incident response system may then be configured to transmit data indicating the potential incidents and at least one of the potential responses to at least one on-premises building device. In some embodiments, the digital twin incident response system selects a potential response to transmit to the on-premises building devices based on the relative risks of the potential responses. For example, the digital twin incident response system may be configured to transmit one response with the lowest associated risk to an on-premises building device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some applications, models of incidents and responses may exist in cloud networks and large data centers, analyzed by teams of data scientists to extract meaningful information and interpret the data. However, such systems require a vast amount of data, time, and computer processing power to support these functions. Due to this need for a large amount of processing power, time, and data, the simulated incidents and responses to the incidents are not available to devices (e.g., on-premises devices) at sites soon enough to provide optimal responses to a developing incident. Further, impacted buildings may not have the necessary access to electrical power, network availability, and/or network bandwidth needed to model alternative responses to various incidents and/or received such models from off-premises (e.g., cloud/data center) devices. In particular, incidents that develop rapidly, that are impacted by constantly changing internal and/or external parameters, and/or that include constantly changing responses to the incident, do not allow sufficient time, computer resources, or knowledge to fully take advantage of the benefits of modeling potential incidents and responses to incident scenarios.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The implementation of on-premises digital twin wireless routers (DTWRs) can allow the generation and transmission of real-time, artificial intelligence (AI) based responses as incidents begin to develop. By using edge-based processing facilitated by the DTWRs associated with various building entities, the digital twin incident response system may enable building managements systems to respond to incidents without relying on cloud based networks which may not be available in the case of an incident. In some embodiments, the digital twin incident response system may work in conjunction with a cloud based network to develop a response to an incident. In some embodiments, the DTWRs may be associated with non-building entities such as traffic signs, vehicles, robots, drones, and/or people. The digital twin incident response systems described herein may proactively model potential incidents and possible responses to instruct a building management system to take corrective actions in order to resolve the incident. Thus, optimal responses to an incident may be implemented more immediately after the development of an incident. As such, the incident may be resolved before the incident may have a significant impact on a building site and/or other entities (e.g., people, equipment, areas of a building, etc.) of the site.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">While the present disclosure discusses utilizing digital twins, it should be understood that, according to various embodiments, the features of the present disclosure may be utilized in conjunction with any type of data, including data that may not be considered a digital twin. All such modifications are contemplated within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Hereinafter, example embodiments will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>, a block diagram of a smart building environment <b>100</b> is shown, according to an exemplary embodiment. Smart building environment <b>100</b> is shown to include building management platform <b>140</b>. The building management platform <b>140</b> and other computing devices described herein may be a part of a computing system that includes a single off-premises server, several off-premises servers (e.g., a distributed system of multiple servers), a cloud computing system, and/or edge devices (e.g., on-premises computing devices and/or sensors, one or more on-premises servers, etc.) of the computing system. Building management platform <b>140</b> may be configured to collect information from a variety of different data sources. Building management platform <b>140</b> may create digital representations, referred to as &#x201c;digital twins,&#x201d; of physical spaces, equipment, people, and/or events based on the collected information. In some embodiments, the generation of digital twins can, additionally or alternatively, be done in edge devices of the network environment. In various embodiments, the digital representations are stored in an entity graph. In other embodiments, the digital representations may be stored in another type of document database (e.g., an Oracle relational database, a MongoDB document database, and so on).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In brief overview, an entity graph is a data structure representing entities (e.g., spaces, equipment, people, events, etc.) and relationships between the entities. In various embodiments, the entity graph data structure facilitates advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning associated with the entities. In various embodiments, entities within the entity graph data structure include or are associated with &#x201c;agents,&#x201d; or software entities configured to take actions with respect to the digital twins/real world entities with which they are associated. In some implementations, the agents may be configured to implement artificial intelligence/machine learning methodologies. The agents may be configured to facilitate communication and collection of information between a variety of different data sources. Each of the data sources may be implemented as, include, or otherwise use respective agents for facilitating communication amongst or between the data sources and building management platform <b>140</b>. The agents of building management platform <b>140</b> and data sources may be configured to communicate using defined channels across which the agents may exchange information, messages, data, etc. amongst each other. In some examples, channels may be defined for particular spaces, subspaces, control loops, groups of equipment, people, buildings or groups of buildings, etc. In some implementations, agents may communicate by publishing messages to particular channels and subscribing to messages on particular channels and/or published by particular other agents/types of agents. In various embodiments, the data sources include buildings. For example, building management platform <b>140</b> may interact with a number of buildings, each of which may include an agent (or a group of agents corresponding to various building subsystems within the respective building), to receive information. Hence, the building management platform <b>140</b> and the data sources may together form a network of agents to facilitate artificially intelligent exchange and communication of information across various channels. In some embodiments, one or more device(s), component(s), space(s) (and sets of devices, components, spaces) within building management platform <b>140</b> may include a respective agent dedicated to perform various tasks associated therewith. The agents may therefore be dedicated for performing separate functions or tasks.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In various embodiments, building management platform <b>140</b> collects data from buildings <b>10</b>. For example, building management platform <b>140</b> may collect data from buildings <b>10</b> such as a school, a hospital, a factory, an office building, and/or the like. It should be understood that the present disclosure is not limited to the number or types of buildings <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. As new devices/components/spaces/buildings/events/control loops are added or otherwise incorporated into smart building environment <b>100</b>, new digital representations (and associated agents, etc.) may be dynamically generated and incorporated into the entity graph data structure.

In brief overview, entity graphs such as entity graph <b>170</b> and/or entity graph <b>300</b> are structured data stored in memory (e.g., a database, memory <b>146</b>, etc.). Entity graphs such as entity graph <b>300</b> and/or entity graph <b>170</b> may include digital twins. Digital twins may be digital representations of real world spaces, equipment, people, and/or events. In various embodiments, digital twins represent buildings, building equipment, people associated with buildings, and/or events associated with buildings (e.g., buildings <b>10</b>, etc.). An entity graph may include nodes and edges, where each node of the entity graph represents an entity and each edge is directed (e.g., from a first node to a second node) and represents a relationship between entities (e.g., indicates that the entity represented by the first node has a particular relationship with the entity represented by the second node). For example, an entity graph may be used to represent a digital twin of a person.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Entities can be things and/or concepts related to spaces, people, and/or asset. For example, the entities could be &#x201c;B7F4 North&#x201d;, &#x201c;Air Handling Unit,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;meeting room.&#x201d; The nodes can represent nouns while the edges can represent verbs. For example, the edges can be &#x201c;isA,&#x201d; &#x201c;hasPart,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;feeds.&#x201d; In various embodiments, the edges represent relationships between entities. While the nodes represent the building and its components, the edges describe how the building operates. The nodes and edges together can create an overall digital twin of a particular building. In some embodiments, the entities include properties or attributes describing the entities (e.g., a thermostat may have a particular model number attribute). The components of the entity graph form large networks that encode semantic information for a building.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The entity graph may be configured to enable flexible data modeling for advanced analytics, control, and/or artificial intelligence applications, in some embodiments. These applications may require, or benefit from information modeling including interconnected entities. Other data modeling techniques based on a table, a hierarchy, a document, and/or a relational database may not be applicable. The entity graph can be a foundational knowledge management layer to support other higher level applications, which can be, complex root cause, impact analysis, building powerful recommendation engines, product taxonomy information services, etc. Such a multilayered system, a system of system topologies, can benefit from an underlying entity graph.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The entity graph can be a data contextualization layer for all traditional and/or artificial intelligence applications. The entity graph can be configured to capture evidence that can be used to attribute the strengths of entity relationships within the entity graph, providing the applications which utilize the entity graph with context of the systems they are operating. Without context (e.g., who the user is, what the user is looking for, what the target of a user request is, e.g., find a meeting room, increase a temperature in this office) these applications may never reach full potential. Furthermore, the entity graph provides a native data structure for constructing question and answer type systems, e.g., a chatbot, that can leverage and understand intent.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The entity graph may not be a configuration database but may be a dynamic representation of a space, person, event, and the like. The entity graph can include operational data from entities which it represents, e.g., sensors, actuators, card access systems, occupancy of a particular space, thermodynamics of the space as a result of actuation, etc. The entity graph can be configured to continually, and/or periodically, ingest new data of the space and thus the entity graph can represent a near real-time status of cyber-physical entities and their inter-relationships. For this reason, artificial intelligence can be configured to introduce a virtual entity and new semantic relationships among entities, in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The entity graph may be configured to facilitate adaptive controls, in some embodiments.

Typically, in these cases, building management systems may require manual management of these incidents which may cause major delays and costs. For example, a fire may break out in one campus building. Manual management of that incident may include managers determining the location of the fire and manually implementing standard operating procedures to respond to the fire. Because this process is not automated, there may be significant delays caused by human error, lack of visibility to information about the fire, etc. Furthermore, if a fire breaks out in a campus building that is in close proximity to other campus buildings, that information would need to be communicated to the other buildings. Manually, building managers could communicate this information through typical communication means such as phone calls, text messages, or emails. This is not ideal though because this method of communication is very prone to human error (forgetting to call, email, or text while trying to manage the fire in their own building, typical communication means not being available because the incident is interfering etc.).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In yet another additional example, an edge device (e.g., a router) positioned in buoys above off-shore oil wells may respond to acoustic signatures of leaks in the oil well. An incident of a leak in an oil well can cause loss of production, safety issues, and severe environmental threats to the surrounding area. Therefore, corrective actions for an incident of a leak can mitigate more of the negative effects of the incident the sooner the actions are implemented to resolve the incident. In some embodiments, a response to an incident that is associated with the least amount of risk is not a clear response. In other embodiments, the fact that a response is needed may not be obvious. This may especially be exacerbated in cases with risk assessment that involves correlation of data from several internal and external sources.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In yet another additional example, an edge device (e.g., a router) may be positioned within a missile which may be a part of a missile defense system. An incident may trigger missile deployment but it may not be clear when and where the missiles should be fired or in what order the missiles should be fired. If a correct incident response is not developed and implemented quickly, this may lead to catastrophic loss of life and equipment. Therefore, a digital twin incident response system is needed to quickly and effectively respond to various incidents.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As mentioned above, the digital twin wireless routers (DTWRs) are associated with different building entities and may be within edge devices associated with the different building entities (e.g., access points, routers, sensors, etc.). Each DTWR may stores a digital twin that is a digital representation of one or more building entities (e.g., devices, people, spaces, etc.) on an edge device. Additionally, each DTWR may process data indicative of a building incident occurring to develop a response to the building incident. Digital twins associated with one or more building entities may stream data between themselves in order to determine one or more collaborative responses to an incident. In some embodiments, the one or more responses to an incident may be stored within the digital twins or in connection with the digital twins that the response impacts. Though the embodiments shown within the present disclosure describe DTWRs associated with different building entities, it is to be understood that those embodiments are only exemplary and that DTWRs in other embodiments may be associated with non-building devices.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The application of digital twin wireless routers (DTWRs) with an on-premises digital twin incident response system can permit DTWRs to identify and evaluate risks and potential incidents that take local context (e.g. what's happening in an operating room, on a person, in a parking structure . . . ) into account. DTWRS may be able to evaluate and select an optimal response to an incident based on input from multiple DTWRs that model current and future risk scenarios to provide multiple perspectives so that the resultant risk mitigation solutions apply to an entire building, conference, operation, campus, or city. In some embodiments, manual management decisions are replaced by more relevant model-based decisions that can be made in significantly less time based on parameters set by management, so that incidents can be addressed before they impact people, buildings, or assets, etc. Additionally, automated management by DTWRs may facilitate a response to incidents in situations where management is unavailable or unable to participate.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, DTWRs from different buildings within a geo-fenced area (such as a campus) may communicate with each other so as to coordinate a collaborative response to incidents that develop within the geo-fenced area.
