now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A locking and unlocking means is provided having a moveable restraint, a latch, and a prime mover. The restraint is configured to selectively restrict or permit access to an item (e.g., food, a bike, an object, etc.), service, or facility. The restraint is selectively opened and closed by the latch. Operation of the latch may be performed, enabled, or restricted by the motion of the prime mover. The prime mover is controlled by a code entry means, a code processing means, and a power source. The code entry means may be manual, such as a keypad, or wireless, such as RF, IR, Bluetooth, WiFi, ANT, Zigbee, Cellular, or other suitable means. The code entry means may also be used to receive information from the locking and unlocking means. A visible display, such as light emitting diodes, liquid crystal display, etc. is provided. The locking and unlocking means is identified by a serial number, which may consist of letters, numbers, symbols, or any combination thereof. A secondary identifier may be used to publicly identify the lock, as the serial number may be kept confidential. This secondary identifier may also consist of letters, numbers, symbols, or any combination thereof. The locking and unlocking means may be equipped with a real time clock and supporting hardware and software, including a temperature measurement means configured to adjust the operation of the real time clock for accurate operation in a variety of temperatures. The code entry means may additionally provide for the setting of the clock, configuring of the serial number, and other maintenance and configuration aspects of the locking and unlocking means. The moveable restraint may be conductive and complete an electrical circuit when closed, for the purpose of electronically verifying the closure of the electronic restraint. There may be an alternate means of attachment and an internal alarm.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The locking and unlocking means may be configured as a portable padlock or cable lock, an integrated cabinet lock, or a functional part of a piece of equipment. As a part of the functional piece of equipment, the lock may alternatively or additionally disable or enable the functional piece of equipment. The locking and unlocking means may be configured as part of a vending device, selectively enabling vending of products or services.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">By having a locking and unlocking means as described, it allows multiple persons to interact in new and unique ways at multiple locations and capacities during an item exchange. A lock provider generally provides at least one locking and unlocking means. A location provider generally provides the location for at least part of the item exchange. An item provider provides at least one item involved in the exchange. A consumer accesses or uses at least one item used in the item exchange. Additionally, a transportation provider may transport an item. A single person or party may fulfill one or many capacities in the same item exchange. This provides a very flexible ecosystem for exchange of items. In addition, each capacity may have its own location. For example, the lock provider has a provider location, while the consumer has a consumer location. These locations may be public or private and commercial or non-commercial.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">This flexible ecosystem allows for items to be exchanged freely without a fixed storage location. For example, a first consumer at a first consumer location may borrow a mobile object via operation of the prime mover at the provider location. The first consumer may then re-secure the mobile object at the first consumer location. In this way, the first consumer, although still potentially financially responsible for the mobile object, may offer the mobile object for use at the first consumer location, rather than returning to the provider location. A second consumer may then borrow the mobile object at the first consumer location. In many rental scenarios, such as bicycle rentals, there is often a lack of storage space in living quarters or an inconvenient return transportation, and thus it is advantageous to re-secure the mobile object at its point of last use, which may be a more likely point for re-rental or display.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the system may include the locking and unlocking means and a remote computer with an application configured to generate codes specific to the lock provider's serial numbers, which are under his control. Codes may also be generated specific to certain time frames in conjunction with the serial numbers.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another embodiment, the system may include the locking and unlocking means and remote computer that the lock provider does not control. With an application to generate codes specific to the lock providers serial numbers. In this embodiment, the lock provider would relinquish control and knowledge of the serial numbers and/or access to the application configured to generate said codes. This will allow the remote computer to generate codes and provide additional services. For example, the remote computer would prevent issuance of an unlocking code for a certain amount of time, thus creating a hold on the item secured in the locking and unlocking means. In addition, the remote computer may easily provide access to multiple parties, coordinate codes, and charge fees appropriate to each party.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The lock provider and/or location provider can set rules as to what can be sold, placement fee, commission, and pricing requirements. For example, at a store that sells new lawnmowers, a lock provider may only allow used lawnmowers selling at over $100, $1 placement fee, with a commission of 20% while a convenience store may allow lawnmowers with no minimum price and no commission, and provide a placement incentive to generate visitors to their store. This will allow the location or lock provider to control the mix of products and their desired customer base to achieve the maximum overall value based on the operations of the specific location.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The locking and unlocking means can interact with a website, adding convenience to a transaction. For example, the consumer may search and find a listing on a website before locating the item and the locking and unlocking means. Alternatively, a consumer may interact with the item and locking and unlocking means before seeking information about the item on the website. In either instance, the unlocking code can be provided via the website or an alternate remote computer.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Codes for the locking and unlocking means can be one time or multiple use. If a code is multiple use it may have a cancellation code that ends the validity of the multiple use code.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The locking and unlocking means may have one or more master codes which are always valid. However, the validity of the one or more master codes may have cancellation codes that end their validity.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The codes may be generated to be valid only during a fixed time frame at which they will become invalid.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is often useful to know when an item has been secured or re-secure in the locking and unlocking means. A means of remotely generating a re-locking code related to said unlocking code is provided, which may be related to a specific serial number, time, and/or unlocking code. Said relocking code being provided by said locking and unlocking means after the defined duration of validity has ended. The relocking code may also be provided if no unlocking code is provided, such that the item can be secured in the locking and unlocking means when it is in an unlocked state. Said relocking code may be provided via a visible display or wireless communications. The restraint of the locking and unlocking means may be visible, such that one can visibly see that an item is secured. When said restraint and visible display are simultaneously perceivable via a single vantage point, a digital photograph may be taken with a mobile device which provides a confirmation that an item has been secured or re-secured. The digital photograph can be sent to another party and may be embedded with time, location, and personal identification information, which are contained in the mobile device. This methodology allows items to be secured or re-secured at any location, providing flexibility in locations. This can allow for items to be secured or re-secured in the most convenient locations, which may be a desirable location for any party involved in an item exchange. This may include re-securing the item at a point of display for sale or rent. This will save time and labor for parties, and reduce storage and transportation costs.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Access to a point of entry secured by the locking and unlocking means may often be bi-directional. For example, a door may be used to access a facility having an inside and an outside. The point of entry, often a door, is accessible from the inside and the outside. When relinquishing access to the facility at the end of a purchased time of access, the cancellation code and relocking code may be entered from the outside, preventing access from both the inside and the outside. The digital photograph showing the unlocking code and the point of entry will then provide confidence that no parties have chosen to remain on the inside of the facility after the end of the purchased time of access.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The locking and unlocking means may have services that are provided on a subscription. As such a deactivation code may be entered into the locking and unlocking means to deactivate its functionality. In addition, a visible deactivation confirmation code may be displayed in response to the entry of the deactivation code.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some cases, it may be desirable to conceal the item after visual confirmation that the item has been secured. This may be particularly useful with items of great value or those subject to theft. Examples include but are not limited to cash payments, jewelry, precious metals, pharmaceuticals, and electronic devices. An enclosure for performing this function may include a main housing, a significantly transparent cover, a first latch having an open position and a closed position and configured to receive a locking and unlocking means to securely contain an item when in a closed position, a significantly opaque cover, a second latch configured to secure said significantly opaque cover in a closed position. The second latch is configured to be inaccessible when both the significantly transparent cover and the significantly opaque cover are simultaneously in their said closed positions. This enclosure may be a standalone device or may be integrated into the locking and unlocking means.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The locking and unlocking means has a first means of selectively attaching said locking and unlocking means via said prime mover, however, it may be desirable to selectively attach the locking and unlocking means via an alternate means of attachment, such that the locking and unlocking means is attached to the item or location even when the first means of selectively attaching said locking and unlocking means is unattached. Examples include attaching to a fixed feature at specific location or a specific item.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Payment or other compensation may be made by any suitable means. This may include, but is not limited to cash, trade, electronic payment, internet based payment, utility bill, reward points, credits, bitcoin, cryptocurrency, etc. Payment made separately from the item may preventing crime, thus it may be advantageous to receive physical payment in one locking and unlocking means at a first location and simultaneously receive an item in a second locking and unlocking means at a second location. By providing the unlocking and relocking codes that are dependent on substantially the same time, this can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some cases, the secured item with visual confirmation, may prompt a payment for purchase rental or loan. This creates a virtual pawn shop. The item is secured at the first location by a loan seeker with visual confirmation sent to a pawn broker. The pawn broker provides a loan. If loan is not repaid after a certain time, the item can be removed from the locking and unlocking means or listed for resale at the first location. If the loan is repaid, the unlocking code is provided to the loan seeker. This use case is not limited to loans, as it may be easily adapted for a purchase for resale transaction.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">If this device is used to vend items it offers several unique advantages over coin operated vending. When used for vending, no secure credit card processing is used at the vending level and no currency is stored. Because there is substantially little value to stolen vended items vs currency or credit card access codes stored in the device, the device can be less secure and much lower cost than previous vending devices. This lends itself to construction without the use of expensive materials or components. Use of plastic enclosures vs. metal enclosures is one example. In addition, as no wireless connectivity is required for off-line operation, lower costs can be achieved vs wirelessly connected devices.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Many businesses may utilize electronic safes for securely storing items. For example, a hotel may maintain electronic safes within hotel rooms for use by guests of the hotel. An electronic safe may utilize a static unlocking code (e.g., the hotel may maintain a single master static unlocking code as a recovery code for a particular electronic safe or for all of the electronic safes in the event a guest forgets an unlocking code for an electronic safe). Unfortunately, maintaining and utilizing static unlocking codes is problematic as the static unlocking codes are often lost or forgotten. A static unlocking code is usually known by the business/location or the manufacture of the electronic safe. When a static unlocking code is used as a recovery code, the recovery code is at risk of being used by unscrupulous employees such as for theft. These problems with static unlocking code are further complicated when the static unlocking codes are never changed from the factory default code during installation. Anyone who obtains or purchases a similar electronic safe would easily have access to all electronic safes of the same model because all of the electronic safes of that model may have the same factory default code as the recovery code.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Accordingly, in order to overcome these problems with electronic safes using static unlocking codes such as recovery codes, it is desirable to utilize a safe with an internal real time clock such that a recovery code can be generated/issued based upon a unique serial number of the safe and/or is valid for a certain timespan. This generated recovery code could be used for accessing the safe, reconfiguring the safe such as to set the internal real time clock, and/or establishing a new static unlocking code.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">There are often groups of lockers or safes that would benefit from easier manufacturing, installations, and/or management. For example, groups of electronic lockers, groups of electronic safe access doors, groups of safety deposit boxes, and/or other locking containment components currently require either wireless access (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular, etc.), or a system of wires and actuators to manage them. This communication requirement results in significant costs of both manufacturing and maintenance. It would be desirable to remotely issue an unlocking code valid for a certain timespan. The unlocking code may be based upon a unique identifier of a lock (e.g., a containment component, an electronic safe, a safety deposit box, an electronic locker, etc.) using from a remote interface that is remote to the lock. The remote interface may be implemented as a local interface (e.g., a kiosk) or could be cloud based where the remote interface is hosted through a cloud service provider with network communication to the locking containment component. In this way, all of the individual locks on groups of locks can be controlled on an individual basis without requirement a wireless interface or writing from a kiosk.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also, it is desirable to delay access to certain locks (e.g., locks of containment components such as electronic safes, safety deposit boxes, electronic locks, etc.). For example, delaying access to a plurality of containment components (e.g., 500 safety deposit box drawers) ensures that the containment components cannot be quickly accessed in quick succession such as in the case of a robbery. Thus, a time delay can be added for issuing real time unlocking codes for successive locks that are proximate to one another (e.g., within a same building or location). This is particularly desirable for safes in pawn shops or jewelry stores to limit loss during a robbery when there are many small, valuable items that can be separately and individually locked up.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, a method is provided. The method includes receiving, by a remote interface, a request from a requestor for an unlocking code used to unlock a lock for a containment component. The method further includes generating, by the remote interface, the unlocking code valid for a timespan. The method further includes transmitting, by the remote interface, the unlocking code to the requestor for unlocking the lock.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the lock is integrated into the containment component.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, the lock is separate from the containment component and has secondary means of attachment to attach the lock to the containment component.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the lock is an offline lock without communication capabilities of communicating with the remote interface.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the method includes generating the unlocking code based upon a unique identifier of the lock.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the request comprises the unique identifier.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the remote interface is hosted by a cloud service provider accessible to the requestor over a communication network.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the method includes waiting a time delay between receiving the request and generating the unlocking code.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, the method includes transmitting the unlocking code as a time based recovery code via the remote interface.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the method includes configuring the remote interface to generate time delayed unlocking codes for a plurality of locks for containment components at single location.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the method includes configuring the remote interface to generate time delayed unlocking codes for a plurality of locks for containment components connected together.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, the lock is a padlock and the containment component is a locker locked by the padlock.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, a method is provided. The method includes providing a listing interface configured to be populated with information regarding a lock. The method further includes receiving, through the listing interface, a request from a requestor for an unlocking code for the lock. The method further includes generating the unlocking code valid for a timespan. The method further includes displaying, by the listing interface, the unlocking code to the requestor for unlocking the lock.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, the method includes waiting a time delay between receiving the request and generating the unlocking code.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, the method includes waiting a time delay between receiving the request and transmitting the unlocking code.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, a method is provided.

At <b>102</b>, a request may be received from a requestor for access to an item (e.g., a lawn mower) secured within a containment component (e.g., a physical structure to which the lawn mower can be secured by a lock) by a locking component. At <b>103</b>, payment by the requestor for accessing the item may be verified. At <b>104</b>, an unlocking code is generated. The unlocking code is valid within a time range (e.g., a user may use the unlocking code within the next 3 hours to gain access to the lawn mower). The unlocking code may be valid for a single use or a plurality of uses. At <b>106</b>, the unlocking code may be provided to a requestor (e.g., through a display of the containment component, text message, email, audible notification, etc.). In some embodiments, a containment component may comprise a locking structure, such as a mobile locking structure (e.g., a cable bicycle lock), such that the containment component is mobile as opposed to a fixed structure such as a box. In some embodiments, a containment component may comprise a locking structure, and the containment component is mobile and thus can move with an item. In some embodiments, a containment component may comprise a fixed structure. In some embodiments, the containment component may comprise a padlock, a cable lock, a locker, a compartment, a fixed structure such as a box, etc. At <b>107</b>, a location of the item is provided to the requestor.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">At <b>108</b>, user input of a code may be received through a code entry component (e.g., the display, a keypad, a code scanner, a wireless transmission means, etc.) associated with the containment component. At <b>110</b>, the locking component is modified into an unlocked state for providing the requestor with access to the item in response to the code being validated (e.g., by a code validation component) as corresponding to the unlocking code and being used within the time range. For example, the containment component and/or the locking component may comprise a code validation component that can validate codes based upon an unlocking code configured for the code validation component.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In an example, a temperature measurement may be obtained using a temperature sensor associated with the containment component. A clock, used to determine a current time for validating codes against time ranges, may be adjusted based upon the temperatures measurement.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an example, a return request, to return the item to a return containment component (e.g., the containment component at an original location from which the item was retrieved; a different containment component located at a different location; the containment component currently located at a new position that is different than a position of the containment component when the user retrieved the item such as where the containment component is mobile), may be received. A relocking code may be generated as corresponding to the unlocking code. The relocking code may be provided to the requestor (e.g., displayed through a display associated with the return containment component). A second user input of a second code may be received such as through the code entry component. The locking component may be modified into a locked state for locking the item into the return containment component based upon the second code being validated as corresponding to the relocking code.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In an example, imagery from a device of the requestor may be received (e.g., a photo captured by a mobile device of the user). The imagery may be evaluated to validate whether the requestor has returned the item into a returned containment component in a locked state in an acceptable condition (e.g., human evaluation, image recognition evaluation, etc.). The imagery may be tagged with geolocation and time from a device such as the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In an example, a translucent over is used to display the item within a visible state through the containment component to users. An opaque cover is utilized to hide the item (e.g., or payment such as money) within a hidden state through the containment component from users.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In an example, a determination may be made that a consignment agreement exists between a first entity and a second entity. The first entity may be offering the item and the second entity may own a location at which the containment component is located. Responsive to payment being submitted by the requestor for accessing the item, a first portion of the payment may be provided to the first entity and a second portion of the payment may be provided to the second entity.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In an example, an instruction to lock the containment component for restricting access to the item for a time duration may be received and implemented.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In an example, a delayed pickup request for the item at a delayed pickup time may be received. Responsive to the item not being retrieved from the containment component before expiration of the delayed pickup time, the requestor may be charged a penalty.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In an example, the containment component may be used as a dispenser for a plurality of items that are dispensed based upon valid code entry.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In an example, the code entry component may be configured as an add-on component for integration into a machine, such as a coin-op machine, such that validation of codes trigger operation of the coin-op machine.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In an example, a second user input of a second code may be received. The item (e.g., a product) may be deactivated in response to the second code being validated as corresponding to a deactivation code.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In an example, a third user input of a third code may be received. Access to a clock, the ability to delete or replace a master code, the ability to block an issued code, or the ability to change a serial number may be provided based upon the third code being validated as corresponding to a maintenance code.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In an example, the item may correspond to medication. Access may be restricted to the medication according to a planned interval of access and verification of proper consumption.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In an example, an alarm component may be provided to generate an alert based upon unauthorized attempts to access the item.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In an example, a fourth user input of a fourth code is received. Access to a sample of the item is provided in response to the fourth code being validated as corresponding to a sample access code.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In an example, a master code, having an indefinite validity timespan, is maintained.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In one embodiment of facilitating exchange of an item, a website is configured by an administrator for a product to be sold with a confidential serial number. A vendor is given access to modify portions of the product description, picture, price, etc. However, the serial number may be kept private and not shared with the vendor. The vendor can include a public location or a location that is to be kept private in which case a very genera location is given such as a city, zip code, visual radius on a map, etc. The vendor can determine if an unlocking code will be single or multiple use.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">A buyer can view items online and request to inspect, purchase a hold/reservation, or purchase the item outright. The buy can select a duration of time to inspect, hold, or pickup, or a fixed time can be set by an administrator or vendor. A payment is made (e.g., for inspection or to hold the item then the payment is a deposit that could be refunded later). The payment is confirmed. A private location of the item is disclosed to the buyer.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">When a purchase is made, a current time (UTC) is used by a server in conjunction with the serial number and duration to generate an encrypted unlocking code. The unlocked code is used to generate a visual relocking code. The visual relocking code may not be generated if the buyer is merely holding or inspecting the item. The unlocking code is sent to the buyer (not the seller or vendor). The visual relocking code is sent only to the vendor. A sold product will be listed as out of stock until relisted/edited by the vendor. A hold product will be shown with a hold time. New potential buyers can &#x201c;get in line&#x201d; and may be charged a fee for such.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">When the unlocking code is entered, a current UTC time, serial number, and duration are used to validate the unlocking code. If validated, then a lock is unlocked to grant the buyer access to the item. If valid and unlocked and expired (single use is automatically expired, multiple use will expire at duration or enter a code to expire the code) the lock will calculate the visual relocking code and display it on the LEDs for 20 seconds after the lock is locked. It will turn on visual relocking code anytime a button is depressed and leave on for 10 seconds.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some instances, when a product is on display online, etc., it may be advantageous for the end user to keep the exact location private. In this case, the public listing may only provide a general location, such as city, postal code, or vague depiction of the item location. Upon requesting a location, paying the requisite fee, or alternately placing a hold or purchasing the item, the exact location will be automatically or manually divulged. This reduces theft and increases safety.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">After a lock is used by the general public, for example at a safe pickup location at a police station or business, a second seller will need to access the website to provide a code. The visual relocking code will be entered as the new password. For example, Red, Green, Off, etc. This will allow the code to be known at the physical location to anyone who seeks to use the lock. The website, having generated the relocking code for the last sale, will automatically change the password to the relocking code after the sale is completed.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example system <b>200</b> of circuitry used by an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item.

The second cover <b>304</b> can then be moved to an unlocked state only when the first cover is in an unlocked state allowing access to the latch protrusions <b>306</b> that are extending through the openings <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example system <b>400</b> of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item <b>406</b>. The apparatus comprises a containment component <b>402</b> configured to store the item <b>406</b> for selective retrieval. The apparatus comprises a locking component <b>404</b> configured to selectively lock or unlock the containment component <b>402</b> for restricting or providing access to the item <b>406</b>. The apparatus comprises a code generation component <b>408</b> configured to receive a request, from a requestor, for access to the item <b>406</b> secured within the containment component <b>402</b> by the locking component <b>404</b>. The code generation component <b>408</b> is configured to generate an unlocking code that is valid within a time range and is valid for either a single use or a plurality of uses. In an example, the unlocking codes and relocking codes are generated in the cloud or app, but the apparatus must receive them to decrypt them to determine validity. The relocking/confirmation type codes would be generated by the apparatus to be displayed on the display.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The apparatus comprises a code entry component <b>410</b> configured to receive a user input of a code. The code entry component <b>410</b> is configured to modify the locking component <b>404</b> into an unlocked state for providing access to the requestor to the item <b>406</b> in response to the code being validated as corresponding to the unlocking code and being used within the time range.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The apparatus comprises a display <b>412</b> through which various information may be provided, such as a cost to access the item <b>406</b>, terms of accessing the item, how to provide visual proof of returning the item, a state of the locking component, the unlocking code, a re-locking code, a hold time for which the locking component <b>404</b> will not be unlocked, etc.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate examples of a system <b>500</b> of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item <b>506</b>. For example, a user <b>504</b> may submit a code that is validated to provide the user <b>504</b> with access to retrieve the item <b>506</b> from a first containment component <b>502</b> at a first location (e.g., near a downtown coffee shop), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. The user <b>504</b> may travel with the item <b>506</b> to a second location (e.g., near a hotel) at which a second containment component <b>520</b> is located, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. Accordingly, the user <b>504</b> may use a re-locking code for returning the item <b>506</b> into the second containment component <b>520</b> in a locked state. The user <b>504</b> may capture a photo of the item <b>506</b> being locked in the locked state within the second containment component <b>520</b>, which may be sent to a remote computing device for validating a proper return of the item <b>506</b>. In this way, another user may retrieve the item <b>506</b> from the second containment component <b>520</b>. In an example, the first containment component may travel with the item to a second location, and the first containment component is used to secure the item at the second location.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In one embodiment of facilitating the exchange of an item, a request, to obtain a loan secured by an item, may be received from a requestor of the loan. A locking code may be sent to the requestor for locking the item within a containment component. Imagery may be received from a device of the requestor, a mobile device, a camera, or from a camera associated with the containment component. The imagery may be evaluated to validate whether the requestor has secured the item into the containment component in a locked state in an acceptable condition. Responsive to validating the imagery, a transaction between the requestor and a loaner (e.g., a loan company) for the requestor to obtain the loan secured by the item may be facilitated. If a determination is made that the loan has not been repaid by the requestor according to a repayment term of the loan, the item may be offered for sale through the containment component.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, unlocking codes are time based and lock specific. A serial number is confidential to a user. Codes, such as unlock codes, are generated to work at a specific time. A code may be embedded with a start time, a validity duration, and/or a type (single/multiple use). A user can establish a unique name to publically identify a lock. A clock of the apparatus can be temperature compensated for keeping an accurate time.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, unlock codes are generated by the apparatus, which is easy to maintain, needs little to no setup, works even though there may be no wireless service, and there are not transmission between the apparatus and another component that can be captured.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, codes can be requested and sent using any type of technology, and thus the apparatus may be relatively future proof.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, photo confirmation of return of the item may be facilitated. For example, the apparatus may comprise a display (e.g., an LED display) showing a state of the lock (e.g., a return code). A camera/smart device can simultaneously show a condition of the item, the lock securing the item, etc. Location, time, and user information may be embedded into imagery from the device that is then verified such as by a human or by image recognition functionality.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, photo confirmation of a secured physical payment, and subsequent concealment of the payment is facilitated by the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus provides for the ability to enclose and lock money or other items under a translucent cover and then cover such with a second opaque cover that cannot be opened until the translucent cover is unlocked/opened.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the ability to pawn and/or resell the item is provided. For example, the item is secured within the apparatus, a photo confirmation is sent, and payment is received such as to acquire a loan secured by the item. If the loan is not repaid within a certain amount of time, then the item can be offered for sale through the apparatus. In an example, the item can be at a display location the entire time of the loan period.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus may be used to facilitate consignment of the item. For example, the apparatus is used to display the item at a location. If the item is sold, then the location gets a cut. If the item is not sold, then the apparatus can be removed. In an example, a time of the item being on display can be used to calculate a charge amount to the entity offering the item for sale. This leads to the addition of consignment at locations that historically sell only new items. The location controls pricing, types of products, fees, commission, duration of display, etc. (e.g., buying a used lawnmower at a hardware store).</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus can be used for providing holds on items. The seller/lock owner relinquishes control of unlocking codes, such that a third party can prevent the seller or another buyer from accessing the item for a certain amount of time. Holds can be paid for based on the time of the hold. Potential buyers do not have to worry about an item being sold out from under them before they can inspect it or pick it up.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus can provide for late pick-up, such as buy now and pick up at a later date. If the item is not picked up by a certain time, the charge penalties can be applied.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, third party delivery can be provided. Third parties can be engaged to pick up an item from a lock and deliver it to a buyer, potentially locking it up for the buyer at an alternate location. A user could order a taxi, Uber, Lyft, etc. and issue the code to the driver and get the item delivered.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus advantageous provides a means for exchanging items that are otherwise too large to profitably ship. For example, a used bicycle, lawnmower, or firewood cannot be shipped profitably, but displaying for pickup can now be practical.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus can be used for providing vending of items. For example, an unlocking code can be used to dispense/deliver a product. This can be advantageous for situations where there is no coin/cash system because it does not require connectivity or a payment system. Thus, there are no funds or payment gateway to protect, just the products in the vending machine, which are often very low value (e.g., a gumball machine or sanitary napkin machine).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus can be used for retrofitting a machine, such as a coin-op. For example, a module could replace a coin slot and knob (turn crank/pull). A code could be entered instead of the coin, the use of a manual (turn crank/pull), or automatic enabled machine. For example, this could be used for video games, gumball machines, vending machines, etc.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus is used to increase foot traffic and/or advertising. When an item is picked up, it creates a unique destination. That destination is controlled by the seller, so it can benefit from whatever business that wants to add foot traffic, such as a convenience store/drug store. Sellers and buyers can select locations on a map to pick up or display items (e.g., an interactive map interface may be displayed through a computing device, such as where a user can place a pin to mark a pickup or return location; the interactive map interface may be populated with locations of available apparatuses and items; etc.).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus can utilize a network or a cloud for payment and generation supply of codes. For example, a database is created in seller's account with lock, cost, and receivable account information. A payment is sent from a seller electronically, the payment is confirmed automatically, a code is generated, and the code is sent to the buyer that then enters the code in the lock. This could be done by text. A user sends a text with lock information, a payment request link is returned, and the seller then clicks link to pay. After payment is confirmed, the code is generated and texted to the buyer, who enters it into the lock. In an example, fees can be charged for transaction, which may be a subscription/service plan.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, items can be returned anywhere. For example, if a lock is attached to a rented item, then the rented item can be re-secured to any fixed object, across town, even at renter's location. Thus, the rented item can be picked up by the owner or re-rented at the return location. If re-rented at the return location, the first renter would still be responsible until the rented item is re-rented to the second renter. This creates rental businesses without the requirement for storage, re-inspection, etc.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, a real time map could display available items for rent.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, deactivation of a product can be provided as a service. For example, a deactivation code can be generated to be entered into a lock to decommission the produce. A visible confirmation code can be displayed.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, maintenance functions may be provided for the apparatus. For example, code entry can set the real time clock, delete master codes, cancel/block issued codes, change a serial number, etc.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, connectivity is provided for the apparatus, such as global position system (GPS), cellular, wifi, etc.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus can be used to convert expense items to profit centers. For example, low cost vending items can replace complimentary items. In a restroom, a low cost vendor could provide toilet seat covers. At a restaurant, extra napkins could be charged for.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus provides for little to no haggle. For example, if the buyer and seller are remote, then there could be no means to negotiate the price.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus provides for sampling and market research. For example, samples may be given on site in exchange for a survey. Contact information may be taken, a code can be given, and a survey can be provided as a follow-up. This can replace a live person, manual collection, and/or shipping/handling.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus can be used to sell extra items, such as through front of house vending. For example, a mustard company may want to put mustard product in a restaurant location that prefers not to stock the mustard product in a condiment bar. Thus, a customer can pay extra for access to the mustard product. The mustard company can restock the mustard product. A portion of the charge could be provided to the restaurant.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, the apparatus can be employed for medication management, such as home medication management. For example, time based codes only allow access at planned intervals, only if the medication is properly taken, and a user provides valid verification codes. In this way, the apparatus can act similar to a mini pill dispenser. This could prevent overdose, can confirm compliance for insurance/employer purposes (insurance could refuse to pay if the user does not follow a required regimen), etc.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, a master unlocking code is generated that does not expire. The master unlocking code may be kept secret. In an example, the master unlocking code may be sold for a sell.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, an alarm may be provided for the apparatus. The alarm can sound due to improper opening (detected by sensor) or from improper motion, too many wrong codes, etc.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In one example of an apparatus for facilitating exchange of an item, a lock can have an identifier other than a name. In an example, a bar or QR code, RFID tag/nfc, Bluetooth beacon, phone number/shorcode, web address etc. can be used to facilitate transactions.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In one embodiment, a locking system comprises a locking and unlocking means comprising a code entry means, a code processing means, a power source, and a prime mover configured to move between a locked and unlocked state. The locking system comprises a means of remotely generating an unlocking code unique to said locking and unlocking means that has a predefined duration of validity. The locking system comprises a means of remotely generating a re-locking code related to the unlocking code. The relocking code may be provided by the locking and unlocking means after the predefined duration of validity has ended.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In one embodiment, the relocking code is provided via a visible display.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In one embodiment, the relocking code is provided via wireless communications.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In one embodiment, the relocking code is provided only after said locking and unlocking means has been unlocked using the unlocking code and relocked.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In one embodiment, the locking system comprises a visible retention means. The visible retention means and the visible display are simultaneously perceivable via a single vantage point, such as by a user.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In one embodiment, the predefined duration of validity is determined by at least one of a number of uses, a fixed time duration, and/or a fixed time interval.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In one embodiment, the predefined duration of validity is determined by a cancellation request.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In one embodiment, an apparatus comprises an enclosure.

The locking configuration <b>800</b> may include a lock assembly <b>810</b>, a primary means of attachment <b>820</b> which may be a flexible cable as shown or a rigid member. The lock assembly <b>810</b> may optionally be secured to a fixed attachment point <b>840</b> via a secondary means of attachment <b>842</b> such that the lock assembly <b>810</b> remains secured to the fixed attachment point <b>840</b> when the primary means of attachment <b>820</b> is unlocked by entering an unlocking code into keypad <b>830</b>. An attachment point can be any fixed (e.g., the fixed attachment point <b>840</b>) or mobile item that will restrict, impede, indicate, or monitor the motion of the lock assembly <b>810</b>. The primary means of attachment <b>820</b> can be used to selectively secure a mobile item, such as a bicycle or tool, to a location while the secondary means of attachment <b>842</b> selectively secures the lock assembly <b>810</b> to the mobile item, or vice versa. A secondary lock assembly <b>844</b> of the secondary means of attachment <b>842</b> allows the lock assembly <b>810</b> to be selectively removed from attachment point <b>840</b> if it is desired to change the location of transfer. It should be noted that the primary means of attachment <b>820</b> and the secondary means of attachment <b>842</b> are operated separately via lock assembly <b>810</b> and the secondary lock assembly <b>844</b> of the secondary means of attachment <b>842</b>.

Speed reduction can be performed by gears, belts, or any other suitable means or combination thereof. The cam assembly <b>955</b> includes an output shaft <b>956</b>, which provides reduced speed output from speed reducer <b>952</b> and transmits the reduced speed output to the cam assembly <b>955</b> via interface ring <b>957</b>. The motor <b>951</b> is rotated in one or more directions such that a cam <b>958</b> is positioned to block or allow movement of latch <b>835</b>. When movement of the latch <b>835</b> is allowed and the latch <b>835</b> is depressed by a user, the removable end <b>845</b> may be removed from opening <b>837</b>, thus providing access to items contained by primary means of attachment <b>820</b>. When movement of the latch <b>835</b> is restricted by the cam <b>958</b>, access is restricted, as the latch <b>835</b> securely retains removable end <b>845</b> in opening <b>837</b>. The latch <b>835</b> is returned to a non-depressed state by spring <b>962</b>. When the removable end <b>845</b> is positioned within opening <b>837</b>, a contact <b>961</b> is depressed, completing an electrical circuit from the contact <b>961</b> to the fixed end <b>838</b> via the primary means of attachment <b>820</b>. Position detector <b>960</b> is provided to detect the position of the cam <b>958</b>. Position detector <b>960</b> can be a switch, encoder, magnetic sensor, optical sensor or any other suitable device capable of position sensing. Knowing the position of the cam <b>958</b> and continuity status between contact <b>961</b> and the fixed end <b>838</b>, the security status of the lock assembly <b>810</b> can be determined by control circuit <b>970</b>. The cam <b>958</b> is carried by interface ring <b>957</b> which may be configured to allow the cam <b>958</b> to slip. This allows for limited torque and force to be applied to any physical stop provided within the lock assembly <b>810</b> and as a result, limits current to the motor <b>951</b>. As this lock assembly <b>810</b> may be used in wet environments, a circuit gasket <b>971</b> is provided to prevent the entry of water into the electronics.

Various hold durations may be available, such as a non-fee based duration (e.g., a shorter duration) or a fee based duration (e.g., a longer duration). For example, a fee may be charged to the buyer <b>2220</b> for holding the item. The fee may be split and paid to one or more entities, such as the seller <b>2201</b>, the service, etc. Access to the item is selectively restricted by the apparatus (e.g., the locking component may be maintained in a locked state so that the item cannot be removed from the containment component) until either the hold duration expires or the buyer <b>2220</b> purchases the item. During the hold duration, the seller <b>2201</b> and/or other alternative/potential buyers may be restricted from accessing the item. Once the hold duration has expired, any alternative buyers on a waiting list for purchasing access to the item may be notified of the availability to now purchase access to the item. For example, users may access the service to be placed on the waiting list during the hold duration.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">During the hold duration, a geolocation of the mobile device of the buyer <b>2220</b> may be tracked, such as to determine whether the buyer <b>2220</b> is located proximate the item for inspection. During the hold duration, the buyer may purchase <b>2226</b> access to the item or allow the hold duration to expire <b>2225</b>.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> illustrates an example <b>2400</b> of a user <b>504</b> utilizing a mobile device <b>2410</b> to interact with a containment component <b>402</b> over a network <b>728</b>, such as by accessing the containment component <b>402</b> through the service that manages the containment component.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">In an embodiment, a method is provided for facilitating a transactional exchange. The method comprises receiving a request, from a requestor, to hold an item secured by a containment component using a locking component for a hold duration. The hold corresponds to an exclusive right for the requestor to subsequently purchase access to the item not yet purchased by the requestor. The method comprises selectively restricting access to the item from parties other than the requestor based upon the hold until the hold duration has expired.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">In an example, the hold is implemented on the item in response to the requestor paying a fee for the hold. In an example, one or more hold durations and fees for the hold durations are displayed. In response to receiving a selection of the hold duration from the one or more hold durations, the requestor is charged a fee associated with the hold duration. In an example, the requestor is charged with a purchase price for the item, wherein the purchase price excludes the fee. In an example, the request is charged with a purchase price for the item, wherein the fee is deducted from the purchase price. In an example, the requestor is charged with a purchase price for the item. The purchase price is collected and held until either the hold duration expires or the item is purchased. In an example, at least one of the purchase price or a portion of the purchase price is refunded if the item is not purchased.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">In an embodiment, a method is provided for facilitating a transactional exchange. The method comprises receiving a request for access to an item secured by a containment component using a locking component that is portable from a first party. The method comprises generating an unlocking code that is valid within a time range and is valid for either a single use or a plurality of uses. The method comprises facilitating access to the unlocking code to a second party. The method comprises receiving input of a code through a code entry component associated with the containment component by the second party. The method comprises modifying the locking component into an unlocked state for providing access to the item in response to the code.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">In an example, the second party comprises a transportation provider. In an example, the facilitating comprises suggesting the transportation provider. In an example, the code is internally validated off-line by the locking component as corresponding to the unlocking code and being used within the time range. In an example, the locking component determines what is a valid locking code in real-time in response to receiving the input of the code. In an example, the locking component comprises a primary means of attachment and a secondary means of attachment. The secondary means of attachment is operable to keep the locking component secured to a fixed attachment point when access is provided to the item. In an example, the secondary means of attachment is selectively removable.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">In an embodiment, a method is provided for facilitating a transactional exchange. The method comprises receiving a request, through a product listing interface, for access to an item secured by a containment component using a locking component. The method comprises generating an unlocking code that is valid within a time range and is valid for either a single use or a plurality of uses. The method comprises providing the unlocking code. The method comprises receiving input of a code through a code entry component associated with the containment component. The method comprises modifying the locking component into an unlocked state for providing access to the item in response to the code.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">In an example, the product listing interface is associated with a non-listed URL. The non-listed URL is modifiable. In an example, access is provided to at least one of the product listing interface or the unlocking code based upon verification of a password. The password is modifiable by a lock owner of the locking component. In an example, the password is displayed on the locking component. In an example, the locking component is portable. In an example, the locking component comprises a primary means of attachment and a secondary means of attachment. The secondary means of attachment is operable to keep the locking component secured to a fixed attachment point.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">In an example of facilitating a transactional exchange, a hold on an item and/or the ability to obtain access to the item may be purchased or may be obtained with merely credentials without being purchased. Purchase of a hold may correspond to a requestor paying a fee to an entity associated with the item (e.g., an owner of the item; a service/company selling or renting the item; a service/company owning the containment component; etc.), the requestor being charged the fee, or any other purchase arrangement. Purchase of access to the item may correspond to the requestor paying the fee, the requestor paying the fee and physically obtaining access to the item (e.g., payment in addition to the requestor obtaining the item), or any other purchase arrangement. If access to the item has not yet been purchased, then that could mean that the requestor has yet to pay the fee or the requestor has paid the fee but has not obtained the item yet (e.g., the fee may be refunded if the requestor does not obtain the item within a threshold amount of time). In this way, transactional functionality is incorporated into the containment component and locking component (e.g., financial transaction and payment). In an example of facilitating a transactional exchange, a code transfer may be performed between two parties such as between the entity associated with the item and the requestor. The code may be manually entered into the locking component or through a listing interface. In an example, a contact within a contacts list may be suggested as a party. In an example of facilitating a transactional exchange, merely credentials (e.g., identification information, a driver's license, a real estate agent credentials, etc.) are needed to obtain a hold on an item and/or obtain access to the item (e.g., used to access a key for a house, used to test drive a car, etc.), as opposed to requiring payment of a fee.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method of generating and providing an unlocking code. During operation <b>2502</b>, a request may be received from a requestor for an unlocking code for a lock. The request may be received through a remote interface (e.g., hardware and/or software hosted by a kiosk, a remote server, a cloud service provider, or other computing device). In some embodiments, the lock may be integrated into a containment component (e.g., a lock of an electronic safe). In some embodiments, the lock may be attached to the containment component by a secondary attachment means (e.g., a padlock attached to a locker). During operation <b>2504</b>, the remote interface generates an unlocking code valid for a timespan (e.g., valid for the next 5 minutes). In some embodiments, the unlocking code is generated based upon a unique identifier of the lock (or a serial number of the containment component). The remote interface may store the unique identifier within a database or the unique identifier may be specified by the request. During operation <b>2506</b>, the unlocking code is transmitted by the remote interface to the requestor (e.g., transmitted over a network to a computing device of the requestor used to generate the request or a different device associated with the requestor such as a mobile device, cell phone, smart watch, or other device whose number was specified by the request; an email address specified by the request; etc.). In some embodiments, the unlocking code is only provided after a time delay (e.g., a 2 minute delay). In some embodiments where there is a plurality of locks and requests for unlocking codes for the locks (e.g., locks within a particular threshold distance of one another such as the same building or location; locks that are part of multiple containment components connected together such as drawers of the same electronic safe; etc.), the unlocking codes are sequentially provided one after another where each unlocking code is provided after the time delay (e.g., a 15 minute time delay between processing each request in order to mitigate theft from a burglary). In this way, the requestor can utilize the unlocking code to unlock the lock.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method of generating and providing an unlocking code through a listing interface.

The listing interface is configured to be populated with information regarding locks. The locks may (e.g., a lock attached to a bike) or may not be associated with containment components (e.g., a lock integrated into a locker). The requestor may be able to request an unlocking code for a lock through the listing interface.

A first lock may be associated with a first containment component <b>2702</b>. A second lock may be associated with a second containment component <b>2704</b>. Other locks may be associated with other types of items than containment components, such as a bike. A requestor <b>2706</b> may utilize a device (e.g., a kiosk, a mobile device, a website) to request an unlocking code <b>2716</b> for the first lock in order to obtain access to the containment component <b>2702</b>. The request may be routed to a remote interface <b>2710</b> hosted by a device <b>2708</b> (e.g., a kiosk, a cloud service provider, a computing device, etc.). The remote interface <b>2710</b> may utilize an unlocking code generator <b>2712</b> configured to generate the unlocking code <b>2716</b> that is valid for a certain timespan (e.g., 10 minutes). The unlocking code may be generated based upon a unique identifier of the first lock (or the first containment component <b>2702</b>) and/or based upon other criteria such as temporal/time criteria/constraints (e.g., the unlocking code generator <b>2712</b> may execute a code generator algorithm to generate the unlocking code <b>2716</b>).
