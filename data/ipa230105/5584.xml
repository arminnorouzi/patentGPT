In a person with asthma, the inside walls of the airways, known as bronchial tubes, become swollen or inflamed. This swelling or inflammation makes the airways extremely sensitive to irritations and increases their susceptibility to an allergic reaction. This can make breathing difficult and can trigger coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. The muscles that wrap around the airways also can tighten, making breathing even harder. When that happens, it is often called an asthma flare-up, asthma episode, or an asthma attack.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other diseases are similar to asthma. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, often referred to as COPD, is an umbrella term for chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic bronchitis inflames the bronchial tubes while emphysema is characterized by loss of elasticity in the lungs. Asthma and COPD may be treated by the use of inhaled medication where other diseases are treated differently.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Certain medications are used to relieve symptoms of asthma and COPD. They work by relaxing the muscles of the airways into the lungs, which makes it easier to breathe. When an asthmatic has an asthma attack, an inhaler gets the medicine straight to the lungs, so it can quickly relax the muscles surrounding the airways. The airways can then open more widely, making it easier to breathe again. Within just a few minutes, breathing becomes easier.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Inhalers are commonly used to provide oral or intra-nasal medication to patients. They can be used for relief on an as-needed basis, as well as for application of a prescribed course of treatment. The user segment of particular significance to the present invention is the large population for whom there is a prescribed course of treatment using an inhaler. The effectiveness of the inhaler is dependent on the user's adherence to the treatment regimen and this has traditionally been a problem area. This is also referred to as a user's &#x201c;compliance&#x201d; with the treatment regimen. There are approximately 26 million persons in the United States alone who suffer from chronic asthma, and whose poor adherence rate greatly contributes to an estimated $300 billion in preventable indirect and direct medical costs annually. On average, children and adults adhere to their prescription schedule with less than a 50% success rate (i.e., they do not administer their medication more than 50% of the time prescribed). One easily quantifiable direct cost of poor adherence is the $18 billion spent on Emergency Room (ER) visits where poor inhaler medication adherence is cited as the number one cause for ER visits.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A higher degree of adherence to the course of treatment would improve results in many cases, and in those cases where the treatment is ineffective the physician and patient can move on to a different solution rather than continuing with a course of treatment thinking that it would be effective if followed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The medical field has long recognized the problem of a patient visiting a physician and having a very imprecise recollection of how often the inhaler has been used. Solutions proposed to solve this problem include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,958,691 to Anderson, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,202,642 to McKinnon, U.S. Pat. No. 5,363,842 to Mishelevich, Published U.S. Patent Application No. 2011/0253139 of Guthrie, et al, Published U.S. Patent Application No. 2009/0194104 of Van Sickle, and published international patent application WO 2014/004437 of Engelhard, et al. These prior devices claim to monitor inhaler usage and track the user's adherence to a treatment regimen. However, they are often bulky, or require customized inhalers (i.e., cannot be easily fitted to and operated with any inhaler already in use). Some also require special purpose hardware to collect data and forward it to the physician.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An additional problem, exacerbated by poor adherence to a course of treatment is the difficulty in obtaining sufficient data regarding changes in lung function, and in making timely adjustments of the prescribed treatment regimen in accordance with updated lung function.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A hand-held or single-dose inhaler is often a passive device that provides no information regarding the medication actually delivered. In some cases, patients who use the inhaler are not clear as to whether they actually received a dose. Multiple efforts have been made in the past to assist a patient with the correct use of an inhaler. Many patients use inhalers incorrectly which results in poor inhalation techniques and a lack of efficacy of the medication. It has been noted that in one study, up to 80% of the patients use an incorrect inhaler technique. Spacer tubes, which typically comprise a valved holding chamber located between the mouthpiece of an inhaler and the patient, have been found to be helpful with some patients; however, many patients do not utilize them because of their bulk and the patient's desire not to attract attention when using an inhaler. A counter that is built into an inhaler is also a useful device; however, a counter does not necessarily indicate that the patient received a dose. The counter only indicates that a dose was delivered by the inhaler but does not indicate that the patient received it.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">People who have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other breathing disorders often use devices either called a hydrofluoroalkane inhaler (HFA inhaler, also referred to as a metered dose inhaler or MDI), or a dry powder inhaler (DPI). An HFA inhaler is a handheld device that delivers a specific amount of medication in aerosol form, rather than as a pill or capsule. The HFA inhaler consists of a pressurized canister inside a plastic case (inhaler body), with a mouthpiece attached. With an HFA inhaler, the user presses on the canister while inhaling the COPD medication directly into his or her lungs. The portability of these inhalers makes them easy to use.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A metered dose inhaler (MDI) is a small device that delivers a measured dose of medicine in a fine spray (aerosol) at the mouthpiece of the inhaler. MDIs use a chemical propellant to produce the spray and the propellant carries the measured amount (dose) of medicine. If the user's mouth is correctly located on the mouthpiece of the inhaler, the spray will be delivered into the user's mouth. However, to be effective, the spray must be drawn into the user's lungs. The &#x201c;spray&#x201d; from an inhaler is sometimes referred to as a puff.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">DPIs are also handheld devices. A DPI delivers medication to the lungs as the user inhales through the inhaler. It does not contain propellants or other ingredients; it contains only the medication. DPIs are breathe-activated; i.e., it is the breathing in deeply and fast that gives the user the right dose of medicine from the DPI. The user's lung strength at inhaling alone is what draws the medication into his or her lungs, as opposed to the MDI that has a propellant for delivery of the medication. The DPI requires a minimum inspiratory flow rate from a patient to work effectively, and the minimum flow rate required to administer effectively varies by DPI medication.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">If a user's inhaler technique is not consistent with the mechanics of delivery of the spray by the inhaler, the user may not get much of the medicine into his or her lungs and relief may not occur. Problems often arise with the MDIs where the user must coordinate pressing down on the inhaler to get the spray at the same time as the user breathes it in deeply enough. If the user presses before breathing in, most of the spray ends up on the back of the user's throat rather than in the user's lungs. If the user presses too late after breathing in, most of the dose ends up in the mouth where it will promptly get breathed out again. There are various other technique deficiencies that can cause the above.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">There are economic advantages of improving the user's inhalation technique. Poor inhaler technique can lead to worse asthma control and possibly a prescription for higher doses and different medications that may not be necessary.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">At this time no technique is known for measuring the amount of spray from an inhaler that actually reaches the user's lungs. Similarly, no technique is known for measuring the amount of spray from an inhaler that actually passes through a user's airways.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">New developments have been made in detecting and reporting the actuation of an inhaler canister of an MDI. Cohero Health, Inc., New York, N.Y. has devices that allow the electronic tracking of MDI actuations and recording of those actuations with a connected app and a connected database (often referred to as an electronic metered dose inhaler or &#x201c;eMDI&#x201d;). However, these eMDI devices are still susceptible to actuation without effective user inhalation of the medication when a user does not have a good inhaler technique. A need has been identified for a system and method that provides more confidence that the user correctly inhaled the medication when an actuation of the inhaler is detected and recorded. Another use for such a system and method is to detect ineffective or &#x201c;poor&#x201d; inhalation as a result of incorrect inhaler technique.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Based on the above discussion, there is a need to monitor the use of an inhaler by a user to determine if the user's inhaler technique is sufficient for the user to have received a full dose of medication. Further, a need has been identified to sense and correlate multiple factors to determine if a patient has effectively used an inhaler to have breathed in a dose of medication deeply enough to reach the lungs.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">There is also an identified need for the recordation of data resulting from a user's actuation of an inhaler and breathing the spray for simultaneous or later review by a healthcare practitioner to monitor the user's technique and consult with the user later should the user's technique be found to be deficient.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Those of skill in the art have also identified a need for a system and method that is configured to gage or grade the quality of a user's inhalation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">There is a further need for a system with which real-time lung function data can be obtained, correlated with actual inhaler usage, the patient treatment regimen reassessed, and the patient advised of the updated treatment regimen without having to visit a physician.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">There is a need, then for a system and method that can be used with the majority of inhaler devices already in use and is likely compatible with those developed in the future and is simple in both design and operation, thereby encouraging more widespread use.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">There is a still further need for a system that can make use of respiratory data of a larger number of people to conduct population-level analysis. For example, identifying sub-populations that respond similarly to medications.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention fulfills these needs and others.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Briefly and in general terms there is provided a system and a method to monitor inhaler use by a user.

num="0067">Referring now in more detail to the exemplary drawings for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the invention, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding or like elements among the several views, there is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> a monitor system <b>23</b> for a respiratory device in accordance with one embodiment is very broadly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A tracking module <b>10</b> monitors operation of an inhaler <b>20</b> and reports by wired or wireless communication link to a local station <b>30</b> with processing and communication capabilities. In the description that follows, the station <b>30</b> is a smart device such as a smartphone executing an application or &#x201c;app&#x201d; <b>46</b>. although this is by way of example only. The local station <b>30</b> may alternatively be a tablet, personal computer, or some other device carried by the user. In a less preferred but viable implementation the local station <b>30</b> may be a desktop computer or other fixed processing system. The local station <b>30</b> processes the received signals for transmission via a wired or wireless network <b>40</b> to a server <b>50</b>. The local station <b>30</b> may additionally process the data and provide analysis results or reports to the user such as on a display of the local station, but in another embodiment of the invention it is contemplated that the primary data processing location is at the server <b>50</b>. The server may be remotely located from the local station or in another embodiment, may be nearby.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, other data inputs are received. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, are received as well as irritant inputs. These include allergens, pollution, and particulates. Additionally, a flow meter input is provided which is a basic type of lung function measurement. Finally, the user's medications are input. In one embodiment, this involves connecting with all wireless medications or medication packages, such wireless pill containers and injector pens.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">One or more databases are stored in a memory <b>52</b> with the server. Analysis results can then be accessed by a healthcare professional (for example, a physician, nurse, or healthcare researcher) or other third party from a remote terminal <b>60</b>. The healthcare professional can make use not only of a specific patient's data from a database but also respiratory data of a larger number of people from another database to conduct population-level analysis. This may allow identification of sub-populations that respond similarly to medications, for example, identifying trends not known before, such as children aged 10-15 responding much better to medicine A than medicine B.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to an embodiment of the invention, a monitoring server, most likely the server <b>50</b>, forwards specific medical information to the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system of the physician, including lung function and medication adherence, and can also receive patient information from the EMR, for inclusion in its analysis and/or communicating to the patient. As one example, the server <b>50</b> can access the EMR to obtain the patient's prescription information and use that in sending reminders to the patient and in assessing patient compliance (alternately referred to as adherence) with the prescription.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The system of the invention can also optionally accept usage data from both controller <b>20</b> and rescue <b>25</b> inhalers as well as lung function data from a spirometer <b>28</b>, as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Each of the three respiratory devices <b>20</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>28</b> can incorporate its own sensing, data storage and/or communications interface as needed to supply data to the local station <b>30</b>, although in a preferred embodiment the inhalers <b>20</b> and <b>25</b> each use a separate tracking module <b>10</b> (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the block diagram shows both inhalers connected to the same tracking module <b>10</b>. This is for convenience of illustration only. Although not shown, each inhaler may have a separate tracking module). Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the spirometer <b>28</b> connected with both the tracking module <b>10</b> and the local station <b>30</b>. This also is for convenience of illustration. In one embodiment, the spirometer has its own data collection and wireless communication device to communicate spirometry data directly to the local station wirelessly. The data from each of the three respiratory devices (<b>20</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>28</b>) can be gathered and forwarded to the local station <b>30</b> by its own respective module, or in another embodiment, data can be collected in a shared tracking module <b>10</b>, or a combination of shared and dedicated modules.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is also possible within the scope of the present invention for the system to be designed and operated to monitor only lung function data via a spirometer <b>28</b>, and to interact with the patient to encourage proper and timely use of the spirometer to provide needed data and to facilitate anticipation of potential adverse respiratory events.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">An example of a tracking module <b>10</b> according to the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, with the tracking module in this example comprising a shell <b>12</b>, made of silicone or other flexible material, which can wrap around a standard inhaler <b>20</b> and interlock its ends with one another to be held in place. Alternatively, or in addition, it may be secured to the inhaler by means of a snap, magnet, moldable metal wire, hook-and-loop fastener such as Velcro&#xae; fasteners, and other means. Alternatively, it may be secured over a device without any attachment device, using elasticity to make it cling to the inhaler.

LDT0-028K by Measurement Specialties. While an accelerometer can function as a vibration sensor, an accelerometer is not a zero-power device and can use far too much power from a small battery.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0087">In operation, each tracking module <b>10</b> has a unique identification number and is &#x201c;paired&#x201d;/&#x201c;synced&#x201d;/&#x201c;married&#x201d; to a unique user smartphone (as an example) such that each tracking module has a direct feedback loop with a single user smartphone (hereafter referred to as &#x201c;pairing&#x201d;). The pairing is performed once, either automatically or using the &#x201c;sync&#x201d; button <b>17</b> on the exterior of the tracking module, for example, the user may open the app <b>46</b> on the smartphone, tell the phone to find a device, and the app will find the device if the user presses either the sync button or puffs when the app is looking to sync with a device. The same tracker can be re-paired with different smartphones.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0088">The tracking module <b>10</b> records a date-stamp each time the pressure activated sensor <b>16</b> is depressed (the &#x201c;DateStamp.&#x201d;) The switch sensor <b>16</b> could be provided anywhere on or connected to the tracking module, and not tied to actual medication dispensing, for the user to press after taking a dose of medication. In a preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, the switch <b>16</b> mounts to the top of the medication canister so that the switch is activated each time that the canister is depressed. Alternatively, the operation of the inhaler to deliver a dose could be detected when the user activates any other mechanical mechanism for dispensing medication. The DateStamp is a record of the date and time of activation, preferably associated with a unique &#x201c;Puff ID.&#x201d; Since the dosage per activation is fixed and known, no data need be recorded except the number of activations and the times at which they occurred. The DateStamp is stored in the internal memory of the tracking module. When a DateStamp is recorded, the tracking module immediately searches for the paired device. If the paired device is found, the tracking module transmits the DateStamp, the smartphone confirms receipt, and the tracking module returns to &#x201c;inactive&#x201d; or &#x201c;sleep&#x201d; mode. If proximity is not immediately found, the tracking module regularly seeks the paired smartphone, for example, every 7-10 minutes, or for a thirty second window once per hour, or some other suitable interval. Once proximity is found, the tracking module transmits all stored DateStamp(s) and returns to &#x201c;inactive&#x201d; or &#x201c;sleep&#x201d; mode.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0089">An alternative tracking module <b>70</b> configuration is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, and <b>5</b>C</figref>, designed for use with a Diskus&#xae; inhaler <b>78</b>, which is a DPI. In this case, the tracking module comprises a saddle-shaped shell <b>72</b> designed to fasten onto the Diskus&#xae; inhaler over the exterior portion of the inhaler body that rotates. This alternative tracking module configuration will include the same electronic internal components and will respond to its pressure sensitive switch <b>74</b> and sync button <b>76</b> in the same manner as the HFA model of tracking module <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C, <b>4</b>A, and <b>4</b>B</figref>. In this embodiment, switch <b>74</b> is not mechanically tied to inhaler activation, but is a standalone button that can be activated by the user after each dose to indicate that a dose has been delivered. In a different embodiment, an inhaler activation sensing switch is used in addition to or in place of the standalone switch. In one embodiment of the inhaler activation sensing switch, an acoustic sensor is used that detects the sound of activation of the activation switch <b>74</b>. The acoustic sensor would be mounted as part of the shell <b>72</b> adjacent the activation switch so that the mechanical sound of the switch making internal contact could be detected.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0090">There are a number of features and advantages that flow from the tracking module <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) having the design and operating characteristics as described above. It will exhibit very low power consumption due to the combined effects of low energy Bluetooth communications and an operational design as a largely passive device that spends the majority of its time in an off/standby mode to conserve battery life. For example, the device is ordinarily in an off/standby mode, and when the sensor button is depressed, the tracking module wakes up from standby mode, and attempts to connect with a mobile device for brief period of time. If it succeeds, the stored data is immediately transferred, and the module returns to its off/standby mode. If it is unsuccessful in immediately connecting to a paired mobile device, the tracking module places itself in an off/standby mode and wakes itself at intervals (for example, once per hour) and for durations (for example, thirty seconds) that will not result in significant power consumption.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0091">A further advantage is that, with the tracking module <b>10</b> having its own internal memory, the inhaler <b>15</b> and smartphone <b>30</b> need not be in proximity when a dose is taken. In addition, the embodiment in which the tracking module shell <b>12</b> is made of silicone and wraps around the inhaler <b>15</b> instead of mounting on top of the inhaler leads to an elastic and flexible package. Not only is this easier to use, but this structure also allows the tracking module to fit on different size HFA inhalers as well as other shapes, including disk-shaped inhalers; for example, the Advair Diskus&#xae; inhaler.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0092">Still further, conventional inhaler practice has been to use one inhaler for &#x201c;controller&#x201d; medication <b>20</b>, inhaled daily no matter how a patient feels, to provide sustained patient improvement and prevent attacks and hospitalization, and a different inhaler for &#x201c;rescue&#x201d; medication <b>25</b>, inhaled only when the patient is having difficulty breathing or having an asthma attack. The tracking module <b>10</b> according to the invention can be used for both controller and rescue medication inhalers.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0093">The &#x201c;Sync&#x201d; button <b>17</b> permits pairing and data-transmission without taking a dose, and the tactile feedback on pressing the switch informs the user that the switch has in fact been pushed, decreasing repeated and unnecessary activations.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0094">Additional embodiments include the following:</p><p id="p-0088" num="0095">A vibrate function or audible function is incorporated into the tracking module <b>10</b> or into the smartphone application <b>46</b> that programs the tracking module or the local station <b>30</b> to vibrate or sound an alarm at regular intervals if a dose is not taken.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0096">The tracking module <b>10</b> is configured to make a sound in order for the user to locate the tracking module (for example, if the tracking module is misplaced in a cabinet or has fallen under a couch, etc.).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0097">The tracking module <b>10</b> includes circuitry to monitor battery condition and is programmed to activate a light or lights to indicate to a user the existence of a low battery. The tracking module also includes a dose counter or has access to a dose counter and provides a light to a user indicating that an inhaler medication order should be refilled (e. g., for example when only a few doses are left). The tracking module is programmed to have access to a prescription or data related to a prescription and is programmed to activate a light or to indicate that it is time to take a dose.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0098">The tracking module includes a dose counter and is programmed to display to the user the number of doses remaining.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0099">The tracking module <b>10</b> has a mechanism or mechanisms other than the pressure sensor switch <b>16</b> that detect activation of the inhaler. One is a mechanism that otherwise detects movement of the canister <b>15</b> to activate it to administer a dose of medicine. Another is a mechanism that senses medication exiting the inhaler, as is described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0100">Different wireless communication technology is used for communication between the tracking module <b>10</b> and the local station <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, a WiFi&#xae; system is used. In another embodiment, a mobile cell phone network is used. Other wireless communication technologies may be used. In yet another embodiment, direct wireless communication between the tracking module and the network <b>40</b> is used.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0101">In another embodiment as is described below, the tracking module <b>10</b> is provided with a flow measurement device so that the tracking module monitors not only the number of doses administered but the amount of the medication inhaled from monitoring the inspiratory flow rate and volume. In another embodiment, a wireless spirometer <b>28</b> is used to monitor lung function to measure how medication use impacts a patient's ability to breathe.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0102">In one embodiment, the local station <b>30</b> comprises an in-home beacon that has a WiFi&#xae; enabled hardware device that plugs into a standard wall outlet and is in a permanent and constant receive mode state. The beacon syncs to the tracking module either in response to a user pressing the sync button <b>17</b>, or the pairing could happen in response to detected activation of the inhaler. The beacon relays data from the tracking module <b>10</b> via WiFi&#xae; system and the Internet, to a cloud-based tracking program application in one embodiment. Local-based programs and other remotely but non-cloud based programs may be used as needed or desired.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0103">In addition to the tracking module <b>10</b>, the system of the present invention includes a local station <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) which, in the preferred embodiment, comprises a smartphone running an application (&#x201c;app&#x201d;) <b>46</b> via which the smartphone will interface with the tracking module and transmit data as appropriate to the server <b>50</b>. More than simply storing and forwarding usage data, the application interacts with the patient to facilitate usage tracking, and to encourage adherence with the patient's prescription.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0104">In another embodiment, the app <b>46</b> programs the local station to configure it to adapt user messaging to user behavior. Under this configuration, the local station will deliver more or fewer messages dependent upon the consistency of user behavior, and to be dependent upon user preferences. In such an embodiment, the user can set his or her notification preferences, and notifications will turn off if medication is taken (i.e., good user behavior vs. bad user behavior). Thus, rather than a one-system fits all users, the system is programmed to adapt to each user based on the user's preference and performance. An illustrative example would be for a system to be programmed to recognize a three-hour time window during which the next scheduled inhaler use is to occur, In such a case, the system is programmed to provide messages that are triggered at different times; for example, a reminder one hour in advance of the next scheduled time for inhaler use, a reminder at the time scheduled for inhaler use, reminders once per hour during the three-hour window, and a &#x201c;dose missed&#x201d; message after that. The system sends reminders at all of these events for a patient with a bad adherence record, and to the patient with a good adherence record, the program only sends one reminder shortly before the end of the three-hour window. In another embodiment, the content of the messages differ for persons with good adherence vs. persons with bad adherence. The programming provides a Settings menu with which the patient elects between more frequent and less frequent reminders, and the system then takes into account both the user preference and the adherence history in determining the frequency of the reminders; i.e., how many and which reminders are to be sent.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>10</b></figref> illustrate exemplary screens that are presented to a user during operation of one embodiment of an app <b>46</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) for the system. In a preferred embodiment, the app employs a dynamic interface that communicates through automated (but intelligent) messaging responsive to particular user adherence and response rates. The app employs a red-yellow-green alerting and engagement output that is consistent with Pulmonary (Asthma and COPD) Clinical Guideline at-risk thresholds (red-yellow-green). The app uses the smartphone <b>30</b> clock to calculate most auto-messaging, or the messages can be generated at the cloud server <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and sent to the smartphone <b>30</b> via text or push notification. The functions contained in each screen are described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref>&#x2014;are examples of screens presented during initial setup of the app. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the initial sign in or register screen <b>180</b> for initiating the app. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is the register screen <b>182</b> that permits pairing of the app with a tracking module. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the symptoms and triggers module <b>184</b> that allows for monitoring and alerting of environmental triggers.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> show the home page interface <b>186</b> which is dynamic and configurable to include patient alerting and calls to actions. This can include initiating an emergency communication, which can be a telephone call, SMS, or other text message, email, etc., to a physician or other healthcare professional, a caregiver, or other emergency contact person. It can also include prompts to track lung function, patient educational video and written content, as well as an aggregated red-yellow-green acute event alerting based on adherence, lung function, environmental and other digital biomarker inputs.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0107">In other embodiments, the above-discussed screens can be modified, or additional screens added to show an alert to the patient of a potential adverse event or other complication, an alert regarding a change in the treatment regimen, an alert to the patient to contact the physician, etc.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0108">While the invention has thus far been described primarily in the context of an inhaler, it can be used to track spirometer <b>28</b> usage alternatively or additionally, as briefly indicated above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A spirometer is used to assess lung function, with the user blowing into the spirometer that then measures the strength and volume of an exhalation and/or inhalation. These measurements are transmitted to a local station <b>30</b> and/or to remote server <b>50</b>. It is also possible for a tracking module <b>10</b> to be paired with a spirometer so that the tracking module stores respiratory data reflecting spirometer measurements. This is done with a tracking module dedicated to the spirometer, or separate tracking modules for spirometer and inhaler, or where the spirometer has the elements of a tracking module (for example, activation sensor, internal memory, wireless communication component) incorporated within the spirometer. In this embodiment, the interactive user interface presented by the local station has a separate interface dedicated to spirometer usage, or if inhaler usage data is collected in addition to spirometer measurements, a single interface addresses both inhaler and spirometer usage.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0109">In either case, the local station <b>30</b> (for example, a smartphone) displays images that correlate to the user's inspiration or expiration with the spirometer <b>28</b>. For example, an image of a birthday cake with lit candles where the candles flicker and are extinguished as a user blows into the spirometer can be used to give the user feedback when using the spirometer. Other animations may be used to provide feedback to the user.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0110">By tracking these lung function measurements over time, trends are identified. Response to different inhaler treatment regimens are seen, deterioration of lung function suggesting imminent respiratory event can be spotted, and predictive modeling is used with all available data to predict potential future events/issues more reliably and provide appropriate messages to the patient and/or healthcare support to prevent such events.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0111">By way of example, the system generates communications relating to a potential exacerbation, potential complication, potential acute event, effectiveness of current usage plan and/or potential change to the usage plan. The patient, in a Settings menu for example, designates different persons to receive communications, for example, a caregiver designated to receive communications regarding compliance level, potential acute events, etc., and a physician or medical practice receiving communications relating to potential acute events and also communications relating to the effectiveness of a current usage plan or potential change to that plan. For example, a communication to the healthcare professional relating to the current or potential usage plan would include data on usage and lung function and also includes analysis of that data. A further option would be designating an insurance provider to receive communications regarding a prescription refill.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0112">The smartphone app <b>46</b> in another embodiment instructs the user on proper use of the spirometer <b>28</b> and provides incentives for proper usage if desired. The spirometer has its own internal memory, so it is usable while not in proximity to a local station <b>30</b> or to a tracking module <b>10</b>, and data is synced at a later time either to a tracking module or directly to a local station.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0113">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, there is shown a cross-section view of a typical metered-dose inhaler <b>100</b>. Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) usually have three main parts: a mouthpiece <b>102</b>; a canister of propellant with medication suspension <b>106</b>; and an L-shaped plastic body <b>108</b> within which the canister is located for use. The canister is activated by pressing its bottom surface <b>190</b> into the body of the inhaler. A metering valve in the canister then controls an aerosol <b>116</b> of deagglomerated medication that comes out the mouthpiece for user inhalation. Alterations of these parts are possible.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0114">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, an &#x201c;inhaled-air&#x201d; passage <b>110</b> is located between the outer surface of the canister <b>106</b> and the inner surface <b>107</b> of the inhaler body <b>108</b>. When the user wants to inhale a dose of the medication from the canister, the user places his or her lips over the mouthpiece <b>102</b> and begins inhaling just before the time that he or she presses the top of the canister into the inhaler body to activate the canister and produce the spray or &#x201c;puff&#x201d; <b>116</b> of medication. By beginning the inhale action just before the canister is activated, the user will more likely inhale at the same time that the canister sprays the aerosol <b>116</b> of medication thereby receiving the entire dose of medication from the canister across the user's breathing passages and into his or her lungs. This inhaled-air passage <b>110</b> is upstream <b>192</b> from the location <b>115</b> where the medication spray <b>116</b> is released by the canister, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. The spray <b>116</b> is therefore &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; <b>194</b> from the canister's spray. As the user inhales, he or she will draw in ambient air <b>118</b> through the inhaled-air passage <b>110</b> and into the lungs of the user.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0115">Although the activated canister <b>106</b> sprayed a dose of medication <b>116</b>, and this canister activation can be detected, it would be more desirable if there were evidence that indicates the medication was inhaled by the patient. One way to develop such evidence is to measure the flow of air occurring in the inhaled-air passage <b>110</b>. Detecting such a flow of air would tend to indicate that user inhalation is occurring. The existence of a flow of air through the inhaled-air passage <b>110</b> in the inhalation direction at the same time that the canister <b>106</b> was activated also tends to indicate that a patient has inhaled the dose <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0116">In accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a pressure sensor <b>114</b> has been located in the inhaled-air passage <b>110</b> and will measure the flow of air through the passage. The measurement of pressure in the passage <b>110</b> can result in a flow determination. If the user is inhaling, the pressure will decrease. If the user is exhaling the pressure will increase. Measuring and analyzing this pressure decrease data, including the time the pressure decrease started, the length of time of the pressure decrease, and the time of activation of the canister for the spray of the dose of medication <b>116</b> can even more strongly lead to a conclusion that the inhaler medication reached the patient's lungs. This data can also be used to develop a quality measurement of the patient's inhalation (&#x201c;quality of inhalation&#x201d;) and provide information on the patient's inhalation technique. The embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>, discussed below, show how an embodiment of a tracking module in accordance with aspects of the invention provides this data.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0117">Other factors may affect the quality of inhalation of a user. Some are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> which include environmental factors, such as temperature. Pollution and allergens in the immediate environment can affect the inhalation quality. Particulates in the air and medications the patent may be taking can also affect the quality of inhalation.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> presents a view of an embodiment of another tracking module <b>200</b> in accordance with aspects of the invention. The tracking module <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> operates similarly to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> but has a different configuration for mounting to an inhaler shell and canister. In this figure, there is shown a tracking module having a body <b>134</b> with a front flap <b>122</b> that is configured to be bent over the top of an inhaler in which a medication canister has been installed (not shown) to hold the inhaler in the body of the tracking module. The body includes two ears <b>124</b> that protrude from the body to engage two holes <b>126</b> of the front flap when the front flap is mounted to an inhaler. The tracking module has a dose sensor switch (not shown) similar to that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and is connected with battery power and other electronics <b>128</b> with electrical conductors <b>132</b>. In this embodiment, the tracking module includes a protrusion <b>60</b> that is positioned between the dose detector switch <b>16</b> and the top of the canister to make contact with the top of a canister when the tracking module is mounted to an inhaler (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>).

The inhaler shell <b>108</b> is visible within the tracking module. In this embodiment, the tracking module has an outer shape with shallow detents <b>138</b> for receiving a patient's fingers to assist the patient in firmly grasping the tracking module during use of the inhaler. Similarly, the inhaler activation detection switch <b>16</b> is located in a shallow depression <b>144</b> at the top <b>202</b> of the tracking module to assist the patient in more easily locating the top of the canister during use of the inhaler so that the patient can activate the medication canister <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0120">The detents <b>138</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref> may also house a biometric device or devices. These may take the form of a fingerprint reader as an example Other biometric sensors may be used on the tracker module and may be placed where room exists. In such a case where a biometric reader is used, the memory of the tracking module would contain an identification number or code for that tracking module and a local device that has been paired with that tracking module would store the tracking module's identification. Before use, the biometric sensor <b>138</b> would take the potential user's biometric data and forward it to the local device. The local device may compare the biometric data against a database of the user's and authorized tracking modules. If this potential user is not in the data base as authorized to use this tracking module, the local device may indicate as such on a display screen viewable by the potential user. Other arrangements for identifying potential users from biometric data may be employed.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a front perspective view of the tracking module <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> also showing the tracking module being mounted to an inhalation canister <b>106</b>. In this view, the detector switch <b>16</b> used to detect activation of the inhalation medication canister by a patient pushing the canister into its shell <b>108</b> as discussed above is shown as a rounded surface in contact with the top <b>136</b> of the canister. Also shown in this figure is an accelerometer <b>120</b> mounted at the tracking module and a proximity sensor <b>130</b> mounted to the front flap <b>122</b> of the tracking module and mounted so as to sense the tracking module being in the proximity of a patient. The accelerometer can have multiple uses; however, one of those uses is to sense movement of the inhaler consistent with taking a dose of the inhalation medication from the canister. The data from the accelerometer is stored along with the time the data was produced and is compared to the time recorded for when the patient took the most current dose. Accelerometers require power to operate which can drain the battery of the tracking module. Consequently, the accelerometer may remain in an off, or non-powered, mode until the dose sensor switch <b>16</b> if the inhaler is activated, or until a vibration sensor is activated. Accelerometer data is useful to determine if the user has a good inhaler technique. For example, it can show if the patient is holding the inhaler upright when it was used. A health care practitioner (HCP) can study this data and advise the user that he or she must be upright when administering a dose of inhaler medication or it may not reach the lung successfully.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0122">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, a zero-power vibration sensor can be used to determine if the inhaler is being readied for use. Such sensors are available from multiple sources. One such sensor that has found to be useful is model no. LDT0-028K by Measurement Specialties of Hampton, Va. 23666. Because they are &#x201c;zero-power&#x201d; sensors, they do not drain the tracking module's battery of power when the tracking module <b>200</b> is not in use. However, the sensitivity of such a sensor must be set so that ordinary non-use activities do not activate it. For example, the sensor should be set so that ordinary movements experienced by a user carrying the tracking module in a purse or backpack do not cause the tracking module to be powered up. Another advantage to a zero-power sensor is the detection of an intentional shaking activity by a user in readying the inhaler for use. Some inhalation medications require the user to shake them before use and in this case, the sensitivity of the zero-power vibration sensor can be set to detect such movement and the time of detection of such shaking action is recorded as data to show that the user performed it. The accelerometer may also, or alternatively, be a useful device for detecting the shaking once it is powered up.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a partially cutaway view of the tracking module <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> showing more detail of the dose sensor switch <b>16</b> located in contact with the top <b>136</b> of the canister <b>106</b>. In this embodiment, the dose sensor switch <b>16</b> is pressure activated in that when a user presses on it to activate the canister to spray a dose of medication out the inhaler, the dose sensor switch is activated, and its activation is recorded by the processor of the tracking module <b>200</b>. The shallow depression <b>144</b> in which the dose sensing switch is located is shown.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0124">Further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the dose sensor <b>16</b> includes a flow sensor mounting extension portion <b>206</b> that makes contact with the top <b>136</b> of the canister and extends towards or into the inhaled-air passage <b>110</b>. In this embodiment, the pressure sensor <b>114</b> is attached to the end of the extension portion <b>206</b> so that when the tracking module is properly mounted to an inhaler and the cap is in contact with the top of the canister, the extension portion places the flow sensor at or in the inhaled-air passage as shown. As discussed previously, this is an upstream <b>192</b> location of this particular flow sensor in that ambient air will be pulled past it on its way to the mouthpiece of the inhaler to be mixed downstream at the convergence point <b>115</b> with medication sprayed by the canister into the mouthpiece <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. In that regard, it is positioned upstream of the medication spray from the canister. The flow sensor at this location should provide a more accurate indication of the inhalation of the user. In another embodiment discussed below, a downstream flow sensor may be used in place of the upstream flow sensor or in conjunction with it.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is not drawn to scale but is provided only for the purpose of illustrating where the various elements of the figure lie in relation to each other. The pressure sensor <b>114</b> resides in the inhaled-air passage <b>110</b> and can sense pressure there. When the air <b>112</b> is drawn through the inhaled-air passage <b>110</b> by the user's inhalation, the pressure will decrease, and that pressure decrease will be sensed by the pressure sensor <b>114</b>. The decrease in air pressure in the passage indicates that a flow of air through the passage exists thereby indicating that the inhaler is being used to administer a dose or &#x201c;puff&#x201d; to a patient. Wiring for the flow sensor <b>114</b> is provided along with the wiring for the sensor switch <b>16</b> through the electrical conductors <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0126">The flow sensor <b>114</b> is also able to detect an exhalation of the user prior to an inhalation. Such may occur when a patient is preparing for use of an inhaler and is often recommended by HCPs. It is not necessary for the user to exhale through the inhaler, but some users may do so. The user may hold the inhaler in his or her mouth, exhale through the inhaler to empty his or her lungs, begin inhaling, then press the canister into the inhaler to activate it, and continue inhaling the medication from the canister. In such an arrangement, the flow sensor <b>114</b> would output signals indicating the flow of exhaled air, then a flow of inhaled air. This data is recorded by the tracking module processor for later review if needed. By using a pressure sensor, the direction of flow is easily determined. When the pressure returns to ambient pressure, the recording of data from the flow sensor <b>114</b> would cease in this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0127">A sensor useful for the above flow sensing function is the Omron Barometric Pressure Sensor contained in the Omron Evaluation Kit F2D3. See http://omronfs.omron.com/en_US/ecb/products/pdf/en_2smpb_02e.pdf. The sensor is sensitive enough to detect a pressure change when the patient inhales when taking the dose from the activated canister. Other sensors may be used and other locations for the sensor may be used. A flow sensor or pressure sensor of a different type that is capable of determining that air is flowing through the inhaled-air passage <b>110</b> may provide the same results as the barometric sensor mentioned above. Whether the sensor is a pressure sensor, either barometric or other, or an acoustic sensor that is sensitive enough to detect the sound of air rushing past it caused by breathing of the patient, it should be of a shape, small size, and location so that it does not distort or interfere with the user's ability to properly inhale and/or exhale through the inhaler.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0128">The measurement of flow of air through the passage <b>110</b> results in a quality measurement &#x201c;Q&#x201d; in labeling the patient's inhalation. The output of the pressure change sensed by the barometric sensor is compared to a database to determine if this particular inhaled dose was an inhalation that was light, medium, or heavy. A base line pressure would be recorded when the canister is shaken. Then pressure change would be measured as the dose button is pressed. The change &#x394; in atmospheric pressure is measured as soon as the canister activation button (dose button) <b>16</b> is pressed. The &#x394; would be compared to curves stored in a database of &#x394;s to determine the quality of the dose. However, the quality of the inhalation may be graded in a way that is different from &#x201c;light,&#x201d; &#x201c;medium,&#x201d; or &#x201c;heavy.&#x201d; It may be graded as &#x201c;unacceptable,&#x201d; &#x201c;acceptable,&#x201d; or &#x201c;good.&#x201d; The purpose is to grade the relative quality levels of an inhalation. Likely aspects of quality are: the inspiratory flow rate (for example, &#x201c;acceptable&#x201d;=&#x2265;10 liters/minute (L/m) and &#x201c;good&#x201d;=&#x2265;20 liters/minute); the timing between inhalation and puff actuation of the canister (did inhalation start before activation of the canister); and the length of time of the inhalation.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0129">The pressure/flow sensor <b>114</b> provided in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> that is attached to the removable tracking module provides the ability to use common inhalers that are readily available today. Today's MDIs are designed to have the inhaled-air passage <b>110</b> between the canister <b>106</b> and the inhaler <b>108</b> for inhalation purposes. Designing the tracker module <b>100</b> so that it has the pressure/flow sensor <b>114</b> built into the extension portion <b>206</b> of the detector switch <b>16</b> that interacts with the canister and that permits positioning the sensor in the air passage as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, enables those common inhalers to continue to be used. Fortuitously, the pressure sensor is easily removed from the inhaled-air passage <b>110</b> when the cap <b>13</b> or cap portion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) or front flap <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) of the tracker module <b>10</b> is disengaged from the canister for replacement of the canister.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0130">Referring now in more detail to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, an inhaler tracking module <b>200</b> is shown mounted around the inhaler <b>108</b>. The tracking module has been designed to mount around the outside of the outer shell or body <b>108</b> of the inhaler <b>100</b>, similarly to the shell <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C, and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>. The tracking module operates similarly to that of the earlier figures. Many MDI's require the patient to shake the medication canister before using. Because the canister is installed in the inhaler device, the user will shake the inhaler device with the tracking module mounted to it. The patient then exhales completely, starts to inhale and presses the canister of the inhaler to expel the medication all the while he or she is inhaling. The present HeroTracker&#xae; tracking module <b>10</b> from Cohero Health, Inc. of New York, N.Y., becomes operationally active (&#x201c;wakes up&#x201d;) by the patient pressing a dose sensor button <b>16</b> located in contact with the top <b>136</b> of the inhaler canister <b>106</b> that will administer the drug. At this time, the inhalation procedure might already be happening since the patient may begin inhalation before pressing the dose button. However, embodiments disclosed herein show and describe different features.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0131">As described above, the tracking module <b>200</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is awakened by a vibration sensor <b>164</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). The vibration sensor may also be used to verify that the patient shook the canister as required and to record how long the canister was shaken. The accelerometer <b>120</b> may also be used for this purpose. If there is a minimum time required for canister shaking, data from the shake sensor or accelerometer will assist in monitoring the inhaler technique of this particular user. It would be expected that a dose would be administered sometime after the canister shaking. Waking the tracking module by the shaking sensor signal before the canister button <b>16</b> is pressed would &#x201c;awaken&#x201d; (power up) the processor of the tracking module to measure any exhalation and inhalation time from signals provided by a flow/pressure sensor. If there is no drug delivery within a preset time after detection of shaking, the tracking module would go back to sleep; such as if there were some other vibration that was not consistent with correct procedure. A vibration sensor in one embodiment is mounted to the same printed circuit board as the processor.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0132">As briefly described above, the vibration sensor <b>164</b> in one embodiment is a zero-power device and is mounted to the circuit board on which the processor is mounted. A pendulum connecting to a contact would suffice. Also, a suspended weight hitting a piezoelectric device would cause enough voltage to wake up the processor of the tracking module <b>10</b>. Other methods could work if they were ultra-low power, such as less than 5 microamperes. A vibration threshold that triggers a processor wake up would need to be selected that causes the wake-up but does not cause a wake up when the inhaler is subjected only to normal handling. This feature minimizes the power consumption.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0133">Vibration sensors are available from a number of sources and function in different ways. A preferable vibration sensor for the tracking module of one embodiment is a zero-power device. That is, the vibration sensor is not powered to operate. The pendulum approach described above is often zero power. The bob of the movable pendulum forms one contact of an electrical circuit and a plurality of contacts surrounding the movement arc of the bob of the pendulum provide the other contact. The electrical circuit that is created when the bob touches an electrical contact causes an interrupt to the processor which then turns the electronics on of the tracking module.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0134">Such vibration sensors are common and are well known to those of skill in the art. Consequently, no further details concerning their structure or operation are provided here.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0135">Another sensor that may be used for detecting vibration or shaking, depending on power requirements and the limitations of battery power, is a three-axis accelerometer <b>120</b> (shown in block form). An accelerometer can sense shaking of the inhaler as well as the time of day that the shaking occurred, the intensity of shaking, and the length of time of shaking. These can be sensed and stored as data by the tracking module processor and local memory. Such data can also be used to affect the quality determination of the inhalation. Some accelerometers remain in a sleep mode but are promptly awakened upon sensing a shaking motion of a certain intensity. Another sensor usable for the purpose of sensing shaking is a piezoelectric device that produces an electrical signal when it receives an electrical shock. Such a device is available from Murata having a part no. of 7BB-20-3.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0136">In another embodiment, a dynamic accelerometer <b>120</b> is used to measure gravitational pull to determine the angle at which the inhaler is tilted with respect to the Earth. The inhaler can thereby record in which direction, or orientation, the mouthpiece is pointing when a dose is administered. In the embodiment described above, the accelerometer is activated when it detects shaking of a certain level of intensity. In another embodiment, the accelerometer is in the off mode until the dose sensor <b>16</b> (button switch) is pressed to administer a dose of inhaler medication from the canister. The accelerometer is immediately powered, and its signals are stored along with the dose detection signal in the memory. By sensing the orientation and movement or non-movement of the inhaler with the accelerometer, it can be determined if the dose was likely administered to a patient or was mistakenly given, such as by dropping the inhaler on the floor, which can be detected by the accelerometer. Various accelerometers are available from multiple manufacturers, including those used in mobile telephones.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0137">In another embodiment where there may be concern about whether a tracking module <b>10</b> is awake for use in tracking a dose administration, a visible light source mounted in the tracking module is used. When the processor of the tracking module <b>200</b> is active and operational, a small green light is powered on that is easily visible to the user. To conserve battery power, the light is very efficient; i.e., a small green light emitting diode (LED) is usable. In this embodiment, the tracking module provides an indication if the processor is operational and is using battery power when the user is not intending to use the inhaler. Such a condition may exist if the inhaler is placed in a user's backpack and experiences rough handling. The shaker sensor signal may result in the processor becoming operational and awaiting the dose sensor signal. The user can then recognize that the inhaler is needlessly using battery power and decide to store the inhaler in a different location that would not experience rough handling when it is not being used.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0138">Also shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a proximity sensor <b>130</b> mounted to the front flap <b>122</b> of the tracking module <b>200</b>. The purpose of the proximity sensor is to detect whether the inhaler <b>100</b> is near a user when the canister <b>106</b> is activated to deliver a dose of the inhaler medication. One embodiment of a proximity sensor comprises an infrared (IR) sensor that transmits a beam. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> in block form, an infrared device <b>130</b> (transmitter/receiver) is located at the front flap <b>122</b> of the tracking module. The proximity sensor is oriented so that its beam is directed in the direction of the mouthpiece <b>102</b>; i.e., towards a user who would be using the inhaler and would put the mouthpiece in his or her mouth. The sensor will detect a return signal if the user is in the correct position with his or her mouth over the mouthpiece when the canister <b>106</b> is activated. Such an IR sensor can be obtained from Vishay Americas, Inc., One Greenwich Place, Shelton, Conn. 06484, https://www.visha.com/.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0139">The IR sensor <b>130</b> (proximity sensor) can determine that it and the inhaler, are near the user of the inhaler when the canister is activated, and a dose was dispensed. This tends to indicate that the user has taken a dose. However, if there is no response to the transmitted IR beam, it may mean that the inhaler was in the wrong location and the user did not take a dose from the inhaler, or that something else is wrong.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0140">In another embodiment, the IR sensor <b>130</b> has both near field and far field modes and its data is provided to the tracking module's processor. In another embodiment, a second IR sensor is used for the far field while the sensor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>; i.e., sensor <b>130</b>, is used for near field. In the far field operation, the IR sensor field extends many feet or meters around the tracking module to detect the existence of a human within the field. If no human is detected for a certain amount of time, the data from the IR detector will indicate as such and the processor of the tracking module will turn off the tracking module. In this embodiment, the far field IR sensor is solely used to turn off the tracking module so that battery power can be conserved. Thus, the far field IR sensor or sensor mode is not activated until the tracking module is activated, such as by a user pressing the dose activation switch <b>16</b> or by a vibration detector.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0141">To briefly review, the tracking module <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C, and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> and the description accompanying those figures. In accordance with aspects of the invention, there is provided in this embodiment a Bluetooth&#xae; low energy-enabled (BLE) inhaler tracking module that connects to or is integrated with an MDI and contains sensors to track canister activation <b>16</b>, mouthpiece contact, orientation <b>120</b>, proximity to a user <b>130</b>, and air flow rate <b>114</b> in the medication chamber of the MDI. This combination of sensors would provide greater confidence that both the activation and release of medication from the canister occurred along with an indication that the MDI was correctly inserted in the patient's mouth for a sufficient time for the patient to complete inhalation of the dose and have that dose cross his or her airways and end up in the lungs. The same or similar principles apply to the Diskus&#xae; inhaler shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, and <b>5</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0142">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the inhaler <b>100</b> includes a capacitive touch sensor <b>140</b> and a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) pressure/flow sensor or sensors <b>142</b> integrated into the MDI of the figure to capture data indicating correct patient technique in medication inhalation. In this embodiment, there is a capacitive touch sensor <b>140</b> on the top and bottom (not shown) of the mouthpiece <b>102</b>. These capacitive sensors will provide data on the proper positioning and mouth contact with the inhaler during a medication canister activation. The flow sensor <b>142</b> will provide data measuring air/medication flow rate during actuation and medication release to indicate quality of inhalation. These sensors are located on the actual inhaler as opposed to being mounted to a tracking module that can be mounted go an inhaler and removed from it.

A spacer is a device that attaches to a metered-dose inhaler and helps to deliver the medicine to the airways of the user's lungs instead of the mouth. This helps the inhaler medication work better and lessens side effects such as candidiasis (thrush) and dysphonia (hoarseness). &#x201c;Spacer&#x201d; is a generic term for any open tube placed on the mouthpiece of an MDI to extend its distance from the mouth.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0155">The contents of an MDI are under pressure and are released quickly, making it more difficult to coordinate inhalation of the particles. The spacer chamber suspends these particles until the user inhales, reducing the amount of coordination required to inhale the particles, thus easing the delivery of medication into the lungs. These devices are recommended for all children who have difficulty coordinating breathing and the use of the inhaler correctly.
