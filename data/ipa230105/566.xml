One principle involved makes use of distributed strain measurement in the optical fiber using characteristic Rayleigh backscatter or controlled grating patterns. The shape along the optical fiber begins at a specific point along the sensor, known as the launch point (or z=0), and the subsequent shape position and orientation are relative to that point. For meaningful clinical use, shape-sensed devices may be registered to an imaging frame of reference (such as a pre-operative CT or a live fluoroscopy image).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has replaced open surgery as the most common technique for the repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The procedure is typically carried out under x-ray fluoroscopy guidance and uses significant amounts of contrast to position and deploy the stent graft correctly. On average 50-100 mL of contrast dye is used during an EVAR procedure, which may result in acute renal failure in rare cases.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The most common complication from EVAR is endoleaks resulting from an insufficient seal of the stent graft to the aorta. Endoleaks involve incorrect flow around the stent (for example, flow around the stent at the proximal or distal attachment site, flow through the graft wall, retrograde flow from the branches, etc.).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another complication around EVAR involves ischemia of the aortic side branches (such as the colonic, renal, and pelvic arteries). This can occur due to misplacement of the stent graft such that the stent partially or completely covers one of the side vessels. This is associated with a lack of high-quality imaging technology as well as the experience of the endovascular team.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In EVAR, endografts are contained within a deployment system that is used to navigate the endograft to the correct part of the vasculature. The deployment systems tend to be relatively large and stiff endovascular devices. They typically involve a handle or set of knobs and dials at the proximal end to control the various steps around the deployment. The endograft lies within a distal part of the device and is only released once the device has been navigated to the appropriate location. In some cases, the endograft completely deploys in one step, while in other cases the endograft can be partially deployed to allow for correct positioning and orientation before the final deployment step firmly attaches the endograft to the vasculature (typically through a retaining/sealing ring).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The endograft typically requires a sufficient amount of healthy vasculature where it can land its sealing ring. If this is not possible beneath the renal arteries, then the stent will cover those arteries, and must create some alternative way of maintaining flow to those vessels. This can be done with a fenestrated endograft (e.g., a endograft with windows for the side-branches) in a procedure known as fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR). In this case, the endograft has fenestrations that must be lined up correctly with the side branches and additional stents are placed to connect the side vessels to the main stent.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Under x-ray guidance the endograft can be visualized through x-ray visible markers that are located in key positions on the stent. In a fenestrated stent, the markers identify the locations of the fenestrations and can be used to orient the endograft to appropriately align the fenestrations with the side vessels. Complications from EVAR includes misplacement of the endograft resulting in endoleaks, misplacement of the endograft resulting in occlusion of the side branches, contrast nephropathy due to high levels of contrast used during endograft deployment and high contrast and radiation dose due to long procedure times due to navigation and deployment in a complex anatomy. In addition, placement of a three-dimensional endograft within a three-dimensional anatomy is challenging and is typically performed under two-dimensional imaging guidance through x-ray fluoroscopy.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with the present principles, a medical device deployment system includes a main body and a guidewire capable of being passed through the main body and including a lumen.

Introducing OSS for navigation to endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) can reduce radiation dose and provide a more intuitive way to position catheters and guidewires within a three-dimensional vasculature to reduce procedure times and improve outcomes.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">One feature of EVAR procedures is the deployment of an endograft. The orientation and position of the endograft is an important consideration in making a good seal with the vessel and adjusting the flow such that an aneurysm is no longer under pressure. If the endograft is not positioned correctly, blood may leak around the endograft and continue to pool in an aneurysm sac, or the endograft could occlude side-vessels off the aorta which can cause poor blood flow to critical organs. In fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR), side-branches (such as the renal arteries) need to be cannulated. This cannulation involves navigating a catheter and guidewire through a semi-deployed stent graft, exiting the endograft via a fenestration, and then entering the target vessel. While this can be done largely through the known position and shape of the devices through OSS, it may also be advantageous to see the position of the endograft (and corresponding fenestrations). Thus, by shape sensing the endograft, the endograft position/orientation/shape can be tracked during deployment for optimal positioning, and cannulation of side-vessels can be performed without (or with minimal) use of x-ray guidance. In one embodiment, guidance can be performed based on OSS-enabled devices, an OSS-enabled stent graft, and a pre-operative CT/live fluoroscopy.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">OSS-enabled devices, such as, e.g., guidewires, catheters etc. provide an operator with knowledge of the shape and deformation and position of points on the device(s) or the entire device(s). The present principles integrate removable optical shape sensed devices into the endograft, stent, balloon, etc. prior to introduction to the body to provide enhanced visualization information during placement. To further provide the operator with knowledge of a deployable device shape, position, and orientation, OSS guidance may be introduced into the deployment process. A deployable or deployment device may include an endograft, stent, guidewire, catheter, balloon catheter, mitral clip, mitral valve, left atrial appendage (LAA) closure device, etc.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">To introduce the use of OSS into an interventional procedure, the fiber needs to be integrated in the device used for the intervention. Incorporating a shape sensing fiber directly into the deployment device may call for the modification of an existing device. One solution includes an optical shape sensing fiber that is integrated into a guidewire used as a &#x2018;delivery rail&#x2019; for the stent deployment system. This guidewire is then registered to the stent or endograft, and then used to model the stent or endograft position and orientation during deployment. Since the deployment device runs over the guidewire, information about the position and orientation of the device can be obtained; however, information about its state of deployment may not be available. Clipping an OSS enabled retrofit attachment onto the handle of the deployment device can be employed to provide additional information about the state of deployment and thus be used to create a more complete model of the stent or endograft position during deployment. These processes can be complemented through the use of fluoroscopy to update the model.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be understood that the present invention will be described in terms of medical instruments; however, the teachings of the present invention are much broader and are applicable to any fiber optic instruments.

While described in terms of the endograft <b>102</b>, the present principles can also apply to balloon catheters, clips, valves, and other implantables.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the fibers <b>126</b> of the OSS system <b>104</b> are integrated within or through the guidewire <b>103</b>, the deployment system <b>107</b> and/or the handle <b>105</b> of the deployment system <b>107</b>. The OSS system <b>104</b> can be employed for making physical measurements. The measurements may be employed for planning or for placement of the endograft <b>102</b>. The endograft <b>102</b> may also include an OSS system <b>104</b> to provide position and orientation information for the endograft <b>102</b> itself.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Shape sensing system <b>104</b> with fiber optics may be based on fiber optic Bragg grating sensors in one or more optical fibers. A fiber optic Bragg grating (FBG) is a short segment of optical fiber that reflects particular wavelengths of light and transmits all others. This is achieved by adding a periodic variation of the refractive index in the fiber core, which generates a wavelength-specific dielectric mirror. A fiber Bragg grating can therefore be used as an inline optical filter to block certain wavelengths, or as a wavelength-specific reflector.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A fundamental principle behind the operation of a fiber Bragg grating is Fresnel reflection at each of the interfaces where the refractive index is changing. For some wavelengths, the reflected light of the various periods is in phase so that constructive interference exists for reflection and, consequently, destructive interference for transmission. The Bragg wavelength is sensitive to strain as well as to temperature. This means that Bragg gratings can be used as sensing elements in fiber optical sensors. In an FBG sensor, strain causes a shift in the Bragg wavelength.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">One advantage of this technique is that various sensor elements can be distributed over the length of a fiber. Incorporating three or more cores with various sensors (gauges) along the length of a fiber that is embedded in a structure permits a three dimensional form of such a structure to be precisely determined, typically with better than 1 mm accuracy. Along the length of the fiber, at various positions, a multitude of FBG sensors can be located (e.g., 3 or more fiber sensing cores). From the strain measurement of each FBG, the curvature of the structure can be inferred at that position. From the multitude of measured positions, the total three-dimensional form is determined.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As an alternative to fiber-optic Bragg gratings, the inherent backscatter in conventional optical fiber can be exploited. One such approach is to use Rayleigh scatter in standard single-mode communications fiber. Rayleigh scatter occurs as a result of random fluctuations of the index of refraction in the fiber core. These random fluctuations can be modeled as a Bragg grating with a random variation of amplitude and phase along the grating length. By using this effect in three or more cores running within a single length of multi-core fiber, the 3D shape and dynamics of the surface of interest can be followed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be understood that optical shape sensing may be performed in a plurality of ways and is not limited to FBGs or Rayleigh scatter techniques. For example, other techniques may include channels etched into the fiber, employing quantum dots for reflection, employing a plurality of separate fibers (e.g., 3 or more) instead of a single multicore fiber or other optical shape sensing techniques.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Workstation <b>112</b> includes a display <b>118</b> for viewing internal images of a subject (patient) or volume <b>131</b> and may include an image <b>134</b> (preoperative or intraoperative images) or an image <b>136</b> (OSS data) as an overlay or other rendering registered with the shape sensing system <b>104</b> in one or more of the components employed in the procedure.

If the fiber <b>126</b> takes a predefined and immutable path, the curvature and shape information of that path can be used to identify a unique image to fiber transformation to be stored in memory <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">An image processing module <b>142</b> is configured to combine images (<b>134</b>) and OSS position data (image <b>136</b>) for joint or separate display on the display <b>118</b>. The OSS data <b>136</b> and the image data (from pre-operative or intraoperative images <b>134</b>) can be registered and jointly displayed to assist in placement of the endograft <b>102</b> (or other stent or implantable device). An imaging system <b>110</b> may include a fluoroscopy system (x-rays) for collecting real-time visual information about positions of instruments or anatomical features. Images <b>134</b> collected with the imaging device <b>110</b> may be registered with the OSS data from OSS system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">One step in endograft <b>102</b> deployment is the positioning of x-ray visible (radiopaque) markers <b>132</b>. These are initially positioned when the endograft <b>102</b> is advanced on the guidewire <b>103</b> to the approximate location. If the endograft can be semi-deployed (as in FEVAR), then the markers <b>132</b> are re-used to fine tune the position of the endograft <b>102</b>. Placement of a three-dimensional endograft <b>102</b> within a three-dimensional anatomy is challenging and is typically performed under two-dimensional imaging guidance through x-ray fluoroscopy. As a consequence, misplacement of the endograft <b>102</b> can occur, and procedure times can become very long.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">During a conventional FEVAR procedure, a significant portion of time is spent cannulating the fenestrations of an endograft to ensure alignment with an underlying vasculature. Specifically, the operator attempts to align all fenestrations, or windows, to ensure side branches are not occluded by the main stent graft body. The operator must navigate up and into the main stent graft body, then exit the fenestration and enter the side vessel. To do this, the anatomy needs to be seen as well as the position and orientation of the endograft.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">By shape sensing a guidewire <b>103</b> and/or a portion of the deployment system <b>107</b>, e.g., the handle <b>105</b>, and thus the position of the endograft (or at least the relevant markers on the endograft), the navigation can be simplified. Then, navigation can be performed using the registered pre-operative (e.g., CT) images for guidance. To introduce the use of optical shape sensing into an interventional procedure, it is first necessary to integrate the fiber into one or more of the devices/systems used for the intervention. Given the complexity of these systems, such integration would be both technically challenging and would require significant changes to existing designs. However, by integrating optical shape sensing into the guidewire <b>103</b> used during endograft deployment and registering the endograft <b>102</b> to the guidewire <b>103</b> in accordance with the present principles, the system <b>100</b> can be used with any type of stent and/or deployment system <b>107</b> with limited impact on design of the endograft or the deployment mechanism.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In accordance with particularly useful embodiments, the OSS system <b>104</b> is integrated into the guidewire <b>103</b> over which the endograft deployment system <b>107</b> is placed. The deployment system handle <b>105</b> is coupled to the guidewire <b>103</b> and any motion of the endograft <b>102</b> is tracked with respect to the guidewire <b>103</b>. The endograft <b>102</b> is registered to the OSS system <b>104</b> in the guidewire <b>103</b>. The guidewire <b>103</b> may include a stiff guidewire having diameter of between about 0.014 to about 0.045 inches, and typically about 0.035 inches.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">While the present principles may be applied to any interventional guidewire used in combination with a stent or endograft, the present embodiments employ the guidewire <b>103</b> with a lumen or channel therein for OSS system <b>104</b> to be disposed so that the position and orientation of the guidewire <b>103</b> is known. Such a guidewire <b>103</b> acts as a &#x2018;delivery rail&#x2019; for the stent deployment tool (<b>107</b>), which passes down a dedicated guidewire lumen within the deployment system <b>107</b>. Since the guidewire <b>103</b> is physically inside the deployment system <b>107</b>, the reconstructed shape of the guidewire <b>103</b> is representative of the shape of the deployment system <b>107</b>. However, the guidewire <b>103</b> is free to rotate and translate inside the deployment system <b>107</b>, and therefore, the precise position and orientation of the endograft <b>102</b>, x-ray visible markers <b>132</b> or the tip of the deployment system <b>107</b> may be unknown.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The configuration of the deployment system <b>107</b> is such that one handle <b>105</b> may be connected to the endograft <b>102</b> in an axially and torsionally stiff manner. This permits re-orientation of the endograft <b>102</b> intra-operatively but can also be re-purposed to maintain a registration between the guidewire <b>103</b> and the deployment system <b>107</b>. This can be achieved in several different ways.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in one embodiment, a clamping mechanism <b>150</b> is employed between the guidewire <b>103</b> and the deployment system <b>107</b>.

Once at this location, the clamping mechanism <b>150</b> within the deployment system <b>107</b> would be activated thus physically coupling the deployment system <b>107</b> to the guidewire <b>103</b>. Thus, pending registration between the OSS system <b>104</b> and a known feature in the deployment system <b>107</b> (such as x-ray visible markers), any subsequent manipulation of the deployment system <b>107</b> is known with respect to a shape sensing co-ordinate system.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The clamping system <b>150</b> may include a system that is integrated into the handle <b>105</b> of the deployment device <b>107</b> or a retrofit system that attaches to the deployment system <b>107</b> and then clamps the guidewire <b>103</b> proximal to entry into the deployment system <b>107</b>.

View <b>164</b> shows the coupling features <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> prior to engagement, and view <b>166</b> shows the coupling features <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> after engagement.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, another embodiment includes a rotational tracking sensor <b>190</b> that tracks rotation between the handle <b>105</b> and the guidewire <b>103</b>. In cases in which it is not desirable to have the guidewire <b>103</b> rotationally coupled to the deployment system <b>107</b>, it is possible to incorporate sensors <b>190</b> into the handle <b>105</b> or attachment piece such that the guidewire <b>103</b> connects to the deployment system <b>107</b> in a manner which enables the relative rotation and translation of the two devices to be measured. This embodiment may include an optical encoder (<b>190</b>) (or similar mechanism) within the handle <b>105</b> to measure rotation, and a linear potentiometer <b>191</b> (or similar mechanism) embedded within the handle <b>105</b> but which couples to the guidewire <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, another embodiment tracks the handle <b>105</b> and the guidewire <b>103</b> using a template <b>192</b> with the OSS system <b>104</b>, using a known shape in the template <b>192</b> within the guidewire lumen. If the guidewire <b>103</b> is forced to pass through a specific shape within the handle of the deployment system <b>107</b>, its position and orientation with respect to the system can be identified.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the endograft <b>102</b> may be registered to the guidewire <b>103</b> in a number of ways. These may include registering the OSS system <b>104</b> in the guidewire <b>103</b> to x-ray visible markers <b>202</b> on the stent or endograft <b>102</b>. This can be performed using an x-ray registration that employs a tip of the guidewire <b>103</b> and the markers <b>202</b> visible in the x-ray image to determine their relationship. In some cases, the tip of the guidewire <b>103</b> may not be visible within the same x-ray image as the stent <b>102</b>. An alternative way to perform this registration is to make unique x-ray visible bands <b>204</b> on the guidewire <b>103</b> along its distal length so that one of those bands is likely to be in close proximity to the endograft or stent <b>102</b>, and thus enable registration. Additional methods of registering the OSS system <b>104</b> are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">By registering the position of the markers <b>202</b> to the guidewire <b>103</b> or to markers <b>204</b> on the guidewire <b>103</b>, a virtual representation of the markers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> can be displayed within the 3D visualization framework (e.g., on display <b>118</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Then, as the deployment system <b>107</b> is manipulated, the position of the markers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> can be updated accordingly. Similarly a 3D model of the stent graft <b>102</b> can be deformed according to the known positions of the markers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and the OSS shape data from OSS system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A 2D overlay of a fluoro image of the stent <b>102</b> can be displayed to the user and adapted based on the guidewire position and orientation. This is particularly useful, for example, in FEVAR when the main body stent has been partially deployed and navigation is underway to cannulate the side vessels using OSS-enabled devices. In this situation, knowing the position of the fenestration markers <b>202</b> on the stent <b>102</b> can provide additional information for navigating through the stent <b>102</b> and into side vessels. The stent <b>102</b> can be visualized using the information provided by tracking the guidewire <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">It should be noted that in the case of a semi-deployable stent, once the initial position of the stent <b>102</b> has been identified and the stent <b>102</b> semi-deployed, registration needs to be repeated prior to any further navigation of other OSS enabled devices (catheters guidewires, etc.) through the fenestrations, etc. This is due to the fact that the stent graft <b>102</b> will expand and the position of the x-ray visible markers <b>202</b> will shift.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A virtual representation of the stent graft as a full 3D model of the stent may be employed in various stages of deployment. Such a representation would clearly provide a further simplified navigation task. Especially in the case of stenting, where it is important to carefully maintain mechanical properties, it may be preferable to not interfere with the functional properties of the endograft <b>102</b>. In addition, there are typically many types of endograft <b>102</b> that use only one type of deployment handle <b>105</b>. An OSS system <b>104</b> may be employed as a retrofit attachment onto the handle. In this way, multiple stents can be addressed by one design.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, another embodiment tracks the handle <b>105</b> and the guidewire <b>103</b> using a same OSS system <b>104</b>. A proximal end of the OSS system <b>104</b> exits the guidewire <b>103</b> and is connected to a fixed point (attachment point) <b>174</b> on the deployment system <b>107</b> before returning to a launch fixture <b>170</b>. As before, the location of this fixed point <b>174</b> is preferably on the distal handle <b>105</b> of the deployment system <b>107</b> since this rigidly coupled to a main backbone of the system <b>107</b> and thus the location of the endograft <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, another embodiment tracks the handle <b>105</b> and the guidewire <b>103</b> using different OSS systems <b>104</b>. A second OSS system <b>104</b>&#x2032; is attached to a fixed point <b>184</b> on the deployment system <b>107</b> and registered to a shape sensing co-ordinate system. The location of this fixed point <b>184</b> is preferably at a point on the handle <b>105</b> of the deployment system <b>107</b> since this is rigidly coupled to a main backbone of the system <b>107</b> and thus the location of the endograft <b>102</b>. This configuration permits the guidewire <b>103</b> to be rotated and translated with respect to the deployment system <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, four positions <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> of a deployment system are depicted with corresponding model images <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> and <b>226</b> of blood vessels having a stent <b>102</b> being deployed therein, are depicted. A clip-on attachment <b>302</b> (or set of attachments) may be included to connect one or more OSS systems <b>104</b> to a handle or handles <b>105</b> of the deployment system <b>107</b>. A method for registering the stent <b>102</b> to the OSS system <b>104</b> is also needed. The clip-on attachment <b>302</b> that connects to the deployment system <b>107</b> can provide a simple way to enable visualization of the endograft deployment process. Motions at a proximal portion of the deployment system <b>107</b> directly map to changes in the stent position and state of deployment.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, the clip-on attachment <b>302</b> includes adhesive strips or pieces that are employed that attach to the OSS system <b>104</b> and are fixed to the proximal and distal handles <b>105</b> of the deployment system <b>107</b>. The OSS system <b>104</b> returns back to a launch base or fixture <b>308</b> where its origin resides. Clips <b>302</b> can be removed and re-applied for another stent deployment within a same procedure. The clips <b>302</b> can be comprised of a mechanical fixation device (e.g., clip, toggle clamp, spring clasp, etc.), an adhesive, a magnetic attachment, a band or other attachment device.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The position of the stent graft <b>102</b>, the orientation of the stent graft <b>102</b> and the state of deployment (how many of the individual stents on the stent graft have been deployed) need to be known. There are three primary features that need be known about the stent to provide a meaningful visualization. It is assumed that a shape sensed guidewire <b>103</b> is being used as part of the deployment process. This guidewire <b>103</b> can provide part of the information to determine the position of the stent <b>102</b>. In some cases, the guidewire <b>103</b> may not be coupled to the deployment system <b>107</b> so it does not provide information about the orientation. The clip-on attachment <b>302</b> can sense the orientation of a retaining ring of the stent graft <b>102</b> (or whichever portion of the stent graft that is rigidly attached to the deployment system <b>107</b>) because the orientation of the distal portion of the handle <b>105</b> is directly coupled to the orientation of the attachment site of the stent graft <b>102</b> (very stiff torsionally). This is what enables the fine manipulation of the stent graft <b>102</b> during deployment. Therefore, by sensing the position of the distal deployment handle <b>105</b>, the orientation of the attachment point on the stent graft <b>102</b> can be extracted.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The clip-on attachment <b>302</b> may provide information about the state of deployment of the stent graft <b>102</b> by measuring a relative position of actuating elements (e.g., handles <b>105</b>) of the stent deployment system <b>107</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, separation between the distal and proximal handles <b>105</b> on the deployment system directly relates to how many individual stents or stent length that has been released. Visualization of the stent deployment using shape sensing on the handles <b>105</b> with a clip-on attachment <b>302</b> includes OSS system <b>104</b> attached to both distal and proximal handles.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">It would also be possible to infer the state of stent deployment by incorporating the OSS system <b>104</b> into the handle or handles <b>105</b> of the deployment system <b>107</b> without modification of the multiple different deployment systems available on the market. Interfacing of the OSS system(s) <b>104</b> can be done with a separate OSS visualization framework. The clip-on attachment <b>302</b> provides the same functionality as the embodiments described above without the need for handle modifications. The clip-on attachment <b>302</b> to the handle <b>105</b> can be done with a different OSS system <b>104</b> than that employed for the guidewire <b>103</b>, or by using the OSS system <b>104</b> after leaving from a proximal portion of the guidewire <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, an illustrative deployment system <b>107</b> is shown along with a magnified view of an adhesive clip-on attachment <b>302</b>&#x2032;. In addition to attaching onto the handle <b>105</b>, the adhesive or clip attachment <b>302</b>&#x2032; can also be used to sense a distal portion of the deployment system <b>107</b>. This clip <b>302</b>&#x2032; may include an adhesive attachment or patch <b>312</b> that couples the OSS system <b>104</b> to the outside of the deployment system <b>107</b>. This adhesive patch <b>312</b> can also have a radiopaque marker <b>314</b> integrated into it for registration purposes. The OSS system <b>104</b> travels back from the deployment system <b>107</b> to a launch fixture <b>308</b> outside the body. Alternatively, it could travel back to an attachment point on the handle <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Once the clip-on attachment <b>302</b>, <b>302</b>&#x2032; has been fixed to the deployment system <b>107</b>, it may not be necessary to register the endograft <b>102</b> to the deployment system <b>107</b> if the stent <b>102</b> is incorporated into the deployment system <b>107</b> in the same way each time for a given stent deployment product. However, it is likely that it will be necessary to register each stent to the deployment system <b>107</b> prior to use.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">There is a very torsionally stiff relationship between the stent anchor (e.g., anchor ring) and the handle <b>105</b>, which is what gives the handle <b>105</b> the ability to re-orient the stent <b>102</b> during deployment. The more important registration is in orientation. This relationship will likely vary in each stent <b>102</b>. For this reason, the Information for Use (IFU) for each stent <b>102</b> includes a step at the beginning of the process where the stent <b>102</b> is visualized under x-ray by the operator, rotated based on the x-ray visible markers (<b>202</b>) present, and then mentally mapped to an indicator <b>322</b> on the handle <b>105</b> so as to remember an &#x2018;optimal&#x2019; orientation for deployment. After navigating, the operator then returns the handle <b>105</b> to the optimal orientation (as indicated by a recalled position of the dot <b>322</b>). This same procedure can be used following attachment of the OSS system <b>104</b>. For example, the stent <b>102</b> is rotated until it is fully in plane (based on the marker bands <b>202</b>) and then that position is used to map the OSS system <b>104</b> to the stent <b>102</b> in orientation. This could be done manually or robotically.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The next important registration is in position. This is principally the distance along the deployment system <b>107</b> between the stent <b>102</b> and the OSS clip <b>302</b> onto the handle <b>105</b>. Specifically, the position of the x-ray visible markers (<b>202</b>) within the stent <b>102</b> should be known. This distance can be identified using a multitude of different methods. For example, one embodiment would include a priori knowledge of the mechanical construction of the stent deployment system <b>107</b>. Another embodiment includes determining the distance under x-ray guidance. If the shape sensing base is registered to the x-ray system then the stent deployment system <b>107</b> can be placed straight and with the stent visible under x-ray. The marker bands (<b>204</b>) can be selected in the image and then the distance between the clips (<b>302</b>) on the handle (<b>105</b>) and the marker bands will be known. This can be done prior to deployment as the marker bands are visible at that time. Another embodiment employs an x-ray image of the stent deployment system <b>107</b> that can be used to identify the offset between the deployment system tip and the marker bands (<b>204</b>) on the stent graft <b>102</b>. From the known orientation, position, and state of deployment, a model of the endograft can be generated and displayed to the user.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The present principles can be applied to any use of an optical shape sensing fiber or system for navigation and deployment of a stent, stent-graft, or stent deployment system. The present principles can also be applied to any stent and balloon, i.e., to any over the wire therapy device, to track the position of the device in the vessel, to help position the device and deliver therapy with less x-ray and less contrast media volume. In such embodiments, a stiff guidewire would likely be replaced by a more flexible wire, either or both may be OSS tracked.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should be understood that the present principles cover any of the applications where an endograft is deployed under fluoroscopic or other guidance including, but not limited to procedures, such as, e.g., endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), branch-fenestrated EVAR (BEVAR), percutaneous EVAR (PEVAR), thoracic EVAR (TEVAR), fenestrated EVAR (FEVAR), etc.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a method for endograft deployment is described and shown in accordance with illustrative embodiments. In block <b>402</b>, a guide wire having an optical shape sensing (OSS) system within a lumen of the guide wire is deployed. The guide wire is configured to deliver an endograft into a vessel. The guide wire may be disposed within a deployment system or tool. The deployment system or tool may have relative motion (e.g., free rotation, measured rotation, etc.) with respect to the guidewire or the relative motion may be constrained. The deployment system and the guidewire may be clamped together or coupled together when engaging at a particular point, etc.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In block <b>408</b>, the OSS system may be attached to the at least one handle or deployment system using a clip-on attachment device or other means.

The OSS system may also be coupled to the at least one handle. In block <b>414</b>, the endograft is registered with the guide wire using one or more radiopaque markers along a length of the guidewire and/or on the endograft.
