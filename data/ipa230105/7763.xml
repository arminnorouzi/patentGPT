DE 19 616 187 A1 discloses a method for operating a transformer for generating a plasma, wherein short voltage pulses are applied to an input voltage.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method of operating a piezoelectric plasma generator.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method of operating a piezoelectric plasma generator. Such a piezoelectric plasma generator comprises a piezoelectric transformer comprising an input side and an output side. An input signal, i.e. an input voltage, is applied to the input side. Due to the piezoelectric effect, a high output voltage may be generated at an end of the output side.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The input signal may be based on a base signal having a first frequency. A signal shape of a base signal may be a sinusoidal shape, for example. The base signal may have a constant first frequency. The first frequency may correspond to a resonance frequency of the piezoelectric transformer. The resonance frequency may be about 50 kHz, for example. &#x201c;Corresponding&#x201d; means that the first frequency is near or identical to the resonance frequency. When running the plasma generator at its resonance frequency, the efficiency of plasma generation is optimized.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The base signal may be modulated by a modulation signal having a second frequency being smaller than the first frequency.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The input signal is such that an absolute value of a peak amplitude of the input signal is periodically reduced and increased to a level smaller and larger than an ignition voltage of the plasma generator. The level smaller than the ignition voltage is such that plasma generation collapses. Accordingly, the lower level is not sufficient to maintain plasma generation. Accordingly, the base signal may be delimited by an envelope curve. The time length in which the absolute value of the peak amplitude is larger than the ignition voltage during one period of oscillation of the peak amplitude is the &#x201c;on-time&#x201d; and the time length in which the absolute value of the peak amplitude is smaller than the ignition voltage during one period of oscillation of the peak amplitude is the &#x201c;off-time&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The field strength on the output end of the piezoelectric transformer that is required for generating plasma is the ignition field strength. The input voltage required for generating the ignition field strength is the ignition voltage.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">By periodically reducing the absolute value of the peak input voltage below the ignition voltage has the effect that an average energy input into the substrate can be reduced. In addition to that, the occurrence of so-called streamers may be prevented or reduced. When these streamers hit the surface of a sensitive substrate, e.g., thin fabric or skin, local burn marks may occur. Accordingly, sensitive substrates may be damaged, which is an undesirable effect. Furthermore, the thermal power can lead to an undue increase of temperature in the substrate, which can damage the substrate.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Controlling the occurrence of streamers and the average energy input is particularly important when plasma treating electronic components, which are very sensitive to electrostatic discharge. A plasma treatment may include cleaning and/or activating surfaces, for example. Furthermore, when the average energy input is reduced, an activation of delicate and sensitive structures such as thin insulating polymer foil or conductive metal paths is possible.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A further example for operation are substrates which are difficult to be activated, e.g. metallic/conductive surfaces such as sooty plastic materials. When a high current is present, the surface cannot be activated on a large scale and without temperature increase. This may be due to the plasma cloud being reduced in its volume due to the lower potential of the substrate. When periodically providing an input signal which is below an ignition voltage, the current flow is disrupted and a large-scaled activation without temperature increase is possible.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A further example is operation in environments in which the heat dissipation is low, e.g. in vacuum. In this case, the self-heating of the plasma generator cannot be dissipated and the reliability of the plasma generator is reduced. When reducing the absolute value of the peak voltage periodically below an ignition voltage, the inner temperature can be reduced while the plasma generation during the on-cycles can be maintained at the same level.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A further example for operation is operation with media which require high voltages for ionization, such as N2, SF6. For such media, the reliability of the plasma generators is generally reduced due to the self-heating at high power input. The self-heating can be reduced by turning the base voltage periodically off and on and choosing a suitable duty-cycle. Thereby, the reliability can be increased.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The modulating signal may be a modulating function scaling the base signal. The modulating signal may have values between 1 and 0, for example.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The modulating signal may be pulse-shaped. In particular, the modulating signal may switch periodically between a high level and a low level.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The high level may be 1. In this case, the modulated signal may correspond to the base signal during the high-level time. The low level may be zero. In this case, the input voltage is switched to zero during the low-level time.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a further embodiment, the low level may be above zero. As an example, the high level may be 1.0 and the low level may be 0.5. In this case, an oscillation of the component can be maintained and the mechanical stress on the component can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further embodiment, the modulating signal may be a continuously oscillating signal such as a sinusoidal signal, for example. In this case, also the input signal continuously oscillates which reduces the mechanical stress on the component. In particular, the modulating signal may have the shape of an absolute value of a sinusoidal signal. According to an embodiment, a duty cycle of the input signal may be adjusted during operation of the plasma generator. The duty cycle is the proportion of &#x201c;on-time&#x201d; in which the absolute value of the peak amplitude is larger than the ignition voltage during one period of oscillation of the absolute value of the peak amplitude and one period of oscillation of the absolute value of the peak amplitude. One period of oscillation of the absolute value of the peak amplitude may correspond to one period of oscillation of the modulating signal.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In all embodiments, the absolute value of the peak amplitude during off-time, in which the absolute value of the peak amplitude is smaller than the ignition voltage, may be at least for most of the off-time above zero. Thereby, oscillation of the piezoelectric transformer can be maintained during off-time. In particular, the peak amplitude during off-time may be such that oscillation is maintained during the entire off-time between on-times. This has the advantage that the transition between plasma generation and collapse of plasma generation is smoother and less mechanical stress is imposed on the transformer.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The average energy emitted from the plasma generator depends on the duty cycle and frequency of the modulating signal. When the duty cycle is high, the average emitted energy is high. When the duty cycle is low, the average emitted energy is low.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Adjusting the duty cycle can be done almost stepless and a fine-tuning of the energy input is enabled. This is particularly important for sensitive substrates or for cosmetic and medical applications. The duty cycle may be adjusted while the frequency of the modulating signal is kept at a fixed value.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an embodiment, the duration of an off-time in which the peak amplitude is below the ignition voltage is at most 10 ms or at most 5 ms. By periodically reducing the absolute value of the peak amplitude, the ignition channel, i.e., a path of ionized gas extending from the output side of the transformer, is forced to break down again and again.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">After reducing the absolute value of the peak amplitude, the high output voltage attenuates. When the output voltage falls below the ignition voltage, the current flow in the ignition channel collapses. However, the higher concentration of charge carriers in this area is maintained for a short period of time. When the base signal is turned on again during this time span, the new ignition of plasma is significantly easier and ignition happens at lower voltage. Due to the lower ignition voltage the mechanical stress on the component is reduced which leads to higher reliability.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to an embodiment, the second frequency, i.e., the frequency of the modulating signal is at most 1/20 of the first frequency, i.e., the frequency of the base signal. This may ensure that the plasma generation stops even at a given inertness of the piezoelectric transformer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">After an off-time in which the absolute value of the peak amplitude is smaller than the ignition voltage, the first frequency, i.e., the frequency of the base signal may be adjusted to the resonance frequency of the plasma generator. For this aim, a parameter corresponding to a shift of the first frequency from the resonance frequency may be obtained and the frequency of the base signal is re-adjusted such that it corresponds to the resonance frequency.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">This enables an optimum operation mode at varying loads, e.g., due to varying substrate characteristics, gas mixtures, materials or work distances.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to a further aspect, a piezoelectric plasma generator comprising a piezoelectric transformer is disclosed. The plasma generator comprises a control circuit for providing an input signal to the piezoelectric transformer. The control circuit may be configured for operating the plasma generator according to the method described in the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The control circuit may comprise a base signal generator for generating a base signal having a first frequency and a modulating signal generator for generating a modulating signal having a second frequency which is lower than the first frequency. The control circuit may further comprise a signal mixer for mixing the base signal with the modulating signal such that an input signal is provided wherein an absolute value of a peak amplitude of the input signal is periodically reduced and increased to a level smaller and larger than an ignition voltage of the plasma generator.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The control circuit may further comprises a measuring device for measuring a parameter related to an energy input provided by the plasma generator to a plasma-treated substrate, wherein the modulation signal is adjusted depending on the measured energy input.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The control circuit may be configured to adjust during operation a duty cycle, which is the proportion of on-time in which the absolute value of the peak amplitude is larger than the ignition voltage in one period of oscillation of the absolute value of the peak amplitude.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The control circuit may further comprise a measuring device for measuring a parameter related to a shift of the first frequency from a resonance frequency of the plasma generator. The measuring device may be the same measuring device used for measuring an energy input in a substrate or may be a further measuring device. Suitable measuring devices are disclosed in the cited patent applications at the beginning. Depending on the measured shift, the control circuit may be configured to re-adjust the first frequency to correspond to the resonance frequency.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present disclosure comprises several aspects of an invention.

When these streamers hit the surface of a sensitive substrate, such as thin fabric or skin, local burn marks may occur. Accordingly, sensitive substrates may be damaged, which is an undesirable effect.
