Parts that are identical or equivalent to each other in the following embodiments are assigned the same reference numerals in the drawings.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A heat exchanger <b>1</b> of the present embodiment is, for example, used as an evaporator that forms a part of a refrigeration cycle performing air conditioning in a vehicle compartment. The evaporator performs heat exchange between refrigerant as a first fluid circulating in the refrigeration cycle and air as a second fluid passing through the heat exchanger <b>1</b>, and cools the air by the latent heat of vaporization of the refrigerant. Arrow DRg in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> indicates an up-down direction DRg of the heat exchanger <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the heat exchanger <b>1</b> includes a plurality of corrugated fins <b>10</b>, a plurality of tubes <b>20</b>, first to fourth header tanks <b>21</b> to <b>24</b>, an outer frame member <b>25</b>, a pipe connection member <b>26</b>, and the like. These members are made of aluminum alloy, for example, and are joined together by brazing. Although a plurality of grooves <b>12</b><i>b </i>to <b>15</b><i>c </i>is formed on the surface of the corrugated fin <b>10</b> as described later, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> omits the grooves <b>12</b><i>b </i>to <b>15</b><i>c </i>for the purpose of clear illustration.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The plurality of tubes <b>20</b> is arranged side by side at predetermined intervals in a tube arrangement direction DRst. The air passing through the heat exchanger <b>1</b> flows among the plurality of tubes <b>20</b>. The air flows among the tubes <b>20</b> from one side in an air passage direction AF as an upstream side to the other side in the air passage direction AF as a downstream side. The air passage direction AF is one cross direction crossing the tube arrangement direction DRst which is one direction. Moreover, the air passing through the heat exchanger <b>1</b> is cooled by the refrigerant to generate condensed water while flowing among the tubes <b>20</b>. That is, the air passing through the heat exchanger <b>1</b> is a gas that generates condensed water by heat exchange with the refrigerant.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The plurality of tubes <b>20</b> is arranged in two rows corresponding to one side and the other side of the air passage direction AF. Each of the plurality of tubes <b>20</b> linearly extends in a tube extending direction DRt from one end to the other end. The tube extending direction DRt need not necessarily coincide with the up-down direction DRg but coincides with the up-down direction DRg in the present embodiment. In short, all the tubes <b>20</b> of the present embodiment extend in the up-down direction DRg, that is, in a vertical direction. The air passage direction AF, the tube arrangement direction DRst, and the tube extending direction DRt are directions intersecting one another, strictly speaking, directions orthogonal to one another.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The plurality of tubes <b>20</b> is inserted into the first header tank <b>21</b> or the second header tank <b>22</b> at upper ends, and inserted into the third header tank <b>23</b> or the fourth header tank <b>24</b> at lower ends. The first to fourth header tanks <b>21</b> to <b>24</b> distribute the refrigerant to the plurality of tubes <b>20</b> and collect the refrigerant flowing in from the plurality of tubes <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The air flows among the plurality of tubes <b>20</b> so that gaps formed among the tubes <b>20</b> are air passages through which the air flows. The corrugated fins <b>10</b> are provided in the air passages. In other words, the corrugated fins <b>10</b> are provided among the tubes <b>20</b>. The corrugated fins <b>10</b> of the present embodiment are thus outer fins provided outside the tubes <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The corrugated fins <b>10</b> promote heat exchange between the refrigerant flowing inside the tubes <b>20</b> and the air flowing among the tubes <b>20</b>. Specifically, the corrugated fins <b>10</b> increase a heat transfer area between the refrigerant flowing inside the tubes <b>20</b> and the air flowing outside the tubes <b>20</b>, thereby increasing a heat exchange efficiency between the refrigerant and the air.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A pair of the outer frame members <b>25</b> is provided on the outside of the portion where the plurality of tubes <b>20</b> and the plurality of corrugated fins <b>10</b> are alternately arranged in the tube arrangement direction DRst. The pipe connection member <b>26</b> is fixed to one of the pair of outer frame members <b>25</b>. The pipe connection member <b>26</b> is provided with a refrigerant inlet <b>27</b> through which the refrigerant is supplied, and a refrigerant outlet <b>28</b> through which the refrigerant is discharged. The refrigerant flowing into the first header tank <b>21</b> through the refrigerant inlet <b>27</b> flows through the first to fourth header tanks <b>21</b> to <b>24</b> and the plurality of tubes <b>20</b> in a predetermined path, and flows out of the refrigerant outlet <b>28</b>. At that time, the latent heat of vaporization of the refrigerant flowing through the first to fourth header tanks <b>21</b> to <b>24</b> and the plurality of tubes <b>20</b> cools the air flowing through the air passages in which the corrugated fins <b>10</b> are provided.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the corrugated fin <b>10</b> is formed by bending a plate-like plate member or the like. Specifically, the corrugated fin <b>10</b> is bent to form a continuous wave shape in the tube extending direction DRt.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The corrugated fin <b>10</b> has a plurality of joints <b>12</b> and a plurality of fin bodies <b>13</b>. Each of the plurality of joints <b>12</b> forms a crest of the wave shape of the corrugated fin <b>10</b> and is joined to a tube wall surface <b>201</b> which is a side surface of the tube <b>20</b> facing the tube arrangement direction DRst. That is, between surfaces of the joint <b>12</b> on both sides in the thickness direction, a surface <b>121</b> on the side opposite to the side joined to the tube <b>20</b> is exposed to the air passage formed between the tubes <b>20</b>. The joint <b>12</b> and the tube <b>20</b> are joined specifically by brazing. The joint <b>12</b> forms the crest of the wave shape of the corrugated fin <b>10</b> and is thus also called a fin top portion.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The fin body <b>13</b> is disposed between the joints <b>12</b> next to each other along the wave shape of the corrugated fin <b>10</b>, and is connected to each of the joints <b>12</b> to link the joints <b>12</b> together.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The fin body <b>13</b> is curved at both ends thereof in the tube arrangement direction DRst. That is, the fin body <b>13</b> includes a pair of curved connections <b>131</b> provided at both ends of the fin body <b>13</b> in the tube arrangement direction DRst, and a middle body portion <b>132</b> provided between the pair of curved connections <b>131</b>. The pair of curved connections <b>131</b> is curved and connected to the joints <b>12</b> on both sides of the fin body <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Solid lines L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, L<b>3</b>, and L<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are virtual lines indicating boundaries among the joint <b>12</b>, the curved connection <b>131</b>, the middle body portion <b>132</b>, and the louver <b>14</b>, and do not indicate a specific shape such as a groove. The similar is true for other perspective views such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrating the corrugated fin <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The fin body <b>13</b> includes a plurality of louvers <b>14</b> that has a shape formed by cutting and raising a part of the fin body <b>13</b>. The plurality of louvers <b>14</b> is arranged side by side in the air passage direction AF. The plurality of louvers <b>14</b> is included in the middle body portion <b>132</b> of the fin body <b>13</b>.

In the present embodiment, the one louver end <b>142</b> and the other louver end <b>143</b> are collectively referred to as louver ends <b>142</b> and <b>143</b>. In a broader concept, the louver <b>14</b> is a cut-raised portion <b>14</b> for promoting heat transfer between the corrugated fin <b>10</b> and the air in contact with the corrugated fin <b>10</b>.

It goes without saying that the components included in the above embodiments are not necessarily required unless specified as being required, regarded as being clearly required in principle, or the like.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">The numerical value such as the number, the numerical value, the quantity, the range, or the like of a component mentioned in the above embodiments is not limited to a specific number unless specified as being required, clearly limited to such a specific number in principle, or the like. The material, the shape, the positional relationship, and the like of a component or the like mentioned in the above embodiments are not limited to those being mentioned unless otherwise specified, limited to specific material, shape, positional relationship, and the like in principle, or the like.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">According to a first aspect illustrated in part or all of the above embodiments, tubes through which a first fluid flows are arranged in one direction. A cut-raised portion of a corrugated fin includes a cut-raised body that guides the second fluid, and a cut-raised end. The cut-raised end is provided on at least one end of the cut-raised portion in the one direction and has a plate shape extending from the cut-raised body. The cut-raised end has recesses and projections that increase hydrophilicity of a surface of the cut-raised end on at least one side of the cut-raised end in a thickness direction of the cut-raised end.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">According to a second aspect, the cut-raised end is provided on each of opposite ends of the cut-raised portion in the one direction. As describe above, the cut-raised end has the recesses and projections on the at least one side of the cut-raised end in the thickness direction. As a result, the water adhering to the cut-raised portion is less likely to be stagnant due to the improvement in the hydrophilicity of the surface at each of both ends of the cut-raised portion. Therefore, as compared with the configuration of the first aspect, it is easier to prevent the water from being stagnant in the cut-raised portion of the corrugated fin.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">According to a third aspect, the fin body includes a pair of curved connections that are curved and connected to the joints at opposite ends of the fin body in the one direction. The pair of curved connections each includes recesses and projections that increase hydrophilicity of a surface of the curved connection on at least one side of the curved connection in a thickness direction of the curved connection. Thus, since the hydrophilicity of the surface of the curved connections becomes high, the drainage from the curved connections to the joint or the tube wall surface can be promoted.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">According to a fourth aspect, the cut-raised end provided on at least one end of the cut-raised portion in the one direction includes one cut-raised end that is provided at an end of the cut-raised portion on one side of the cut-raised portion in the one direction. The recesses and projections of the one cut-raised end includes a plurality of grooves, and the recesses and projections of one of the pair of curved connections closer to the one cut-raised end also includes a plurality of grooves. At least one of the plurality of grooves of the one cut-raised end is connected to at least one of the plurality of grooves of the one of the pair of curved connections. As a result, the water adhering to the one cut-raised end is more easily pulled to one of the curved connections, so that the drainage from the cut-raised portion can be promoted. Thus, the drainage from the cut-raised portion to the joint or the tube wall surface via the one curved connection can be promoted.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">According to a fifth aspect, the fin body includes a pair of curved connections curved and connected to the joints at opposite ends of the fin body in the one direction. The fin body includes a cut-raised gap that is provided adjacent to the cut-raised portion by formation of the cut and raised shape of the cut-raised portion. At least one of the pair of curved connections has a notch extending thereinto from the cut-raised gap. The notch extends outward of a width of the cut-raised portion in the one direction. Thus, a notched portion of the notch can also be used as a drainage path so that drainage of a region near the notched portion can be performed smoothly.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">According to a sixth aspect, the joint includes recesses and projections provided on a surface of the joint facing away from the joined tube for increase in hydrophilicity of the surface of the joint. Thus, the drainage is less likely to be stagnant at the joint, whereby the drainage from the cut-raised portion to the joint can be promoted.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">According to a seventh aspect, the corrugated fin includes a tube side ridge that includes the joint and a portion adjacent to the joint, and the tube side ridge is curved to have a convex surface joined to the tube. The tube side ridge includes a plurality of hydrophilic grooves on the convex surface and a concave surface on the backside of the convex surface for increase in hydrophilicity of the convex and concave surfaces of the tube side ridge. The plurality of hydrophilic grooves on the convex surface has a groove depth smaller than a groove depth of the plurality of hydrophilic grooves on the concave surface.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Thus, the hydrophilic grooves of the tube side ridge generate the capillary force of &#x201c;convex surface&#x3c;concave surface&#x201d;, whereby the water is more easily collected on the surface on the concave surface of the tube side ridge to be the drainage path. As a result, the water is drained smoothly from the heat exchanger. Moreover, the recesses and projections on the surface can be made to be small on the convex surface of the tube side ridge joined to the tube, whereby the corrugated fin can be reliably joined to the tube.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">According to an eighth aspect, the corrugated fin includes a tube side ridge that includes the joint and a portion adjacent to the joint, and the tube side ridge is curved to have a convex surface joined to the tube. The tube side ridge includes a plurality of hydrophilic grooves on the convex surface and a concave surface on a backside of the convex surface for increase in hydrophilicity of the convex and concave surfaces of the tube side ridge. The plurality of hydrophilic grooves on the convex surface has a groove width wider than a groove width of the plurality of hydrophilic grooves on the concave surface.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">Thus, similar to the seventh aspect, the water is more easily collected on the surface on the concave surface of the tube side ridge, whereby the corrugated fin can be reliably joined to the tube.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">According to a ninth aspect, the cut-raised body includes recesses and projections that increase hydrophilicity of a surface of the cut-raised body on at least one side in a thickness direction of the cut-raised body. Thus, the water spreads on the surface of the cut-raised body and flows out more easily from the cut-raised portion, whereby the drainage from the cut-raised portion can be improved.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">According to a tenth aspect, the second fluid flows between the tubes in one cross direction crossing the one direction from one side as an upstream side to another side as a downstream side. The fin body includes a flat surface along the one cross direction. The flat surface includes a plurality of longitudinal grooves that increase hydrophilicity of the flat surface, and the plurality of longitudinal grooves extends in the one direction. The longitudinal grooves thus pull the water adhering on the flat surface in the one direction, whereby the water is easily led to a tube adjacent to the corrugated fin. Therefore, the drainage from the flat surface can be improved.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">According to an eleventh aspect, the flat surface includes a plurality of lateral grooves that increase hydrophilicity of the flat surface, and the plurality of lateral grooves crosses the plurality of longitudinal grooves and extends in the one cross direction. The water adhering on the flat surface thus wets and spreads while being pulled by the longitudinal and lateral grooves, and is drained to the area around the flat surface. Since the plurality of longitudinal grooves and the plurality of lateral grooves intersect one another, a wide variety of drainage paths is formed on the flat surface so that the drainage from the flat surface can be improved.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">According to a twelfth aspect, the flat surface includes a plurality of lateral grooves that increase hydrophilicity of the flat surface, and the plurality of lateral grooves extends in the one cross direction. Thus, the hydrophilicity of the flat surface is improved by the lateral grooves so that the drainage from the flat surface can be improved.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">According to a thirteenth aspect, the second fluid is a gas that generates condensed water by heat exchange with the first fluid.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">According to a fourteenth aspect, the heat exchanger is provided in an environment to be exposed to water.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">According to a fifteenth aspect, the tubes extend in a vertical direction. Therefore, the drainage of the water along the tube wall surface can be improved by gravity.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">According to a sixteenth aspect, a depth of a recess included in the recesses and projections is 10 &#x3bc;m or deeper. As a result, the hydrophilicity is gained sufficiently by the recesses and projections, and the drainage effect of draining the water adhering to the surface with the recesses and projections can be sufficiently exerted.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">According to a seventeenth aspect, a depth of a groove included in the plurality of longitudinal grooves is 10 &#x3bc;m or deeper, and a depth of a groove included in the plurality of lateral grooves is 10 &#x3bc;m or deeper. As a result, the hydrophilicity is gained sufficiently by the longitudinal grooves and the lateral grooves, and the drainage effect of draining the water adhering to the flat surface can be sufficiently exerted.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">According to an eighteenth aspect, the recesses and projections of the cut-raised end are provided on each of opposite sides of the cut-raised end in the thickness direction. Thus, as compared with the case where the recesses and projections is provided only on one side in the thickness directions of the cut-raised end, a greater effect of preventing stagnation of the water in the cut-raised portion of the corrugated fin can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">According to a nineteenth aspect, the cut-raised portion for promoting heat transfer is a louver.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">According to a twentieth aspect, a cut-raised portion of a corrugated fin includes a cut-raised body that guides a second fluid, and a cut-raised end that is provided on at least one end of the cut-raised portion in one direction and has a plate shape extending from the cut-raised body. The cut-raised end has recesses and projections that increase hydrophilicity of a surface of the cut-raised end on at least one side of the cut-raised end in a thickness direction of the cut-raised end.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">A comparative example will be described. A heat exchanger according to the comparative example is a plate-fin and tube heat exchanger, and flat tubes are inserted into notches formed in a flat plate fin.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">On the surface of the plate fin, recesses and projections may be formed to improve hydrophilicity of the surface of the plate fin. As a result, condensed water is drained quickly along the plate fin.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">When the condensed water is generated in the heat exchanger and stagnates therein, the heat exchange performance may be deteriorated. As a result, such deterioration may cause, for example, an increase in noise, an increase in power consumption of a blower feeding air to the heat exchanger, an increase in power of a compressor connected to the heat exchanger in a refrigeration cycle, and the like.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">On the other hand, a heat exchanger including corrugated fins with louvers has a different drainage path from that of the plate-fin and tube heat exchanger. Moreover, the corrugated fins improve the heat exchange performance by guiding the fluid passing between tubes with the louvers of the corrugated fins. Therefore, the technology of the comparative example for improvement of hydrophilicity of the surface of the plate fin cannot be used as it is for the heat exchanger including the corrugated fins. The present inventors have found the above facts as a result of detailed study.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a heat exchanger performs heat exchange between a first fluid and a second fluid. The heat exchanger includes tubes which are arranged in one direction and in which the first fluid flows, and a corrugated fin provided between the tubes, curved to have a wave shape, and configured to promote heat exchange between the first fluid and the second fluid. The second fluid flows between the tubes. The corrugated fin includes joints that are joined to the tubes, and fin bodies that are each between and connect the joints which are located next to each other along the wave shape. The fin body includes a cut-raised portion that has a shape in which a part of the fin body is cut and raised for promotion of heat transfer. The cut-raised portion includes a cut-raised body that guides the second fluid, and a cut-raised end that is provided on at least one end of the cut-raised portion in the one direction and has a plate shape extending from the cut-raised body. The cut-raised end has recesses and projections that increase hydrophilicity of a surface of the cut-raised end on at least one side of the cut-raised end in a thickness direction of the cut-raised end.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">Thus, since the hydrophilicity of the surface of the cut-raised end becomes high, the water adhering to the cut-raised portion is less likely to be stagnant at the cut-raised end and is quickly drained to the joint or the surface of the tube of the corrugated fin. Therefore, the water can be prevented from stagnating in the cut-raised portion of the corrugated fin. As a result, for example, the function of the cut-raised portion for guiding the second fluid is not hindered by the water adhering to the cut-raised portion.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a corrugated fin is for a heat exchanger performing heat exchange between a first fluid and a second fluid. The corrugated fin is disposed between tubes arranged in one direction, is curved to form a wave shape, and promotes the heat exchange between the first fluid flowing through the tubes and the second fluid flowing between the tubes. The corrugated fin includes joints joined to the tubes, and fin bodies that are each between and connect the joints which are located next to each other along the wave shape. The fin body includes a cut-raised portion that has a shape in which a part of the fin body is cut and raised for promotion of heat transfer. The cut-raised portion includes a cut-raised body that guides the second fluid, and a cut-raised end that is provided on at least one end of the cut-raised portion in the one direction and has a plate shape extending from the cut-raised body. The cut-raised end has recesses and projections that increase hydrophilicity of a surface of the cut-raised end on at least one side of the cut-raised end in a thickness direction of the cut-raised end.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">Therefore, the effect similar to that of the heat exchanger according to the one aspect above can be obtained.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
