More particularly, the invention relates to systems that monitor conditions in a tire, such as tire pressure. Specifically, the invention is directed to a system that determines if a tire pressure leak is present by monitoring <b>9</b><i>a </i>pressure difference across two tires mounted on an axle.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Vehicles include two or more axles that are supported by pneumatic tires. Typically, at least one tire is mounted on each end of each axle. Such tires typically have certain conditions or parameters that are beneficial to monitor during vehicle operation. For example, monitoring the pressure of a pneumatic tire may be helpful in assessing the condition and/or performance of the tire, as a low pressure may indicate that there is an issue with the tire.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To monitor tire pressure, Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) have been developed. Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems measure the pressure inside the tire cavity using sensors that are attached to the tire, and obtain pressure data in real time from the sensors.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The measured tire pressure may be correlated to a specific tire and transmitted to an electronic control system of the vehicle. The measured tire pressure data may then be employed to improve the function of vehicle systems, such as an anti-lock brake system (ABS), electronic stability control system (ECS), and the like. The measured tire pressure data may also be sent to an operator of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, for fleets of commercial vehicles or passenger vehicles, it is desirable for a manager of the fleet to be informed of tire pressure to make informed decisions about the tires and the vehicle. For example, in the event that a pressure measurement is below a threshold value, an alert may be sent to the fleet manager. The fleet manager may then instruct the vehicle operator to reduce the vehicle speed or direct the vehicle to a service center.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is desirable to improve the accuracy of TPMS measurements, particularly for slow pressure leaks that occur gradually over time. However, in many cases, tire pressure is the only parameter that can be measured in certain TPMS systems, which makes it difficult for the systems to account for and/or compensate for various driving conditions and temperature conditions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, prior art techniques typically only compare a measured pressure or a temperature compensated pressure to a threshold value and transmit an alert when the measured or compensated pressure drops below the threshold value. Such techniques lack precision, as they may generate an alert that is not needed. Prior art techniques also do not distinguish between a rapid leak condition and a slow leak condition. Detection of a slow leak detection is particularly advantageous for fleet managers, as preventive measures for the tire may be taken according to a fleet maintenance schedule, rather than unnecessarily removing the vehicle from immediate service.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a result, there is a need in the art for a system that determines with precision if an air pressure leak is present when tire pressure is the only parameter that can be measured.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a tire pressuring monitoring system is provided. The system includes a first tire mounted on a first end of an axle and a second tire mounted on a second end of the axle, in which the first and second tires and the axle support a vehicle. A first sensor is mounted on the first tire for measuring a pressure of the first tire, and a second sensor is mounted on the second tire for measuring a pressure of the second tire. The system includes means for transmitting measured pressure data from the first sensor and the second sensor to a processor. A tire pressure model is executed on the processor and includes an aggregator that accumulates the measured pressure data from the first sensor and the second sensor. A noise filter filters sensor noise and generates filtered pressure data from the measured tire pressure data. A detection module receives the filtered pressure data and determines when an air pressure leak occurs in at least one of the first tire and the second tire. A leak notification is generated by the tire pressure model when the air pressure leak occurs.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention will be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic perspective view of a vehicle and tire that employ an exemplary embodiment of the tire pressure monitoring system of the present invention, showing the tire partially in section;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic plan view of the vehicle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic perspective view of the vehicle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with a representation of data transmission to a cloud-based server and to a display device;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow diagram showing aspects of an exemplary embodiment of the tire pressure monitoring system of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a graphical representation of an aspect of the tire pressure monitoring system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a graphical representation of an aspect of the tire pressure monitoring system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a graphical representation of an aspect of the tire pressure monitoring system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a graphical representation of an aspect of the tire pressure monitoring system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flow diagram of aspects of a tire pressure model of tire pressure monitoring system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Similar numerals refer to similar parts throughout the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">&#x201c;ANN&#x201d; or &#x201c;Artificial Neural Network&#x201d; is an adaptive tool for non-linear statistical data modeling that changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through a network during a learning phase.
