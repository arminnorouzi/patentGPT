For inkjet printing applications, the volume of ink that is deposited is a relatively low amount, and the volume is not as important as other factors such as color matching and print quality. The number of droplets is not specified or controlled by the user and thus the user has no ability to specify the dispensing of more ink droplets or fewer ink droplets than required for a specific printing application. A typical inkjet printer is limited to the deposition of about 2 to about 3 &#x3bc;L/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, for other applications that require accurate amounts of liquid to be dispensed onto or into a medium, fluid volume may be an extremely important and/or critical factor. For some application, it may be advantageous to specify that a volume of fluid is deposited into or over a specific area. An example may be the dispensing of a single drop of fluid containing a single cell into a well of a well-plate. Another example may be dispensing a large number of fluid droplets into a small areas such as filling each of 384 wells in a well-plate. Accordingly, the density of fluid deposited into the wells of a well-plate may require the dispensing of more than 250 &#x3bc;L/cm<sup>2 </sup>of fluid. Likewise, depositing fluid onto a glass slide for analyzing a sample on the glass slide requires that a closely controlled amount of fluid is deposited over a specific area of the glass slide.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the medical field, in particular, there is a need for automated sample preparation and analysis. The analysis may be colorimetric analysis or require the staining of samples to better observe the samples under a microscope. Such analysis may include drug sample analysis, blood sample analysis and the like. In the analysis of blood, for example, blood is analyzed to provide a number of different factors that are used to determine the health of an individual. When there are a large number of patients that require blood sample analysis, the procedures may be extremely time consuming. Also, there is a need for accurate preparation of the samples so that the results can be relied on. There are many other situations that require sample analysis in the medical field and in other fields that can benefit from the use of analytical instruments that provide accurate and reproduceable results, such as micro-titration of multiple samples.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Well plates, slides and other substrates are used for many experiments and laboratory procedures. The process of filling the wells or spotting is often performed manually or using expensive lab equipment. In some cases, the wells are filled with hand operated pipettes. In other cased, high-end automated devices based on pipette technology are used to fill the well plates. Such automated devices accommodate an open well dispense head only. The open well dispense head is a dispense head where a small amount of fluid must be deposited into an opening in the dispense head before use. The fluid is typically deposited manually using a pipette or similar means. The dispense head is held stationary while moving the microplate in both X and Y directions. These high end devices are extremely expensive.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the areas of micro-circuit manufacture, fluids are required to be dispensed in precise locations to provide circuit devices on a substrate. The volume of fluid dispensed per unit area is typically much greater than can be provided by conventional ink jet printing technology. In some cases, different fluids are combined together on the substrate to provide a chemical or physical change to the fluids so that the resulting material performs a desired circuit function.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other areas of micro-manufacturing may also require the precise deposit of fluids into or onto a substrate. There is thus the need for a method and device that can be used to program, dispense and visualize the deposition of a predetermine volume of one or more fluids per unit area of a substrate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, an embodiment of the disclosure provides a system and method for ejecting one or more fluids from a digital dispense device. The method includes a) inputting to a memory a volume per unit area for each of the one or more fluids to be ejected from the digital dispense device; b) matching the volume per unit area to a device resolution for the digital dispense device; c) formatting fluid ejectors for the digital dispense device for the device resolution; and d) ejecting fluid from the digital dispense device to provide the volume per area for each of the one or more fluid.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another embodiment of the disclosure provides a fluid dispense system. The fluid dispense system includes A) a digital dispense device for ejecting one or more first fluids from a digital dispense device; B) an input for inputting to a memory of a computer a volume per unit area for each of the one or more first fluids; C) a translation device for matching the volume per unit area to a device resolution for the digital dispense device; D) a processor for formatting fluid ejectors for the digital dispense device according to the device resolution of the digital dispense device; and E) a first fluid cartridge containing fluid ejectors for ejecting one or more first fluids from the digital dispense device to provide the volume per area for each of the one or more first fluids.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the volume per unit area is greater than the device resolution for the digital dispense device. In another embodiment, the volume per unit area is less than the device resolution for the digital dispense device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, a separator is input after step (d) and steps (a)-(d) are repeated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the separator is a wait period of time between fluid depositions.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In other embodiments, the separator is a fluid cartridge change between fluid depositions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the separator is a physical property feedback loop to a user between fluid depositions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In other embodiments, the separator is a chemical property feedback loop to a user between fluid depositions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, step (e) is repeated for one or more fluids up to an including forty different fluids.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the fluid dispense device includes a second fluid cartridge containing fluid ejectors for ejecting one or more second fluids from the digital dispense device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the fluid dispense device includes a display for illustrating a location and volume per unit area for each of the one of more fluids ejected by the fluid cartridge.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The system and method described herein may be used to visualize the deposition of one or more fluids into or onto a substrate so that a precise amount of the one or more fluids is dispense in a predetermined area of the substrate. Thus, the system and method may be used for performing analysis of samples and for micro-manufacturing of electrical and other devices.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The system and method provides a means to accurately dispense a specified volume of fluid over a specified area, including a method of representing volume data in an image-like format that is scalable to any number of data channels representing potentially different fluids. In addition, the method is scalable to any number of layers of data, with each layer separated by a separator. The data may be processed in a way to allow a printer or potentially other liquid dispensing devices to accurately dispense fluids onto or into a medium.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flow diagram for processing data to be used by a digital dispense device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a digital dispense device and user interface therefor.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, is a cut-away, perspective view of the digital dispense device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref> are graphical representations of fluid droplets disposed in a pixel location.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view of a micro well plate on a tray for accepting fluids from the digital dispense device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart for creating FVF data for the digital dispense device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a simplified flow diagram for dispensing layers of fluid onto a substrate using the digital dispense device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a graphical representation of fluid layers deposited on a substrate by the digital dispense device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> for fluids <b>1</b> to N.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a process flow diagram for dispensing fluids onto a substrate according to a software program for processing data for the digital dispense device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>14</b></figref> are graphical representations of how total volumes are divided for fluid deposition according to various digital dispense device resolutions.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>17</b></figref> are graphical representations on a digital display for fluids deposited on or in particular areas of a substrate.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In contrast to convention inkjet printing devices, the disclosed embodiments provide a unique data format appropriate for defining the volume/area required for controlling the dispensing of predetermined amounts of fluid. The data format described here is referred to as &#x201c;FVF format&#x201d; and includes &#x201c;FVF data.&#x201d; The data for the FVF format is processed in a way specific to a fluid dispensing device to accurately dispense a specified volume of fluid into the specified area. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an overall process flow <b>10</b> for the FVF format. In order to encode the FVF data <b>12</b> for use by a digital dispense device <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref>), a data format that is similar to existing image formats such as a raster may be used. A cut-away view of the digital dispense device <b>14</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and includes a removable cartridge <b>15</b>, and a translation device <b>17</b> for moving the cartridge in an x direction across a tray <b>30</b>. The cartridge <b>15</b> may include a single fluid or multiple fluids and an ejection head for depositing fluids on a substrate. The cartridge <b>15</b> may be removed and a new or different cartridge installed in the digital dispense device <b>14</b> for deposition of one or more different fluids onto a substrate.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Traditional image formats specify the color desired at a specific x,y location on a substrate. Accordingly, the tray <b>30</b> may move the substrate in a y direction while the cartridge traverses the substrate in an x direction. The traditional image formats are also often interleaved, which limits the number of channels that can be described. By contrast the FVF format describes each channel as a separate plane and supports any number of planes. Accordingly, any number of fluid channels may be described in one data set so it is easiest to describe each channel's data separately rather than interleaving the channel data.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As a simple illustration, the FVF data may define an array <b>22</b> of pixels <b>24</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, where the numbers in the array <b>22</b> of pixels <b>24</b> indicates the number of drops that are dispensed to a specific pixel location <b>26</b>. A value of 0 signifies 0 drops, 1 signifies 1 drop, 2 signifies 2 drops, and so on. The FVF format also enables defining many channels or fluids independently without a limitation on the number of planes defined, as well as allowing for a means to specify layers of dispensed fluid combinations.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in the array <b>22</b>, a pixel location <b>26</b> is specified that contains 18 pixels <b>24</b>. Assuming that a desired total volume of the pixel location <b>26</b> is 10,000 pL and the device <b>14</b> ejects a drop size of 10 pL, the number of drops per pixel <b>24</b> can be calculated as follows: 10,000 pL/(10 pL/drop)/18 pixels=55.56 drops/pixel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The foregoing example results in a total error of 0.56 drops per pixel, or a total of 10.08 drops. The remainder of drops may be spread easily over the target pixel location <b>26</b> of 18 pixels using a variety of techniques. One such result is shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, where 1 drop is added to the amount in 10 pixels <b>24</b>. Accordingly, the FVF data format for pixel location <b>26</b> has an accuracy of within less than 1 drop size of the digital dispense device <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As a second, more specific illustration, consider volumes and resolutions common to micro-well plate dispensing of fluids. A conventional micro-well plate <b>28</b> disposed in a tray <b>30</b> for the digital dispense device is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The fluid volume required for micro-well plate fluid dispensing applications is typically many times the volume required for inkjet printing applications. For example, a 96 well micro-well plate has accurately sized wells <b>32</b> that are usually circular. If it is desired to dispense into the well <b>32</b> of a micro-well plate <b>28</b> using a circular area with a diameter of 4 mm, then the total area of the well <b>32</b> is 12.57 mm<sup>2</sup>. In order to convert the well plate area to pixels, a resolution for the pixel data must be determined. A typical inkjet resolution is 300 dpi (dots per inch). Using 300 dpi as the device resolution, we get 1 mm=11.81 300ths. Based on the 300 dpi resolution, the area calculation for a 4 mm diameter well <b>32</b> is as follows:</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Radius=2 mm=11.81*2=23.62 300ths.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0041" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Area=3.1415*(23.62)<sup>2</sup>=1752.65 pixels at 300 dpi<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0042" num="0000">There is no such thing as a fractional pixel, so the result is rounded down 1752 pixels.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0039">Next the pixel values of those 1752 pixels is determined. For this example the following assumption is made:</p><p id="p-0044" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Desired Volume=1 uL=1,000,000 pL<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0045" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Drop volume=10 pL<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0046" num="0040">In general, &#x201c;Desired Volume&#x201d; is a parameter of the application, and &#x201c;Drop Volume&#x201d; is a property of a fluid ejection cartridge used to dispense the fluid.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0041">In order to place 1 uL in a 4 mm diameter well <b>32</b> using 10 pL drops, the following calculation is made: 1,000,000/10=100,000 drops.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0042">Assuming a uniform coverage over the selected area is desired, the 100,000 drops is spread over the pixel area as follows: 100,000/1752 pixels=57.08 drops per pixel, rounded down to 57 drops per pixel. So each pixel in the 1752 pixel area would have a value of 57 drops per pixel. The foregoing assumes that an error &#x2212;0.08 drops per pixel is acceptable, however, there are ways to offset the error.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0043">In order to place circular areas in the correct locations on the well plate <b>28</b>, pixel values of 0 are used to signify empty space <b>34</b> between wells <b>32</b>. Using this method, a raster format is constructed that can specify droplet volumes and locations.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0044">If it is desired to reduce the error associated with 57.08 drops per pixel being rounded down to 57 drops per pixel, a slightly more complex algorithm to generate the FVF data can be used. In order to appreciate the use of the more complex algorithm, the error is first calculated for truncating 57.08 drops per pixel to 57 drops per pixel as follows:</p><p id="p-0051" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>57.08 drops per pixel*1752 pixels=100004.16 drops<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0052" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>57 drops per pixel*1752 pixels=99864 drops<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0053" num="0000">The difference is 140 drops, which is not a large number. However, in some applications 140 drops can important, and in other examples the error could be 0.49 rather than 0.08, which would result in a much larger error.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0045">Instead of setting every one of the 1752 pixels to 57 drops per pixel, a method that accumulates the rounding error may be used to give a more accurate dispense volume. According to the method, the drops per pixel are truncated rather than rounded, so that 57.08 drops per pixel becomes 57 drops per pixel, and 57.99 drops per pixel also becomes 57 drops per pixel. Each pixel is calculated as follows:</p><p id="p-0055" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Real Pixel Value =Real Pixel Value+Accumulated Error<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0056" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>PixelValue=truncate (Real Pixel Value)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0057" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Accumulated Error=(Real Pixel Value&#x2212;PixelValue)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0058" num="0046">In this way, the error is accumulated and eventually enough will be accumulated so that the truncated value will become 58 instead of 57, according to the above example. The foregoing method may be able to reduce the error to within one drop volume.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0047">FVF data in the examples above has been described as one byte per pixel, but the FVF data does not have to be limited to one byte per pixel. The FVF format itself allows that any number of bytes may be used to describe a pixel, although in practice a maximum value of four bytes per pixel would likely be the largest value that is used.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0048">Each set of FVF data may consist of a header and associated data, with the header describing various aspects of the data, including, but not limited to:</p><p id="p-0061" num="0049">1.

The Original Base Volume is used to translate between differing drop volumes. The &#x201c;Maximum Value&#x201d; is defined as the maximum pixel value found in the pixel data. The &#x201c;Volume Multiplier&#x201d; is defined as the value that is applied to each pixel as a multiplier, which can be used to represent higher volumes in lower byte per pixel data, potentially at the expense of some dispense volume accuracy. The &#x201c;MaxFrequency&#x201d; is defined as the value that specifies the maximum frequency that the data can be dispensed at which may affect the top speed of the digital dispense device <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0059">In addition to the above aspects of the FVF data in the header, there may be application specific values included in the header data that only certain applications will use and other applications will ignore. For example, many inkjet printers use a level of dithering, sometimes called shingling, to effectively spread the data in order to prevent certain fluid ejection defects that may occur. A header value for SHINGLELEVEL may communicate to digital dispense device <b>14</b> information on how to dispense the data while a different device may ignore such header value for SHINGLELEVEL.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart <b>40</b> for creating FVF data. In the first step <b>42</b> of the process, areas of a &#x201c;Job&#x201d; that have volumes are identified and the volume per area for each channel are determined. The shapes for the volumes may include standard shapes such as squares, circles, triangles, ovals, and the like, or more complex shapes. A user can draw the shapes with a graphics program and thus can specify any desired shape and the volume per pixel that is dispensed in the specified area. Thus, an area may have different shapes and different volumes per pixel.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0061">In the next step <b>44</b> of the process, the area is calculated in order to determine the pixel count for the specified area. The method that is used for determining the pixel count is dependent on the shape of the area. For very complex shapes, the calculation method may be an estimation of the pixel count rather than an actual pixel count. Finally, in step <b>46</b>, the value for each pixel in the FVF data is determined. The foregoing process is repeated for each fluid or channel required by the particular fluid dispense application.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0062">The foregoing FVF data description may be considered as the dispensing of fluid in a single layer if the concept is extended to a three dimensional fluid dispense application, even if the third dimension is time instead of a Z-axis. The concept of a fluid layer may be useful for many different applications. Each fluid layer may be separated by a layer separator from an adjacent layer for a variety of reasons, and the parameters of each fluid layer may be different for different applications.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0063">In some applications, the layer separator may be a period of time that is needed to dry the dispensed fluid, time to mix dispensed fluids properly, or time to complete a chemical reaction. In other applications, the layer separator may be a prompt for change to a second fluid cartridge when a second fluid is required to be dispensed after a first fluid from a first cartridge. In some applications, each cartridge may dispense <b>2</b> or more fluids, such as four fluids.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0064">In other applications, the layer separator may be an external signal supplied by an external device that measures some property of the layer such as temperature, hardness, pH, density, or other physical property change that may occur before the next fluid layer is dispensed. The layer separator may be an external device that manipulates the substrate or layer in some way, either by moving it or by supplying another step of the fluid dispense job such as putting a lattice in place, providing heat or light to dry or cure the fluid, or other operations that do not include dispensing additional fluids. In still other applications, the layer separator may be a wait period of time between fluid layer dispensing. There is no particular limit to the number of layers and layer separators that may be used according to the disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a simplified flow diagram <b>50</b> of dispensing layers of fluids with layer separators between fluid dispense steps. The fluid layers that are dispense in a particular area are illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> for fluids <b>1</b> to N dispensed by a digital dispense device <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0065">As set forth above, the method according to the disclosure formats FVF data for a digital dispense <b>14</b> where the input is a volume of fluid to be deliver over a defined area. The input data that is created by the foregoing calculations is effectively an image representing both X and Y axes, but also introduces a Z axis that represents volume as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In addition, when dispensing more than 1 channel or fluid at once, a 4th dimension is introduced to track the different channels or fluids.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0066">The foregoing method provides benefits over traditional digital dispense systems which may print the entire volume of fluid into a micro-plate well in a single operation. The foregoing method may be used to spread the volume of fluid to be dispensed over multiple dispense head passes and multiple fluid ejectors along a dispense head array of an ejection head. This will minimize the impact of missing or poorly performing fluid ejectors. Depending on the desired dispense accuracy and probability of ejectors not functioning correctly, a minimum number of fluid ejectors to use can be specified or calculated.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a process flow diagram <b>60</b> implemented by a software program that resides in the memory of a computer or in a memory of the digital dispense device <b>14</b> for sequencing the dispensing of multiple fluids by the digital dispense device <b>14</b> in order to complete a specific fluid dispensing task. According to the process flow diagram <b>60</b>, a fluid dispense task is identified in the software in step <b>62</b>. Once identified, one or more fluids may be dispensed simultaneously or sequentially onto a substrate in step <b>64</b>. If a reaction is required to take place, a layer separator <b>66</b> provides a built in wait time, a hardware input <b>68</b>, such as a color change, temperature change, density change, or other fluid property input, and/or a user input from a user interface <b>70</b> that can vary widely depending on the fluids being used and the particular fluid dispense task being performed. The user inputs may be selected from a fluid cartridge change, a fluid selection change, a fluid volume change, visual inspection, or other user input as required by the fluid dispense task. In step <b>72</b>, a decision is then made by the software program to continue to dispense fluids to complete the fluid dispense task, or to finalize the fluid dispense task in step <b>74</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0068">Accordingly, the dispense system procedure described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> may be used to create automated jobs, and/or the analysis steps that require human input can be scripted and displayed by the system to reduce errors in the fluid dispense task procedures.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0069">The FVF data may be generic and for the most part not specific for a digital dispense device <b>14</b>. However, at an application level, the unique characteristics of the digital dispense device <b>14</b> may come into play. It is likely that a specific device or application will have a very narrow range of fluid dispense jobs that it can perform. For example, the digital dispense device may only print on or dispense fluids into micro-well plates or onto slides. Also, the digital dispense device may perform the fluid deposition tasks in a very specific way, such as by use of a pipette machine dispensing fluid into wells one at a time. Accordingly, the processing of the FVF data may vary from device to device.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0070">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first step <b>16</b> processes the FVF data to match the output resolution of the digital device <b>14</b>. Matching the FVF data may include an upsample or downsample in resolution, as well as a scale factor using an original base volume. For example, if the FVF data is 600&#xd7;600 dpi, but the digital dispense device output is 1200&#xd7;1200 dpi, then a resolution change of the FVF data is necessary. A resolution of 1200&#xd7;1200 dpi means that there are twice as many pixels horizontally as the input FVF data, and twice as many pixels in the Y or vertical plane as the input FVF data. One 600&#xd7;600 dpi pixel can contain four 1200&#xd7;1200 dpi pixels in the same area. If the total volume of fluid in a layer is to be held constant, the volume of fluid will have to be divided to spread the 600&#xd7;600 dpi pixel over the four 1200&#xd7;1200 dpi pixels.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>14</b></figref> illustrate how the total volume may be divided for different device output resolutions. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, if the FVF data requires the deposition of 20 drops of fluid in the 600&#xd7;600 dpi pixels (pixel area <b>80</b>) and the device output resolution in pixel area <b>82</b> is 600&#xd7;1200, then the 20 drops are divided into so that 10 drops are dispensed in each of the 600&#xd7;1200 dpi pixels in pixel area <b>82</b> and 5 drops are dispensed in each of the 1200&#xd7;1200 dip pixels in pixel area <b>84</b> in order to obtain an equal volume of fluid in the specified pixel area.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates an example wherein there is an odd number of fluid droplets to dispense. For example, if the FVF data requires 25 drops with a resolution of 600&#xd7;600 dpi in pixel area <b>90</b>, then the 600&#xd7;1200 dpi pixels of pixel area <b>92</b> require 12 drops in one portion of the pixel area <b>92</b> and 13 drops in another portion of the pixel area <b>92</b> to provide the 25 drops. Likewise, the 1200&#xd7;1200 dpi pixels of pixel area <b>94</b> require 6 drops in three portions of the pixel area <b>94</b> and 7 drops in one portion of the pixel area <b>94</b> in order to obtain the 25 drops.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0073">In another example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the FVF data requires 2 drops in the pixel area <b>100</b> with a resolution of 600&#xd7;600 dpi, then the 600&#xd7;1200 dpi pixels requires 1 drop in each portion of the pixel area <b>102</b>. However, the pixel area <b>104</b> of the 1200&#xd7;1200 dpi pixels has 1 drop in two portions of the pixel area <b>104</b> and 0 drops in two other portions of the pixel area <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates a situation wherein the FVF data is at a higher resolution than the digital dispense device. In that case, the FVF data will have to be downsampled. Accordingly, if the device resolution has a 300&#xd7;300 dpi output, the 600&#xd7;600 dpi pixels in pixel area <b>110</b> will have to be combined into one 300&#xd7;300 dpi pixel area <b>112</b> which results in a sum of the four pixels in pixel area <b>100</b> as shown.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0075">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the next step <b>18</b> of the process is to translate the volume data. Based on the original base volume from the header information, it may be necessary to translate the pixel values into droplet size for the fluid cartridges if the device droplet size does not match the original base volume. Such a situation may occur if the FVF data was generated for a different device or cartridge, or it could be the same device, and the fluid properties in the cartridge do not match the original data. Some fluids may have different drop volumes within the same cartridge. Step <b>18</b> may be done before step <b>16</b> or concurrently with step <b>16</b> in the process.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0076">The final step <b>20</b> is to take the modified FVF data and format the FVF data into a data stream that the digital dispense device <b>14</b> recognizes.
