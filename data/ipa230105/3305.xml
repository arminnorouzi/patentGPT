id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a diaphragm valve, a flow control device, a fluid control device, and a semiconductor manufacturing device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">For flow control of process gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes or the like, mass flow controllers are widely used. Such a mass flow controller, for example, in the case of a pressure type mass flow controller, is configured to measure a mass flow rate by using pressures in front and back of an orifice provided in a flow path, and adjust the mass flow rate by a control valve so that the mass flow rate becomes a target value. As such control valves, diaphragm valves are widely used.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The diaphragm valve has a construction in which a drive unit presses a diaphragm made of a thin metal plate or the like to elastically deform the diaphragm to open and close the flow path and adjust the opening degree. The drive unit includes, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> of Patent Literature 1), a stem <b>8</b> for pressing the diaphragm (reference numeral <b>17</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and a piezoelectric actuator <b>2</b> for driving it. When a voltage is applied, the piezoelectric actuator <b>2</b> is configured to extend, and the stem <b>8</b> is driven in a direction to open the valve by the piezoelectric actuator <b>2</b> via a displacement transmission mechanism (<b>4</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>). On the other hand, when the voltage of the piezoelectric actuator <b>2</b> is not applied, the stem <b>8</b> is biased by a disc spring <b>9</b><i>a </i>in a direction to close the diaphragm valve, thereby, to realize a normally closed operation. The stem <b>8</b> is guided by a through hole <b>10</b><i>b </i>of a bonnet <b>10</b> via an O-ring <b>14</b> (Patent Literature 1).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This O-ring <b>14</b> is formed of rubber such as nitrile rubber, fluororubber, silicon rubber, or chloroprene rubber, and has flexibility. Since the operating stroke of the stem <b>8</b> driven by the piezoelectric actuator <b>2</b> is as small as several 10 &#x3bc;m, it is considered that the axial displacement of the stem <b>8</b> is allowed by elastic deformation of the O-ring <b>14</b> rather than sliding.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PTL 1: International Publication No. WO2017/033423A1</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the above mechanism, since the contact area of the O-ring as a guide is small, the holding force is insufficient, and there is a case where axis shake of the stem occurs. As a result, if the abutting portion of the stem in the diaphragm becomes eccentric, the stress becomes high, and it may cause shortening the life of the diaphragm. Especially, when the diaphragm is miniaturized along with miniaturization of flow control devices, even a slight axis shake causes a relatively large eccentricity for the diaphragm, and more severe suppression of the axis shake is required.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it is also conceivable to replace the O-ring with a metal sleeve having a high holding force as a guide to reduce the axis shake. However, since the sleeve is arranged within the range of the bonnet <b>10</b>, the axial length is short, and when an external force is applied to the long displacement transmission mechanism (<b>4</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>) coupled to the stem, there is a problem that an excessive reaction force is applied to the sleeve and it is easily damaged (easily stuck), and as a result, there may occur trouble in adjustment of the opening degree of the valve.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to solve the above-mentioned problems and to provide a diaphragm valve in which axis shake of a stem is reduced.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A diaphragm valve of the present invention comprises: a valve body having a flow path formed therein and a valve chamber recessed from an upper surface of the valve body;

Thus, the displacement of the length of the piezoelectric actuator <b>2</b> is transmitted to the first stem member <b>8</b><i>a </i>through a series of displacement transmission mechanism (<b>4</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>) including the displacement transmitting member <b>5</b>, and the first stem member <b>8</b><i>a </i>is adapted to move in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Incidentally, the upper end portion of the first stem member <b>8</b><i>a </i>is loosely fitted into a blind hole on the lower surface of the support plate <b>3</b>, so that the axial movement of the series of displacement transmission mechanism (<b>4</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>) including the first stem member <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the displacement transmitting member <b>5</b> is loosely guided.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>is arranged coaxially with the first stem member <b>8</b><i>a </i>so that the upper end portion of the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>abuts on the lower end portion of the first stem member <b>8</b><i>a. </i>While the lower end portion of the first stem member <b>8</b><i>a </i>forms a substantially flat plane, the upper end portion of the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>is substantially spherical, and both are in point contact (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). With this configuration, even if an external force is applied to the displacement transmitting member <b>5</b> and the first stem member <b>8</b><i>a </i>is swung, the fluctuation of the axial position of the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>can be minimized. A diaphragm presser <b>19</b> is attached to the lower end portion of the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>and abuts against the diaphragm <b>17</b>. The second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>is driven by the first stem member <b>8</b><i>a </i>to press the diaphragm <b>17</b> and elastically deform it.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>is moveably held in the axial direction via the sleeve <b>15</b> by the bonnet <b>10</b>. In the present embodiment, a sleeve <b>15</b> is used as a sliding portion between the stem <b>8</b> and the guide hole <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the bonnet <b>10</b> instead of the conventional O-ring <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). That is, the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>is guided by the inner periphery of the sleeve <b>15</b> whose outer periphery is fitted and fixed to the guide hole <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the bonnet <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, since the sleeve <b>15</b> has a self-lubricating resin layer such as polyacetal, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, fluororesin, Teflon (registered trademark) resin, and phenol resin on the inner peripheral side of the sleeve body <b>15</b><i>a, </i>the coefficient of friction with the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>made of stainless steel to be guided is small. Further, the combination of the outer periphery of the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>and the inner periphery of the sleeve <b>15</b> forms a cylindrical contact surface, which realizes a wide contact area and high guide rigidity.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, the operation of the diaphragm valve <b>1</b> of the present embodiment thus configured will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">First, in the initial condition where the voltage applied to the piezoelectric actuator <b>2</b> is zero, the length L of the piezoelectric actuator <b>2</b> is the initial length L<b>0</b> and the minimum, and the displacement transmission mechanism (<b>4</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>) and the first stem member <b>8</b><i>a </i>which is engaged therewith is pushed down by a coil spring <b>9</b> and is in the lowermost position, and the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>in contact with this is also in the lowermost position. Therefore, the diaphragm <b>17</b> is pressed by the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>and comes into close contact with the valve seat <b>16</b><i>e, </i>so that the valve is in fully closed state.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, when a voltage is applied to the piezoelectric actuator <b>2</b>, the length L of the piezoelectric actuator <b>2</b> is increased, overcoming the biasing force of the coil spring <b>9</b>, the displacement transmission mechanism (<b>4</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>) and the first stem member <b>8</b><i>a </i>are pulled up. As a result, the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>is also pushed up by the shape-restoring force of the diaphragm <b>17</b>, a gap is formed between the diaphragm <b>17</b> and the valve seat <b>16</b><i>e, </i>the valve opens, and the fluid can pass through the diaphragm valve <b>1</b>. By adjusting the applied voltage to the piezoelectric actuator <b>2</b>, the gap between the diaphragm <b>17</b> and the valve seat <b>16</b><i>e </i>can be adjusted, and the flow rate of the fluid can be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Here, since the stem <b>8</b> is divided into a first stem member connected to the displacement transmitting member and a second stem member that presses the diaphragm, even if a moment due to an external force is applied to the first stem member, it is not transmitted to the second stem member.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Therefore, the sleeve <b>15</b> having high guide rigidity can be used as a guide for the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b. </i>Therefore, it is possible to prevent the axis shake during vertical movement to thereby reduce the stress-increase of the diaphragm <b>17</b> due to the axis shake, so that the life of the diaphragm <b>17</b> can be improved. Further, since the resin layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>having low friction coefficient is formed on the inner peripheral side of the sleeve <b>15</b> with which the outer periphery of the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>is in contact, the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>can be moved in the vertical direction smoothly.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the present embodiment, the sleeve <b>15</b> in which the resin layer <b>15</b><i>b </i>is formed on the inner peripheral side of the sleeve body <b>15</b><i>a </i>made of metal is used as the guide of the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b, </i>but the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, a ball bush having a rolling ball may be used, and even in such a configuration, high guide rigidity and low guide resistance can be realized.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, the abutting points between the lower end portion of the first stem member <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the upper end portion of the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>are formed by making the former a flat plane and the latter a spherical surface to realize point contact, but the present invention is not limited thereto, and the former may be a spherical surface, the latter may be a flat plane, or both may be spherical surfaces. Further, although both ends of the upper end portion of the second stem member <b>8</b><i>b </i>are flat and the central portion is a substantially spherical surface, the upper end portion may be a spherical surface as a whole.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, a flow rate control device of the present invention will be described.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of a flow rate control device <b>20</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention, and shows a pressure type flow rate control device <b>20</b> in which the diaphragm valve <b>1</b> described above is incorporated.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a cover for covering the entire flow rate control device <b>20</b> and a feedback control board actually exist, but they are not shown for convenience of explanation.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The flow rate control device <b>20</b> includes a downstream side block <b>25</b>, a pressure detector <b>22</b>, an orifice (not shown), a pressure detector <b>26</b>, and a downstream side flow path (not shown) in addition to the above-described components of the diaphragm valve <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Inside the valve body <b>16</b>, an orifice (not shown; in the present embodiment, a gasket-type orifice) is provided in the flow path <b>16</b><i>b </i>on the downstream side of the diaphragm <b>17</b>.
