Unfortunately, this conventional method is fraught with problems. One problem is that the tape can be inadvertently or intentionally removed by the patient prematurely thereby leaving the catheter unsecured and exposed from the insertion site in the skin where it enters the body. The unsecured catheter is also susceptible to accidental premature removal which requires replacement of a new catheter which requires a surgical procedure performed by a hospital. Additionally, another problem results from the necessarily repeated cleaning and disinfection of the catheter entry site into the body, thereby requiring frequent removal and reapplication of medical tape on the sensitive skin of patients, especially infants and young persons, which causes itching, severe irritation and soreness.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Attempts to eliminate the need for taping have led to the development of covers for enclosing and protecting the external portion of the catheter and which are affixed to the patient's skin with a less irritating medical grade adhesive similar to but less irritating than that employed by regular medical tape. Devices of this sort are undesirable to the catheter patient because the use of any adhesive over time results in the same type of skin irritation and soreness associated with the use of regular medical tape. Furthermore, the adhesive used with these devices typically employs lower adhesion capability causing more frequent premature departure from the skin.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">None of the previous devices have adequately protected both the external segment of the catheter and the entry site into the body from these problems giving rise to increased risks of serious injury among adults and especially infants and young persons having implanted catheters.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, a need exists for an apparatus which not only protects the external end of a catheter and secures it to the body, but which provides a means for protecting the entry site from the sources of injury described above.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other past attempts to resolve this issue include the following references, but none disclose a thoracic catheter protective pouch like the present invention:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Patent/App. No.</entry><entry>Inventor</entry><entry>Issue/Pub.

When the apparatus is worn, the pocket portion has on one side a planar surface facing the body when the apparatus is worn and an exterior portion having two flaps, an inner flap and an outer flap. The inner and outer flaps form a compartment for receipt of the exposed segment of catheter. The compartment has at least one securement fastener disposed about at least one peripheral edge of the outer flap, preferably strips of hook and loop fastening material. The inner panel of the pouch may also have a securement strip or loop which may be hook and loop to hold a catheter tube more securely within the pouch. The band attached to and used to wrap the pouch around a person's body is preferably elastomeric and is size adjustable by a using a bracket and with a band overlap.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention should become even more readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings wherein there is shown and described illustrative embodiments of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0011">In the following detailed description, reference will be made to the attached drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front perspective view of the thoracic catheter protector pouch of the present invention with the catheter protective pocket in an open mode;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a front planar view of the thoracic catheter protector pouch of the present invention being worn by a person;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a rear view of the thoracic catheter protector pouch of the present invention being worn by a person;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the thoracic catheter protector pouch of the present invention along section line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> with the catheter secured within the holding pocket; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the thoracic catheter protector pouch of the present invention along section line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> with the catheter secured within the holding pocket.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0017">For purposes of describing the preferred embodiment, the terminology used in reference to the numbered items in the drawings is as follows:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018"><b>1</b>. thoracic catheter protective pouch, generally</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019"><b>2</b>. torso band</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020"><b>3</b>. inner flap</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021"><b>4</b>. outer flap</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022"><b>5</b>. pocket</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023"><b>6</b>. hook and loop fastening strips (inner flap)</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024"><b>7</b>. hook and loop fastening strip (outer flap)</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025"><b>8</b>. size adjuster</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026"><b>9</b>. person</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027"><b>10</b>. catheter tube</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028"><b>11</b>. catheter end connector</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029"><b>12</b>. inner exterior of pocket</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030"><b>13</b>. band overlap</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031"><b>14</b>. catheter tube securement loop</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032"><b>15</b>. inner panel of pouch</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033"><b>16</b>. hooked attachment bracket</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034"><b>17</b>. attachment strap loop</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">Referring now to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a perspective view of the thoracic catheter protective pouch <b>1</b> of the present invention is illustrated.
