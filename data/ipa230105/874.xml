id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention relates to a new formulation of specific nutritional ingredients (nutraceuticals) and/or pharmaceutical compounds.</p></abstract><description id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a new formulation of specific nutritional ingredients (nutraceuticals) and/or pharmaceutical compounds.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to a formulation (mainly for oral consumption), which comprises riboflavin (as a nutritional ingredient) and (usually) a pharmaceutical compound, which is used to treat (the symptoms of) IBD (such as thiopurine and/or at least a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or at least one prodrug thereof).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When riboflavin (also known as vitamin B2) is used in a formulation, it will show an intensive yellow color, when it is dissolved in water or even when it comes in contact with water. This leads to an unpleasant coloration of the mouth and/or the tongue of a patient who is consuming such a formulation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The goal of the present invention was to provide a formulation (mainly for oral consumption) having a high amount of riboflavin, which has not the above mentioned disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The formulation for the oral consumption (usually a tablet) could be coated to solve the problem of the unwanted coloration. However, in case the specific nutritional ingredients (nutraceuticals) and/or pharmaceutical compounds are to be delivered to the small or large intestine a regular coating of the tablet might not be the ideal solution, e.g. due to large variations of residence time in the stomach or dose dumping effect.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need of formulations, which do not have the disadvantages are described above.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it was found that the coloration issue of the riboflavin (in combination with the IBD drugs) can be solved by using a multiple-unit pellet system (MUPS), wherein the riboflavin particles are coated. In such a formulation riboflavin can be used in a high amount.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a micronutrient with a key role in maintaining health in humans and other mammals. It is the central component of the cofactors FAD and FMN, and is therefore required by all flavoproteins. As such, riboflavin is required for a wide variety of cellular processes. It plays a key role in energy metabolism, and for the metabolism of fats, ketone bodies, carbohydrates, and proteins. Riboflavin is found naturally in asparagus, popcorn, bananas, persimmons, okra, chard, cottage cheese, milk, yogurt, meat, eggs, fish, and green beans. Other sources specify cheese, leafy green vegetables, liver, kidneys, legumes, tomatoes, yeast, mushrooms, and almonds. Recently it has been shown that Riboflavin has a beneficial effect on growth of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, which is a marker species for a healthy gut.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The thiopurine drugs are purine antimetabolites widely used in the treatment of i.e. inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thiopurine covers a range of various active compounds such as:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP), which is also known as mercaptopurine is sold i.e. un-der the brand name Purinethol among others. It is taken by mouth.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Azathioprine (AZA), which is sold under the brand name Imuran among others. It is taken by mouth (or injected into a vein).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thioguanine, which is also known as tioguanine or 6-thioguanine (6-TG) is sold i.e. under the brand name Lanvis among others. It is taken by mouth.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">If needed also mixture of such IBD drugs can be used.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Multiple unit pellet systems (MUPS) are well known in the field of pharmaceutical applications. They are described in many patent applications as well as scientific papers. Also the production of MUPS is described and well known. MUPS as therapeutical dosage forms can either be used as such, e.g. as granulate in a sachet or they can be integrated in other dosage forms like tablets or capsules.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention relates to a multiple unit pellet system (MU), which comprises at least two different particles<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0017">(a) pellets (pellets (a)) comprising 10-90 weight-% (wt-%), based on the total weight of the pellet (a), of riboflavin,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0018">(b) particles (particles (b)) comprising at least one thiopurine and/or at least a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or at least one prodrug thereof,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0019">wherein the pellets (a) are coated.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">The content of riboflavin in the multiple unit pellet system is usually always at least 1 wt %, based on the total weight of the multiple unit pellet system.
