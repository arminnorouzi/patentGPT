id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A compound of formula (I), or a salt thereof that may have an antagonistic action against an NMDA receptor that includes an NR2B subunit and may be useful as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for depression, bipolar disorder, migraine, pain, a symptom peripheral to dementia, or the like.</p></abstract><description id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2019-206311, filed Nov. 14, 2019, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to heterocyclic compounds that may have an antagonistic action on an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor containing an NR2B subunit and may be useful as prophylactic or therapeutic agents for depression, bipolar disorder, migraine, pain, peripheral symptoms of dementia, or the like.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (such as the brain and spinal cord) is glutamic acid, and the signal transduction thereof is carried out by the ion channel-conjugated receptor N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor, the gamma-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyloxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)/kainic acid (KA) receptor, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor. Among these, the NMDA receptor has high permeability to certain cations, including calcium ions, and mediates excitatory neurotransmission by depolarization of the nerve cells. In addition, calcium that has flowed into the cell via the NMDA receptor functions as a secondary messenger and causes plastic changes in the nerve function via actions such as changes in intracellular phosphorylation signals and regulation of gene transcription and translation, and thus the NMDA receptors play an important role in the regulation of central nervous system function.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The NMDA receptor is a receptor composed of a tetramer in which two or three subunits from among NR1, NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D, NR3A, and NR3B subunits are associated, and the presence of the NR1 subunit is believed to be essential to its function as a receptor for carrying out the excitatory neurotransmission. Since the NR1 subunit is included in functional NMDA receptors, it is widely distributed in the central nervous system. On the other hand, the distribution and expression timing of the NR2 subunit are different for each subunit. For example, the NR2A and NR2C subunits are detected for the first time immediately before birth, while the NR2B and NR2D subunits are observed from the early stage of fetal development. Moreover, for example, the NR2A subunit is widely distributed in the brain, while the NR2B subunit is locally expressed in the forebrain, and the NR2C subunit is locally expressed in the cerebellum.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The NMDA receptor containing the NR2B subunit, the target of the present disclosure, is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex (particularly layers 2 and 3), hippocampus, amygdala, ventral nucleus of thalamus, and olfactory bulb in the adult rodent brain. Also, the receptor is confined to the posterior horn of the spinal cord, particularly the second layer. In addition, in the single cell, the NMDA receptor containing the NR2B subunit is most highly expressed in postsynaptic density and expression thereof is also observed in the extrasynaptic region. This suggests that the NMDA receptor containing the NR2B subunit is functional widely in the brain and may be effective in the prophylaxis or treatment of central nervous system diseases.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides heterocyclic compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same, that may have an antagonistic action on an NMDA receptor containing an NR2B subunit and may be useful as prophylactic or therapeutic agents for depression, bipolar disorder, migraine, pain, peripheral symptoms of dementia, or the like.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Disclosed herein are: [1] A compound of formula (I):</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="24.47mm" wi="67.73mm" file="US20230002318A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0010" num="0000">or a salt thereof (which may be abbreviated herein as &#x201c;compound (I)&#x201d;), wherein:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">R<sup>1 </sup>is chosen from halogens and C<sub>1-3 </sub>alkyl groups optionally substituted with at least one fluorine;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">R<sup>2 </sup>is chosen from C<sub>1-3 </sub>alkyl groups optionally substituted with at least one fluorine;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">R<sup>3 </sup>is chosen from hydrogen and hydroxy groups;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0011">ring A is chosen from optionally substituted benzene groups;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0012">ring B is chosen from groups of the following formulas:</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="61.89mm" wi="65.62mm" file="US20230002318A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0012" num="0000">wherein:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0013">X and Y are each independently chosen from carbon and nitrogen;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0014">ring B<sup>1 </sup>is chosen from optionally substituted benzene groups, optionally substituted pyridine groups, and optionally substituted pyrazine groups;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0015">ring B<sup>2 </sup>is chosen from optionally substituted pyrimidine groups;

prevention or treatment of depression (including major depression, intractable depression, treatment-resistant depression, and the like), bipolar disorder, migraine, pain, or peripheral symptoms of dementia.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0328">Both depression and bipolar disorder may be characterized by a depressive state, or a depressive state and a manic state for a long period of time. In recent years, it has been found that the intravenous single administration of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, rapidly and continuously improves depression symptoms associated with major depression and bipolar disorder [Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology (Ther. Adv. Psychopharmacol.) Vol. 4, page 75 to 99, 2014]. In addition, it has been reported that treatment-resistant depression symptoms are significantly improved by continuous intravenous administration of CP-101,606 which are antagonists to the NMDA receptor containing the NR2B subunit [Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology (J. Clin. Psychopharmacol.) Vol. 28, page 631 to 637, 2008]. Therefore, the compound of the present disclosure is promising as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for treatment-resistant depression.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0329">A migraine is a chronic and paroxysmal primary headache. The onset mechanism is unknown, but it is thought to occur along with abnormalities of central nervous system processing, abnormalities of the trigeminal neurovascular system, or the like. In the study of the pathophysiological process of migraines, especially aura thereof, the cortical spreading depression phenomenon (cortical spreading depression) has attracted attention. In an experimental cortical spreading depression test using rodents, it has been reported that CP-101,606 and Ro25-6981, which are antagonists for the NMDA receptor containing the NR2B subunit, suppress the number of occurrences of and the depth of cortical spreading depression [The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.) Vol. 321, page 564 to 572, 2007]. Therefore, a compound of formula (I), a salt thereof, or a prodrug thereof may be useful as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for migraines.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0330">Pain is classified into acute pain, in which the pain is sustained for a relatively short period of time, and into chronic pain in which the pain is sustained for three months or longer or reoccurs, the pain is sustained for more than a month after recovery of acute tissue damage, or an accompanying lesion which is not cured is observed. The NMDA receptor containing the NR2B subunit is highly expressed in the posterior horn of the spinal cord, which plays an important role in the reception of pain. It has been suggested that pain may be controlled by functional control of the NMDA receptor containing the NR2B subunit. In fact, it has been reported that the pain threshold value is increased by gene modification operation which causes the lowering of the function of the NR2B subunit [European Journal of Neuroscience (Eur. J. Neurosci.) Vol. 32, page 798 to 810, 2010]. Additionally, it has reported that the pain threshold value is increased by Ifenprodil, which is an antagonist of the NMDA receptor containing the NR2B subunit [Pain (Pain), Vol. 153, page 1022 to 1029, 2012]. Therefore, a compound of formula (I), a salt thereof, or a prodrug thereof may be useful as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for pain.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0331">Dementia is a chronic, general, and usually irreversible decline in cognitive ability. The quality of life reduction in patients caused by a decrease in cognitive ability is notable, but peripheral symptoms of dementia (such as, e.g., mental symptoms or behavioral abnormalities) are also considered to be a significant factor in lowering patient and/or caregiver quality of life. Although there is no effective therapeutic intervention for the peripheral symptoms of dementia, it has been reported that the peripheral symptoms of dementia are partially ameliorated by the administration of memantine, an antagonist of the NMDA receptor [The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (Ann. Pharmacother.) Vol. 42, page 32 to 38, 2007]. NMDA receptors containing the NR2B subunits are widely distributed throughout brain regions other than the cerebellum, but the peripheral symptoms of dementia are reported to be related to white matter abnormalities in brain regions other than the cerebellum [Journal of the Neurological Sciences (J. Neurol. Sci.) Vol. 337, page 162 to 166, 2014]. Therefore, a compound of formula (I), a salt thereof, or a prodrug thereof may be useful as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for peripheral symptoms of dementia.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0332">The dosage of a compound of formula (I), a salt thereof, or a prodrug thereof may vary depending on the object of administration, route of administration, target disease, symptoms, or the like, but, for example, when oral or parenteral administration is carried out to an adult patient, a usual amount for a single time may be about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of body weight, such as, e.g., 0.1 to 50 mg/kg of body weight, such as, e.g., 0.5 to 20 mg/kg of body weight, and the amount can be administered one to three times a day.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0333">A compound of formula (I), a salt thereof, or a prodrug thereof may be used in combination with other active ingredients (hereinafter, abbreviated as a concomitant drug).</p><p id="p-0311" num="0334">Non-limiting examples of concomitant drugs include the following drugs: an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (such as, e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and zanapezil), a nootropic (such as, e.g., memantine), a &#x3b2;-amyloid protein production, secretion, accumulation, aggregation, and/or deposition suppressor, a &#x3b2;-secretase inhibitor (for example, 6-(4-biphenylyl) methoxy-2-[2-(N,N-dimethylamino) ethyl] tetraline, 6-(4-biphenylyl) methoxy-2-(N,N-dimethylamino) methyltetraline, 6-(4-biphenylyl) methoxy-2-(N,N-dipropylamino) methyltetraline, 2-(N,N-dimethylamino) methyl-6-(4&#x2032;-methoxybiphenyl-4-yl) methoxytetraline, 6-(4-bifeniryl) methoxy-2-[2-(N,N-diethylamino) ethyl] tetraline, 2-[2-(N,N-dimethylamino) ethyl]-6-(4&#x2032;-methylbiphenyl-4-yl) methoxytetraline, 2-[2-(N,N-dimethylamino) ethyl]-6-(4&#x2032;-methoxybiphenyl-4-yl) methoxytetraline, 6-(2&#x2032;,4&#x2032;-dimethoxybiphenyl-4-yl) methoxy-2-[2-(N,N-dimethylamino) ethyl] tetraline, 6-[4-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl) phenyl] methoxy-2-[2-(N,N-dimethylamino) ethyl] tetraline, 6-(3&#x2032;,4&#x2032;-dimethoxybiphenyl-4-yl) methoxy-2-[2-(N,N-dimethylamino) ethyl] tetraline, an optical active substance thereof, a salt thereof, and a hydrate thereof, and OM99-2 (WO 01/00663)), a &#x3b3;-secretase inhibitor, a &#x3b2;-amyloid protein aggregation inhibitor (for example, PTI-00703, ALZHEMED (NC-531), PPI-368 (JP H11-514333 T), PPI-558 (JP 2001-500852 T), SKF-74652 (Biochem.
