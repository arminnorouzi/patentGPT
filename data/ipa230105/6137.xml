electroluminescence device (hereinafter, occasionally referred to as an organic EL device), holes are injected from an anode and electrons are injected from a cathode into an emitting layer. The injected electrons and holes are recombined in the emitting layer to form excitons. Specifically, according to the electron spin statistics theory, singlet excitons and triplet excitons are generated at a ratio of 25%:75%.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0003">A fluorescent organic EL device using light emission from singlet excitons has been applied to a full-color display such as a mobile phone and a television set, but an internal quantum efficiency is said to be at a limit of 25%. Accordingly, studies have been made to improve a performance of the organic EL device. The performance of the organic EL device is evaluable in terms of, for instance, luminance, emission wavelength, full width at half maximum, chromaticity, luminous efficiency, drive voltage, and lifetime.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">For instance, it is expected to further efficiently emit the organic EL device using triplet excitons in addition to singlet excitons. In view of the above, a highly efficient fluorescent organic EL device using thermally activated delayed fluorescence (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as &#x201c;delayed fluorescence&#x201d;) has been proposed and studied.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">A TADF (Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence) mechanism uses such a phenomenon that inverse intersystem crossing from triplet excitons to singlet excitons thermally occurs when a material having a small energy difference (&#x394;ST) between singlet energy level and triplet energy level is used. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence is explained in &#x201c;Yuki Hando-tai no Debaisu Bussei (Device Physics of Organic Semiconductors)&#x201d; (edited by ADACHI, Chihaya, published by Kodansha, issued on Apr. 1, 2012, on pages 261-268).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">As a compound exhibiting TADF properties (hereinafter also referred to as a TADF compound), for example, a compound in which a

For instance, a benzene ring has 6 ring carbon atoms, a naphthalene ring has 10 ring carbon atoms, a pyridine ring has 5 ring carbon atoms, and a furan ring has 4 ring carbon atoms. Further, for instance, 9,9-diphenylfluorenyl group has 13 ring carbon atoms and 9,9&#x2032;-spirobifluorenyl group has 25 ring carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0046">When a benzene ring is substituted by a substituent in a form of, for instance, an alkyl group, the number of carbon atoms of the alkyl group is not counted in the number of the ring carbon atoms of the benzene ring. Accordingly, the benzene ring substituted by an alkyl group has 6 ring carbon atoms. When a naphthalene ring is substituted by a substituent in a form of, for instance, an alkyl group, the number of carbon atoms of the alkyl group is not counted in the number of the ring carbon atoms of the naphthalene ring. Accordingly, the naphthalene ring substituted by an alkyl group has 10 ring carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0047">Herein, the ring atoms refer to the number of atoms forming a ring of a compound (e.g., a monocyclic compound, fused-ring compound, crosslinking compound, carbon ring compound, and heterocyclic compound) in which the atoms are bonded to each other to form the ring (e.g., monocyclic ring, fused ring, and ring assembly). Atom(s) not forming the ring (e.g., hydrogen atom(s) for saturating the valence of the atom which forms the ring) and atom(s) in a substituent by which the ring is substituted are not counted as the ring atoms. Unless otherwise specified, the same applies to the &#x201c;ring atoms&#x201d; described later. For instance, a pyridine ring has 6 ring atoms, a quinazoline ring has 10 ring atoms, and a furan ring has 5 ring atoms. For instance, the number of hydrogen atom(s) bonded to a pyridine ring or the number of atoms forming a substituent are not counted as the pyridine ring atoms. Accordingly, a pyridine ring bonded with a hydrogen atom(s) or a substituent(s) has 6 ring atoms. For instance, the hydrogen atom(s) bonded to carbon atom(s) of a quinazoline ring or the atoms forming a substituent are not counted as the quinazoline ring atoms.

This document describes that, if an energy gap &#x394;E<sub>13 </sub>of a fluorescent material between a singlet state and a triplet state is reducible, a reverse energy transfer from the triplet state to the singlet state, which usually occurs at a low transition probability, would occur at a high efficiency to express thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Further, a mechanism of generating delayed fluorescence is explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>.<b>38</b></figref> in the document. The delayed fluorescent material of the third exemplary embodiment is preferably a compound exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence generated by such a mechanism.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0295">In general, emission of delayed fluorescence can be confirmed by measuring the transient PL (Photo Luminescence).</p><p id="p-0329" num="0296">The behavior of delayed fluorescence can also be analyzed based on the decay curve obtained from the transient PL measurement. The transient PL measurement is a method of irradiating a sample with a pulse laser to excite the sample, and measuring the decay behavior (transient characteristics) of PL emission after the irradiation is stopped. PL emission in TADF materials is classified into a light emission component from a singlet exciton generated by the first PL excitation and a light emission component from a singlet exciton generated via a triplet exciton. The lifetime of the singlet exciton generated by the first PL excitation is on the order of nanoseconds and is very short. Therefore, light emission from the singlet exciton rapidly attenuates after irradiation with the pulse laser.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0297">On the other hand, the delayed fluorescence is gradually attenuated due to light emission from a singlet exciton generated via a triplet exciton having a long lifetime. As described above, there is a large temporal difference between the light emission from the singlet exciton generated by the first PL excitation and the light emission from the singlet exciton generated via the triplet exciton. Therefore, the luminous intensity derived from delayed fluorescence can be determined.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0298"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of an exemplary device for measuring the transient PL.
