More particularly, the present disclosure relates to state-of-charge diagnosis and prognosis for lithium-ion batteries using Lebesgue-sampling equivalent circuit model techniques.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENTLY DISCLOSED SUBJECT MATTER</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally speaking, battery technology is a critical component of industrial systems, electric cars, and aerospace areas. Hundreds of companies around the world are conducting related work involving the lithium (Li)-battery. The anticipated market size is over $150 billion by 2030. The Li-battery has a bright future, and it will change our world due to its high energy density, voltage capacity, and lower self-discharge rate than other rechargeable batteries.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional state-of-charge (SOC) estimation and prediction is mainly based on the electrochemical model or on the equivalent circuit model (ECM) of a Li-battery. Even though the electrochemical model can describe the internal electrochemical reaction mechanism of Li-battery accurately, the high computation cost hinders its embedded applications. On the contrary, the computation cost of the ECM is low, but it cannot simulate the behavior of Li-battery accurately with fixed parameters. Additionally, the traditional way to obtain open circuit voltage (OCV) used for terminal voltage calculation and SOC estimation is to discharge the battery during the period from full charge to full discharge of the battery at a small rate (usually 0.02&#xb0; C.) over a long period of time (e.g., more than <b>50</b> hours).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENTLY DISCLOSED SUBJECT MATTER</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects and advantages of embodiments of the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the following description, or can be learned from the description, or can be learned through practice of the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The presently disclosed subject matter identifies the parameters of the ECM with consideration of the nonlinearity of the terminal voltage, which lays foundation to overcome the low fidelity of the ECM of Li-batteries by updating the parameters according to the measured terminal voltage. Meanwhile, it greatly decreases the time cost of obtaining the OCV by fitting a series of OCV points which are defined as measured terminal voltage points after enough rest time of the battery. Moreover, the integration between Lebesgue sampling (LS) and the ECM for SOC diagnostics and prognostics results in low computation and small uncertain accumulation, which enables the realization of embedded online applications possible. Finally, the presently disclosed subject matter enables accurate SOC diagnostics and prognostics by re-conducting parameter identification and initializing SOC condition during the whole life service of the battery.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The presently disclosed method subject matter overcomes the drawback of the traditional parameter identification and OCV acquirement method and considers the effects of SOC and state-of-health (SOH) on the parameters during the process of SOC diagnostics and prognostics, which results in efficient OCV acquirement and in accurate SOC diagnostics and prognostics during the whole life service of the battery. Moreover, the presently disclosed method integrates LS and ECM, which greatly decreases the computation cost and uncertainty accumulation. Compared with traditional OCV acquirement, SOC diagnostics and prognostics method, the presently disclosed method significantly improves the efficiency, simplifies the process, and improves accuracy.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One exemplary presently disclosed method relates to providing accurate SOH diagnostics and prognostics during the whole life service of a lithium-ion battery by considering the effects of SOC and SOH on certain parameters (such as consideration of nonlinearity of the terminal voltage) during the process of SOC diagnostics and prognostics. One exemplary method integrates LS and ECM analysis, which greatly decreases computation cost and uncertainty accumulation to provide efficient acquisition of OCV determinations for the ECM process.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For some embodiments, the OCV curve of the battery is obtained during Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) testing by fitting a series of selected OCV points after enough rest of the subject battery. For example, rest on the order of minutes, such as several minutes may, in some instances, be sufficient. In some embodiments, a rest of at least five minutes may be practiced. Identified parameters of ECM, in some instances, are updated according to terminal voltage measurement to enable accurate SOC estimation and prediction during the period from full charge to full discharge of the battery. Parameter identification may, in some instances, be re-conducted and an initial condition for SOC estimation is updated according to SOH to enable accurate SOC estimation during the whole life service of battery.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One exemplary embodiment in accordance with presently disclosed subject matter relates to a method for performing SOC diagnosis and prognosis for lithium-ion batteries, including conducting ECM analysis for a subject battery based on established parameters, wherein said established parameters include consideration of nonlinearity of the subject battery terminal voltage over time and using LS acquisition of OCV determinations for use in the ECM analysis.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another exemplary embodiment of presently disclosed subject matter relates to methodology for accurate SOC estimation and prediction of a subject Li-battery by identifying parameters for ECM analysis of the subject Li-battery so as to account for nonlinearity of the subject Li-battery terminal voltage over time, including updating the parameters according to the measured terminal voltage of the subject Li-battery.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet another presently disclosed exemplary embodiment relates to a method for providing accurate SOH diagnostics and prognostics during the whole life service of a lithium-ion battery by considering the effects of SOC and SOH on certain parameters for ECM analysis during the process of SOC diagnostics and prognostics.

Thus, it is intended that aspects of the present disclosure cover such modifications and variations.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Exemplary aspects of the present disclosure are directed to batteries, and more particularly, to SOC diagnosis and prognosis for lithium-ion batteries.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Generally, the present disclosure is directed to lithium-ion battery SOC diagnosis-prognosis based on LS ECM technique.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Parameter identification is an aspect of ECM analysis. In some instances, OCV curve acquirement is used for ECM analysis. HPPC testing is conducted according to the nonlinearity of the terminal voltage to obtain a set of parameters of ECM with respect to terminal voltage. In particular, in some embodiments, measured terminal voltage points are selected after the subject battery rests (i.e., the applied input current is zero) for enough time as OCV points. From there, the OCV curve of the battery is obtained by fitting a series of selected OCV points.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The HPPC test is re-conducted, and the SOC is initialized based on SOH data. In this context, SOH refers to the condition of a battery relative to its ideal conditions. For example, the SOH of a battery may be referenced at 100% at the time of manufacture, and then decrease over time as a result of its use. Within that context, diagnosis and prognosis of SOC is a present level of battery charge compared to capacity (e.g., in percentage, 0%=empty; 100%=full).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Per presently disclosed exemplary subject matter, in some instances, the ECM analysis may be integrated with Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) estimation theory to estimate SOC by calculating OCV of the battery with the parameters of ECM according to terminal voltage.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments disclosed herewith, the SOC diagnostic algorithm may be conducted if a new measurement (terminal voltage) reaches the pre-defined Lebesgue states. The SOC prognostic algorithm is executed based on the LS model to estimate distributions of operating time for the diagnostic SOC reaching each Lebesgue state.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Per presently disclosed exemplary subject matter, in some instances, SOH and SOC estimation of whole-life-service Li-Battery may be based on simplified first principles model under an LS framework. Stated another way, the presently disclosed subject matter, in some instances, may relate to LS-based battery whole-life-service SOC estimation using simplified first principles model.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Parameter identification of ECM is conducted in accordance with presently disclosed subject matter with consideration of the nonlinearity of the terminal voltage, which enables the ECM with identified parameters. In some instances, the OCV curve of the battery is obtained during HPPC test by fitting a series of selected OCV points after enough rest of the subject battery. The proposed LS framework combines ECM and LS method for SOC diagnostics and prognostics, which results in low computation and small uncertainty accumulation. With a set of identified parameters of ECM, the parameters are updated according to terminal voltage measurement to enable accurate SOC estimation and prediction during the period from full charge to full discharge of the battery. The parameters identification is re-conducted and initial condition for SOC is updated according to SOH to enable accurate SOC estimation during the whole life service of the battery.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With reference now to the Figures, example embodiments of the present disclosure will be discussed in further detail.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an example graphical representation of a terminal voltage curve graphed, along with a plot of HPPC test results for specific such voltages depending on the number of seconds after charging, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> similarly illustrates a graph of HPPC test response of terminal voltage tracked relative to number of recharging times, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> graphically represents the OCV (curve) relative to SOC.
