More specifically, the disclosure relates to systems and methods for increasing power distribution capacity on secondary power distribution grids.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In many jurisdictions, power is distributed at medium voltages through primary feeders, and residential power is distributed over a low voltage secondary power distribution grid. Power is commonly distributed through primary feeders as three-phase alternating current (AC) which is then divided into its constituent phases to be supplied to a group of residences. When entering residential neighborhoods, distribution transformers are commonly used to reduce the voltage of one phase from the primary feeders to voltage levels appropriate for residential household use. Power from the distribution transformer is delivered to the secondary power distribution grid through secondary feeders.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The increasing adoption of residential photovoltaic (PV) systems, residential energy storage (RES) systems and electric vehicles (EVs) present challenges to the power capacity and power quality of existing distribution grids.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Large-scale adoption of EVs significantly increases power demand on secondary power distribution grids in residential areas. In comparison to traditional household electrical loads, an EV charger can increase the peak power demand of a home by a factor of 2 to 10. As a result, capacity of existing secondary power distribution grid infrastructure may become insufficient to handle the charging demand.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The ampacity of existing secondary feeders may also be insufficient as the secondary feeders in most residential systems are sized according to household power loads prior to the advent of EV adoption. Therefore, with increasing adoption of EVs, homeowners and/or utility companies may need to upgrade secondary feeders, which can be very expensive.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, the capacity of distribution transformers and primary feeders may also be insufficient to support peak demand. Similar to issues with secondary feeders, existing distribution transformers and primary feeders were sized without considering loads from EV chargers. In certain instances, a single EV in a neighborhood could overload a transformer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Existing solutions to increase the capacity of distribution grids include upgrading existing elements of the power distribution grid, including secondary feeders, transformers, and primary feeders. These upgrades require significant construction work, including digging up wires, which can be expensive and time consuming. Further, on most systems, these upgrades would need to be carried out on a large scale to become effective.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Power quality has become a significant issue with the increasing use of PV and RES. The increasing adoption of PV systems and RES systems can cause issues such as overvoltage, undervoltage and phase voltage imbalance. Further, PV and RES require power electronic devices in order to connect to the grid, which may induce frequency instability. These power quality issues may undermine the efficiency of the distribution grid and may also result in undesirable blackout events.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is interest in the power distribution industry for solutions to address power capacity and power quality issues associated with the increased adoption of EVs, PV systems and RES systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The disclosure provides systems and methods for upgrading and/or retrofitting one or more existing secondary power distribution grids. The retrofitted secondary power distribution grid distributes power as direct current (DC) power to increase the capacity of a secondary grid without replacing feeders and transformers. The system includes rectifiers for converting alternating current (AC) voltage from a distribution transformer to direct current voltage. The DC voltage then distributed through the secondary power distribution grid and is converted back to AC using inverters for household use.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a broad aspect, a DC power distribution system for use with an AC secondary power distribution grid includes one or more first conversion units, one or more second conversion units and one or more controllers. The first conversion units each have a rectifier for receiving AC from a distribution transformer of the secondary power distribution grid and converting AC to DC. The second conversion units each have an inverter for converting DC from the first conversion unit to AC to supply power to a respective household. The controllers are each configured to coordinate the first conversion units and the second conversion units, wherein the one or more controllers at least synchronize voltages and pulse width modulation carrier signals of the inverters of the second conversion units.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an aspect, there is provided a direct current (DC) power secondary distribution system comprising: a first conversion unit that receives alternating current (AC) electrical voltage from a distribution transformer of an AC power distribution system and converts the AC electrical voltage to DC electrical voltage output; one or more second conversion units connected downstream of the first conversion unit, wherein each second conversion unit converts the DC electrical voltage output from the first conversion unit to a respective AC electrical voltage output for a respective one or more loads.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the first conversion unit comprises a rectifier that converts the AC electrical voltage to the DC electrical voltage output; and each of the one or more second conversion units comprises a respective inverter that converts the

distribution grid, and residential electrical power is provided using a low voltage secondary power distribution grid. Power is commonly distributed as three-phase alternating (AC) over primary feeders at voltages that can be between 2 kV to 35 kV or greater. When entering residential neighborhoods, distribution transformers are used to reduce the voltage of the electrical power from the primary feeders to voltage levels appropriate for residential household use (e.g. 120V/240V). The lowered-voltage power output by the distribution transformers may be distributed to households or commercial buildings over the secondary power distribution grid.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, each distribution transformer may typically service between about 1 to 15 homes.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In jurisdictions such as North America, distribution transformers operate on a single phase, representing one of three-phases of the AC power from the primary feeders. Power from the distribution transformer is delivered to the secondary power distribution grid using secondary feeders. The term &#x201c;feeder&#x201d; as used herein may refer to power lines through which electrical power is transmitted. Typically, secondary feeders may comprise two powered conductors and one neutral line.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the drawings described below, like reference numbers denote like elements. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of an example AC power distribution system <b>100</b>. The system <b>100</b> comprises a primary feeder <b>112</b> and a secondary power distribution grid <b>122</b>. The primary feeder <b>112</b> may supply three-phase AC power.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, the primary feeder <b>112</b> comprises three primary feeder lines <b>114</b><i>a, </i><b>114</b><i>b, </i><b>114</b><i>c, </i>each comprising a respective one of three phases of the three-phase AC power. Each of the primary feeder lines <b>114</b><i>a, </i><b>114</b><i>b, </i><b>114</b><i>c </i>is connected to at least one distribution transformer <b>120</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, each of the primary feeder lines <b>114</b><i>a, </i><b>114</b><i>b, </i><b>114</b><i>c </i>is shown connected to three distribution transformers <b>120</b>, but the number of distribution transformers <b>120</b> may vary. Each distribution transformer <b>120</b> lowers the voltage of the AC power, thereby providing low voltage electrical power. The term &#x201c;low voltage electrical power&#x201d; as used herein refers to electrical power having a voltage sufficiently low for use in residential or commercial buildings. The low voltage electrical power from each distribution transformer is then supplied to a respective group of homes <b>130</b> via respective secondary feeders <b>124</b> for residential service. In some embodiments, the secondary feeders <b>124</b> are connected to electrical panels <b>132</b> and meters <b>134</b> proximate the homes <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a partial schematic block diagram of the secondary power distribution grid <b>122</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in some embodiments, power from a distribution transformer <b>120</b> of the secondary power distribution grid <b>122</b> is supplied to a home <b>130</b> via a secondary feeder <b>124</b><i>a. </i>The secondary feeder <b>124</b> in may comprise first and second conductor lines <b>224</b><i>a, </i><b>224</b><i>b </i>and one neutral (or ground) line <b>224</b><i>c. </i>In some embodiments, the conductor lines <b>224</b><i>a, </i><b>224</b><i>b </i>and the neutral line <b>224</b><i>c </i>are connected to a meter <b>134</b> and an electrical panel <b>132</b> associated with the home <b>130</b>. In North America, there is commonly a 120V difference in potential between the first conductor line <b>224</b><i>a </i>and the neutral line <b>224</b><i>c </i>as well as a 120V difference in potential between the neutral line <b>224</b><i>c </i>and the second conductor line <b>224</b><i>b, </i>such that there is a 240V difference in potential between the first conductor line <b>224</b><i>a </i>and the second conductor line <b>224</b><i>b. </i>One or more other secondary feeders <b>124</b><i>b </i>may carry power to homes.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of another example AC power distribution system <b>300</b> including a primary feeder <b>312</b>, transformers <b>320</b>, and a secondary power distribution grid <b>322</b>. The secondary power distribution grid <b>322</b> is similar to the secondary power distribution grid <b>122</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> further shows residential photovoltaic (PV) systems <b>340</b>, electric vehicle (EV) chargers <b>350</b> and residential energy storage (RES) systems <b>360</b> that are coupled to or associated with corresponding homes <b>330</b>. For example, the residential PV systems <b>340</b>, EV chargers <b>350</b> and RES systems <b>360</b> may each be coupled (directly or indirectly) to the electrical panel <b>332</b> of the corresponding home <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Example house <b>330</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> has each of a residential PV system <b>340</b>, an EV charger <b>350</b> and an RES system <b>360</b> associated therewith. The residential PV system <b>340</b> may comprise solar panels. The residential PV system <b>340</b> is connected to a PV inverter <b>342</b>. The PV inverter <b>342</b> is connected intermediate the residential PV system <b>340</b> and the electrical panel <b>332</b> of the house <b>330</b><i>a </i>in order to convert direct current (DC) voltage from the residential PV system <b>340</b> to AC voltage. Similarly, an RES inverter <b>362</b> is connected intermediate the RES system <b>360</b> and the electrical panel <b>332</b> of the house <b>330</b><i>a. </i>The other residential PV systems <b>340</b>, EV chargers <b>350</b> and RES systems <b>360</b> associated with other houses <b>330</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are similarly configured.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The increased adoption of residential PV systems, EVs and RES systems presents capacity and power quality issues on existing power distribution grids. To address these issues, in some embodiments, at least some of the distribution on a secondary distribution grid is transitioned from AC power to DC power.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of an example power distribution system <b>400</b> including a primary feeder <b>412</b> and a secondary power distribution grid <b>422</b>. Again, homes <b>430</b> may have associated therewith one or more of a residential PV system <b>440</b>, an EV charger <b>450</b> and a RES system <b>460</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The secondary power distribution grid <b>422</b> comprises a plurality of first conversion units <b>470</b> and second conversion units <b>476</b>. The second conversion units <b>476</b> are connected downstream (electrically) of the first conversion units <b>476</b>. The first conversion units <b>470</b> may each comprise a respective rectifier, and the second conversion units <b>476</b> may each comprise a respective inverter. The first conversion units <b>470</b> convert AC electrical voltage to DC electrical voltage output, while the second conversion units <b>476</b> convert DC electrical voltage output from the first conversion units <b>470</b> to AC electrical voltage respective one or more loads associated with homes <b>430</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Each first conversion unit <b>470</b> may be coupled to and positioned proximate a corresponding one of the distribution transformers <b>420</b> to receive AC power therefrom. Each first conversion unit <b>470</b> may be coupled via one or more secondary feeders <b>424</b> to one or more secondary conversion units <b>476</b>. The ratio of first conversion units <b>470</b> to secondary conversion units <b>476</b> and homes <b>430</b> may vary. Each distribution transformer <b>420</b> and first conversion unit <b>470</b> may, as an example, service between <b>1</b> to <b>15</b> homes. The secondary feeders <b>424</b> each carry DC power from the first conversion unit <b>470</b> to a respective secondary conversion unit <b>476</b>. The secondary conversion units <b>476</b> each output AC voltage to the electrical panel <b>432</b> of a respective one (or more) of the homes <b>430</b>. Thus, at least a portion of power distribution in the secondary power distribution grid <b>422</b> is accomplished via transmission of DC power.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The secondary power distribution grid <b>422</b> may be created by retrofitting an existing AC secondary power distribution grid (such as the grid <b>322</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) with the first conversion units <b>470</b> and second conversion units <b>476</b>. The retrofit may be carried out by installing first conversion units <b>470</b> proximate corresponding distribution transformers <b>420</b>. Existing secondary feeders <b>424</b> may each be disconnected from distribution transformers <b>420</b> and reconnected on a DC side of a respective rectifier <b>470</b>, while the AC side of the respective rectifier <b>470</b> is connected to the corresponding distribution transformer <b>420</b>. The second conversion units <b>476</b> may each be installed proximate a corresponding home <b>430</b> to convert DC voltage back to AC voltage prior to power delivery to the homes <b>430</b>. This conversion back to AC voltage may avoid or lessen any impact on the power supply needs of the household.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The conversion of a secondary power distribution grid to a DC grid by converting AC voltage from a distribution transformer to DC voltage for distribution may increase the capacity of the secondary distribution grid. For example, in North America, an existing AC secondary distribution grid has a voltage of 240V. If the ampacity of the secondary feeder is 100 A, the power capacity of the secondary distribution grid to each home is 24 kVA. Currently, to increase the capacity of a secondary power grid, secondary feeders are replaced with cable with a higher ampacity. By distributing power in DC, voltage may be increased to approximately 480V using the same secondary feeders to approximately double the capacity of the secondary distribution grid using the same 100 A secondary feeder. Conversion to a DC grid may permit upgrading the capacity of a secondary power distribution grid with a reduced need for construction. Further, conversion allows upgrading of individual homes or neighborhoods providing further potential time and cost savings or deferrals.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of another example power distribution system <b>500</b> including a primary feeder <b>512</b> and a secondary power distribution grid <b>522</b>. The system <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is similar to the system <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. One neighborhood <b>502</b> is shown receiving power via the primary feeder line <b>514</b><i>a. </i>Within the neighborhood <b>502</b>, only distribution to one home <b>530</b><i>a </i>is upgraded with first and second conversion units <b>570</b> and <b>576</b>, such that DC power is carried over secondary feeder line <b>524</b><i>a. </i>Other homes <b>530</b><i>b, </i><b>530</b><i>c </i>in the same neighborhood <b>502</b> continue to use an existing AC secondary distribution via feeder lines <b>524</b><i>b, </i><b>524</b><i>c </i>of the grid <b>522</b>. The first conversion unit <b>570</b> comprises a rectifier and the second conversion unit <b>576</b> comprises an inverter in this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of another example power distribution system <b>600</b> including a primary feeder <b>612</b> and a secondary power distribution grid <b>622</b>. In this embodiment, the system <b>600</b> again includes multiple neighborhoods <b>602</b><i>a, </i><b>602</b><i>b </i>and <b>602</b><i>c, </i>which are associated with primary feeder lines <b>614</b><i>a, </i><b>614</b><i>b </i>and <b>614</b><i>c </i>respectively. Two neighborhoods <b>602</b><i>b </i>and <b>602</b><i>c </i>are shown upgraded with first conversion units comprising rectifiers <b>670</b> and second conversion units comprising inverters <b>676</b> configured for DC power distribution. Another neighborhood <b>602</b><i>a </i>associated with primary feeder line <b>614</b><i>a </i>continues to use the existing AC secondary distribution infrastructure.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Converting or retrofitting secondary distribution grids to utilize DC power distribution can also result in an improvement in power quality. As homes are decoupled from the AC power distribution infrastructure using rectifiers and inverters, power supply voltage and frequency to each home can be maintained at optimum levels through proper control of inverters, regardless of the voltage quality and frequency of the AC primary power distribution grid. Further, PV systems and RES systems in the associated neighborhoods may also be decoupled from the AC power grid by the rectifiers and inverters, and their impact on the power quality of the primary AC grid may be significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">By controlling a rectifier proximate a distribution transformer, the power quality of an AC power grid may be improved. Rectifiers can also provide ancillary services such as reactive power generation and transformer monitoring. Centralized control of distributed rectifiers in different neighborhoods may also allow distribution grid operators to improve the efficiency and power quality of the entire distribution grid. In some embodiments, the DC power grid can operate within a range of grid voltages. During peak hours, the grid voltage can be regulated by adjusting the rectifiers to control the amount of reactive power injected to or absorbed from the distribution grid to keep the grid voltage towards the higher range of voltages. As the current flowing through the primary feeders decreases, the line losses may be reduced. This can also be used to control the power factor of rectifiers to ensure the entire distribution grid is operating at a higher power factor range. Further, rectifiers can be used to absorb certain low order harmonics on the distribution grid injected by industrial, commercial or residential loads to reduce harmonics on the distribution grid.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of yet another example power distribution system <b>700</b> including a primary feeder <b>712</b> and a secondary power distribution grid <b>722</b>.

A deadband may be implemented to prevent frequent changes of Vdc and for a more easily discernable indication of the loading state of the transformer. Therefore, may Vdc stays at Vmid when transformer loading is between P<b>1</b> and a second intermediate threshold P<b>2</b>. For example, P<b>1</b> can be set at a power level around 60% or 65% of the maximum transformer capacity Pmax and P<b>2</b> can be set at a power level close to the limit of transformer rating, e.g., 70% or 80% of the maximum transformer capacity.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In an embodiment, reaching P<b>2</b> means that the EV charging demand cannot further increase.

A specific example of managed charging for one or more EV charger is summarized below. However, embodiments are not limited to this specific example. The following managed charging parameters may be implemented by the inverter controller:</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">If Vmin&#x3c;Vdc&#x3c;Vmid, the inverter(s) can start EV chargers freely.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">If Vdc=Vlim<b>1</b>, the inverter controller(s) requests charger(s) to hold off on charging to prevent further increase of the charging demand. For example, chargers that have already started charging may keep charging at the same power level. Chargers that have not started charging will not start. In this condition, transformer loading may decrease if the base household power demand reduces. When the transformer loading is reduced to a limit P<b>4</b> (e.g. 50% of Pmax) or lower for a given period (e.g. 15 minutes), the level of Vdc may be reduced to a lower voltage level between Vmin and Vmid and the inverter controller(s) may signal to the chargers that EV charging may resume, meaning that chargers can increase charging power if needed and/or inactive chargers may start if needed.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">If Vdc=Vlim<b>2</b>, each inverter controller may request its respective EV charger to reduce charging demand. For example, if the transformer loading can be reduced to P<b>5</b> (e.g., 60% of Pmax), Vdc may be returned to Vlim<b>1</b> to cease measures to reduce charging power and to remain at the current power level. New chargers would not be activated. If the transformer loading stays below P<b>5</b> for a given period (e.g. 15 minutes), Vdc may return to the value that determined by the power-voltage relationship between Pbase and P<b>1</b>, which means that chargers can increase their charging power demand as needed and/or inactive chargers may be activated as required.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">If Vdc=Vlim<b>3</b>, the transformer is overloaded or a demand response request has initiated. In this case, the inverter controllers may stop all EV chargers and Vdc may return to Vlim<b>1</b> to pause all chargers until the transformer loading backs to normal or the demand response request is lifted.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The above is one example of how DC link managed charging may be implemented using embodiments of the present SDS system. In other embodiments, a different number of transformer load thresholds P<b>1</b>,P<b>2</b>, . . . ,Pn may be selected having any number of corresponding desired Vdc levels. Likewise, the house-side inverters of the SDS may be configured to respond to Vdc levels and instruct their corresponding EV chargers in various ways besides in the manner described above. For example, certain inverters may be prioritized and instruct their corresponding chargers to initiate or continue charging while others are not permitted to charge.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">These operating principles similarly apply for the architectures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, with the exception that DSI proximate the homes will communicate with EV chargers.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">These operating principles may also similarly apply for the architectures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref> to manage EV charging demand. However, as inverters receive output voltages of individual DC-DC converters, homes can have different DC link voltages, e.g. Vdc<b>2</b>,<b>1</b> for a first home and Vdc<b>2</b>,i for second home. This further allows optimization of the operation of the DC SDS. For instance, in the TSC, Vdc can follow the same principles illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. However, Vdc<b>2</b>,i can be individually controlled to ask the EV charger of a specific home to start charging while keeping the other chargers paused.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some embodiments having variable DC link-based DC SDS operation, charging demand can be managed to prevent the transformer overloading. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref> illustrates the result of managed charging using an example neighborhood with 10 homes receiving power supplied by 0 kVA distribution transformer. Each home has a 10 kW EV charger and we assume that the average energy for charging is 35 kWh per home. Without controlling EV chargers, peak transformer loading reaches over 80 kVA due to the high-power demand for charging. This may overload and damage the transformer and primary feeders. With the present variable DC link-based DC SDS demand management approach, transformer loading may be consistently kept below 0 kVA, meaning that transformer overloading is prevented.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> is a partial schematic block diagram of an example DC SDS system <b>1900</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> shows the &#x201c;inverter&#x201d; side of the system <b>1900</b>. including a &#x201c;smart&#x201d; home panel <b>1902</b>, and a conversion unit <b>1904</b> coupled to the smart home panel <b>1902</b>.
