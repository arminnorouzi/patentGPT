A description will be given of the case where the data lines <b>8</b> are divided into groups based on amplifiers, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> to <b>13</b></figref>. It should be noted that the case where the writing is performed by dividing the data lines <b>8</b> into three groups based on amplifiers will be described here. Here, the number of groups need only be two or more and may be a number other than three.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">First, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, when the Vth correction preparation period begins, the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> that are connected to the amplifiers <b>31</b> of the first group whose number is equal to &#x201c;n/3&#x201d; turn ON from an OFF state. This causes the reference voltage Vofs to be written to the data lines <b>8</b> of the first group that are connected to the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> of the first group. It should be noted that the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> of the second and third groups that are connected to the amplifiers <b>31</b> of the second and third groups whose number is equal to &#x201c;2n/3&#x201d; remain OFF and that no change occurs in the signal voltage Vdata that has been written to the data lines <b>8</b> on the previous vertical line. Here, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, letting the parasitic capacitance C (vccp-data) between VCCP and DATA when the signal voltage Vdata changes to the reference voltage Vofs at the time of the writing in one operation be denoted as Cp, Cp/3 contributes to the VCCP fluctuation, which reduces a VCCP change at the time of the writing in one operation. Specifically, the fluctuation of the peak is reduced to one third.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, while the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> of the first group to which the reference voltage Vofs has been written a while ago are ON and remain grounded to the reference voltage Vofs, the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> of the second group which is a different group that are connected to the amplifiers <b>31</b> of the second group whose number is equal to &#x201c;n/3&#x201d; turn ON from the OFF state. This causes the reference voltage Vofs to be written to the data lines <b>8</b> of the second group that are connected to the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> of the second group. Here, the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> in the remaining third group that are connected to the amplifiers <b>31</b> of the third group whose number is equal to &#x201c;n/3&#x201d; remain OFF, and no change occurs in the signal voltage Vdata that has been written to the data lines <b>8</b> on the previous vertical line. Meanwhile, the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> of the first group are fixed in the ON state even after the end of the writing of the reference voltage Vofs.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">At this time, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the parasitic capacitance that affects the VCCP fluctuation by the second group is Cp/3 as in the above case of the first group. However, the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> of the first group are grounded to the fixed power supply (specifically, voltage Vofs) even after the end of the writing, which contributes to the additional suppression of the VCCP change. This reduces the VCCP fluctuation more than in the above first group. Here, if the ratio of Cp to a parasitic capacitance Cp_VCC between the VCCP and another fixed power supply is reduced, the VCCP fluctuation is reduced. The grounding of the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> of the first group to the fixed power supply even after the end of the writing translates into the additionally larger Cp_VCC. As a result, the ratio of Cp to Cp_VCC is reduced, which reduces the VCCP fluctuation. It should be noted that the fixed power supply to which the selector switches are grounded may be a power supply other than the reference voltage Vofs. Also, grounding may be achieved by means other than the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Finally, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, while the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> of the first and second groups are ON and remain grounded to the reference voltage Vofs, the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> in the remaining third group that are connected to the amplifiers <b>31</b> of the third group whose number is equal to &#x201c;n/3&#x201d; turn ON from the OFF state. Then, the reference voltage Vofs is written to the data lines <b>8</b> of the third group that are connected to the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> of the third group. This further reduces the VCCP fluctuation more than in the case of the above second group for a reason similar to the case of the second group.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">It should be noted that the transistor DSTr is turned ON by the first control signal DS during the Vth correction preparation period as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. That is, the transistor DSTr is ON when the reference voltage Vofs is written. This causes one of electrodes of the drive transistor DRTr to be grounded to the fixed power supply (specifically, VCCP) via the transistor DSTr, which makes it possible to additionally increase Cp_VCC. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the VCCP fluctuation by reducing the above ratio of Cp to Cp_VCC. It should be noted that the transistor DSTr may be turned OFF during the Vth correction preparation period.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As a result, the VCCP change is suppressed as a whole, as illustrated by the bold dashed line waveform in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, which makes it possible to suppress occurrence of the above crosstalk. The writing on a group-by-group basis can suppress the peak of the fluctuation, and the writing in an overlapping manner can reduce the length of time required to eliminate the fluctuation. The number of divisions and the writing timing are set as appropriate commensurate with allowable length of time for the Vth correction preparation period and the like.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">It should be noted that the writing need not be performed in the order from the first group to the second group to the third group. For example, the writing may be performed in the order from the first group to the third group to the second group. Also, the writing periods of the reference voltage Vofs of the respective groups during the Vth correction preparation period may or may not overlap with each other. That is, the writing may be performed before or after the elimination of the power fluctuation of the previous group.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The way of dividing the data lines <b>8</b> into groups is not limited to the division into groups based on amplifiers. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the data lines <b>8</b> may be divided into groups based on pixel colors to which the pixel circuits correspond. Also, rather than dividing them regularly, that is, dividing them into groups based on amplifiers, colors, or the like, the data lines <b>8</b> may be divided into groups irregularly as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. Also, as in the case described above, the number of data lines <b>8</b> may be the same in each group. Alternatively, the number of data lines <b>8</b> may be different among the divided groups. That is, the data lines <b>8</b> need only be divided into two or more groups. In any case, it is possible to suppress the occurrence of crosstalk as in the case of the division into groups based on amplifiers described above.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As described above, the organic EL display apparatus <b>1</b> can suppress the power fluctuation by writing the correction potential for correcting Vth of the drive transistor DRTr to the data lines <b>8</b> that are divided into groups, on a group-by-group basis. This suppresses the luminance change caused by the power fluctuation that occurs partially on the screen, which makes it possible to improve the deterioration of the image quality. Because the fixed power supply is grounded after the writing of the correction potential, it is possible to reduce the power fluctuation as compared to the case where the fixed power supply is not grounded (specifically, in the case where the selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> are turned OFF after the writing) as described above. The selector switches SEL<b>1</b> to SEL<b>9</b> sample, in a time-shared manner, the signal voltages of the data signals commensurate with the gray scale level that are input chronologically following the correction potential and write the signal voltages to the data lines <b>8</b>, which makes it unnecessary to form a new circuit for writing the correction potential to the pixel circuit <b>4</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">&#x3c;3.
