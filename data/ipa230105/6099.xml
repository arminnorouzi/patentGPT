At this time, a reverse voltage is applied to the tunnel junction (the p-n junction) of the tunnel junction layer <b>30</b>. Therefore, a current due to the tunnel effect flows in the tunnel junction layer <b>30</b>.

The second n-type layer <b>21</b> has a higher sheet resistance than the fourth electrode <b>44</b> that is made of a metal material, so that the current that is supplied via the second electrode <b>42</b> is not easily diffused in the planar direction of the second n-type layer <b>21</b>. As described below, the sheet resistance of the second n-type layer <b>21</b> is increased because the second n-type layer <b>21</b> cannot be made thick.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">When forming the layers that are higher than the first n-type layer <b>11</b>, there is a risk of thermal damage of the lower layers that are already formed; therefore, it is favorable for the film formation times the layers that are higher than the first n-type layer <b>11</b> to be less than the film formation time of the first n-type layer <b>11</b>. In such a case, the layers that are higher than the first n-type layer <b>11</b> are thinner than the first n-type layer <b>11</b>.

Therefore, it is difficult to diffuse the current supplied to the second n-type layer <b>21</b> via the second electrode <b>42</b> in the planar direction.
