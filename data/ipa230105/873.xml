One such compound is pemetrexed, which has the chemical name N-[4-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H-pyrrolo [2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]L-glutamic acid and the structure of formula (1):</p><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="24.21mm" wi="74.93mm" file="US20230000874A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Pemetrexed is used in the treatment of pleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer. ALIMTA, Eli Lilly's pemetrexed product is presently supplied in 100 mg and 500 mg vials of lyophilized pemetrexed disodium for injection. According to the prescribing information, in order to prepare ALIMTA for infusion the vials are reconstituted in sufficient 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative free) to give a solution containing 25 mg/mL of ALIMTA. This concentrated solution is then further diluted into a solution of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative free). The prescribing information cautions that reconstitution and further dilution is only recommended with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative free), and that &#x201c;ALIMTA is physically incompatible with diluents containing calcium, including Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP and Ringer's Injection, USP and therefore these should not be used.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Calcium containing diluents, such as Lactated Ringer's Injection and Ringer's Injection, are common solutions used in medical settings for the reconstitution and/or dilution of drug products prior to intravenous administration. There is a need for pemetrexed dosage forms that are chemically stable after reconstitution and/or dilution with diluents containing calcium. In addition to being useful with a wider range of available diluents, the use of such a dosage form would minimize both the loss of dosage forms due to improper reconstitution or dilution and the risk that a patient would be administered pemetrexed reconstituted or diluted in an incompatible diluent.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">In solution, pemetrexed undergoes hydrolysis and degrades rapidly. Due to this rapid degradation, pemetrexed formulations must either be lyophilized for long term stability or comprise stabilizers. However, reconstitution of a lyophilized formulation requires multiple steps, each of which increases the risk of user error. In addition, reconstitution of a lyophilized formulation is clinically inconvenient and can take up to 30 minutes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">While stable, ready to use formulations of pemetrexed are known, they require stabilizers, such as anti-oxidants or amino acids as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,686,365; CN 101081305; and WO 2012/015810, or high levels of non-aqueous solvents, as described in WO2013/144814. It would be advantageous to minimize patient exposure to these additional ingredients.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">As such, there is a need for a stable, non-lyophilized pemetrexed composition with a minimal amount of additional ingredients. To this end, we have developed a stable pemetrexed formulation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0008">In certain embodiments, the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising pemetrexed and a non-aqueous solvent present at a concentration less than 0.30 ml/mL, wherein upon dilution with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent to an initial dosage concentration of pemetrexed, the composition comprises at least 90% of the initial dosage concentration of pemetrexed after storage at a temperature of 2&#xb0; C. to 8&#xb0; C. for at least 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">In further embodiments, the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising 25 mg/mL pemetrexed, 250 &#x3bc;L/mL propylene glycol, and water, wherein upon dilution with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent to an initial dosage concentration of pemetrexed, the composition comprises at least 90% of the initial dosage concentration of pemetrexed after storage at a temperature of 2&#xb0; C. to 8&#xb0; C. for at least 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">In still further embodiments, the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising pemetrexed at an initial concentration of 10 to 50 mg/mL and a non-aqueous solvent present at a concentration less than 0.30 ml/mL, wherein the composition comprises at least 90% of the initial pemetrexed concentration after storage at a temperature of 2&#xb0; C. to 8&#xb0; C. for at least 12 months.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">In further embodiments, the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising 25 mg/mL pemetrexed, 250 &#x3bc;L/mL propylene glycol, and water, wherein the composition comprises at least 90% of the initial pemetrexed concentration after storage at a temperature of 2&#xb0; C. to 8&#xb0; C. for at least 12 months.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">In certain embodiments, the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising pemetrexed and a non-aqueous solvent present at a concentration less than 0.30 ml/mL, wherein upon dilution with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent to an initial dosage concentration of pemetrexed, the composition comprises no more than 8% w/w total impurities after storage at a temperature of 2&#xb0; C. to 8&#xb0; C. for at least 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">In further embodiments, the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising 25 mg/mL pemetrexed, 250 &#x3bc;L/mL propylene glycol, and water, wherein upon dilution with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent to an initial dosage concentration of pemetrexed, the composition comprises no more than 8% w/w total impurities after storage at a temperature of 2&#xb0; C. to 8&#xb0; C. for at least 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">In still further embodiments, the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising pemetrexed at an initial concentration of 10 to 50 mg/mL and a non-aqueous solvent present at a concentration less than 0.30 ml/mL, the composition comprises no more than 8% w/w total impurities after storage at a temperature of 2&#xb0; C. to 8&#xb0; C. for at least 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">In further embodiments, the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising 25 mg/mL pemetrexed, 250 &#x3bc;L/mL propylene glycol, and water, the composition comprises no more than 8% w/w total impurities after storage at a temperature of 2&#xb0; C. to 8&#xb0; C. for at least 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Additional embodiments of the invention include:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0017">1.
