High-capacity energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries and capacitors, are used in a growing number of applications, including portable electronics, medical, transportation, grid-connected large energy storage, renewable energy storage, and uninterruptible power supply (UPS). In each of these applications, the charge/discharge time and capacity of energy storage devices are key parameters. In addition, the size, weight, and/or cost of such energy storage devices are also key parameters. Further, low internal resistance is integral for high performance. The lower the resistance, the less restriction the energy storage device encounters in delivering electrical energy. For example, in the case of a battery, internal resistance affects performance by reducing the total amount of useful energy stored by the battery as well as the ability of the battery to deliver high current.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Li-ion batteries are thought to have the best chance at achieving the sought after capacity and cycling. However, Li-ion batteries as currently constituted often lack the energy capacity and number of charge/discharge cycles for these growing applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for faster charging, higher capacity energy storage devices that have improved cycling, and can be more cost effectively manufactured. There is also a need for components for an energy storage device that reduce the internal resistance of the storage device.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Implementations described herein generally relate to metal electrodes, more specifically lithium-containing anodes, high performance electrochemical devices, such as secondary batteries, including the aforementioned lithium-containing electrodes, and methods for fabricating the same.

Certain details are set forth in the following description and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>20</b></figref> to provide a thorough understanding of various implementations of the disclosure.

However, current lithium metal batteries suffer from dendrite growth, which hinders the practical applications of lithium metal batteries in portable electronics and electric vehicles. Over the course of several charge/discharge cycles, microscopic fibers of lithium, called dendrites form on the lithium metal surface and spread until contacting the other electrode. Passing electrical current through these dendrites can short circuit the battery. One of the most challenging aspects of enabling lithium metal battery technology is the development of a stable and efficient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). A stable and efficient SEI provides an effective strategy for inhibiting dendrite growth and thus achieving improved cycling.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Current SEI films are typically formed in-situ during the cell formation cycling process, which is generally performed immediately after cell fabrication. During the cell formation cycling process, when an appropriate potential is established on the anode and particular organic solvents are used as the electrolyte, the organic solvent is decomposed and forms the SEI film at first charge. With typical liquid electrolytes and under lower current density, a mossy lithium deposit was reported and the lithium growth was attributed to &#x201c;bottom growth.&#x201d; At higher current densities, a concentration gradient in the electrolyte causes &#x2018;tip growth&#x2019; and this tip growth causes shorting of the cell. Depending upon the organic solvents used, the SEI film that forms on the anode is typically a mixture of lithium oxide, lithium fluoride, and semicarbonates. Initially, the SEI film is electrically insulating yet sufficiently conductive to lithium ions. The SEI prevents decomposition of the electrolyte after the second charge. The SEI can be thought of as a three-layer system with two key interfaces. In conventional electrochemical studies, it is often referred to as an electrical double layer. In its simplest form, an anode coated by an SEI will undergo three stages when charged. These three stages include electron transfer between the anode (M) and the SEI (M<sup>0</sup>&#x2212;ne&#x2192;M<sup>n+</sup><sub>M/SEI</sub>); cation migration from the anode-SEI interface to the SEI-electrolyte (E) interface (M<sup>n+</sup><sub>M/SEI</sub>&#x2192;M<sup>n+</sup><sub>SEI/E</sub>); and cation transfer in the SEI to electrolyte at the SEI/electrolyte interface (E(solv)+M<sup>n+</sup>SEI/E&#x2192;M<sup>n+</sup>E(solv)).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The power density and recharge speed of the battery is dependent on how quickly the anode can release and gain charge. This, in turn, is dependent on how quickly the anode can exchange lithium ions with the electrolyte through the SEI. Lithium ion exchange at the SEI is a multi-stage process and as with most multi-stage processes, the speed of the entire process is dependent upon the slowest stage. Studies have shown that anion migration is the bottleneck for most systems. In addition, it is believed that the diffusive characteristics of the solvents dictate the speed of migration between the anode-SEI interface and the SEI-electrolyte (E) interface. Thus, the best solvents have little mass in order to maximize the speed of diffusion.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although the specific properties and reactions that take place at the SEI are not well understood, it is believed that these properties and reactions have profound effects on the cycling and capacity of the anode electrode structure. It is further believed that the SEI can thicken when cycled, slowing diffusion from the Electrode/SEI interface to the SEI/Electrolyte. For example, at elevated temperatures, alkyl carbonates in the electrolyte decompose into insoluble Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>that can increase the thickness of the SEI film, clog pores of the SEI film, and limit lithium ion access to the anode. SEI growth can also occur by gas evolution at the cathode and particle migration towards the anode. This, in turn, increases impedance and decreases capacity. Further, the randomness of metallic lithium embedded in the anode during intercalation results in dendrite formation. Over time, the dendrites pierce the separator, causing a short circuit leading to heat, fire and/or explosion.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Implementations of the present disclosure relate to constructing a stable and an efficient SEI film ex-situ. The SEI film is formed in the energy storage device during fabrication of the energy storage device. This new and efficient SEI film is believed to inhibit lithium dendrite growth and thus achieves superior lithium metal cycling performance relative to current lithium based anodes, which rely on an in-situ SEI film.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of one implementation of an energy storage device <b>100</b> incorporating an anode electrode structure having an SEI film stack <b>140</b> formed according to implementations described herein.
