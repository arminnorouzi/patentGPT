However, such systems must be policy-based to ensure that user-created content does not violate rules set up by the franchisor. For example, traditional creative methods using generative adversarial networks (GAN) and style-transfer methods for creating derivative content from original content have no constraints (e.g., face swaps between gender, ethnicity) or franchise limitations (e.g., do not make &#x201c;good&#x201d; character commit a violent or bad act).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a fan-based system functioning within the communication network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in accordance with various aspects described herein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, users (also referred to herein as &#x201c;fans&#x201d;) operate media devices <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>203</b> to access a fan-based platform implemented by a network element <b>210</b>. Likewise, editors operate an exemplary media device <b>205</b> to securely access network element <b>210</b> to maintain aspects of the operation of network element <b>210</b> and implementation of the platform. Network element <b>210</b> implements a platform to assist in the creation and distribution of UGC mashups. The platform comprises a content database <b>211</b>, provides a search interface <b>212</b>, a composition module <b>213</b>, a policy repository <b>214</b>, a rendering and publishing module <b>215</b>, and a leaderboard <b>216</b>. Although these platform functions and data storage are illustrated as one single network element <b>210</b>, one of ordinary skill in the art would realize that such platform functions and data storage may be spread over a distributed computing environment, or even hosted by physical machines outside of the communications network <b>207</b>, or &#x201c;network cloud.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Content database <b>211</b> comprises digital media assets that the fans may use or interact within the boundaries of franchisor policies. The platform automatically derives &#x201c;building blocks&#x201d; of a franchise that can be used as a basis for creating a UGC mash-up. In one embodiment, a building block may be the appearance of a particular character, a location in a franchise, an extended scene or set of shots, or other memorable or significant narrative object. These building blocks should be recognizable outside of their original source and ideally have a specific preference or attachment to a user measured by explicit indicators (likes, comments, social media) or by passive indicators (most of the content exposure in a series or season focuses on this character or locale. The platform can generate metadata that maintains the original context of these building blocks such that the building blocks may be more easily discovered and evaluated for continuity and fitness in future placements. In one embodiment, the fitness of a building block that involves a famous character and quote may represent &#x201c;mournful scenes&#x201d; and &#x201c;father-son relationships&#x201d; that would be appropriate for climactic end-of-story scenarios or surprising character reveals. The platform can also discover &#x201c;candidate segments,&#x201d; which complement building blocks, that describe potential destinations (e.g. spatial and temporal cut points for an object and its content into source content) for building blocks. In one example, the system may identify candidate segments in content as &#x201c;relationships&#x201d; via identification of metadata tags like &#x201c;static scene,&#x201d; &#x201c;high drama,&#x201d; or &#x201c;intimate vocal discussions&#x201d; by analysis techniques. Coupling the &#x201c;father-son relationship&#x201d; building block example from above, a fitness score may be high for this building block and appropriate for users that are more likely fathers or sons, but the score may be low if the users are one or more elementary children. In another embodiment, building blocks may be derived from assets in the same franchise but from different creation dates. Specifically, several action hero films have been &#x201c;rebooted&#x201d; numerous times by different directors and franchise operators. In this example, the building blocks may be the same catch phrase, like &#x201c;I'm Batman&#x201d; (automatically detected and segmented by the system) but spoken by the various actors that have been a part of the franchise from the 1950s through 2010s.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Search interface <b>212</b> provides the fans with the ability to find content in the content database <b>211</b>. This interface may embody more traditional uses (like a search interface with keywords, vocal prompts, visual examples, etc.) or non-traditional examples, like the threading of topics or themes (e.g., an introspective theme or the topic of dealing with the loss of a beloved pet). The interface is designed to allow interactions both with the user as well as automated queries that may be utilized to match candidate segments with building blocks.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A composition module <b>213</b> enables fans to generate UGC. Composition module <b>213</b> provides both textual and visual interfaces to allow fans to express their needs in any form. Some examples of an interface for the composition module <b>213</b> may include direct forms, list selections, and graphical indicators (e.g., circles, groupings, highlights) to more complex visual indicators like sliders representing one extreme or another of two oppositional concepts (action vs. drama) or visual components of building blocks (e.g., a haunted mansion or a dark cave). While these are only a few examples, due to the immersive nature of the search interface <b>212</b> and composition module <b>213</b>, more of the interface may focus on the resultant content mash-up (e.g., visual or audio results of the building block and candidate set mixing) instead of the metadata that describes those components. In another embodiment, one or more completed compositions (e.g., those that involve the inclusion of multiple building blocks as suggested by a fitness evaluation from the system) may be presented to the user and thereby limit options to either the completed composition A or completed composition B.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Policy repository <b>214</b> stores franchise policies governing the use of franchise content. Franchise and content creator policies control sharing and discovery of original content. The policies prevent improper usage of original content, appropriate moderation, and distribution of a franchise or asset in a user-based mash-up/composition. Community-based policies provide for different, novel social channels. Policies can be enforced with linkage to a franchise at different granular levels, such as object, character, or scripts.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Rendering and publishing module <b>215</b> is a mechanism that executes the proposed composition according to policies in policy repository <b>214</b>. Some embodiments may include the visual splicing of certain characters into unusual scenes, the substitution of a scene or location for another, modification of lighting, dialog replacement between characters, etc. Rendered UGC may be delivered as a single, atomic stream (e.g., a fixed video or audio asset that can be delivered outside of the system), as a series of playlist edits (e.g., jumping from one historical piece of content to the next as determined by time signatures and sources references) or as a complex hybrid of both types, where both the timing of content is specified as well as the effect or composition method (e.g., splice, overlay, replace, fade, etc.).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Leaderboard <b>216</b> provides automated and community-based checking at publication of new UGC, both for each consuming user (e.g., child, friend, industry pro) and a consumption channel (e.g., social sharing, personal collection, national film release, etc.). In one embodiment, the leaderboard is a scoring mechanism that can rank-order and recommend new combinations of UGC. For example, if a particular dialog exchange was funny or the interaction of multiple characters was exciting, users may express preferences, tags, or otherwise annotate the generated media. The leaderboard can aggregate these preference indicators for an entire duration of newly composed UGC, the candidate segments, or building blocks (both from content database <b>211</b>). In this manner, repeated use of an original content may naturally formulate a social &#x201c;meme&#x201d; through aggregated preference indicators. In another embodiment, the leaderboard may stratify the preference indicators by demographics or properties associated with the user. For example, one rendering of the leaderboard may represent the entire population of the state of Washington but another rendering may show aggregations for high-school aged users alone.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a flow block diagram illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of processes performed by a fan-based system functioning within the communication network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in accordance with various aspects described herein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, in step <b>221</b> a fan begins consuming content from a franchise. The content can be manifested by many modalities (e.g., genre, text, visual examples, etc.). In step <b>222</b>, previous policy rules for a franchise are also loaded (if available). In step <b>223</b>, the process of fan generating content begins. The user selects one or more characters or plot starting points. In step <b>224</b>, editors or creators of the original content may suggest different options for creating the fan content. For example, the user may select a specific seed instance (episode, character) via search. Also, the user may search for additional revisions and addable content, such as general objects, like period-specific items (a Victorian stool, a sci-fi robot, or a fantasy-based gnome) or cross-franchise suggestions (like the mixing of action heroes with cartoon characters that may reside under one content owner's franchise).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In step <b>225</b>, the system may suggest topic areas based on narrative timeline differences. Alternatively, the system may supply historical examples of user generated content (UGC).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, in step <b>226</b>, the user begins the composition process by guiding what components might be combined into a UGC mash-up. For example, the user may supply a new character dialog, action scene, or interaction between different characters.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, in step <b>227</b>, the system can accept an A/B dialog discourse (or description) and generate a new conversational scene. An A/B dialog discourse is a template for one or more characters and one or more utterances. In one embodiment, the template lasts for three minutes and the dialog is meant to raise emotional tension in the discourse. The composition module <b>213</b> may understand how to generate or select the most appropriate dialog that accomplishes the &#x201c;raising tension&#x201d; objective when given two initial characters and the available original content from the content database <b>211</b> through the search interface <b>212</b>. In this example the &#x201c;A&#x201d; and &#x201c;B&#x201d; description refer to a back-and-forth dialog between two characters, which may also involve deliberate camera close-ups, lighting, or other focus effects to guide the user's attention between the points in the exchange Optionally, the system can provide a form style interface that stimulates user entries of templated topics or dialog. In yet another example, the system can help the user create a mash-up of other assets by mood, music suggestion. A search can be included as well.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, in step <b>228</b>, the system applies franchise limits on the UGC. For example, in step <b>229</b>, creator limitations invoke an interactive process of assert, validate, correct of the user edit process. Then, in step <b>230</b>, the system returns the amended composition back to the user. This process can continue interactively until the UGC meets all of the policies of the franchise. The system includes moderation capabilities for both the audience (which user) and the distribution channel (e.g., shared social, personal, national). Branding and object boundaries are defined by metadata (specific objects or actions are defined), more concrete than general bias/truth/sentiment standards. In an embodiment, complex semantics can be invoked for the characters in each franchise (e.g., Batman is not permitted to lose to Joker).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step <b>231</b>, the system offers the UGC to editors and a user community for review and publication. The editors and community can provide annotations on the UGC. Policies from prior compositions and their renderings are collected for a creator to validate. In one embodiment, at this stage the system collects information about the potential recipient audience if the content were shared (e.g., would sharing be permitted for all audiences, those marked as adults, or those in specific countries). In another embodiment, the system collects information about the media device (e.g., is the media device capable of rendering an <b>8</b>K picture, or is it a mobile device, a smart watch, or a jumbotron). In yet another embodiment, step <b>231</b> may apply known legal restrictions for the composed content (e.g., airing in a specific country, licensing restrictions for a distribution channel, or bar dates for exposure of content to a certain market.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step <b>232</b>, additional policies can be applied by the editor/content creator before publication. Optionally in step <b>233</b>, community policies can also be created for their shared channels. Specifically, the policies derived from composition in step <b>228</b>, the automatically asserted editor policies <b>229</b>, and the interactively accepted (or negotiated policies) <b>230</b> may be brought back to the content owner (reviewer) to validate. At this time, the modifications to original content that were created in each of the above steps is given one final opportunity for the editor to accept, reject, or refine. Ultimately, in step <b>234</b>, the UGC becomes a new asset for sharing.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, in step <b>235</b>, the users rank the new asset and share content via different platforms. Aligning to the types of associated preferences that feed the leaderboard <b>216</b>, the user may express preferences (or avoidances) for fully composed UGC after processing by the rendering and publishing module <b>215</b>, the candidate segments from search interface <b>212</b>, or the building blocks from the original content stored in the content database <b>211</b>. This preference expression and ranking may be active (a thumbs up, like, or social comment) or passive (a laugh, smile, or share to others). Ranking maybe inferred by the system based on the watch order of the new content from a playlist if one or more versions of the same content is skipped or one or more pieces of different content in the same playlist are skipped. Other interactions with any of the metadata associated with the content from the leaderboard, community sharing, or editor markup may also be attributed with a preference indicator during the user's review in step <b>235</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step <b>236</b>, the platform provides automated evaluation and quality scoring of compositions and comparison versus differences in known components. The quality scoring can be based on feasibility, possibility (i.e., realism) and/or novelty. In a gaming environment, the scoring may be assessed by difficulty.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In step <b>237</b>, the platform may permit user ranking and scoring of UGC. Similar to step <b>235</b>, this ranking and scoring may be distributed among many users and aggregated at various levels as previously indicated in step <b>236</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In step <b>238</b>, the platform can optionally share versions of &#x201c;rough&#x201d; versus &#x201c;produced&#x201d; content sources for higher quality (e.g., film festival). Through the composition module <b>213</b>, instances of UGC and various time-marked modification operations (inclusion, exclusion, reuse, etc.) are recorded in a registry or database as edit transactions. Utilizing techniques from transactional database operations, UGC can be perfectly re-composed based on a playback of transactions given a marker (e.g., a specific user, a specific edit date and time, an identification of content, a specific intersection of content) that identifies the first and last transaction to be included. In one embodiment, two tuples of transaction markers produce a &#x201c;rough&#x201d; version of content to compare a &#x201c;produced&#x201d; version of content. Currently, these versions may be meticulously curated and shared at opportune moments, like a theatrical release (the &#x201c;produced&#x201d; version) and a subsequent re-release or anniversary edition (the &#x201c;rough&#x201d; or &#x201c;director's&#x201d; version). The platform supports this optional operation as well, to best accommodate the leaderboard ranking of versions to allow a community of users to identify their version that becomes a &#x201c;cult classic.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In step <b>239</b>, the platform can optionally provide a link to a source for the UGC. Utilizing the transactional compositions described in step <b>238</b>, the system also provides links to the original source content for any user, editor, or policy creator to later revisit.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In step <b>240</b>, the platform can provide community moderation capabilities, thereby fostering engagement and elevation of their UGC. As moderation and legal requirements change for new release channels, the system allows the use of the composition module <b>213</b> to further refine included pieces of content by moderation ratings. For example, tags derived from automated content analysis (e.g., to identify smoking, bullying, aggressiveness, etc.) can be associated to original content at a later date. At any point, the new moderation tags may be applied to segments and the composition module <b>213</b> can re-evaluate a policy application in step <b>228</b> and respective user (step <b>230</b>), community (step <b>233</b>), and creator requirements (step <b>229</b>) to derive a new, fully compliant version of user generated content. In one embodiment, the process, portions thereof and/or results can be recorded through blockchain procedures to maintain a history.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the respective processes are shown and described as a series of blocks in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, it is to be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a block diagram <b>300</b> is shown illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a virtualized communication network in accordance with various aspects described herein. In particular a virtualized communication network is presented that can be used to implement some or all of the subsystems and functions of system <b>100</b>, the subsystems and functions of system <b>200</b>, and method <b>220</b> presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b></figref>. For example, virtualized communication network <b>300</b> can facilitate in whole or in part deriving one or more building blocks from original content of a franchise; providing a search interface enabling a user to discover the one or more building blocks; providing a composition module enabling the user to manipulate the set of building blocks to create the user generated content; and applying one or more policies of the franchise concerning the user generated content.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In particular, a cloud networking architecture is shown that leverages cloud technologies and supports rapid innovation and scalability via a transport layer <b>350</b>, a virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> and/or one or more cloud computing environments <b>375</b>. In various embodiments, this cloud networking architecture is an open architecture that leverages application programming interfaces (APIs); reduces complexity from services and operations; supports more nimble business models; and rapidly and seamlessly scales to meet evolving customer requirements including traffic growth, diversity of traffic types, and diversity of performance and reliability expectations.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In contrast to traditional network elements&#x2014;which are typically integrated to perform a single function, the virtualized communication network employs virtual network elements (VNEs) <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. that perform some or all of the functions of network elements <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, etc. For example, the network architecture can provide a substrate of networking capability, often called Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) or simply infrastructure that is capable of being directed with software and Software Defined Networking (SDN) protocols to perform a broad variety of network functions and services. This infrastructure can include several types of substrates. The most typical type of substrate being servers that support Network Function Virtualization (NFV), followed by packet forwarding capabilities based on generic computing resources, with specialized network technologies brought to bear when general-purpose processors or general-purpose integrated circuit devices offered by merchants (referred to herein as merchant silicon) are not appropriate. In this case, communication services can be implemented as cloud-centric workloads.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As an example, a traditional network element <b>150</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), such as an edge router can be implemented via a VNE <b>330</b> composed of NFV software modules, merchant silicon, and associated controllers. The software can be written so that increasing workload consumes incremental resources from a common resource pool, and moreover so that it is elastic: so, the resources are only consumed when needed. In a similar fashion, other network elements such as other routers, switches, edge caches, and middle boxes are instantiated from the common resource pool. Such sharing of infrastructure across a broad set of uses makes planning and growing infrastructure easier to manage.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an embodiment, the transport layer <b>350</b> includes fiber, cable, wired and/or wireless transport elements, network elements and interfaces to provide broadband access <b>110</b>, wireless access <b>120</b>, voice access <b>130</b>, media access <b>140</b> and/or access to content sources <b>175</b> for distribution of content to any or all of the access technologies. In particular, in some cases a network element needs to be positioned at a specific place, and this allows for less sharing of common infrastructure. Other times, the network elements have specific physical layer adapters that cannot be abstracted or virtualized and might require special DSP code and analog front ends (AFEs) that do not lend themselves to implementation as VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> or <b>334</b>. These network elements can be included in transport layer <b>350</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> interfaces with the transport layer <b>350</b> to provide the VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. to provide specific NFVs. In particular, the virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> leverages cloud operations, applications, and architectures to support networking workloads. The virtualized network elements <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> and <b>334</b> can employ network function software that provides either a one-for-one mapping of traditional network element function or alternately some combination of network functions designed for cloud computing. For example, VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> and <b>334</b> can include route reflectors, domain name system (DNS) servers, and dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) servers, system architecture evolution (SAE) and/or mobility management entity (MME) gateways, broadband network gateways, IP edge routers for IP-VPN, Ethernet and other services, load balancers, distributers and other network elements. Because these elements do not typically need to forward large amounts of traffic, their workload can be distributed across a number of servers&#x2014;each of which adds a portion of the capability, and overall, which creates an elastic function with higher availability than its former monolithic version. These virtual network elements <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. can be instantiated and managed using an orchestration approach similar to those used in cloud compute services.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The cloud computing environments <b>375</b> can interface with the virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> via APIs that expose functional capabilities of the VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. to provide the flexible and expanded capabilities to the virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b>. In particular, network workloads may have applications distributed across the virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> and cloud computing environment <b>375</b> and in the commercial cloud or might simply orchestrate workloads supported entirely in NFV infrastructure from these third-party locations.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there is illustrated a block diagram of a computing environment in accordance with various aspects described herein. In order to provide additional context for various embodiments of the embodiments described herein, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general description of a suitable computing environment <b>400</b> in which the various embodiments of the subject disclosure can be implemented.

Wi-Fi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices, e.g., computers, to send and receive data indoors and out; anywhere within the range of a base station. Wi-Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11 (a, b, g, n, ac, ag, etc.) to provide secure, reliable, fast wireless connectivity. A Wi-Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other, to the Internet, and to wired networks (which can use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet). Wi-Fi networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands for example or with products that contain both bands (dual band), so the networks can provide real-world performance similar to the basic 10BaseT wired Ethernet networks used in many offices.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an embodiment <b>500</b> of a mobile network platform <b>510</b> is shown that is an example of network elements <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, and/or VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. For example, platform <b>510</b> can facilitate in whole or in part deriving one or more building blocks from original content of a franchise; providing a search interface enabling a user to discover the one or more building blocks; providing a composition module enabling the user to manipulate the set of building blocks to create the user generated content; and applying one or more policies of the franchise concerning the user generated content. In one or more embodiments, the mobile network platform <b>510</b> can generate and receive signals transmitted and received by base stations or access points such as base station or access point <b>122</b>. Generally, mobile network platform <b>510</b> can comprise components, e.g., nodes, gateways, interfaces, servers, or disparate platforms, that facilitate both packet-switched (PS) (e.g., internet protocol (IP), frame relay, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)) and circuit-switched (CS) traffic (e.g., voice and data), as well as control generation for networked wireless telecommunication. As a non-limiting example, mobile network platform <b>510</b> can be included in telecommunications carrier networks and can be considered carrier-side components as discussed elsewhere herein. Mobile network platform <b>510</b> comprises CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> which can interface CS traffic received from legacy networks like telephony network(s) <b>540</b> (e.g., public switched telephone network (PSTN), or public land mobile network (PLMN)) or a signaling system #7 (SS7) network <b>560</b>.

Additionally, CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> can access mobility, or roaming, data generated through SS7 network <b>560</b>; for instance, mobility data stored in a visited location register (VLR), which can reside in memory <b>530</b>. Moreover, CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> interfaces CS-based traffic and signaling and PS gateway node(s) <b>518</b>. As an example, in a 3GPP UMTS network, CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> can be realized at least in part in gateway GPRS support node(s) (GGSN).

The embodiments (e.g., in connection with automatically identifying acquired cell sites that provide a maximum value/benefit after addition to an existing communication network) can employ various AI-based schemes for carrying out various embodiments thereof. Moreover, the classifier can be employed to determine a ranking or priority of each cell site of the acquired network. A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector, x=(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, x<sub>4 </sub>. . . x<sub>n</sub>), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, that is, f(x)=confidence (class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to determine or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs, which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches comprise, e.g., na&#xef;ve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As will be readily appreciated, one or more of the embodiments can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained (e.g., via a generic training data) as well as implicitly trained (e.g., via observing UE behavior, operator preferences, historical information, receiving extrinsic information). For example, SVMs can be configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus, the classifier(s) can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions, including but not limited to determining according to predetermined criteria which of the acquired cell sites will benefit a maximum number of subscribers and/or which of the acquired cell sites will add minimum value to the existing communication network coverage, etc.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As used in some contexts in this application, in some embodiments, the terms &#x201c;component,&#x201d; &#x201c;system&#x201d; and the like are intended to refer to, or comprise, a computer-related entity or an entity related to an operational apparatus with one or more specific functionalities, wherein the entity can be either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution.
