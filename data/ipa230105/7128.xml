INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to image reading apparatuses for reading images from documents and image forming apparatuses for forming images read by the image reading apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Image reading apparatuses adopted in multifunction machines are generally equipped with an automatic document feeder (ADF). In order to cope with recent demands for a more efficient operation flow through use of information technology, a configuration has been disclosed in which receipts and bills are read by an ADF that is provided in a multifunction machine and that serves as an input unit for entering expenditure information, and in which the image data is integrated in the operation flow to be processed (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No 2015-162077).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, documents containing expenditure data such as receipts and bills are small pieces of paper, and such documents are possibly folded, crumpled, or curled before they are placed on a document tray. It is difficult to stack and align such documents, especially in cases where there is a large number of such documents.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When conveying documents in the ADF, feeding operations are repeatedly performed until all the documents placed on the document tray are fed. Therefore, in a case where folded or crumpled documents are read and discharged by the ADF continuously, stacking failure may occur on the sheet discharge tray or the documents may be jammed in a sheet discharge unit of the ADF.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect of the present invention, an image reading apparatus includes a document tray on which a document is placed, a detection unit configured to detect the document placed on the document tray, a sheet feeding unit configured to feed the document placed on the document tray, a conveyance unit configured to convey the document fed by the sheet feeding unit along a conveyance path, a reading unit configured to read an image on the document being conveyed by the conveyance unit, a sheet discharge unit configured to discharge the document having been read by the reading unit, a sheet discharge tray on which the document discharged by the sheet discharge unit is stacked, and a control unit configured to stop feeding of the document by the sheet feeding unit in a case where the detection unit detects that there is no document present on the document tray. The control unit is configured to execute a first mode and a second mode, the first mode being a mode in which the sheet feeding unit stops feeding of the document in a case where the number of documents having been discharged continuously by the sheet discharge unit has reached a predetermined number of sheets, regardless of a detection result of the detection unit, and the second mode being a mode in which the sheet feeding unit continues feeding of the documents regardless of the number of documents having been discharged continuously by the sheet discharge unit.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a second aspect of the present invention, an image reading apparatus includes a document tray on which a document is placed, a detection unit configured to detect a document placed on the document tray, a sheet feeding unit configured to feed the document placed on the document tray, a conveyance unit configured to convey the document fed by the sheet feeding unit along a conveyance path, a reading unit configured to read an image on the document conveyed by the conveyance unit, a sheet discharge unit configured to discharge the document having been read by the reading unit, a sheet discharge tray on which the document discharged by the sheet discharge unit is stacked, and a control unit configured to stop feeding of the document by the sheet feeding unit in a case where the detection unit detects that there is no document present on the document tray. The control unit is configured to execute a first mode and a second mode, the first mode is a mode in which the sheet feeding unit stops feeding of the document in a case where the number of documents having been fed continuously by the sheet feeding unit has reached a predetermined number of sheets, regardless of a detection result of the detection unit, and the second mode is a mode in which the sheet feeding unit continues feeding of the document regardless of the number of documents having been fed continuously by the sheet feeding unit.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a third aspect of the present invention, an image reading apparatus includes a document tray on which a document is placed, a detection unit configured to detect the document placed on the document tray, a sheet feeding unit configured to feed the document placed on the document tray, a conveyance unit configured to convey the document fed by the sheet feeding unit along a conveyance path, a reading unit configured to read an image on the document being conveyed by the conveyance unit, a sheet discharge unit configured to discharge the document having been read by the reading unit, a sheet discharge tray on which the document discharged by the sheet discharge unit is stacked, and a control unit configured to stop feeding of the document by the sheet feeding unit in a case where the detection unit detects that there is no document present on the document tray. In a state where the document on the document tray is detected by the detection unit, the control unit is configured to stop feeding of the document by the sheet feeding unit, if documents

In other words, the CPU <b>321</b> is configured to switch from a second mode in which there is no limitation on the number of continuously dischargeable sheets to a first mode in which the number of continuously dischargeable sheets is limited to a predetermined number.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">According to this configuration, in a case where the image reading apparatus <b>1000</b> subjects the document determined to have low stackability to continuous reading, a limitation is provided to the number of documents to be stacked on the sheet discharge tray <b>10</b> regardless of the setting performed by the user. Thereby, in a case where the image reading apparatus <b>1000</b> reads documents determined to have low stackability continuously, the changing of order in which the documents are stacked on the sheet discharge tray <b>10</b> or the occurrence of sheet jam in the sheet discharge unit <b>33</b> can be suppressed.</p><heading id="h-0036" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0255" num="0254">In the first to third embodiments, a receipt has been defined as the type of document that is specified as a document having low stackability in the reading job, but it is merely one example of a dedicated setting that is prepared according to a job workflow application. A similar effect can be acquired by applying the present invention to any document having a narrow width, such as a receipt. Further, a similar effect can be acquired by applying the present invention in a mixed-load read mode in which a plurality of document having different sizes are read.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">Further, according to the first to third embodiments, the CPU <b>321</b> limits the number of continuously dischargeable sheets, and when the number of documents discharged by the sheet discharge roller <b>9</b> has reached a predetermined number, stops the feeding of the document regardless of the detection result of the document presence detection sensor <b>11</b>, but the present technique is not limited to this example. The CPU <b>321</b> can be configured to count the number of sheets being fed and to stop the feeding of sheets when the number has reached a predetermined number, instead of the configuration of counting the number of discharged sheets and stopping the feeding of sheets when the number has reached a predetermined number. That is, the CPU <b>321</b> can be configured to be able to set a first mode of stopping the feeding of documents regardless of the detection result of the document presence detection sensor <b>11</b> in a case where the number of documents fed continuously by the pickup roller <b>1</b> and the separation roller <b>2</b> has reached a predetermined number. Further, the CPU <b>321</b> can be configured to be able to set a second mode of continuing continuous feeding of documents by the pickup roller <b>1</b> and the separation roller <b>2</b> regardless of the number of documents being fed continuously by the pickup roller <b>1</b> and the separation roller <b>2</b>. The CPU <b>321</b> can be configured to be able to selectively execute the first mode and the second mode.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256">According to such a configuration, in a state where documents that have low stackability and are difficult to align in a stacked manner is read continuously by the image reading apparatus <b>1000</b>, a limitation is provided to the number of documents being fed continuously so as to limit the number of documents being stacked on the sheet discharge tray <b>10</b>. Thereby, the image reading apparatus <b>1000</b> can suppress the changing of order in which the documents are stacked on the sheet discharge tray <b>10</b> or the occurrence of sheet jam in the sheet discharge unit <b>33</b>. Further, even if the number of documents having exceeded the number of continuously feedable sheets is placed on the document tray <b>30</b>, the image reading apparatus <b>1000</b> can set the first mode so as to limit the number of documents being fed continuously. Thereby, the image reading apparatus <b>1000</b> can reduce the number of times that documents are placed on the document tray <b>30</b> and the number of times the reading job is instructed and executed, such that the number of steps performed by the user when reading documents can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">Further according to the first to third embodiments, the CPU <b>321</b> initializes the continuously discharged sheet counter when a request to resume reading output from the controller unit <b>400</b> by having the OK button on the operation unit <b>405</b> pressed is received, but the present invention is not limited to this example. For example, the CPU <b>321</b> can be configured to be able to resume the conveyance of the document by initializing the continuously discharged sheet counter and continue the limitation of the number of continuously dischargeable sheets at a point of time when a sensor <b>34</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that detects presence or absence of a document placed on the sheet discharge tray <b>10</b> detects the absence of a document.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">According to the above configuration, the document presence detection sensor <b>11</b> constitutes a first detection unit, and the sensor <b>34</b> that is arranged on the sheet discharge tray <b>10</b> and that detects the presence or absence of a document placed on the sheet discharge tray <b>10</b> constitutes a second detection unit.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259">Further according to the first and third embodiments, the CPU <b>321</b> is configured to temporarily stop the document at a position between the separation roller <b>2</b> and the drawing roller <b>3</b> when the number of continuously dischargeable sheets has reached a predetermined number, but the present technique is not limited to this example. The CPU <b>321</b> can be configured to set any position between the document tray <b>30</b> and the CCD sensor unit <b>210</b> in the conveyance path <b>32</b> as the position at which the document is temporarily stopped when the number of continuously dischargeable sheets has reached a predetermined number.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260">Further according to the third embodiment, in a state where a read mode of the freely set size is set and the upper limit setting conditions have been satisfied, the CPU <b>321</b> is configured to set an upper limit value of the continuously discharged sheet counter, but the present technique is not limited thereto. Even in a case where the conditions for setting the upper limit are satisfied, if a specific switch (not shown) for suppressing a control to set the upper limit value of the continuously discharged sheet counter provided on the operation unit <b>405</b> is operated, for example, the CPU <b>321</b> can be configured to not set the upper limit value of the continuously discharged sheet counter.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261">As described above, in a case where the upper limit value of the continuously discharged sheet counter is set, the CPU <b>321</b> according to the third embodiment is configured not to update the upper limit value until the reading job is ended. Therefore, by not setting the upper limit value of the continuously discharged sheet counter when a specific switch is operated in the image reading apparatus <b>1000</b>, even in a case where a small document not intended by the user is mixed in the bundle of documents S, the continuous reading of documents can be continued exceeding the predetermined number of documents.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262">Even according to such case, the CPU <b>321</b> constitutes a mode maintaining unit of maintaining a second mode even if a condition for switching from the second mode to the first mode is satisfied.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0263">According further to the third embodiment, when determining whether the upper limit setting conditions have been satisfied, the CPU <b>321</b> is configured to refer to the width and the conveyance direction length of the document, but the present technique is not limited to this example. For example, the CPU <b>321</b> can be configured to determine that the document has low stackability and that the upper limit setting conditions are satisfied in a case where the thickness of the document is less than a predetermined thickness using a sensor for detecting a thickness of the document provided on the conveyance path <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0264">When this configuration is adopted, a document of a first type whose number of continuously dischargeable sheets is limited to a predetermined number of sheets is set as a document having a low stackability in the sheet discharge tray <b>10</b> since the document is thinner than the document of the second type and easily crumpled, folded, and curled. The type of the document determined to have a thickness less than the predetermined thickness constitutes a specific type, and the CPU <b>321</b> that detects the thickness of the document and determines whether the thickness is less than a predetermined thickness constitutes a type detection unit.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0265">Further according to the third embodiment, the CPU <b>321</b> is configured to determine whether the upper limit setting conditions have been satisfied based on the width of the document and the magnification of the conveyance direction length of the document and document width, but the present technique is not limited thereto. For example, the CPU <b>321</b> can be configured to determine that the upper limit setting condition has been satisfied in a case where the document width being computed is less than a predetermined width. Further, if the conveyance direction length of the document being computed is less than a predetermined length, the CPU <b>321</b> can be configured to determine that the upper limit setting conditions have been satisfied.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0266">Embodiment(s) of the present invention can also be realized by a computer of a system or apparatus that reads out and executes computer executable instructions (e.g., one or more programs) recorded on a storage medium (which may also be referred to more fully as a &#x2018;non-transitory computer-readable storage medium&#x2019;) to perform the functions of one or more of the above-described embodiment(s) and/or that includes one or more circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) for performing the functions of one or more of the above-described embodiment(s), and by a method performed by the computer of the system or apparatus by, for example, reading out and executing the computer executable instructions from the storage medium to perform the functions of one or more of the above-described embodiment(s) and/or controlling the one or more circuits to perform the functions of one or more of the above-described embodiment(s).
