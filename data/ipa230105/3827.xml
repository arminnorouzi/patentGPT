If the condition 1 or 2 is satisfied, the location of the radio <b>2</b><i>a </i>may be re-estimated.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0059">If location estimation is performed using information from the other radio <b>2</b> that does not satisfy the condition 1 or 2, the reliability of location estimation may be lower than when location estimation information from the other radio <b>2</b> is not used. For example, if the errors in the location estimation results for the other radio <b>2</b> are significant, when the location estimation results for the other radio <b>2</b> are used and thus the errors in the location estimation use the location estimation results, the location estimation reliability may be even lower. The same is true if the received signal strength in relation to the other radio <b>2</b> is low.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0060">If the reliability of the location estimation for the radio <b>2</b><i>a </i>in Step <b>104</b> is greater than or equal to the threshold (S<b>104</b>/No) and there is no other radio <b>2</b> that can be used for location estimation in Step <b>105</b> (S<b>105</b>/No), the location information server <b>10</b> adopts the results of estimation made in Step <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0061">As described above, in this embodiment, in the case where the location of a radio is estimated referring to the received signal strengths of the beacon signals received from the transmitters, if the reliability of the location estimation is low, the location estimation is redone using information from the other radio that satisfies predetermined conditions. This improves the reliability of location estimation and enables more accurate location estimation. In addition, clarifying the conditions for the other radio to be used for location estimation prevents the reliability of location estimation from conversely becoming low.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0062">In the aforementioned embodiment, the top three highest received signal strengths are used for location estimation, but not necessarily top three but top four or five, that is, three or more received signal strengths may be used for location estimation.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0063">In the aforementioned embodiment, the reliability of location estimation is evaluated referring to the third highest received signal strength, but the reliability may be evaluated in other ways. For example, it may be evaluated based on the sum or average of the top three received signal strengths to be used, or the variation of received signal strength, or even a combination thereof. For example, the reliability of evaluation based on the variation of received signal strength becomes lower as the difference of received signal strength between signals or the amount of variation between received signal strengths over time becomes greater.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0064">Information from multiple other radios may be used for location estimation. For example, if there are three or more other radios that satisfy the conditions 1 and 2 and can be used for location estimation, the location may be estimated only using the location estimation information from those other radios and the received signal strengths in relation to other radios, without using received signal strengths from the transmitters <b>3</b>.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0065">In Embodiment 1, an example is given of a system that estimates the location of a receiver based on the received signal strengths received at the receiver in an environment where a plurality of transmitters are installed.
