An electric work machine includes a stator, a rotor rotatable about a rotation axis, magnetic sensors, a sensor board supporting the magnetic sensors, and an output unit drivable by the rotor. The stator includes a stator core, an insulator, and coils including first-, second-, and third-phase coils. The rotor includes a rotor core and magnets fixed to the rotor core. The magnetic sensors detect the magnets and include, in a circumferential direction, a first magnetic sensor aligned with at least a portion of a first coil pair, a second magnetic sensor aligned with

This allows the magnetic sensors <b>51</b> to be less susceptible to the magnetic field from the coils <b>33</b>. The magnetic sensors <b>51</b> can thus accurately detect the magnetic flux of the magnets <b>13</b>. Additionally, the motor <b>4</b> is controlled in accordance with the angle of advance, thus reducing a delay in the control of the motor <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0273">In the embodiment, the two coils C1 and C2 in the first coil pair P<b>1</b><i>a </i>are connected to each other in series and formed with the single wire <b>90</b>.

With the switching circuit <b>104</b> inverting the high-level detection signal and the low-level detection signal to be input into the controller <b>100</b> from the magnetic sensor <b>51</b>V, the controller <b>100</b> receives the detection signals that are apparently the same as those from the magnetic sensors <b>51</b>U, <b>51</b>V, and <b>51</b>W under the magnetic field in the same direction.
