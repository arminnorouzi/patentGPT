The system includes a pump, a controller for controlling the speed of the pump and one or more vibration sensors (such as an accelerometer) to measure vibration. The controller receives input about the vibration of the pump or one or more pump components, and possibly other data, such as the temperature of the molten metal, and/or the depth of the molten metal, ad/or parameters related to the operation of the pump. The controller analyzes the one or more inputs to vary the speed of the pump, turn the pump off, and/or send a communication to an operator.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="169.50mm" wi="134.70mm" file="US20230001474A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="183.39mm" wi="136.74mm" file="US20230001474A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="110.57mm" wi="107.27mm" file="US20230001474A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="122.77mm" wi="129.62mm" file="US20230001474A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="113.96mm" wi="123.95mm" file="US20230001474A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="214.04mm" wi="155.19mm" file="US20230001474A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="201.17mm" wi="148.00mm" file="US20230001474A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="116.16mm" wi="137.24mm" file="US20230001474A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="197.10mm" wi="154.09mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230001474A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="195.83mm" wi="145.37mm" file="US20230001474A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser.

The term &#x201c;gas&#x201d; means any gas or combination of gases, including argon, nitrogen, chlorine, fluorine, Freon, and helium, which are released into molten metal.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Known molten-metal pumps include a pump base (also called a housing or casing), one or more inlets (an inlet being an opening in the housing to allow molten metal to enter a pump chamber), a pump chamber of any suitable configuration, which is an open area formed within the housing, and a discharge, which is a channel or conduit of any structure or type communicating with the pump chamber (in an axial pump the chamber and discharge may be the same structure or different areas of the same structure) leading from the pump chamber to an outlet, which is an opening formed in the exterior of the housing through which molten metal exits the casing. An impeller, also called a rotor, is mounted in the pump chamber and is connected to a drive system. The drive shaft is typically an impeller shaft connected to one end of a motor shaft, and the other end of the drive shaft is connected to an impeller. Often, the impeller (or rotor) shaft is comprised of graphite and/or ceramic, the motor shaft is comprised of steel, and the two are connected by a coupling. As the motor turns the drive shaft, the drive shaft turns the impeller and the impeller pushes molten metal out of the pump chamber, through the discharge, out of the outlet and into the molten metal bath. Most molten metal pumps are gravity fed, wherein gravity forces molten metal through the inlet and into the pump chamber as the impeller pushes molten metal out of the pump chamber. Other molten metal pumps do not include a base or support posts and are sized to fit into a structure by which molten metal is pumped. Most pumps have a metal platform, or super structure, that is either supported by a plurality of support posts attached to the pump base, or unsupported if there is no base. The motor is positioned on the superstructure if a superstructure is used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This application incorporates by reference the portions of the following publications that are not inconsistent with this disclosure: U.S. Pat.

Circulation pumps are used to circulate the molten metal within a bath, thereby generally equalizing the temperature of the molten metal. Circulation pumps may be used in any vessel, such as in a reverbatory furnace having an external well. The well is usually an extension of the charging well, in which scrap metal is charged (i.e., added).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Standard transfer pumps are generally used to transfer molten metal from one structure to another structure such as a ladle or another furnace. A standard transfer pump has a riser tube connected to a pump discharge and supported by the superstructure. As molten metal is pumped it is pushed up the riser tube (sometimes called a metal-transfer conduit) and out of the riser tube, which generally has an elbow at its upper end, so molten metal is released into a different vessel from which the pump is positioned.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Gas-release pumps, such as gas-injection pumps, circulate molten metal while introducing a gas into the molten metal. In the purification of molten metals, particularly aluminum, it is frequently desired to remove dissolved gases such as hydrogen, or dissolved metals, such as magnesium. As is known by those skilled in the art, the removing of dissolved gas is known as &#x201c;degassing&#x201d; while the removal of magnesium is known as &#x201c;demagging.&#x201d; Gas-release pumps may be used for either of both of these purposes or for any other application for which it is desirable to introduce gas into molten metal.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Gas-release pumps generally include a gas-transfer conduit having a first end that is connected to a gas source and a second end submerged in the molten metal bath. Gas is introduced into the first end and is released from the second end into the molten metal. The gas may be released downstream of the pump chamber into either the pump discharge or a metal-transfer conduit extending from the discharge, or into a stream of molten metal exiting either the discharge or the metal-transfer conduit. Alternatively, gas may be released into the pump chamber or upstream of the pump chamber at a position where molten metal enters the pump chamber. The gas may also be released into any suitable location in a molten metal bath.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Molten metal pump casings and rotors often employ a bearing system comprising ceramic rings wherein there are one or more rings on the rotor that align with rings in the pump chamber (such as rings at the inlet and outlet) when the rotor is placed in the pump chamber. The purpose of the bearing system is to reduce damage to the soft, graphite components, particularly the rotor and pump base, during pump operation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Generally, a degasser (also called a rotary degasser) includes (1) an impeller shaft having a first end, a second end and a passage for transferring gas, (2) an impeller, and (3) a drive source for rotating the impeller shaft and the impeller. The first end of the impeller shaft is connected to the drive source and to a gas source and the second end is connected to the impeller.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Generally, a scrap melter includes an impeller affixed to an end of a drive shaft, and a drive source attached to the other end of the drive shaft for rotating the shaft and the impeller. The movement of the impeller draws molten metal and scrap metal downward into the molten metal bath in order to melt the scrap. A circulation pump is preferably used in conjunction with the scrap melter to circulate the molten metal in order to maintain a relatively constant temperature within the molten metal.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The materials forming the components that contact the molten metal bath should remain relatively stable in the bath. Structural refractory materials, such as graphite or ceramics, that are resistant to disintegration by corrosive attack from the molten metal may be used. As used herein &#x201c;ceramics&#x201d; or &#x201c;ceramic&#x201d; refers to any oxidized metal (including silicon) or carbon-based material, excluding graphite, or other ceramic material capable of being used in the environment of a molten metal bath. &#x201c;Graphite&#x201d; means any type of graphite, whether or not chemically treated. Graphite is particularly suitable for being formed into pump components because it is (a) soft and relatively easy to machine, (b) not as brittle as ceramics and less prone to breakage, and (c) less expensive than ceramics.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Ceramic, however, is more resistant to corrosion by molten aluminum than graphite. It would therefore be advantageous to develop vertical members used in a molten metal device that are comprised of ceramic, but less costly than solid ceramic members, and less prone to breakage than normal ceramic.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A smart molten metal pump system and method is one that automatically controls the operating speed of the pump rather than requiring an operator to control the speed. An operator can, however, override or turn off the system and manually control the pumping if desired.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The system includes a pump, a controller for controlling the speed of the pump, and one or more of: (1) one or more thermocouples (which could be any device for measuring temperature), (2) one or more devices (referred to herein sometimes as &#x201c;depth device&#x201d;), such as a laser, to measure the depth of molten metal in one or more structures, and (3) one or more vibration sensors, such as an accelerometer, to measure vibration. The controller receives input (or &#x201c;communications&#x201d;) from the thermocouple(s) about the temperature of the molten metal at one or more locations, and/or from the depth device(s) about the depth of the molten metal at one or more locations, and/or from the vibration sensor about the vibration of the pump, or of one or more pump components. The controller may also receive inputs about one or more of: the pump speed, load, length of time the pump has been operating, prior maintenance performed on the pump, and the amount of molten metal in structures, such as a launder, mold, or other vessel, adjacent or in communication with the vessel in which the pump is positioned. The controller analyzes the one or more inputs to vary the speed of the pump, to turn the pump off, and/or send messages to a human monitor or operator.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The thermocouple(s) is preferably positioned at a location under the surface of the molten metal in the vessel in which the molten metal pump is positioned. The thermocouple should not be directly exposed to the molten metal but should still accurately measure the temperature of the molten metal. The thermocouple may be positioned in a support post, pump base, rotor, or rotor shaft of the molten metal pump and housed so that it is not directly exposed to molten metal. Alternatively, the thermocouple could be positioned remote to the molten metal pump and, regardless of where it is located, communicate through a wired or wireless connection with the controller.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The device to measure the depth of the molten metal may be a laser that is positioned on a superstructure (also called a motor support or platform) of the molten metal pump, which is above the molten metal in the vessel in which the pump is positioned. Alternatively, the laser may be remote to the molten metal pump and, regardless of where it is located, communicate through a wired or wireless connection with the controller.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The vibration sensor may be an accelerometer. The vibration sensor may be positioned at any suitable location, such as in or on a support post, pump base, rotor, rotor shaft, motor shaft, superstructure, or motor of the molten metal pump. The vibration sensor should be positioned or housed so that it is not directly exposed to molten metal. The vibration sensor may communicate through a wired or wireless connection with the controller.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">All the pump information can optionally be shared to a user's computer or hand-held electronic device, so the user can view it at his/her office, at home, or any remote location. The pump operational and input information can also be stored over time, for troubleshooting the pump, the vessel in which the pump operates, and/or the operational system and method used at the processing facility. In addition, software can make it possible for the pump manufacturer to remotely access the controller in order to troubleshoot or modify the pump's operation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The controller may be positioned on the superstructure or be remote to the pump and communicate through a wired or wireless connection with the pump.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front, perspective view of a pump for pumping molten metal according to this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a partial, cross-sectional view of a pump base that may be used with the pump of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>is a top, perspective view of a pump base that may be used with the pump of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a top, perspective view of a rotor according to this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional side view of an exemplary system according to this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> showing the level of molten metal in the furnace being increased.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top view of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a partial, cross-sectional side view of an exemplary system according to this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a partial, cross-sectional side view of an exemplary system according to this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a front, partial perspective view of an exemplary system according to this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is schematic representation of an exemplary system according to this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and represents different levels of molten metal in the vessel.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> in which the level of molten metal has decreased to a minimum level.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a controller panel that may be used to control a pump used in a system according to this disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning now to the figures, wherein the purpose is to describe an embodiment of this disclosure and not to limit same, a smart molten metal pump system <b>10</b> can include a molten metal circulation pump, gas-injection (or gas-release) pump, or transfer pump. Currently, most molten metal pumps use a variable frequency drive (&#x201c;VFD&#x201d;) to control the speed of the pump. An operator controls the pump speed based on observing various operating parameters.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A smart pump system <b>10</b> as disclosed uses a program logic controller (&#x201c;PLC&#x201d; or &#x201c;controller&#x201d;) <b>170</b> and human machine interface (&#x201c;HMI&#x201d;) for additional functionality and feedback. It optionally utilizes SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) hardware/software with a GE IFIX <b>75</b> tag for remote monitoring of the pump <b>22</b>, such as from an office at an aluminum processing facility.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A computer <b>500</b> for accessing and monitoring data received by the controller <b>170</b>, and/or controlling the pump <b>22</b>, may be located at an operator's location, such as at an office at the processing facility. The controller <b>170</b> may also be accessible by a hand-held device <b>510</b> such as a cellular phone. Further, the controller <b>170</b> may also be accessible by a computer <b>520</b> at the pump manufacturer's facility. Any suitable wired or wireless connection between a computer <b>500</b>, hand-held device <b>510</b>, manufacturer's computer <b>520</b>, and the controller, such as an Ethernet connection, may be utilized. The pump's operational and input information can also be stored over time for troubleshooting: the pump <b>22</b>, the vessel in which the pump <b>22</b> operates, other vessels, and/or the operational system and method used at the processing facility in which the pump <b>22</b> is located.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The measured inputs (or &#x201c;inputs&#x201d;) to the controller <b>170</b> are one or more of: (1) the molten metal temperature in one or more vessels (such as the furnace pump well, a launder and/or a ladle); (2) the depth (or level) of the molten metal in one or more of the afore-mentioned vessels, which could be measured in any suitable manner, such as by a laser measuring device or float; (3) the vibration of the pump <b>22</b>, or of a pump component (such as the drive shaft <b>42</b> or rotor <b>100</b>), by a vibration sensor at any suitable location on the pump; (4) the weight of molten metal in a structure, such as a mold or ladle; and (5) pump speed, pump load, and other information. The controller <b>170</b> may also include the date the pump <b>22</b> was installed and maintenance history for the pump <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The controller <b>170</b> may control the speed of the pump <b>22</b>, turn the pump <b>22</b> on, turn the pump <b>22</b> off, and/or send a signal to an operator, based on one or more of the measured inputs. For example, if shaft <b>42</b> breaks, a vibration sensor would detect it and turn the pump <b>22</b> off. The controller <b>170</b> can also be programmed to develop a relationship between two or more of the inputs, e.g., two or more of: temperature of the molten metal, level of the molten metal, vibration, speed of the pump, and pump load.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When a furnace or other vessel is charging (which means adding solid aluminum to the molten metal in a vessel), or when the molten metal temperature is relatively low or dropping in a vessel, the pump <b>22</b> should generally run faster to increase the solid metal melt rate and/or molten metal mixing rate. The pump <b>22</b> can be slowed when the measured temperature is proper and/or a vessel is not being charged with solid aluminum. Utilizing a slower speed when a higher speed is not necessary increases the life of pump components such as the rotor shaft <b>42</b> and rotor <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Some benefits of the teachings of this disclosure are one or more of: (1) increased production from an existing molten metal processing vessel; (2) increased solid metal melting efficiency; (3) more uniform temperature distribution in a vessel; (4) longer component life for the pump; and (5) less time required of a human operator.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thermocouples in the drawings are designated by the letter &#x201c;T&#x201d; followed by a numeral.
