These devices are connected to controller area network (CAN) <b>17</b>, which is an in-vehicle network, and communicably connected to ECU <b>11</b>. Note that on-board device <b>1</b> includes, in addition to those devices, a car navigation system, audio equipment, an inverter, a motor, and auxiliary equipment, for example.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">ECU <b>11</b> is an electronic control unit that collects vehicle information from GPS module <b>12</b>, ACC switch <b>13</b>, sensor <b>14</b>, and image capture <b>15</b>, for example, and performs various control processes related to predetermined functions of vehicle <b>100</b>. ECU <b>11</b> is, for example, a motor ECU, hybrid ECU, engine ECU, and the like. The vehicle information includes, for example, vehicle position information, speed information, vehicle status information, and captured image information. The vehicle position information is information indicating the current position of vehicle <b>100</b>, and is, for example, information indicating the latitude and longitude at which vehicle <b>100</b> is traveling. The vehicle position information is transmitted from, for example, GPS module <b>12</b> and the car navigation system. The speed information is information indicating the current speed of vehicle <b>100</b> transmitted from a vehicle speed sensor. The vehicle status information is, for example, a signal indicating whether ACC switch <b>13</b> is ON or OFF. In addition to this, the vehicle status information includes a windshield wiper operation status, defogger status, accelerator position, brake depression, steering volume of the steering wheel, and information obtained from advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). The ADAS is a system that supports a driver's driving operation in order to enhance the convenience of road traffic. The captured image information is information indicating contents of an image captured by image capture <b>15</b>. The captured image information includes time information indicating the time of image generation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">GPS module <b>12</b> receives a GPS signal transmitted from satellite, measures the position of vehicle <b>100</b> on which GPS module <b>12</b> is mounted, and inputs the vehicle position information, which is the positioning result, to ECU <b>11</b> through CAN <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">ACC switch <b>13</b> is a switch that turns on and off accessory power supply of vehicle <b>100</b> in response to an operation of an occupant. For example, ACC switch <b>13</b> turns on and off the accessory power supply in response to an operation to a power switch provided on an instrument panel near the steering wheel of the driver's seat in the vehicle compartment. The power switch is, for example, a button switch for operating an ignition (not illustrated). An output signal of ACC switch <b>13</b> is exemplary information indicating the start and stop of vehicle <b>100</b>. To be more specific, when the output signal of ACC switch <b>13</b> turns an ON signal from an OFF signal, it indicates the start of vehicle <b>100</b>, and when the output signal of ACC switch <b>13</b> turns the OFF signal from the ON signal, it indicates the stop of vehicle <b>100</b>. ACC switch <b>13</b> is communicatively connected to ECU <b>11</b>, for example, through CAN <b>17</b>, and the status signal (ON signal/OFF signal) is transmitted to ECU <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Sensor <b>14</b> is, for example, a sensor detecting a voltage applied to the inverter, a sensor detecting a voltage applied to the motor, a sensor detecting a vehicle speed, a sensor detecting an accelerator position, a sensor detecting a steering volume of the steering wheel, and a sensor detecting a brake operation amount. In addition, sensor <b>14</b> may include, for example, an acceleration sensor detecting acceleration of vehicle <b>100</b>, and an angular velocity sensor (gyroscope) detecting angular velocity of vehicle <b>100</b>. Detection information outputted from sensor <b>14</b> is taken into ECU <b>11</b> through CAN <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Image capture <b>15</b> is a camera including an image sensor such as a charge coupled device (CCD) and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS). Image capture <b>15</b> includes, for example, an inside image capture that captures an image of the inside of vehicle <b>100</b> and an outside image capture that captures an image of the outside of vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The inside image capture is placed at a position where faces of occupants of a driver's seat, a passenger's seat, a rear seat of vehicle <b>100</b>, for example, can be captured. Such a position includes, for example, a dashboard of vehicle <b>100</b>, an instrument panel of the driver's seat, and the ceiling of vehicle <b>100</b>. Vehicle <b>100</b> is not necessarily provided with a single inside image capture, and may be provided with a plurality of inside image captures. The inside image capture outputs captured image information indicating a captured inside image of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The outside image capture may be an omni-directional camera that captures an image of the scenery around the vehicle, and a panoramic camera, for example. The scenery around the vehicle is, for example, the scenery in front of vehicle <b>100</b>, the scenery on the side of vehicle <b>100</b> (driver's seat door side of vehicle <b>100</b> or passenger's seat door side of vehicle <b>100</b>), and the scenery behind vehicle <b>100</b>. The scenery includes, for example, a road on which the vehicle is traveling, an object present on the road, a sidewalk facing the road, and an object present on the sidewalk. The object present on the road is, for example, a vehicle, building, structure (advertisement, road sign, traffic light, telegraph pole, etc.), person, and animal. The object present on the sidewalk is, for example, a pedestrian, animal, bicycle, structure, and fallen object. The outside image capture is placed at a position where the scenery outside the vehicle can be captured, for example. Such a position includes a front grille, side mirror, ceiling, and rear bumper, for example. The outside image capture outputs captured image information indicating a captured outside image of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Display <b>16</b> is, for example, an on-board meter panel provided in front of the driver's seat, and a head-up display that displays an image on the windshield.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, an exemplary hardware configuration of the ECU will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the exemplary hardware configuration of the ECU.

Note that the density or type of the color may be changed in gradation. The gradation indicates that a color tone changes continuously according to the traveling condition or surrounding environment of vehicle <b>100</b>.

The line of sight to the upper speed zone of speedometer <b>61</b> can be determined by analyzing an image captured by an inside image capture (e.g., stereo camera) to determine the line-of-sight direction (line-of-sight vector) and giving a starting point based on the eye position of the driver to the line-of-sight direction. To be more specific, image processor <b>112</b> identifies the eye area from a three-dimensional image of the driver's face captured by the stereo camera, stereoscopically views the eye shape, and determines the eye center coordinates from the curvature. Further, image processor <b>112</b> specifies the black eye (pupil) area from the eye area to determine the black eye center coordinates, and determines the direction from the eye center coordinates to the black eye center coordinates as the line-of-sight direction (line-of-sight vector).

In addition, displaying in this manner prevents the display pattern of the image of speedometer <b>61</b> from being frequently switched according to the change in the vehicle speed even when the vehicle speed fluctuates, thereby preventing deterioration of the visibility of speedometer <b>61</b> due to the change in the display pattern.

Further, in a case where the display pattern is changed in this manner, the positions of the first speed zone and second speed zone, and the tilt of needle <b>61</b><i>a </i>, for example, are not changed before and after the change of the display images; accordingly, it is easier to see speedometer <b>61</b>. Note that this change of the display pattern is particularly useful when the circular rim section of steering wheel <b>50</b> has a large gap inside.

For example, display pattern changer <b>120</b> reads, from display information storage <b>116</b>, image information corresponding to the color tone of the surrounding environment of vehicle <b>100</b> in clear weather according to the input of color tone information from image processor <b>112</b>, and configures, to speedometer <b>61</b>, speed background color <b>65</b> of speedometer <b>61</b> as illustrated on the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> based on the image information. Background color <b>65</b> in this case is configured to be blue, for example. The change of speed background color <b>65</b> of speedometer <b>61</b> to blue reduces the effect of sunlight even in a situation where it is difficult for a driver to see the white color due to strong sunlight shining through a windshield of vehicle <b>100</b> in the morning, for example, thereby greatly improving the visibility of speedometer <b>61</b>. Note that the brightness of speedometer <b>61</b> can be controlled using the conventional art, but when the red light of sunset, for example, enters the driver's eyes or is reflected on speedometer <b>61</b>, it is still difficult to see the red part of speedometer <b>61</b> by only controlling the brightness.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Information processing apparatus <b>110</b> according to the present embodiment can change the color of speedometer <b>61</b> in accordance with the change in the surrounding environment of vehicle <b>100</b>, thus improving the visibility of speedometer <b>61</b> and assisting driver's driving. It is particularly useful for elderly drivers who have difficulty in recognizing a color difference.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition to the weather, display pattern changer <b>120</b> may be configured to change the color of speedometer <b>61</b> in accordance with the time of day vehicle <b>100</b> travels. For example, strong sunlight possibly affects driving from 6:00 am to 8:00 am, and thus display pattern changer <b>120</b> may be configured to perform the above-described control (color change of speedometer <b>61</b>) in the time period and not to perform the above-described control except for the time period. Further, when sunlight temporarily becomes stronger due to a break in the clouds in cloudy weather, for example, display pattern changer <b>120</b> may be configured not to perform the above-described control until a predetermined time (about several minutes) elapses from the timing at which the strength of sunlight exceeds a predetermined level, and to perform the above-described control when the predetermined time has elapsed. This configuration prevents frequent color change of speedometer <b>61</b> according to the change in the surrounding environment of vehicle <b>100</b>, thereby preventing deterioration of the visibility.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In addition to the weather, display pattern changer <b>120</b> may also be configured to change the color of speedometer <b>61</b> in accordance with the attribute of an occupant of vehicle <b>100</b>. For example, display pattern changer <b>120</b> may be configured to perform the above-described control when the determination result of a face image by image processor <b>112</b> is inputted and the driver is determined to be an elderly person of a predetermined age or more based on the face image, and may be configured not to perform the above-described control when the driver is determined not to be an elderly person. This configuration improves the visibility of speedometer <b>61</b> for the elderly, and allows people other than the elderly to concentrate on driving without feeling troublesome to the color change.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Further, display pattern changer <b>120</b> may be configured to change the color of speedometer <b>61</b> when the color difference between the color of the surrounding environment of vehicle <b>100</b> and the color of speedometer <b>61</b> is lower than a predetermined value. For example, information on the color of the surrounding environment of the vehicle can be taken into display pattern changer <b>120</b> by image processor <b>112</b> analyzing a captured image of the surrounding environment of the vehicle. Display pattern changer <b>120</b> determines the color of the surrounding environment of the vehicle based on the information on the color of the surrounding environment of the vehicle and information on Munsell hue circle, and compares the determined color with the color configured to speedometer <b>61</b> (e.g., speed background color <b>65</b> of speedometer <b>61</b> described above). This makes it possible to determine whether the difference in color values (color difference) is lower than the predetermined value. For example, it is difficult to see speedometer <b>61</b> when the red light of sunset is similar to speed background color <b>65</b> of speedometer <b>61</b>, and thus display pattern changer <b>120</b> performs the above-described control when determining that the color difference is lower than the predetermined value. This prevents deterioration of the visibility of speedometer <b>61</b> due to the surrounding environment of vehicle <b>100</b> regardless of the age of the driver.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Display pattern changer <b>120</b> may change, instead of speed background color <b>65</b> of speedometer <b>61</b>, one of the color of the speeds of speedometer <b>61</b> (color of speed values of speedometer <b>61</b>), the color of the needle of speedometer <b>61</b>, and the color of all or a part of areas of the background of speedometer <b>61</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Further, display pattern changer <b>120</b> may change the color of speedometer <b>61</b> taking into account the user preferred display condition. For example, display pattern changer <b>120</b> may change the color so as to incorporate more blue for those who can see blue well, and more green for those who can see green well.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">(Method of Changing Display Pattern of Speedometer in Accordance with Traveling Mode)</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Next, a description will be given of examples of changing the display pattern of the speedometer in accordance with a traveling more with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates an actual vehicle speed while traveling in an autonomous driving mode and a virtual vehicle speed expected when the autonomous driving mode is switched to a manual driving mode.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">On speedometer <b>61</b> of vehicle <b>100</b> traveling in the autonomous driving mode, an image of needle <b>61</b><i>a </i><b>1</b> indicating the actual vehicle speed is displayed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. When the driving mode is switched from the autonomous driving mode to the manual driving mode in such vehicle <b>100</b> traveling in the autonomous driving mode, the vehicle speed sometimes significantly diverges before and after the switching.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">For example, even in a case where the current vehicle speed is 40 km/h, when the driving mode is switched from the autonomous driving mode to the manual driving mode while the accelerator pedal is strongly depressed and the vehicle speed corresponding to the accelerator position is 80 km/h, for example, there is a risk of a sudden increase in the vehicle speed and a rear-end collision with a vehicle ahead.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Also, for example, even in a case where the current vehicle speed is 100 km/h, when the driving mode is switched from the autonomous driving mode to the manual driving mode while a foot is just put on the accelerator pedal and the vehicle speed corresponding to the accelerator position is 10 km/h, for example, the vehicle speed suddenly drops and the distance between the vehicle and the following vehicle is shortened, which is dangerous.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In view of this, for example, in the prior art disclosed in Patent Literature (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No 2007-196809), a driving operation by a driver is compared with a driving operation determined to be optimal by an autonomous driving control apparatus from the timing at which the driver makes a request to cancel the autonomous driving until the manual driving takes over, and when it is determined that the driver can perform proper driving, it switches to the manual driving. In the prior art, however, it is impossible to (visually) grasp how far the operation amount of the driver is diverged from the current traveling state, and thus driver's fear of sudden acceleration or deceleration after switching to the manual driving cannot be dispelled. This causes a problem of not switching to the manual driving.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Considering the above, display pattern changer <b>120</b> according to the present embodiment inputs, for example, mode switching information from a mode switching switch that switches the driving mode, and displays the current vehicle speed on speedometer <b>61</b> when it is determined that the current driving mode is the autonomous driving mode based on the inputted mode switching information. In addition, display pattern changer <b>120</b> estimates the vehicle speed corresponding to the accelerator position based on the traveling information described above. For the estimation of the vehicle speed corresponding to the acceleration position, table information that associates the accelerator position with the vehicle speed is used, for example. Display pattern changer <b>120</b> reads image information of the needle for the vehicle speed corresponding to the estimated vehicle speed from display information storage <b>116</b>, and displays the image of needle <b>61</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> indicating the virtual vehicle speed on speedometer <b>61</b> in addition to the image of needle <b>61</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> indicating the actual vehicle speed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. This makes it possible to display, besides the vehicle speed during the autonomous driving, the vehicle speed that is expected when switched to the manual driving. Accordingly, the driver can confirm the difference between the current vehicle speed and the vehicle speed when switched to the manual driving, and when the speed difference is about 10 km/h, for example, the driver can switch the driving mode without adjusting the accelerator position. When the speed difference exceeds 10 km/h, the driver can switch the driving mode after reducing the speed difference by adjusting the accelerator position while looking at the image of needle <b>61</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> indicating the above-described virtual vehicle speed. Note that display pattern changer <b>120</b> may be configured not only to display the vehicle speed that is expected when switched to the manual driving, but also to display information on the expected vehicle speed, such as the difference from the vehicle speed during the autonomous driving and an alert indicating that the vehicle speed difference is too large.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Note that information processing apparatus <b>110</b> according to the present embodiment may be configured to display the display information displayed on on-board meter panel <b>60</b> on a head-up display and change the display pattern on the head-up display. In this case, the change of the display information can be implemented by controlling the optical path length, controlling the optical path direction, and the like. For example, when changing the display pattern of an image such as a speedometer displayed on the head-up display, display pattern changer <b>120</b> outputs a command to a head-up unit to control the operation of an optical system. The head-up unit includes an emitter and the optical system. The emitter is a projector that emits light. The optical system is a component that reflects the light emitted by the emitter and projects the light toward a predetermined area of the display provided on a windshield. The optical system is composed of, for example, a concave mirror, a plurality of lenses, a mirror, etc. The light emitted from the emitter is projected onto the display through the optical system, and this forms a virtual image of the speedometer, for example, in front of the windshield.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">While various embodiments have been described with reference to the drawings herein above, the present disclosure is obviously not limited to these examples.
