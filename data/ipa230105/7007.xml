For example, the proximity detection module <b>204</b> may detect when a personal computing device <b>102</b> moves into a proximity detection range of the multiuser device <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, the proximity detection module <b>204</b> may be configured to analyze a signal (e.g., a radio frequency (RF) signal) transmitted by the personal computing device <b>102</b> and received by the multiuser device <b>108</b>. The proximity detection module <b>204</b> may process the received signal and determine the signal strength to determine proximity and/or location of the personal computing device <b>102</b> relative to the multiuser device <b>108</b>. Based on a determination that the personal computing device <b>102</b> is within the proximity detection range of the multiuser device <b>108</b>, the multiuser device <b>108</b> may analyze the signature (e.g., RF signature) of the personal computing device <b>102</b> to determine the wireless communications protocol(s) used by that personal computing device <b>102</b>. If there is compatibility with the multiuser device <b>108</b>, the multiuser device <b>108</b> may establish a communications link with the personal computing device <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the proximity detection module <b>204</b> may determine that the personal computing device <b>102</b> is within the proximity detection range of the multiuser device <b>108</b> by detecting that the personal computing device <b>102</b> has established a communication link with a local network to which the multiuser device <b>108</b> is connected to. In some embodiments, the personal computing device <b>102</b> may be associated with one or more user profiles managed by the user profile module <b>206</b>, as will be described in further detail below. In some embodiments, the proximity detection module <b>204</b> may determine that the personal computing device <b>102</b> is within the predetermined proximity detection range by detecting a message (e.g., text message, SMS message, etc.) transmitted by the personal computing device <b>102</b> and received by the multiuser device <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The user profile module <b>206</b> may be configured to manage one or more user profiles associated with the multiuser device <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, the user profile module <b>206</b> may receive, retrieve, and/or store user profiles associated with the multiuser device <b>108</b>. For example, in instances in which the multiuser device <b>108</b> is a washing machine, one or more user profiles associated with the washing machine may include one or more preferred settings for the washing machine. As another example, in instances in which the multiuser device <b>108</b> is a television with an application that provides an online streaming service, one or more user profiles associated with the application may include one or more preferred settings (e.g., recommended movies and shows, previously watches movies and shows, etc.) for the application. The one or more user profiles managed by the user profile module <b>206</b> may be stored in a data store of the shared profile management system <b>110</b> and/or the data store <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A user may attempt to access a multiuser device <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, the user may attempt to directly access the multiuser device <b>108</b>. In other embodiments, the user may attempt to access the multiuser device <b>108</b> via the personal computing device <b>102</b>. For example, the personal computing device <b>102</b> may be brought within a predetermined proximity detection range of the multiuser device <b>108</b>. This may trigger the user profile module <b>206</b> to retrieve one or more user profiles associated with the multiuser device <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, the user profile module <b>206</b> may retrieve one or more user profiles associated with the detected personal computing device <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, one primary shared user profile may be associated with the multiuser device <b>108</b>. In such embodiments, the primary shared profile may include one or more specific user profiles. For example, the primary shared user profile may be a profile for a family sharing the multiuser device <b>108</b> and the one or more specific user profiles may be the user profiles for each family member. In some embodiments, the user profile module <b>206</b> may display the primary shared user profile including the one or more specific user profiles as a result of detecting that a user is attempting to access the multiuser device <b>108</b>, and the user may attempt to activate a specific user profile.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A user may be required to perform an authentication process in order to activate one of the retrieved one or more user profiles associated with the multiuser device <b>108</b>, as will be described in further detail below. For example, the user may be required to perform an authentication process to activate a specific user profile as described above. In some embodiments, the user profile module <b>206</b> may additionally and/or alternatively be configured to prompt the user to generate a new user profile. In such embodiments, the user may provide biometric information for authentication as will be described in further detail below. The generated new user profile module along with the provided biometric information may be stored in the data store of the shared profile management system <b>110</b> and/or the data store <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the user profile module <b>206</b> may bind a specific user profile to a personal computing device <b>102</b>. For example, a user may attempt to activate a specific user profile as described above. Specifically, the specific user profile may be one of a plurality of specific user profiles associated with the personal computing device <b>102</b> and displayed to the user based on, for example, a detection that the personal computing device <b>102</b> is within a predetermined proximity detection range of a multiuser device <b>108</b>. Based on a determination that the user has successfully performed an authentication process to activate the specific user profile, the user profile module <b>206</b> may bind the activated specific user profile to the personal computing device <b>102</b> (hereinafter referred to as a personal computing device and specific user profile pairing). The personal computing device and specific user profile pairing may be stored in the data store of the shared profile management system and/or the data store <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, a user using the bound personal computing device may now longer be required to come within the predetermined proximity detection range of the multiuser device <b>108</b> to activate the bound specific user profile on the multiuser device <b>108</b>. For example, the user may perform an authentication process to activate the bound specific user profile on the multiuser device <b>108</b> even when the bound personal computing device is not brought within the predetermined proximity detection range of the multiuser device <b>108</b>.
