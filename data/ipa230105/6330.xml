For example, an antenna for receiving wireless signals may be embedded within an integrated circuit in a semiconductor die, such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The antenna may be configured to receive a wireless signal at a predefined frequency, and may not receive wireless signals at other frequencies. The wireless signal received by the antenna may include a control signal that may be used to control a function of the integrated circuit. For example, the integrated circuit may include a control circuit connected to the antenna by interconnects, and the control circuit may be configured to implement logic to control a function of the integrated circuit responsive to the received control signal. Illustratively, the control circuit may enable or disable, or otherwise modify, one or more functions of the circuit responsive to the received control signal.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some examples, the embedded antenna and its interconnects to control circuit(s) may be hard wired during fabrication of the semiconductor die at the foundry by patterning one or more metal layers of the semiconductor die, e.g., of the FPGA or ASIC. In other examples, the antenna and its interconnects to control circuit(s) may be programmed into configurable logic blocks (CLBs) of an FPGA via programmable interconnects, and optionally may be reprogrammable. The integrated circuit may, but need not necessarily, further include an embedded analog front-end circuit and/or an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuit, which may be utilized to prepare an analog signal from the embedded antenna to a digital signal for use by other functional elements (e.g., logic devices and/or storage devices) of the integrated circuit. Embedding the antenna, the antenna's interconnects to control circuit(s), and associated circuitry (such as the front-end circuit and/or ADC) in the integrated circuit may obviate the need for external antennas, interconnects, associated circuitry, and the like, and thus may reduce weight and complexity of a chipset that includes the integrated circuit. Additionally, the embedded antenna, interconnects, and associated circuitry may be incorporated within the integrated circuit in a manner that is physically obfuscated and, thus, may enhance hardware security aspects of the circuit. For example, embedding the antenna within the semiconductor die may inhibit reverse engineering or unauthorized use.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Implantation of an antenna within an integrated circuit in accordance with aspects of this disclosure may provide numerous advantages over conventional systems that include external antennas. For example, in some embodiments, an embedded antenna within the integrated circuit may provide more compact form factors and/or may permit a reduction of weight of equipment that includes such circuitry. In addition or in other embodiments, the embedded antenna may permit the remote activation of the integrated circuitry and/or other types of remote control of the operation of such circuitry. Thus, in some implementations, the embedded antenna may be utilized as part of a dedicated receiver (e.g., an emergency receiver) assembled within circuitry of a satellite system, other types of spacecraft, and/or remotely located equipment. For another example, the embedded antenna may provide an obfuscated layer of hardware security, permitting or otherwise facilitating hardware security applications that may enhance protection against reverse engineering and/or unauthorized access and/or use; or that may permit wireless key loading.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates components of a system including an integrated circuit with an embedded antenna, according to some examples provided herein. The system <b>100</b> includes an integrated circuit <b>110</b> within a semiconductor die, e.g., including a solid substrate having patterned metal layers, patterned semiconductor layers, patterned insulating layers, and the like, disposed thereon. The integrated circuit <b>110</b> may be embodied in or may include, for example, a FPGA or an ASIC. In examples in which the integrated circuit <b>110</b> includes an ASIC, the ASIC may include hard-wired circuit components that are defined at the time of manufacture. In examples in which the integrated circuit includes an FPGA, the FPGA may include reprogrammable circuit components, such as CLBs, and programmable interconnects. Integrated circuit <b>110</b> may be implemented using any suitable semiconductor(s), such as silicon, gallium arsenide, silicon-germanium, gallium nitride, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Integrated circuit <b>110</b> includes a control circuit <b>120</b> and an embedded antenna <b>130</b> that are coupled to one another by at least one interconnect <b>131</b>. The embedded antenna <b>130</b>, control circuit <b>120</b>, and interconnect(s) <b>131</b> therebetween are formed in the same semiconductor die as one another, e.g., may be formed by elements that are disposed on the same solid substrate as one another, and may be packaged together, e.g., within ceramic packaging.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The control circuit <b>120</b> may be embodied in or may include one or more circuit components configured to control a function of the integrated circuit <b>110</b> responsive to the received control signal. The one or more components may permit or otherwise facilitate the implementation of a defined digital design that may provide at least part of the control circuit <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The embedded antenna <b>130</b> may include one or more metal layers that, together, provide an antenna configured to receive a wireless signal at a predefined frequency. One skilled in the art readily may select the particular shape and size of the embedded antenna <b>130</b> so as to resonate at a predefined frequency, e.g., a frequency between about 1 MHz and about 1000 MHz, e.g., between about 10 MHz and about 500 MHz, e.g., between about 50 MHz and about 150 MHz. The bandwidth of embedded antenna <b>130</b> may have any suitable value, e.g., may be about 1 MHz to about 100 MHz, or about 1 MHz to about 50 MHz, or about 1 MHz to about 20 MHz, or about 5 MHz to about 20 MHz, or about 10 MHz to about 20 MHz, or about 15 MHz. For example, the embedded antenna <b>130</b> may have one or more defined types, e.g., may include a directional antenna, a non-directional antenna, a monopole antenna, a dipole antenna, a folded-dipole antenna, a patch antenna, or the like, which are defined by one or more patterned metal layers of integrated circuit <b>110</b>. In one specific, nonlimiting example, embedded antenna <b>130</b> may include a monopole antenna. In nonlimiting examples, the embedded antenna <b>130</b> may have a length between about 1 &#x3bc;m and about 100 mm, e.g., between about 10 &#x3bc;mm and about 50 mm. The length of embedded antenna <b>130</b> may be wrapped around a plane that occupies a footprint defined by a footprint length and a footprint width. In nonlimiting examples, the embedded antenna may occupy a footprint of about 1 mm by 1 mm to about 1 cm by 1 cm. In nonlimiting examples, the embedded antenna <b>130</b> may have a width between about 10 nm and about 10 &#x3bc;m, e.g., between about 10 nm and about 500 nm. In nonlimiting examples, the embedded antenna <b>130</b> may have a thickness between about 1 nm and about 1 &#x3bc;m, e.g., between about 10 nm and about 500 nm. It will be appreciated that the particular metal(s) used, the dimensions of embedded antenna <b>130</b>, and the resonance frequency of the embedded antenna will depend on the particular foundry, node, and processes used to prepare the antenna.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the embedded antenna <b>130</b> may be electrically coupled and mechanically coupled to at least a portion of the control circuit <b>120</b> via one or more interconnects <b>131</b> which may be defined by one or more patterned metal layers of integrated circuit <b>110</b>. In some examples, the embedded antenna <b>130</b> and interconnect(s) <b>131</b> may be formed utilizing routing elements within the integrated circuit <b>110</b>, such as any suitable combination of vias, traces, metal pillars, routing metals, or other types of conductive interconnects that operatively couple the antenna <b>130</b> to control circuit <b>120</b>. Any suitable combination of such routing elements may extend vertically through the integrated circuit or may extend horizontally along the integrated circuit. As such, receive characteristics of the embedded antenna <b>130</b>, such as directionality, spectral response, operational bandwidth, and receive power, may be determined, at least in part, by the shape, length and orientation(s) of the conductive interconnect(s) or routing metal(s) utilized to fabricate the antenna.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, embedded antenna <b>130</b> may include, or may be formed by, a first patterned metal layer. The first patterned metal layer may be disposed over the control circuit <b>120</b>. Illustratively, the first patterned metal layer may be or include the top metal layer in the semiconductor die of integrated circuit <b>110</b>. Interconnect <b>131</b> may include, or may be formed by, a second patterned metal layer that is disposed over control circuit <b>120</b> and disposed under the first patterned metal layer, e.g., that includes patterned portions that extend vertically through integrated circuit <b>110</b>. In some examples, the patterned metal layer forming embedded antenna <b>130</b> may be provided in an FPGA or in an ASIC. Alternatively, when the integrated circuit <b>110</b> includes an FPGA, the embedded antenna <b>130</b> and interconnect <b>130</b> may be programmed into CLBs of the FPGA.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In contrast to conventional integrated circuits that utilize or otherwise leverage an external antenna, the embedded antenna <b>130</b> may permit wireless input to the control circuit <b>120</b> without reliance on input/output (I/O) pins or other types of I/O interfaces. In the example system <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, transmitter device <b>140</b> includes antenna <b>144</b> that transmits a control signal to embedded antenna <b>130</b> via wireless transmission path <b>141</b>. Antenna <b>144</b> may be configured so as to transmit the control signal at or about the predetermined frequency of embedded antenna <b>130</b>, e.g., at a frequency between about 50 MHz and about 1000 MHz, e.g., within the bandwidth of the embedded antenna at about the predetermined frequency. Antenna <b>144</b> may include a monopole antenna, or any other suitable type of antenna such as a directional antenna, a non-directional antenna, a dipole antenna, a folded-dipole antenna, a patch antenna, or the like. Antenna <b>144</b> may have any suitable length, e.g., of about 10 cm to about 100 cm, or about 20 cm to about 50 cm. Antenna <b>144</b> may transmit the control signal at sufficient power that the signal has sufficient power when received by embedded antenna <b>130</b> that the function of integrated circuit <b>110</b> may be controlled using it. In one purely illustrative example, the Friis transmission equation (1) below is used to calculate the received power Pr at embedded antenna <b>130</b>:</p><p id="p-0039" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Pr=Pt+Gt+Gr+20 log 10(wavelength/4*&#x3c0;*R) &#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0040" num="0000">where R is the distance between transmit antenna and receive antenna, Pt is transmit power, for example 100 W, Gt is transmit antenna gain, for example 3 dB, and Gr is the receive antenna gain, which is assumed to be approximately zero. For an example distance R of 9 m, Pr is 22 dBm, and for an example distance R of 3 m, Pr is 31 dBm.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0038">As such, embedded antenna <b>130</b> may receive the control signal and provide it to control circuit <b>120</b> via interconnect <b>131</b>. In comparison, if another external antenna (e.g., an antenna being used by a nefarious actor) attempts to transmit a control signal at a frequency other than the predetermined frequency (e.g., because the holder of the external antenna does not know the predetermined frequency) then embedded antenna <b>130</b> may not properly receive that control signal and therefore may not provide that control signal to control circuit <b>120</b> for use in controlling the function of the integrated circuit <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0039">The transmitter device <b>140</b> may be provided in any suitable platform. In one scenario, both the transmitter device <b>140</b> and integrated circuit <b>110</b> may be terrestrial. In other scenarios, the transmitter device <b>140</b> may be on board of a spacecraft that includes the integrated circuit <b>110</b>, or transmitter device <b>140</b> and integrated circuit <b>110</b> may be on different spacecraft. In yet other scenarios, the transmitter device <b>140</b> may be integrated within the integrated circuit <b>110</b> or within another IC. In other scenarios, the transmitter device <b>140</b> may be included in a circuit board (e.g., a printed circuit board (PCB), a motherboard, or the like) on which the integrated circuit <b>110</b> is mounted or in another circuit board. Antenna <b>144</b> of transmitter device <b>140</b> may transmit the control signal to embedded antenna <b>130</b> over any suitable radio channel, such as a wireless point-to-point communication channel (e.g., a BLUETOOTH&#xae; channel, a near-field communication (NFC) communication channel, and/or a channel for communication between radiofrequency identification (RFID) devices).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">The control signal that embedded antenna <b>130</b> receives, e.g., from antenna <b>144</b> of transmitter device <b>140</b>, may be used to control a function of integrated circuit <b>110</b>. Therefore, in some implementations, the embedded antenna <b>130</b> and the control circuit <b>120</b> may be considered to provide a dedicated receiver that may control the operation of the integrated circuit <b>110</b> using, at least in part, the control signal received wirelessly by the embedded antenna <b>130</b>. For example, the control signal may include a sequence of signals that control circuit <b>120</b> is configured to respond to appropriately. Transmitter device <b>140</b> and control circuit <b>120</b> may be programmable to define an appropriate unique or custom pattern for the control signal so as to help ensure that the pattern cannot be readily guessed by a third party trying to control a function of integrated circuit <b>110</b>. For example, the control signal may include encryption information (e.g., an encryption key). Control circuit <b>120</b> may apply the encryption key to the function of the integrated circuit <b>110</b>, e.g., so as to decrypt information that integrated circuit <b>110</b> may be generating or may store. In addition or in another example, the control signal may include an activation signal causing control circuit <b>120</b> to activate or deactivate one or more components of the integrated circuit <b>110</b> or a portion thereof, e.g., to activate or deactivate one or more elements of the control circuit <b>120</b> itself. Illustratively, the control signal may direct the control circuit <b>120</b> to the integrated circuit <b>110</b> or a portion thereof to transition from a low-power state (e.g., an OFF state) to a high-power state (e.g., an ON state); or may direct the control circuit <b>120</b> to the integrated circuit <b>110</b> or a portion thereof to transition from high-power state (e.g., an ON state) to a low-power state (e.g., an OFF state). Illustratively, the control signal may include a protocol for initiating or disabling remote inductive power transfer or charging; for example, integrated circuit <b>110</b> may be coupled to, or may include, functional elements (e.g., inductive coils) that control circuit <b>120</b> may activate or deactivate responsive to the control signal so as to cause integrated circuit <b>110</b> to begin or stop receiving or generating power using such functional elements.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0041">Additionally, or alternatively, the control signal may cause the control circuit <b>120</b> to alter an output of the integrated circuit <b>110</b> responsive to the control signal, e.g., so as to enable or disable the function of the integrated circuit <b>110</b>. For example, the control signal may include a first instruction that may direct or otherwise cause the control circuit <b>120</b> to transition integrated circuit <b>110</b> or a portion thereof to a first defined state (e.g., a locked state) in which defined functionality is unavailable (or locked) and the integrated circuit generates a first output which may be or include a null output, or an incorrect output. Alternatively, the integrated circuit may by default be in the first defined state without need for receiving the first instruction. Additionally, or alternatively, the control signal may include a second instruction that may direct or otherwise cause the control circuit <b>120</b> to transition integrated circuit <b>110</b> or a portion thereof to a second defined state (e.g., an unlocked state) and the integrated circuit generates a second output which may be or include a correct output. As such, the second instruction may cause or otherwise direct the unlocking of the integrated circuit <b>110</b> or the portion thereof wirelessly, without reliance on information received via any I/O pin(s) that may be included in the integrated circuit <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0042">Note that a nefarious entity attempting to obtain information from integrated circuit <b>110</b> by attempting to transmit a control signal at different frequencies that does not match the predetermined frequency of the embedded antenna, may receive an incorrect output from the integrated circuit at each of such frequencies. As such, the nefarious entity may be inhibited from identifying which frequency is correct, even if they search the entire relevant frequency space. Additionally, it will be appreciated that the embedded antenna <b>130</b> may be physically obfuscated within the integrated circuit <b>110</b>, thus mitigating or avoiding reverse-engineering issues and/or inspection attacks. In a scenario in which the integrated circuit <b>110</b> is embodied in or includes an ASIC, the embedded antenna <b>130</b> may be assembled underneath a metal fill layer and may traverse different metal layers. Such an assembly may obfuscate the embedded antenna <b>130</b> in case of de-capping or delayering of the ASIC. Similarly, in examples in which the integrated circuit <b>110</b> is embodied in or includes an FPGA, the embedded antenna <b>130</b> may be provided through CLBs of the FPGA and thus may be obfuscated in case of disassembly of the FPGA.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically illustrates components of another system including an integrated circuit with an embedded antenna, according to some examples provided herein.
