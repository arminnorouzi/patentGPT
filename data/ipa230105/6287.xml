An example of the secondary batter includes a nickel-cadmium battery, a nickel-metal hydride battery, a nickel-hydrogen battery, and a lithium secondary battery. Among them, the lithium secondary battery, which has operating voltage of 3.6 V or more, is used as a power supply of a portable electronic device, or is used for a high output hybrid automobile by connecting a plurality of lithium secondary batteries in series with each other. Since the lithium secondary battery has operating voltage three times higher than that of the nickel-cadmium battery or the nickel-metal hydride battery and is more excellent in view of energy density characteristics per unit weight than the nickel-cadmium battery or the nickel-metal hydride battery, the use of the lithium secondary battery has been rapidly increased.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A pouch-type secondary battery may be formed by surrounding an electrode assembly with a sheath as a case. At this time, sealing parts are formed by sealing the outermost portions of the case in which the electrode assembly is housed. When assembling the secondary battery module with the sealing parts protruding, a total volume of the secondary battery module is increased due to the sealing parts, such that the energy density of the secondary battery module may be lowered. Further, since the sealing parts surround outer peripheries of the electrode assembly, heat dissipation may be inhibited. For example, even if the secondary battery is disposed on a cooling plate for heat dissipation, the heat transfer from the electrode assembly to the cooling plate may not be smoothly performed due to the sealing parts.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">[Patent Document 1] Korean Patent Registration Publication No. 10-1520153 (registered May 7,

The polyurethane adhesive may be obtained by synthesizing polyol and a chain extender with a diisocyanate as well known in the art, and the chain extender used in the synthesis may be a diol or a diamine. Physical properties of the adhesive may be variously controlled by adjusting types or molecular weights of the chain extender, diisocyanate and a polyol monomer. The polyurethane adhesive that can be used in the embodiment of the present invention may have a viscosity in a range of 10000 to 15000 cps when measuring by a Brookfield rotational viscometer at a temperature of 120&#xb0; C. When adhering the folding part <b>23</b> by using the polyurethane adhesive having a viscosity within the above range, workability such as efficiency and result of operation are improved, and the shape of the adhesive (the adhesive member <b>30</b>) may be maintained during curing the adhesive. If the viscosity of the adhesive is out of the above range (i.e., if it is less than or exceeding the above range), it is difficult to maintain the shape of the adhesive during curing the adhesive, and the workability is deteriorated, and thereby causing a problem in manufacturing the secondary battery <b>10</b>. If necessary, the viscosity of the adhesive may be controlled by using a viscosity regulator. For example, when using a thixotropic agent etc., the viscosity of the adhesive may be increased, and when using a diluent or a dispersant, the viscosity of the adhesive may be reduced. The viscosity regulator may use a commonly known substance, and an amount of the viscosity regulator to be used is not particularly.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0072">In addition, when curing for 2 hours or more, the polyurethane adhesive has a peel-off strength of 3 kgf/in measured by a T-peel test, and a static shear holding time of 250 hours or more measured by a static shear test at a temperature 85&#xb0; C. and a humidity of at 85%.

Therefore, the polyurethane adhesive as the adhesive member <b>30</b> used in the embodiment of the present invention may be required to have a dielectric breakdown voltage for ensuring insulating properties. Preferably, the dielectric breakdown voltage measured according to ASTM D149 of the polyurethane adhesive according to the present example may be 5 to 20 kV/mm. More preferably, the dielectric breakdown voltage of the polyurethane adhesive according to the present example may be 8 to 15 kV/mm.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0074">The dielectric breakdown voltage required in the polyurethane adhesive of the present example may be ensured by mixing an insulation material with the polyurethane resin. The insulation material used for this purpose may be, for example, ceramic particles such as alumina, SiC, and ZnO.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0075">Further, since the polyurethane adhesive has a lower curing rate than that of an acrylic or epoxy resin, the adhesive member <b>30</b> may not be cured while the folding part <b>23</b> is brought into contact with the case <b>21</b> after injecting the adhesive member <b>30</b> into the folding part <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating the sealing part and a bottom part of the secondary battery according to the embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, the sealing parts <b>22</b> may be formed on three (3) sides of the electrode assembly <b>11</b> along the peripheries thereof.

The bottom part <b>24</b> may be formed at a portion below the portion in which the electrode tab is drawn out without sealing. Since the sealing part <b>22</b> is not formed on the bottom part <b>24</b> side, the space occupied by the sealing part <b>22</b> may be reduced.

Results thereof are indicated according to the following standards, wherein &#x2018;&#x2218;&#x2019; (good) denotes that both properties are satisfied. &#x2018;&#x394;&#x2019; (normal) denotes that one of both properties is satisfied, and &#x2018;&#xd7;&#x2019; (poor) denotes that both properties are not satisfied.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0105">The high temperature and high humidity evaluation were also performed by using the same standards as the evaluation of adhesive property.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0106">As shown in the above Table 2, it can be seen that the polyurethane adhesive (example) according to the embodiment of the present invention is highly evaluated in adhesive property, application property, and high temperature and humidity evaluation (shear adhesion evaluation).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0107">That is, the polyurethane adhesive according to the present example had a peel-off strength of 3 kgf/in or more after curing for 2 hours in the T-peel test, such there was no detachment occurred in a case of attaching the folding part <b>23</b> over time. On the other hand, the polyurethane adhesives of Comparative Examples 1 to 3 had significant lower peel-off strengths than the present example after curing for 2 hours in the T-peel test, such that the folding part <b>23</b> and the case <b>21</b> would be spaced apart or detached from each other after attaching the folding part <b>23</b> over time.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0108">Further, since the polyurethane adhesive according to the present example had a sufficient high viscosity, the adhesive would be applied and the shape thereof would be maintained. On the other hand, since the polyurethane adhesives of Comparative Examples 2 and 3 except for Comparative Example 1 had significantly lower viscosities than that of the present example, the shape thereof would not be maintained after applying the adhesive to flow down, and thereby hindering the attaching operation. The polyurethane adhesive of Comparative Example 1 had a higher viscosity than that of the present example. However, when the viscosity is too high, workability such as operation efficiency may be adversely affected.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0109">Further, the polyurethane adhesive according to the present example may maintain the adhesive force for a long period time in a shear adhesion evaluation performed at high temperature and high humidity. In this regard, the polyurethane adhesives of Comparative Example 3 shows the similar result to that of the present example. However, the polyurethane adhesives of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 show a significant short time for maintaining the adhesion at high temperature and high humidity, therefore it can be seen that these adhesives are not suitable for use in an environment in which the secondary battery <b>10</b> is placed.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0110">In summary the above results, it can be seen that the polyurethane adhesive according to the present example was superior in terms of adhesive properties, application properties and high temperature and high humidity evaluation to the adhesives of the comparative examples, and thereby, the polyurethane adhesive according to the present example is more suitable to attach the folding part <b>23</b> of the secondary battery <b>10</b> than the adhesives of the comparative examples.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0111">Although the representative embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail, it will be understood by persons who have a common knowledge in the technical field to which the present invention pertains that various modifications and variations may be made therein without departing from the scope of the present invention.
