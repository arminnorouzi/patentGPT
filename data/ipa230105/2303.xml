The present invention relates also to a process for preparing a (2-cyclopentenyl)acetate ester compound therefrom, and a process for preparing a (2-cyclopentenyl)acetic acid compound therefrom.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">Mealybugs are pests belonging to the order Hemiptera, the family Pseudococcidae, and suck juice of many agricultural plants, such as grapes, apples, pears, persimmons, pineapples, bananas, coffee, citrus, and flowering plants, to damage these agricultural plants. Further, mealybugs discharge honeydew which contains sugar to cause fungi-induced diseases. These damage and diseases reduce the yield and quality of such agricultural plants, which is a serious problem.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Generally, insecticides have been used for controlling mealybugs. However, mealybugs live in narrow spaces behind leaves and/or plant barks and are themselves covered with a waxy substance. Therefore, insecticides are difficult to come in contact with the pest body. This results in insufficient effects of the insecticides.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">In the light of adverse effects of insecticides on the environment and human health, there is recently a demand for the development of a new highly safe, and eco-friendly control method such as mating disruption and/or mass trapping using sex pheromones of insects. Development of such a new control method requires the industrial and inexpensive preparation of a sex pheromone in a large amount.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">For sex pheromones of mealybugs, the chemical structures of sex pheromones secreted from about 20 species of agriculturally harmful mealybugs have been identified. Some of these sex pheromones are known to have a characteristic structure wherein a cyclopentane or cyclopentene ring is substituted with an alkyl group and a 2-acyloxyethyl group or a formylmethyl group attaches to the ring.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Specifically, a sex pheromone of the longtailed mealybug (scientific name: <i>Pseudococcus longispinus</i>) is reported to be an optically active (&#x2212;)-2-(1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)ethyl acetate (Non-Patent Literature 1 listed below). A sex pheromone of a sexually reproducing strain of the pineapple mealybug (scientific name: <i>Dysmicoccus brevipes</i>) is reported to be an optically active (1S,2S)-(&#x2212;)-(1,2-dimethyl-3-methylenecyclopentyl)acetaldehyde (Non-Patent Literatures 2 and 3 listed below).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Enantiomers or diastereomers (i.e., kinds of stereoisomers) of such optically active sex pheromone are reported to have no adverse effect on the attracting activity of natural pheromones (Non-Patent Literatures 1 and 3). Accordingly, for establishment of the techniques for controlling the pests utilizing sex pheromones it is thought to be efficient to find a process for preparing a mixture of stereoisomers containing the natural pheromones in view of the inexpensive supply of the pheromone substances and for a economical control method.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">A process for preparing a mixture of stereoisomers of these pheromones is reported as follows. For example, a mixture of stereoisomers containing (&#x2212;)-2-(1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)ethyl acetate, which is a sex pheromone substance of the longtailed mealybug, is prepared by acetylating 3,4,4-trimethyl-2-cyclopenten-1-ol, reacting the reaction product with a base and, then, t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, subjecting the reaction product to an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement reaction to form (1,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetic acid as an intermediate, and then converting a functional group of the intermediate into a target functional group (Non-Patent Literature 4 listed below).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">A mixture of stereoisomers containing (1S,2S)-(&#x2212;)-(1,2-dimethyl-3-methylenecyclopentyl)acetaldehyde, which is a sex pheromone of the pineapple mealybug, is prepared by acetylating 2,3-dimethyl-2-cyclopeten-1-ol, reacting the reaction product with a base and, then, trimethylsilyl chloride, subjecting the reaction product to an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement reaction to form (1,2-dimethyl-2-cyclopentenyl)acetic acid as an intermediate, transforming the skeleton of the intermediate into the skeleton of a target compound and, then, converting a functional group in the resulting compound into a target functional group to obtain a mixture of enantiomers and/or diastereomers (Non-Patent Literature 5 listed below).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Like the aforesaid Ireland-Claisen rearrangement reaction, a Johnson-Claisen rearrangement reaction is known as a Claisen-type rearrangement reaction of allylalcohols such as 2-cyclopenten-1-ol compounds, in which a 2-cyclopeten-1-ol compound is reacted with a trialkyl orthoacetate in the presence of a weakly acidic catalyst such as propionic acid to form a (2-cyclopentenyl)acetate ester compound (Non-Patent Literature 6 listed below).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">LIST OF THE LITERATURES</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non-Patent Literatures</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0011">[Non-Patent Literature 1] R.

There is need for establishing a process for industrially and inexpensively preparing a (2-cyclopentenyl)acetate ester compound and a (2-cyclopentenyl)acetic acid compound.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">However, the preparation processes described in Non-Patent Literature 4 and Non-Patent Literature 5 using an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement reaction have such disadvantages that an organolithium compound and lithium amide, which are ignitable, are used; the reactions must be carried out at a so extremely low temperature as &#x2212;78&#xb0; C.; and industrially relatively expensive trialkylsilane chloride is used.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">In the process described in Non-Patent Literature 6 for preparing a (2-cyclopentenyl)acetate ester by a Johnson-Claisen rearrangement reaction in which a 2-cyclopenten-1-ol compound is reacted with a trialkyl orthoacetate in the presence of a weakly acidic catalyst, a dehydration reaction of the starting material, 2-cyclopeten-1-ol compound, occurs preferentially to cause a problematic low yield (see, Non-Patent Literature 4 and the Comparative Examples 1 and 2 described in the present specification).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">Thus, the prior art failed to industrially and economically prepare a (2-cyclopentenyl)acetate ester compound and a (2-cyclopentenyl)acetic acid compound in a large
