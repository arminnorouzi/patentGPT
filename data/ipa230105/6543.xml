The power density generally refers to a ratio of a weight/size of the power adapter to power of the power adapter. Higher power density of the power adapter indicates more power provided in a same size and also a higher loss caused by a power transistor inside the power adapter. Consequently, heat dissipation of the power adapter gradually becomes a bottleneck.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To reduce a switching loss of the power transistor, a voltage at two ends of the power transistor is usually caused to reach a valley value before the power transistor is turned on. In this case, the switching loss of the power transistor may be the smallest. To enable the power transistor to be turned on just at a valley voltage, a value of the voltage at the two ends of the power transistor needs to be monitored. In an existing solution, an auxiliary winding of a transformer may be added to monitor whether a voltage of the auxiliary winding exceeds zero. After a resonance period of specific duration is delayed, the voltage at the two ends of the power transistor at this moment is monitored. The voltage at this moment is the valley voltage. In this monitoring solution, delay duration may vary for different resonance periods. The delay duration is generated by using a resistor-capacitor RC circuit. However, the RC circuit needs to be disposed outside the power transistor, to adjust the delay duration. Therefore, a peripheral circuit of a power transistor chip is complex, and an overall size of the power adapter is increased.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of this, how to reduce an energy loss without increasing the overall size of the power adapter is an urgent problem to be resolved by a person skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application provides a converter, a converter control method, and a power adapter, to reduce an energy loss of power density without increasing an overall size of the power adapter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, this application provides a converter. The converter includes an input direct current (DC) power supply, a main power transistor, an auxiliary power transistor, a first capacitor, a transformer, and a controller. The first capacitor is connected in series to the transformer to form a series circuit. The series circuit is connected in parallel to a source and a drain of the auxiliary power transistor. A source of the main power transistor is connected to the drain of the auxiliary power transistor. A source of the main power transistor is connected to either an input positive electrode or an input negative electrode of the input DC power supply. The source of the auxiliary power transistor is connected to the other electrode of the input DC power supply. The input negative electrode of the input DC power supply is grounded. The controller is configured to: monitor a value of a current on the transformer to obtain a quantity of times that the value of the current on the transformer reaches a specified current threshold, and when the quantity of times that the value of the current on the transformer reaches the specified current threshold is N, control the main power transistor to be turned on, where N is a positive odd number.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Because an on voltage of the main power transistor is in direct proportion to an energy loss of the power transistor, to reduce a switching loss of the power transistor, a voltage at two ends of the power transistor needs to reach a valley value before the power transistor is turned on. Specifically, by observing the voltage at the two ends of the main power transistor and a current time sequence waveform of the transformer, it can be learned that a current on the transformer may exceed zero. When the current on the transformer exceeds zero for an odd number of times, the voltage at the two ends of the main power transistor reaches the valley value. Therefore, when the value of the current on the transformer reaches 0 for N times, the main power transistor is controlled to be turned on, to reduce the energy loss of the main power transistor without increasing an overall size of a power adapter.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">After the auxiliary power transistor is turned off, the current on the transformer generates oscillation noise, and this affects counting of the quantity of times that the value of the current on the transformer reaches the specified current threshold. In some possible implementations, the controller is specifically configured to monitor the value of the current on the transformer after the auxiliary power transistor is turned off for specified duration. The value of the current on the transformer is monitored after the auxiliary power transistor is turned off for the specified duration, so that a noise signal in the current on the transformer can be effectively prevented from affecting the counting of the quantity of times that the value of the current on the transformer reaches the specified current threshold, to improve monitoring accuracy and reduce an energy loss of power density without increasing an overall size of the power adapter.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some possible implementations, the transformer includes a primary-side winding and a secondary-side winding. A dotted terminal of the primary-side winding and a dotted terminal or an undotted terminal of the secondary-side winding are located on a same side. The controller is specifically configured to monitor a value of a current on the primary-side winding of the transformer. With reference to the structure in this aspect, if the dotted terminal of the primary-side winding and the undotted terminal of the secondary-side winding are located on the same side, a circuit structure of the converter in this application may be referred to as an asymmetric half bridge forward topology. If the dotted terminal of the primary-side winding and the dotted terminal of the secondary-side winding are located on the same side, a circuit structure of the converter in this application may be referred to as an asymmetric half bridge flyback topology.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Because not all magnetic lines generated by the winding on one side of the transformer can pass through the winding on the other side, leakage inductance exists. In some possible implementations, the primary-side winding includes a magnetic inductor and a leakage inductor. The controller is specifically configured to: monitor a value of a magnetic inductance current on the magnetic inductor of the primary-side winding of the transformer, or monitor a value of a leakage inductance current on the leakage inductor of the primary-side winding of the transformer. The main power transistor can be accurately controlled to be turned on by monitoring the value of the magnetic inductance current on the magnetic inductor or the value of the leakage inductance current on the leakage inductor of the primary-side winding of the transformer, to reduce the energy loss of the power density without increasing the overall size of the power adapter.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some possible implementations, the controller specifically includes a current monitoring circuit, a quantity monitoring circuit, and a main power transistor control circuit.

The main power transistor control circuit is configured to control, based on the drive signal, the main power transistor to be turned on. The current monitoring circuit may further include a specified resistor. The specified resistor is connected in series to the primary-side winding of the transformer. The current monitoring circuit can calculate the value of the current on the transformer by measuring a value of a voltage at two ends of the specified resistor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some possible implementations, the converter further includes a second capacitor. Two terminals of the second capacitor are respectively connected to the input positive electrode and the input negative electrode of the input DC power supply. The two terminals of the second capacitor are respectively connected to the input positive electrode and the input negative electrode of the input DC power supply. The second capacitor may be used for both the asymmetric half bridge forward topology and the asymmetric half bridge flyback topology.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a second aspect, this application provides a converter control method, applied to a converter.

It is clear that the described embodiments are merely some rather than all of embodiments of this application. A person of ordinary skill in the art may learn that the technical solutions provided in embodiments of this application are also applicable to a similar technical problem as a technology evolves and a new scenario emerges.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, it should be understood that in the descriptions of this application, terms such as &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; are only used for description differentiation, but cannot be understood as indication or implication of relative importance and cannot be understood as indication or implication of sequences; &#x201c;and/or describes an association relationship for describing associated objects, and represents that three relationships may exist.

Actually, a magnetic inductor is a primary-side inductor of a transformer, and a current on the inductor is not conducted to a secondary side. The inductor functions to generate excitation effect on an iron core, so that ferromagnetic molecules in the iron core can be used for conducting magnetism.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">(2) Leakage inductance: Not all magnetic lines generated on a primary side can pass through a secondary coil. Therefore, an inductor that generates magnetic leakage is referred to as a leakage inductor. Specifically, the leakage inductance refers to a part of flux that is leaked in a coupling process of the primary side of the transformer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">With development of consumer electronics, consumers have increasingly strong requirements for miniaturization and fast charging of an adapter. Higher power density of the adapter becomes a future technical development trend. Higher power density indicates more power provided in a same size and also a higher loss. Consequently, heat dissipation gradually becomes a bottleneck.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one end of a power adapter is connected to a power grid, and the other end is connected to a load. The power grid may be a mains network provided for residents, for example, 220 V. The load may be various types of electronic devices, for example, a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a notebook computer, and a wearable device. There may be a plurality of types of power adapters, power adapters corresponding to different types of electronic devices may not have a same structure, and power adapters of electronic devices of a same type may also be different. This is not specifically limited in this application.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a possible implementation, to reduce a switching loss of a power transistor in the power adapter, a voltage at two ends of the power transistor is usually caused to reach a valley value before the power transistor is turned on. In this case, the switching loss may be the smallest. To enable the power transistor to be turned on (closed) just at a valley voltage, a value of the voltage at the two ends of the power transistor needs to be monitored. For example, an auxiliary winding of a transformer may be added to monitor whether a voltage of the auxiliary winding exceeds zero. After a specified resonance period is delayed, the voltage at the two ends of the power transistor at this moment is monitored. The voltage at this moment is the valley voltage. However, in this method, different delay duration may be set for different resonance periods. Generally, the delay duration needs to be generated by using a resistor-capacitor circuit.
