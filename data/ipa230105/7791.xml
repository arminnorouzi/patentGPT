Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure generally relates to a display device, which may be independently used and also used to constitute a tiling display device by connecting multiple display devices.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As interest in information displays and demand for portable information media increase, research and commercialization have focused on display devices.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such display devices have been manufactured and used in various sizes from display devices having relatively small sizes, such as TVs, monitors, and various types of personal portable digital devices to display devices having relatively large sizes, such as public displays and digital signage.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, technical difficulty exists up to now when independent large-sized display devices are manufactured. Accordingly, a tiling display device has recently been used, in which display devices are connected to each other, thereby enlarging a display area.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A boundary area of the display devices should be minimized so as to improve the visibility of the tiling display device, the quality of an image, and the like, and hence each of the display devices has no instrument capable of protecting corners thereof. Therefore, the display device may be damaged from a very weak contact, and hence it is difficult to handle the display device. In addition, the display device cannot be used even when the display device is to be independently used without constituting the tiling display device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is to be understood that this background of the technology section is, in part, intended to provide useful background for understanding the technology. However, this background of the technology section may also include ideas, concepts, or recognitions that were not part of what was known or appreciated by those skilled in the pertinent art prior to a corresponding effective filing date of the subject matter disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments provide a display device which facilitates panel handling when the display device is independently used and has improved visibility when the display device constitutes a tiling display device, to be independently used and also be used to constitute the tiling display device when multiple display devices are connected.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a display device including: a first display panel; a first housing disposed on a bottom of the first display panel; a first cabinet disposed on a bottom of the first housing, the first cabinet including a first protrusion part and a first concave part; and a first side frame disposed on a side surface of the first display panel, wherein the first side frame is movable toward the first cabinet, and a portion of the first side frame extends to the first concave part.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The display device may further include: a second display panel disposed adjacent to the first display panel; a second housing disposed on a bottom of the second display panel; a second cabinet disposed on a bottom of the second housing, the second cabinet including a second protrusion part and a second concave part; and a second side frame disposed on a side surface of the second display panel.
