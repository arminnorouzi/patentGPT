For workpiece of different lengths, vises of different sizes are typically used.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the prior art, there is a vise capable of adjusting its clamping length. For example, as shown in the patent CN208744613, the vise includes a vise body, a fixed jaw fixed to the vise body, and a movable jaw assembly movably connected to the vise body and movable along the vise body. The vise body is made up of at least two vise body segments that are put together. The vise body segments that are put together are connected by a vise body connecting means. The vise body is made up of at least two vise body segments that are put together, and the vise body segments, after being put together, can extend an overall length of the vise body. After the vise body segments are put together, a position of the fixed jaw on the vise body may experience changes. That is, if the movable jaw assembly does not move, a distance between the fixed jaw and the movable jaw assembly will expand, resulting in an increase in a maximum clamping distance between the fixed jaw and the movable jaw assembly.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The movable jaw assembly includes a jaw fixing frame assembled with the vise body segments, a cam-type rotating clamping means disposed on the jaw fixing frame, a handle for manipulating the rotating clamping means and movable dies connected to the jaw fixing frame. The cam-type rotating clamping means includes a clamping pad and a pin shaft in cooperation with the clamping pad. The clamping pad is arranged at middle of the jaw fixing frame and provided with a guide hole, and the jaw fixing frame is provided with a guide pole. The guide pole is inserted in the guide hole. Under the guidance of the guide pole and the guide hole, the clamping pad can move relative to the jaw fixing frame. The clamping pad is provided at the bottom with a depression. The depression cooperates with a raised portion of the vise body segments. The presence of the depression maximizes a vertical thickness of the clamping pad. The clamping pad is brought into contact with the bottom of a guide means.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">After a workpiece is placed on a top surface of the vise body, the movable jaw assembly is moved to clamp the workpiece, and the handle of the movable jaw assembly is rotated to fix the movable jaw assembly to the vise body. Since the direction of a force that rotates the handle always forms a certain angle with the direction of a longitudinal axis of the vise body, meaning that there is a stress directed toward the left or right relative to the longitudinal axis of the vise body, i.e., the direction of the force that rotates the handle forms an angle with a straight line direction of guide rails, as such, after the workpiece is clamped between clamping surfaces, a deviation of the workpiece from the straight line direction of the guide rails may be caused, creating an angle of clamping deviation, i.e., there is an angle of deviation between the workpiece and the straight line direction of the guide rails, leading to unsuitability for processing or non-precise processing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, those skilled in the art are directing their effort toward developing a woodworking vise and how to avoid the problem of a deviation from a straight line direction of guide rails after clamping by clamping surfaces causing an angle of clamping deviation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above described

techniques disclosed herein become more apparent and better understood. The present application may be embodied in many different forms of embodiment, and the protection scope of the present application is not limited only to the embodiments mentioned herein.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Throughout the accompanying drawings, structurally identical parts are indicated with identical reference numerals, and structurally or functionally similar components are indicated with similar reference numerals. The size and thickness of each component in the drawings are arbitrarily depicted, and the present application is not limited to any size or thickness of each component. For greater clarity of illustration, the thicknesses of some parts are exaggerated as appropriate somewhere in the drawings.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a schematic diagram showing the structure of a woodworking vise of an embodiment of the present application, the woodworking vise includes a profiled vise body <b>1</b>, a first jaw <b>2</b>, a second jaw <b>2</b>&#x2032; and a movable jaw <b>3</b>. Wherein, the profiled vise body <b>1</b> is provided, along its longitudinal axis, with channel rails <b>5</b>. For example, the profiled vise body <b>1</b> is provided, on both sides along its longitudinal axis, with the channel rails <b>5</b>. The first jaw <b>2</b> and the second jaw <b>2</b>&#x2032; are disposed at both ends of the profiled vise body <b>1</b> and serve as stop elements at both ends of the channel rails <b>5</b>. The movable jaw <b>3</b> can slide along the channel rails <b>5</b> forth and back and can be movably fixed to the channel rails <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In another embodiment of the present application, in order to be able to clamp large workpieces and shorten a length of the woodworking vise when out of use, the profiled vise body <b>1</b> may include two separable vise body segments and a connecting member <b>4</b> connecting the two vise body segments together. The two vise body segments may be nested together, with one being partially overlapped or superimposed with the other. When the woodworking vise needs to handle a profile with a relatively long length, at least one of the two vise body segments may be pulled along the longitudinal axis of the profiled vise body <b>1</b> so that it is resized to become compatible with the size of the workpiece. The two vise body segments are then secured with the connecting member <b>4</b>. The connecting member <b>4</b> may be a rivet, a screw or a bolt, thus being able to satisfy the needs of profiles of different lengths.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In another embodiment of the present application, at least one of the first jaw <b>2</b> and the second jaw <b>2</b>&#x2032; is movably fixed to the profiled vise body <b>1</b>, for example, by a screw or a bolt.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In another embodiment of the present application, at least one of the first jaw <b>2</b> and the second jaw <b>2</b>&#x2032; is a fixed jaw, for example, fixed to the profiled vise body <b>1</b> by bolting, screwing or welding.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In another embodiment of the present application, when a workpiece is placed on the profiled vise body <b>1</b>, the movable jaw <b>3</b> may be pushed to slide along the channel rails <b>5</b> so that the workpiece is clamped between one of the first jaw <b>2</b> and the second jaw <b>2</b>&#x2032; and the movable jaw <b>3</b>. The movable jaw <b>3</b> is then fixed to the profiled vise body <b>1</b>. After the fixation, an operator can work on the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In another embodiment of the present application, there are two of the movable jaws <b>3</b>, which form workpiece-clamping structures respectively with the first jaw <b>2</b> and the second jaw <b>2</b>&#x2032;. The two movable jaws <b>3</b> have the same structure. For ease of description, the following embodiments are described in the context of one movable jaw <b>3</b> as an example.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Therefore, since the woodworking vise of the present embodiment is provided with the movable jaw <b>3</b> and the channel rails <b>5</b>, the woodworking vise can be used to clamp workpieces of different sizes and can simultaneously clamp two workpieces at both ends. The operation is simple and convenient.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In another embodiment of the present application, the movable jaw <b>3</b> in the woodworking vise may be structured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an exploded diagram schematically illustrating the structure of the movable jaw in the woodworking vise of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The movable jaw <b>3</b> includes a die fixing frame <b>31</b>, a first movable die <b>32</b>, a second movable die <b>32</b>&#x2032;, a first die pad <b>33</b>, a second die pad <b>33</b>&#x2032;, a force applying means <b>34</b>, a camshaft <b>35</b> and a locking block <b>36</b>. The force applying means <b>34</b> includes a grip <b>340</b>, a shaft <b>341</b> and fasteners <b>342</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The profiled vise body <b>1</b> assumes an elongate shape, and an elongate direction of the profiled vise body <b>1</b> is just the aforementioned longitudinal axis of the profiled vise body <b>1</b>. The profiled vise body <b>1</b> is provided, on both sides along its longitudinal axis, with the channel rails <b>5</b> that protrude upward. That is, the longitudinal axis of the profiled vise body <b>1</b> is parallel to the channel rails <b>5</b>, and being along the longitudinal axis of the profiled vise body <b>1</b> can be also referred to as being along the channel rails <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In another embodiment of the present application, the movable jaw <b>3</b> is provided with limiting ribs and the force applying means <b>34</b> has limiting grooves that cooperate with the limiting ribs to rotate the force applying means <b>34</b> to a predetermined position.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In another embodiment of the present application, the channel rails <b>5</b> are T-shaped or inverted L-shaped.

The first movable die <b>32</b>, the second movable die <b>32</b>&#x2032;, the first die pad <b>33</b> and the second die pad <b>33</b>&#x2032; are disposed, after being assembled together, on the channel rails <b>5</b> of the profiled vise body <b>1</b> such as to be able to slide forth and back along the channel rails <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">A top surface of the locking block <b>36</b> is a fastening abutment surface <b>361</b>, and the locking block <b>36</b> is disposed on a bottom surface of the die fixing frame <b>31</b> and can be brought into contact with a top surface of the profiled vise body <b>1</b>. The camshaft <b>35</b> is disposed inside the die fixing frame <b>31</b> and arranged on the locking block <b>36</b>. Moreover, a center axis of the camshaft <b>35</b> is perpendicular to the channel rails <b>5</b>. The force applying means <b>34</b> is connected to the camshaft <b>35</b> and can rotate about the center axis of the camshaft <b>35</b> to cause the camshaft <b>35</b> to rotate. Upon the rotation of the camshaft <b>35</b> resulting in a cam of the camshaft <b>35</b> pressing against the top surface of the locking block <b>36</b> and thus firmly pressing the locking block <b>36</b> against the top surface of the profiled vise body <b>1</b>, the movable jaw <b>3</b> is fixed to the top surface of the profiled vise body <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As can be seen from the above description, when the movable jaw <b>3</b> is being fixed to the top surface of the profiled vise body <b>1</b>, a force exerted on the force applying means <b>34</b> is always parallel to the channel rails <b>5</b>. Therefore, there is no problem that may cause a workpiece deviation from a straight line direction of the rails. This can avoid the problem of an angle of clamping deviation and enables the movable jaw <b>3</b> to be more firmly fixed to the top surface of the vise body <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The die fixing frame <b>31</b> may be structured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a diagram schematically illustrating the structure of the die fixing frame in the woodworking vise of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.
