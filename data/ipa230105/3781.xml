For example, when measuring low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), these parameters describe the signal-to-noise degradation that occurs due to the internally-generated noise of the active devices within an LNA.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The &#x201c;noise factor&#x201d; (F) of a device, such as an amplifier or radio receiver, denotes the ratio between the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the device to the output signal-to-noise ratio of the device. On the other hand, the &#x201c;noise figure&#x201d; (NF) of the device is the noise factor expressed in decibels. More precisely, the noise figure is the difference in decibels (dB) between the output noise of the actual device and the output noise of an ideal device at the same gain and bandwidth under a condition in which the actual and ideal devices are connected to matched terminations at a given standard temperature (referred to as a &#x201c;noise temperature&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of a noise receiver <b>30</b> for measuring the output noise (or noise power) of a device-under-test (DUT) <b>20</b>. The noise receiver may be used in conjunction with separate circuitry (not shown) that measures a gain of the DUT <b>20</b>. The DUT <b>20</b> is assumed for explanation purposes to be an amplifier. As shown, an input of the DUT <b>20</b> is coupled to a termination (T) <b>10</b> which constitutes a controlled noise source. An output of the DUT <b>20</b> is coupled to an input port <b>31</b> of a noise receiver <b>30</b>.

In operation, the amplifier <b>32</b> of the receiver amplifies an output noise of the DUT <b>20</b>. The output of the amplifier <b>32</b> is bandpass filtered by the pre-selector <b>33</b>, and an output of the pre-selector <b>33</b> is frequency reduced to baseband by the mixer <b>34</b> driven by the LO <b>35</b>.

However, in the case where receiver noise N is large relative to DUT output noise X (i.e., N&#x3e;&#x3e;X), the accuracy of noise figure measurement is degraded. As such, to improve sensitivity, a typical approach is to apply a low noise amplifier (LNA) at the first stage of the receiver. Even so, however, an LNA may not be sufficient in the case where the DUT has low output noise or low gain.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">Separately, unwanted frequency conversion responses may occur at the output of the mixer <b>34</b>. These include image responses (f<sub>LO</sub>+f<sub>IF</sub>, or f<sub>LO</sub>&#x2212;f<sub>IF </sub>(where f<sub>LO </sub>is the local oscillator frequency and f<sub>IF </sub>is an intermediate frequency at the input of the mixer <b>34</b>)), harmonic responses (2fLO&#xb1;f<sub>IF</sub>, 3fLO&#xb1;f<sub>IF</sub>, and so on), and spurious responses. For this reason, the pre-selector <b>33</b> is provided to pass a preselected band of frequencies to the input of the mixer <b>34</b>.

It will be understood, however, that an amplifier as the DUT <b>20</b> is merely an example.

Sensitivity of the receiver <b>200</b> may not be limited by the noise floor of each receiver, and separately, sensitivity is enhanced with an increase in measurement time. The receiver <b>100</b> may be especially effective for DUTs having low output noise (i.e., DUTs having a low noise factor and/or a low gain).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the receiver <b>200</b> includes an input port <b>201</b>, a splitter <b>207</b>, first and second amplifiers <b>202</b><i>a </i>and <b>202</b><i>b</i>, first and second mixers <b>204</b><i>a </i>and <b>204</b><i>b</i>, first and second local oscillators (LO<b>1</b> and LO<b>2</b>) <b>205</b><i>a </i>and <b>205</b><i>b</i>, first and second analog-to-digital converters (ADC) <b>206</b><i>a </i>and <b>206</b><i>b</i>, and a cross-correlation circuit (xcorr) <b>208</b>. The first amplifier <b>202</b><i>a</i>, the first mixer <b>204</b><i>a</i>, and the ADC <b>206</b><i>a </i>may be considered a first measurement channel of the receiver <b>200</b>.

The first mixer <b>204</b><i>a </i>is driven by the first local oscillator <b>205</b><i>a </i>which outputs a local oscillation signal of a first frequency LO<b>1</b>. The frequency down-conversion is to a target frequency within the capture range of the first ADC <b>206</b><i>a</i>. The first ADC <b>206</b><i>a </i>outputs a corresponding first total noise digital signal. The first total noise digital signal constitutes total noise samples (total noise power samples) which includes noise contributed by the DUT <b>20</b> and noise contributed by the first measurement channel of the noise receiver <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0064">Likewise, in the second measurement channel, the second amplifier <b>202</b><i>b </i>amplifies the DUT output signal, and the resultant amplified signal is frequency down-converted by the second mixer <b>204</b><i>b</i>.
