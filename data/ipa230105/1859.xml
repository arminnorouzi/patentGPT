Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Discussed herein are various devices, systems, and methods relating to an improved mountable rising bike rack. For brevity, and for ease of explanation, these embodiments may be described in relation to a &#x201c;bike rack,&#x201d; though that is not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure in any way. For example, certain aspects can be used in other applications, such as for wheelchairs, skis, luggage, or other heavy equipment, as would be readily understood in the art.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to certain embodiments, the disclosed bike rack and associated systems and methods have a movable support bracket that may be lowered, such as to the ground or nearer the ground, to load and secure a bike, and then may be raised to transport the bike.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In various implementations, the bike rack may be mounted on or affixed to a vehicle, such as for transport. In various additional implementations, the bike rack may be mounted to another surface, such as a wall for raised storage of various items.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In use, according to various implementations, a user may lower the bike rack's support bracket while the bike rack is mounted to the vehicle or other structure. After the support bracket is lowered, the user may easily roll the bike onto or off the rack when the support bracket is on the ground, or the user may slightly lift the bike onto or off the bike rack when the support bracket is slightly off the ground. This loading and unloading design allows users to load and unload heavy bikes or other items more easily. For example, electric bikes are typically substantially more heavy than traditional bikes due to the weight of their battery and as such the need for improved transportation and storage methods for such equipment.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">After the bike is loaded onto the rack, the support brackets may be raised into a transport position such that the bike and rack is high enough off the ground to avoid impact with the road while the vehicle is moving. To unload the bike, the support brackets holding the bike may be lowered to the ground or slightly off the ground such that the bike can be easily rolled or slightly lifted off the bike rack. Alternatively, in certain embodiments, a support bracket may engage with the top of a bike, as would be understood by a skilled artisan and discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Turning to the drawings in greater detail, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> show one implementation of the bike rack <b>10</b> in use with a bike <b>2</b> that can be secured to the bike rack <b>10</b> for transportation and use, as would be appreciated. For example, the bike <b>2</b> may be secured to the bike rack <b>10</b> via the wheel(s) <b>4</b> of the bike <b>2</b>. The bike rack <b>10</b> may in turn be attached to a vehicle <b>6</b>. The bike rack <b>10</b> may optionally be attached to a hitch <b>8</b> of the vehicle <b>6</b> via a hitch beam <b>38</b>, as would be understood, or via any understood attachment mechanism readily appreciated in the art. The bike rack <b>10</b> is configured to extend and retract vertically (as shown by reference arrow A) to alter the position of the bike rack <b>10</b> from the raised position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> to the lowered position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, as would be understood. The bike rack <b>10</b> may include a bike holder <b>9</b> and an extension mechanism <b>11</b>. The extension mechanism <b>11</b> optionally includes the center beam <b>36</b> and the linear slide <b>40</b>, shown and discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Continuing with the implementations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> in greater detail, according to the implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the bike rack <b>10</b> may be in the raised position such that the bike <b>2</b> and the bike rack <b>10</b> are high enough off the ground to avoid impact with the road while the vehicle <b>6</b> is moving. In various implementations, in this raised position, the bottom of the bike holder <b>9</b> is substantially the same height from the ground as the hitch beam <b>38</b>. Alternatively, the bike holder <b>9</b> may be above or below the hitch <b>8</b> height, as would be understood. In this raised position, the bike <b>2</b> is situated on the bike rack <b>10</b> such that the wheels <b>4</b> sit on/within the bike holder <b>9</b>. As described further herein, and as would be understood, an optional vertical support <b>30</b> may be provided for the bike <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As is also shown in the implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the bike rack <b>10</b> may be in a lowered position such that the bike holder <b>9</b> is close to or touching the ground for easy movement of a bike <b>2</b> or another item onto the bike holder <b>9</b>. The bike rack <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is in an extended/lowered state (movement shown by reference arrow A), to be in a loading/unloading position. In this lowered position, the bottom of the bike holder <b>9</b> is substantially closer to the ground than to the hitch beam <b>38</b>. After the bike holder <b>9</b> is lowered, the user may roll the bike <b>2</b> onto or off the bike rack <b>10</b> when the bike holder <b>9</b> is on the ground. Alternatively, the user may slightly lift the bike <b>2</b> onto or off the bike rack <b>10</b>, such as if the bike holder <b>9</b> is slightly off the ground, as would be understood by a skilled artisan.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In certain alternative implementations, the bike holder <b>9</b> may be rotated 180 degrees such that the bike holder <b>10</b> lowers onto the top of the bike <b>2</b> and is adapted to engage with the top of the bike wheels or other bike features (e.g., a handlebar, a cross bar, or a seat), as would be readily apparent to those of skill in the art. As a further example, in certain implementations the bike holder <b>9</b> is adapted to pass through the wheels and/or frame of the bike to lift the bike, as would also be readily appreciated. It is also understood that other known support structures, e.g., bike holders, may be used on the movable support.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>6</b></figref>, in various implementations, the bike holder <b>9</b> is attached to the extension mechanism <b>11</b>, specifically, to a center beam <b>36</b> via a brace <b>34</b>. The bike holder <b>9</b> is constructed and arranged to move relative to the hitch beam <b>38</b> when the extension mechanism <b>11</b> is actuated. For example, the bike holder <b>9</b> is configured to be lowered (as shown by reference arrow A) relative to the hitch beam <b>38</b> to alter the position of the bike rack <b>10</b> from the raised position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> to the lowered position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in the implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, the bike holder <b>9</b> of the bike rack <b>10</b> includes the support brackets <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B capable of supporting a bike <b>2</b> that are disposed on a substantially horizontal support base <b>24</b> secured to a vertically disposed post <b>26</b>. In these and other implementations, the support brackets <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B are constructed and arranged to support a bike <b>2</b> by holding the wheels <b>4</b> of a bike <b>2</b>. It is understood that in alternate implementations, the support brackets <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B are constructed and arranged to support other cargo items, one non-limiting example being wheelchairs or mobility scooters. Further implementations would of course be readily apparent to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Continuing with the implementations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, a pair of support brackets <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B may be placed opposite one another, such that a first support bracket <b>12</b>A holds a first wheel <b>4</b> of a bike (e.g., the front wheel), and a second support bracket <b>12</b>B holds a second wheel <b>4</b> of the bike (e.g., the back wheel). The support brackets <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B may be configured to support multiple bikes simultaneously. Each support bracket <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B may include wheel supports <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B, <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>D, and each wheel support <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B, <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>D may be configured with a wheel strap <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>D to secure a wheel <b>4</b> in the respective wheel support <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B, <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>D. The geometry and load requirements of various multiple bike configurations would be readily understood by those of skill in the art, such that racks <b>10</b> having several bike capacities are possible and contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, a wheel strap <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>D may surround a portion of a wheel <b>4</b> and tire such that the bottom of the wheel <b>4</b> is held up by the wheel support <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B, <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>D and held down by the wheel strap <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>D. The wheel supports <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B, <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>D may be attached to the support arms <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B. A wheel support <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B, <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>D may be shaped to further secure a wheel <b>4</b> from undesired movement. For example, a wheel support <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B, <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>D may be at least partially angled up and away from the support arm <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B to increase the security of the wheel <b>4</b>, as would be understood by a skilled artisan.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In various implementations, the support arm <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B may be connected to a side arm <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B via a coupling mechanism <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B. In some examples, the coupling mechanism <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B temporarily attaches the support arm <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B to the side arm <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B. In these and other implementations, the support arms <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B are movable along the side arms <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B and can be affixed temporarily or permanently at various positions along the side arms <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B. In other examples, the coupling mechanism <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B permanently attaches the support arm <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B to the side arm <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In these and other implementations, each of the side arms <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B fit into opposing sides of the support base <b>24</b>. In some examples, the support base <b>24</b> may include at least three slots configured to receive the support arms <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B and the post <b>26</b>. In some examples, the support base <b>24</b> temporarily secures to one or more of the side arms <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B and the post <b>26</b>, for example, via pins <b>28</b>A, <b>28</b>B. In other examples, the support base <b>24</b> permanently secures to one or more of the side arms <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B and the post <b>26</b>. In certain implementations, a pin <b>28</b>C affixes the post <b>26</b> to the support base <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, the post <b>26</b> extends upward from the support base <b>24</b>. A vertical support <b>30</b> may be attached to the post <b>26</b> via support mechanism <b>32</b>. In some cases, the vertical support <b>30</b> is configured to engage with a bike's <b>2</b> frame to provide additional support to the bike <b>2</b>, such as to prevent the bike <b>2</b> from tipping over, as would be understood by a skilled artisan. The vertical support <b>30</b> may be adjusted to be secured at different heights along post <b>26</b> via support mechanism <b>32</b>, which will be discussed in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, a brace <b>34</b> may couple the support base <b>24</b> to the center beam <b>36</b>. In some cases, the brace <b>34</b> permanently attaches the support base <b>24</b> to the center beam <b>36</b>. In other cases, the brace <b>34</b> temporarily attaches the support base <b>24</b> to the center beam <b>36</b>. Additionally or alternatively, a hitch beam <b>38</b> may also be attached to the center beam <b>36</b> on the opposing side of the support base <b>24</b>. In some cases, the brace <b>34</b> permanently attaches the hitch beam <b>38</b> to the center beam <b>36</b>. In other cases, the brace <b>34</b> temporarily attaches the hitch beam <b>38</b> to the center beam <b>36</b>. The hitch beam <b>38</b> may be configured to fit into a receiving hitch, which will be discussed in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. When the bike rack <b>10</b> is mounted on a vehicle via the hitch beam <b>38</b>, the support arms <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B may extend away from the vehicle, such as in the opposite direction of the hitch beam <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, the center beam <b>36</b> may be attached to a linear slide <b>40</b>. In various implementations, the center beam <b>36</b> and the linear slide <b>40</b> may be parallel to each other. In some examples, the center beam <b>36</b> permanently attaches to the linear slide <b>40</b>. In other examples, the center beam <b>36</b> temporarily attaches to the linear slide <b>40</b>. The linear slide <b>40</b> may be configured to extend and retract such that the brace <b>34</b> and the components attached thereto (e.g., the support brackets <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B, the support base <b>24</b>, and the vertical support <b>30</b>) are moved between a loading position and a transport position, which will be discussed in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Additionally, the movement of the linear slide <b>40</b> may be electrically controlled via a control hub <b>42</b>, as would be understood by a skilled artisan, and will be discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, the control hub <b>42</b> may include an actuator switch <b>44</b> and a power source <b>46</b>. In some examples, the power source <b>46</b> may be a battery <b>48</b> that is coupled with the control hub <b>42</b> via a dock <b>50</b>. In other cases, the power source <b>46</b> may include a solar panel or power cord or the like, as would be readily understood by the skilled artisan.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the bike rack <b>10</b> may include a hitch beam <b>38</b>. The hitch beam <b>38</b> may be attached to the center beam <b>36</b> on the opposing side of the support base <b>24</b>. In certain implementations, a mount <b>54</b> may attach the hitch beam <b>38</b> to the center beam <b>36</b>. In some examples, the mount <b>54</b> may be configured such that the center beam <b>36</b> may tilt relative to the hitch beam <b>38</b> and the vehicle, as will be discussed in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the hitch beam <b>38</b> may be configured with an end <b>52</b> that fits into a receiving hitch or other hitch of a vehicle, as would be readily understood by the skilled artisan.
