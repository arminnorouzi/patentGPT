Hence, there is interest in finding new catalysts that increase commercialization of the catalysts and allow the production of polymers having improved properties.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since its discovery in the 1950s, olefin metathesis has emerged as a valuable synthetic method for the formation of carbon-carbon double bonds (olefins). The recent advances in olefin metathesis applications in organic syntheses and polymer syntheses rely on developments of well-defined catalysts. The diversity of possible applications has led to the use of olefin metathesis as a standard synthetic tool. Olefin metathesis applications include cross-metathesis, ring-opening metathesis polymerization, ring-opening cross metathesis, ring-closing metathesis, and acyclic diene metathesis. An industrially important application is production of polymers produced from ROMP including polyalkenamers, such as polyoctenamer (polymer of cyclooctene) or polypentenamer (polymer of cyclopentene). Metathesis reactions are therefore indispensable as a synthetic tool for the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Olefin metathesis may be catalyzed by one or more catalytic metals, usually one or more transition metals, such as the molybdenum-containing Schrock catalyst and the ruthenium- or osmium-containing Grubbs catalysts. Single component ruthenium or osmium catalysts have been previously described by, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,312,940; 5,342,909; 5,728,917; 5,710,298; 5,750,815; 5,831,108; 7,329,758; and PCT Publications WO 1997/020865 and WO 1997/029135. These catalysts possess several advantageous properties, such as tolerance to a variety of functional groups and high activity.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, improvements in metathesis catalysis including ROMP catalysis, may arise from catalysts capable of producing polycycloolefins with: high molecular weights, controllable molecular weights, or narrow polydispersity indices. Polycycloolefins, which have high molecular weight, typically have desirable mechanical properties over their lower molecular weight counterparts. A catalyst capable of one or more of the aforementioned improvements is valuable, but even more so if a catalyst combines a number of improvements into an overall advantage over prior catalysts or catalyst systems. The catalyst activity and polymer properties may be affected by the solubility of the catalyst in the reaction medium. The reaction medium may not include solvent other than the reactants and may include aliphatic hydrocarbon(s). Many previous metathesis catalysts are only sparingly soluble in aliphatic hydrocarbon and may, therefore, be limited in application and production of certain polycycloolefin products.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, polycycloolefins, such as polypentenamer, may have a comonomer, such as cyclooctene, incorporated into the polypentenamer backbone. These copolymers provide varying physical properties compared to polypentenamer homopolymers and may be produced in a low pressure reactor, utilizing, for example, solution, slurry, or gas phase polymerization processes. The comonomer content of a polycycloolefin (e.g., wt % of comonomer incorporated into a polycycloolefin backbone) influences the properties of the polycycloolefin (and composition of the copolymers) and is influenced by the polymerization catalyst.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There remains a need for catalysts soluble in aliphatic hydrocarbons which are capable of being synthesized by mild, affordable, and simple synthetic routes and which demonstrate selectivity in metathesis transformations including high cis-double bond formation. Furthermore, there is a need for new and improved catalyst compounds and catalyst systems for polycycloolefin polymerization that produce polycycloolefins with certain properties, such as controllable molecular weights, including high molecular weights, high melting point, high comonomer incorporation, or narrow polydispersity index.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">References for citing in an information disclosure statement (37 C.F.R. 1.97(h)): U.S. Pat.

Such applications include, for example, mono- or multi-layer blown, extruded, and/or shrink films. These films may be formed by extrusion or coextrusion techniques, such as a blown bubble film processing technique, where the composition can be extruded in a molten state through an annular die and then expanded to form a uni-axial or biaxial orientation melt prior to being cooled to form a tubular, blown film, which can then be axially slit and unfolded to form a flat film. Films may be subsequently unoriented, uniaxially oriented, or biaxially oriented to the same or different extents. One or more of the layers of the film may be oriented in the transverse and/or longitudinal directions to the same or different extents. The uniaxially orientation can be accomplished using typical cold drawing or hot drawing methods. Biaxial orientation can be accomplished using tenter frame equipment or a double bubble processes and may occur before or after the individual layers are brought together. For example, a polyethylene layer can be extrusion coated or laminated onto an oriented polypropylene layer or the polyethylene and polypropylene can be coextruded together into a film then oriented. Likewise, oriented polypropylene could be laminated to oriented polyethylene or oriented polyethylene could be coated onto polypropylene then optionally the combination could be oriented even further. Typically the films are oriented in the Machine Direction (MD) at a ratio of up to 15, such as 5 to 7, and in the Transverse Direction (TD) at a ratio of up to 15, such as 7 to 9. However, in at least one embodiment the film is oriented to the same extent in both the MD and TD directions.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0164">The films may vary in thickness depending on the intended application; however, films of a thickness from 1 to 50 m are usually suitable. Films intended for packaging are usually from 10 to 50 m thick. The thickness of the sealing layer is typically 0.2 to 50 m. There may be a sealing layer on both the inner and outer surfaces of the film or the sealing layer may be present on only the inner or the outer surface.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0165">In at least one embodiment, one or more layers may be modified by corona treatment, electron beam irradiation, gamma irradiation, flame treatment, or microwave.
