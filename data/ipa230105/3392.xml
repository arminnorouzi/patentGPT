Such a conduit mainly extends along a longitudinal direction, while the base extends in a plane along a transverse direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction, and along a depth direction perpendicular to the longitudinal and transverse directions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At least one suction unit configured to generate an air flow through the conduit from the intake opening to the discharge opening is arranged within the conduit. The suction unit comprises an impeller rotated by an electric motor along a rotation axis typically oriented along the depth or transverse direction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, in the state of the art, kitchen hoods are known with a double suction unit configured to generate a greater suction effect of the cooking fumes than those with a single suction unit.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In detail, this last type of hood has a first and a second suction unit arranged in the conduit at the same distance from the intake opening along the longitudinal direction. In greater detail, the first and the second suction unit extend parallel along the depth direction and are arranged side by side along the transverse direction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The flanking of the first and the second suction unit along the transverse direction results in a significant increase in the volume of the conduit along the latter direction with respect to the hoods with a single suction unit. Therefore, disadvantageously, in the case in which the hood is recessed in a hanging cabinet, the greater encumbrance along the transverse direction of the conduit leads to a reduction in the cubic area of the cabinet useful for the storage of food products or kitchen equipment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, the greater size of the conduit of the hoods with double suction unit entails an increase in the raw materials necessary for their creation and countless logistical disadvantages that result in an increase in production and storage costs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Again, disadvantageously, the greater size of the conduit and thus the greater weight of the hood with a double suction unit make installation operations less easy and more expensive in terms of time.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this context, the technical task underlying the present description is to propose a hood for extracting cooking fumes which overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide a hood for extracting cooking fumes with a double suction unit having an overall encumbrance comparable to that of the common hoods with a single suction unit. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a hood with a double suction unit which, if recessed in a hanging cabinet, can occupy the smallest possible volume, so as to maximise the storage capacity of the cabinet itself.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a hood with a double suction unit which is light and of small dimensions so as to be economically feasible, efficiently storable and easy to install.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The hood object of the present description comprises a base having an intake opening that can be facing a hob, and a conduit connected to the base.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In detail, the conduit extends mainly along a longitudinal direction and has a discharge opening placed in fluid communication with the intake opening.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The hood further comprises a first and a second suction unit arranged in the conduit and configured to generate a respective air flow through the conduit from the intake opening to the discharge opening.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In detail, the first and the second suction unit extend parallel along a depth direction oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The first suction unit is placed close to the opening and the second suction unit is spaced from the first along the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Advantageously, such a distance of the suction units along the longitudinal direction allows a partial overlapping thereof along a transverse direction oriented perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction and to the depth direction. It is thus evident that by doing so it is possible to reduce the extension of the conduit along the transverse direction, and consequently increase the useful storage volume of any hanging cabinets in which the hood is recessed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, advantageously, the hood object of the present invention, by contracting the transverse extension of the conduit, is capable of reducing production costs, reducing the amount of raw materials necessary for the construction of the hood, facilitating installation operations by reducing the weight and bulk of the conduit, and allows an efficient storage of the hoods by maximising the number of units which can be placed in a given volume of space.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">LIST OF FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further features and advantages of the present description will become clearer from the indicative, and therefore non-limiting, description of a preferred but non-exclusive embodiment of a hood for extracting cooking fumes, as illustrated in the appended figures in which:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view from below of a hood in accordance with the present description;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a view from below of the hood of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a top view of the hood of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a front partially sectional view of the hood of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a front view of the hood of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with some parts removed to better illustrate others;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a perspective view of some components of the hood of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a front view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of some components of the hood of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to the accompanying figures, the present description relates to a hood <b>1</b> for extracting vapours and odours produced by food during cooking.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the hood <b>1</b> object of the present description comprises a base <b>2</b> having an intake opening <b>20</b> that can be facing a hob.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, but not necessarily, said base <b>2</b> is flat and extends along a transverse direction Y-Y and a depth direction Z-Z, in accordance with what is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Furthermore, the hood <b>1</b> object of the present description comprises a conduit <b>3</b> connected to the base <b>2</b> and extending mainly along a longitudinal direction X-X oriented orthogonally to the transverse direction Y-Y and to the depth direction Z-Z.
