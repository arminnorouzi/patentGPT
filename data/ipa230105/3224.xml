In certain known rotor structures, this sealing is typically done using one or more seals (e.g., O-rings) disposed between the tie-bolt and the bore of a shaft section of the rotor. A respective O-ring may thus be subject to the process fluid internal pressure on one side and to atmospheric pressure on the other side. The present inventors have recognized that such known rotor structures lack features that would allow monitoring an incipient leakage of the process fluid about the tie bolt. Additionally, such known rotor structures lack features that would allow conveying a sealing fluid (such as a dry sealing fluid) about the tie bolt.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Disclosed embodiments make use of an innovative venting/sealing arrangement providing reliable and cost-effective venting/sealing backups and/or venting/sealing redundancies, such as with features that may be effective for venting about the tie bolt so that, for example, an incipient leakage of the process fluid can be monitored and in turn malfunctioning seals can be appropriately and timely replaced before escalating to an undesirable condition. The venting may be carried out by way of a conduit&#x2014;drilled or otherwise constructed through a stub shaft&#x2014;that under certain operational conditions effectively functions as a vent. Additionally, such features may be effective for conveying an appropriately pressurized sealing fluid about the tie bolt effective for reducing the likelihood of the process fluid escaping to the atmosphere. The conveying of the sealing fluid to the tie bolt may be carried out by way of another conduit&#x2014;similarly drilled or otherwise constructed through the stub shaft&#x2014;that under certain operational conditions effectively permits conveying the sealing fluid to the tie bolt.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the following detailed description, various specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of such embodiments. However, those skilled in the art will understand that disclosed embodiments may be practiced without these specific details that the aspects of the present invention are not limited to the disclosed embodiments, and that aspects of the present invention may be practiced in a variety of alternative embodiments. In other instances, methods, procedures, and components, which would be well-understood by one skilled in the art have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessary and burdensome explanation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, various operations may be described as multiple discrete steps performed in a manner that is helpful for understanding embodiments of the present invention. However, the order of description should not be construed as to imply that these operations need be performed in the order they are presented, nor that they are even order dependent, unless otherwise indicated. Moreover, repeated usage of the phrase &#x201c;in one embodiment&#x201d; does not necessarily refer to the same embodiment, although it may. It is noted that disclosed embodiments need not be construed as mutually exclusive embodiments, since aspects of such disclosed embodiments may be appropriately combined by one skilled in the art depending on the needs of a given application.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a fragmentary cross-sectional view of one non-limiting embodiment of a disclosed rotor structure <b>100</b>, as may be used in industrial applications involving turbomachinery, such as without limitation, compressors (e.g., centrifugal compressors, etc.).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one disclosed embodiment, a tie bolt <b>102</b> extends axially between a pressurized (e.g., relatively high pressure) process side and an atmospheric pressure side of the turbomachine. As would be readily appreciated by one skilled in the art, a stub shaft <b>104</b><sub>1 </sub>is fixed to a first end of tie bolt <b>102</b>. A second stub shaft <b>104</b><sub>2 </sub>is fixed to a second end of tie bolt <b>102</b>. Second end of tie bolt <b>102</b> is axially opposite the first end of tie bolt <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The description will proceed in connection with a first venting/sealing arrangement arranged proximate the first end of tie bolt <b>102</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As would be appreciated by one skilled in the art, a second venting/sealing arrangement is arranged proximate the second end of tie bolt <b>102</b>. Since the first and second venting/sealing arrangements comprise identical structural and/or operational relationships in order to avoid pedantic and burdensome repetition the description will proceed in connection with just the first venting/sealing arrangement arranged proximate the first end of tie bolt <b>102</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Essentially, the first and second venting/sealing arrangements would exhibit structural symmetry with respect to one another about a radial plane <b>101</b> that cuts the longitudinal axis of the turbomachine.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one disclosed embodiment, a plurality of axially spaced apart annular seals <b>106</b>, such as annular seals <b>106</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>106</b><sub>2 </sub>through <b>106</b>, (e.g., O-rings) may be arranged about a segment of tie bolt <b>102</b> in correspondence with a radially-inward segment <b>108</b> of respective stub shaft <b>102</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the number of illustrated annular seals is equal to 5 and so in this example n=5.

In the foregoing example, four axially sequential chambers would be defined by annular seals <b>106</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>106</b><sub>2 </sub>through <b>106</b><sub>5</sub>. For the sake of simplicity of illustration just two of such chambers are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the general case, the relationship that defines the number of chambers formed by an n number of annular seals is n&#x2212;1.

It will be appreciated that the source of the sealing fluid and the venting outlet may be obtained by way of a dry fluid seal system <b>130</b>, such as is commonly used in process gas centrifugal compressors. Without limitation, dry fluid seal system <b>130</b> may involve a tandem seal configuration involving stationary and rotatable sealing elements. As would be appreciated by one skilled in the art, dry fluid seal system <b>130</b> may be disposed about the radially-outward segment <b>111</b> of the respective stub shaft <b>102</b> and, as noted above, may be used as the source of the sealing fluid and may be further used to provide a venting mechanism to a flow that may comprise the incipient leakage of the process fluid.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one non-limiting embodiment, a plurality of impeller stages <b>140</b> (just one is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may be disposed between stub shafts <b>104</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>104</b><sub>2</sub>.
