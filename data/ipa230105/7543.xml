Compared with long-term evolution (LTE), the 5G new radio (NR) technology have a much wider spectrum, for example, including millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands. With the development of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) and/or multiple-beam systems, the 5G NR may provide a much faster speed and much shorter latency. The 5G NR may include a development of an integrated access backhaul (IAB) implementation. The IAB implementation may include one or more IAB-donors and multiple connecting IAB-nodes. The IAB implementation may communicate between one or more IAB-donors and one or more IAB-nodes via wireless backhaul and relay links. The IAB implementation may provide a flexible NR cell configuration and increase cell density without increasing the density of IAB-donors.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">An IAB system may include one or more IAB-donors and one or more IAB-nodes, which collectively provide wireless connection service to one or more user equipment (UEs) (e.g., smartphones). The IAB-donors and IAB-nodes may be wireless network base stations including a NG radio access network (NG-RAN) base station, which may include a nodeB (NB, e.g., a gNB) in a mobile telecommunications context. The IAB-donor may provide access backhaul to one or more connecting child IAB-nodes, and may connect to a core network via a wired communication. In one implementation, the core network may include a 5G core network (5GC). In another implementation, the wired communication may include a fiber transport communication. The IAB-node may include wireless access link and wireless backhaul link. The wireless access link may be used for communication between a UE and the IAB-node. The wireless backhaul link may be used for communication between the IAB-node and the IAB-donor, and/or communications between one IAB-node with another IAB-node. Thus, the IAB-node does not need a wired communication network for data backhaul. In some implementations, the IAB-node does not include a wired communication network for data backhaul, so that IAB-node are more flexible and easier to implement, mitigating the burden of implementing wired communication network. The access link and backhaul link may use transmission bands with same frequency (known as in-band relay), or use transmission bands with different frequency (known as out-band relay).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the IAB-donor <b>130</b> may provide access backhaul <b>140</b> to one or more connecting child IAB-nodes (<b>152</b> and <b>154</b>). The IAB-donor <b>130</b> may connect to a core network <b>110</b> via a wired communication <b>120</b>. In one implementation, the core network <b>110</b> may include a 5G core network (5GC). In another implementation, the wired communication <b>120</b> may include a fiber transport communication.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">An IAB-donor may provide a wireless connection to one or more user equipment (UE). The UE may be a mobile device, for example, a smart phone or a mobile communication module disposed in a vehicle. For example, the IAB-donor <b>130</b> may provide a wireless connection <b>160</b> to a UE <b>172</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Similarly and without limitation, a child IAB-node may provide a wireless connection to one or more UEs. For example, the IAB-node <b>152</b> may provide a wireless connection <b>160</b> to a UE <b>174</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Similarly and without limitation, a child IAB-node may provide access backhaul to one or more downstream IAB-nodes. For example, the IAB-node <b>154</b> may provide access backhaul <b>140</b> to a downstream IAB-node <b>156</b> and a downstream IAB-node <b>157</b>. In the view of the IAB-node <b>154</b>, the IAB-node <b>156</b> may be called as a child IAB-node of the IAB-node <b>154</b>; and the IAB-node <b>157</b> may be called as a grandchild IAB-node of the IAB-node <b>154</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Similarly and without limitation, the grandchild IAB-node <b>157</b> may also provide access backhaul to one or more connecting great-grandchild IAB-nodes and/or provide wireless connection to one or more UEs (for example, UE <b>178</b>).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one implementation, the IAB system <b>100</b> may include another IAB-donor <b>135</b>. The IAB-donor <b>135</b> may also connect to the core network (e.g., 5GC) <b>110</b> via a wired communication <b>120</b>. The IAB-donor <b>135</b> may provide access backhaul <b>140</b> to one or more connecting child IAB-nodes <b>158</b>; and the IAB-node <b>158</b> may provide a wireless connection <b>160</b> to one or more UE <b>176</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The IAB-node <b>156</b>, which currently connects to the IAB-donor <b>130</b> via the IAB-node <b>154</b>, may migrate to the IAB-donor <b>135</b>. This may be called as an inter-donor migration and the IAB-node <b>156</b> may be called as a migrating IAB-node. Currently, there are problems and/or issues associated with updating data transmission for a downstream device (IAB-node or UE) during and/or after the inter-donor migration.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment with NR system, after inter-gNB migration, the target gNB may retransmit a portion of the data packets so as to ensure a continuation of the communication service to a UE. To minimize the portion of the data packets, the UE may send a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) status report to the target gNB. The PDCP status report may inform the target gNB the conditions (e.g., failure or success conditions) of the data packets received by the UE, and thus, the target gNB may decide which data packet is selected for retransmission or transmission. In the current system, UE's sending PDCP status report may be triggered by PDCP data recovery and/or PDCP re-establishment. In both implementations with the PDCP re-establishment and the PDCP data recovery, UE may need to retransmit PDCP protocol data units (PDUs) or PDCP service data units (SDUs) that have not been confirmed by a lower layer (for example, radio link control (RLC) layer).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one implementation with PDCP re-establishment, UE may send PDCP status report during inter-gNB migration by the following procedures. The target gNB may send a radio resource control (RRC) message via the source gNB. The RRC message may be configured inside a RRC container of the source gNB and the UE; the RRC message may also include an information element of re-establish PDCP. The information element of re-establish PDCP may trigger PDCP re-establishment procedure, and trigger UE to send PDCP status reporter. The UE may send the PDCP status report to target gNB after the connection between the UE and the target gNB is successfully established.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the IAB system, to avoid unnecessary retransmission of data packets and ensure service continuity, the UE may report the PDCP status report. However, some problems/issues occur. One of the problems/issues may include that, after the migrating IAB-node establishes connection between the IAB-node and target gNB-CU, a UE connecting with the migrating IAB-node may need be triggered to send PDCP status report to the target IAB-donor. The triggering events may include one of the PDCP data recovery procedure and the PDCP re-establishment procedure. This may lead to retransmission of data packets which could arrive at IAB-donor CU but was in the source route during the period of the migrating IAB-node's migration, then wasting network resources and resulting in low performance.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present disclosure describes embodiments of methods and devices of updating configuration information for at least one of the migrating IAB-node and/or the downstream devices of the migrating IAB-node during the inter-donor migration of the migrating IAB-node, addressing at least some of the problems discussed above.
