Thus, a can and a lid conveyed at a high speed can be continuously seamed while being transferred.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a lid supply device of a seaming device, a three-screw type (three-lid cutout roll type) lid supply device has been conventionally used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. The three-screw type lid supply device has a configuration in which a plurality of lids F, F, . . . are delivered downward in a state of being stacked inside a vertically extending path and separated one by one, with the lowermost end lid Fa engaging cutout grooves <b>521</b>, <b>521</b>, and <b>521</b> that are formed on the outer peripheries of three lid cutout rolls <b>520</b>, <b>520</b>, and <b>520</b> that are provided to rotate about a vertical rotating axis to separate the lids F, F, . . . from each other at their lower end and that are provided at even intervals in a circumferential direction while cutout of the remaining lids F, F, . . . is stopped by stoppers <b>522</b>, <b>522</b>, and <b>522</b>, the three lid cutout rolls <b>520</b>, <b>520</b>, and <b>520</b> are simultaneously rotated about the vertical rotating axis via gears <b>525</b>, <b>525</b>, and <b>525</b> and an internal gear <b>526</b> that couples the gears <b>525</b>, <b>525</b>, <b>525</b> to each other, and the lowermost end lid Fa is delivered to a pocket of a lid conveyance turret <b>550</b> while maintaining its horizontal posture along the cutout grooves <b>521</b>, <b>521</b>, and <b>521</b> of the respective lid cutout rolls <b>520</b>, <b>520</b>, and <b>520</b> (see Patent Literature 2).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the above three-screw type lid supply device has a complicated structure due to the three lid cutout rolls or the like and is therefore costly. Further, the device is not favorable in workability since its total weight is heavy at a time of disassembling and washing the same.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, a one-screw type (one-lid cutout type) lid supply device has also been proposed as another lid supply device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the one-screw type lid supply device has a configuration in which lids F, F, . . . are delivered downward in a state of being stacked inside an obliquely extending path, separated one by one, with the end edge of the lowermost end lid Fa engaging a cutout groove <b>621</b> of one lid cutout roll <b>620</b> provided to rotate about a vertical rotating axis to separate the lids F, F, . . . from each other at their lower end while cutout of the remaining lids F, F, . . . is stopped by a stopper <b>622</b>, caused to change to a horizontal state from a state inclined by the cutout groove <b>621</b>, and delivered to a pocket of a horizontal lid conveyance turret <b>650</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in the above one-screw type lid supply device, conveyance by the lid conveyance turret <b>650</b> starts with a curled part of the lowermost end lid Fa stacked. Therefore, a large pressing force due to the weight of the delivered lids F, F, . . . stacked in a large amount is received by the curled part. Therefore, the lid Fa is damaged or abrasion powder is generated and mixed in a product, which is not preferable from the viewpoint of product quality or hygiene.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">[Patent Literature]</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">[Patent Literature 1] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. S62-244537</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">[Patent Literature 2] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H08-324795</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention has been made in order to solve the above problems and has an object of providing a container member supply device that has favorable workability at a time of disassembly and washing and suppresses the occurrence of abrasion powder in a container member.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In order to solve the above problems, the present invention provides a container member supply device including:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0017">a container member separation unit that supplies a container member having a flange at a peripheral edge thereof to a pocket of a container member conveyance turret, one by one, wherein</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0018">the container member separation unit has a plurality of cutout parts, and one of the plurality of cutout parts is constituted by a cutout groove that is integrally provided on an upper outer periphery of the container member conveyance turret and engages with a flange of a container member.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0019">According to the container member supply device of the present invention, at least one of a plurality of cutout parts is constituted by a cutout groove that is integrally provided on the upper outer periphery of a container member conveyance turret and engages with a container member. Thus, the container member supply device has no need to arrange a multiplicity of cutout rolls around a container member separation unit and can therefore have a more simplified structure over conventional art. Accordingly, the container member supply device can provide favorable workability at a time of disassembly and washing. Further, the container member supply device has a cutout groove on the side of the container member conveyance turret. Therefore, damage on the flange of a container member or the occurrence of abrasion powder in the container member when the container member is cut out can be suppressed compared with a one-screw type container member supply device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">In a configuration in which one of the cutout parts is a cutout groove that is provided on a cutout roll and engages with a lid according to the present invention, the one cutout roll may only be arranged besides the container member conveyance turret. Therefore, it is possible to simplify the structure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">In a configuration in which the downwardly delivered container member is mounted in a pocket of the container member conveyance turret while maintaining its substantially parallel posture according to the present invention, the lowermost end container member can be reliably separated and transferred to a pocket of the container member conveyance turret with its flange at the peripheral edge of the container member not stacked. Therefore, damage on the flange of the container member or the occurrence of abrasion powder in the container member can be further suppressed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view showing an example of the configuration of a seaming device in which a container member supply device (lid supply device) according to an embodiment of the present invention is provided.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing an example of the configuration of the seaming device in which the container member supply device (lid supply device) according to the embodiment of the present invention is provided.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view showing an example of the configuration of a lid supply device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view showing an example of a cutout groove and a lid cutout roll in the lid supply device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a plan view of a conventional three-screw type lid supply device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a front partially cross-sectional view of the lid supply device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a plan view of a conventional one-screw type lid supply device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a front partially cross-sectional view of the lid supply device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0030">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031">A seaming device that seams a lid to a can is cited as an example of a device having a container member supply device (lid supply device) according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a seaming device <b>100</b> includes: a seaming turret <b>101</b> that performs the seaming process of a can C and a lid F;
