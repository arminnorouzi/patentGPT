id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">An electrically and magnetically enhanced ionized physical vapor deposition (I-PVD) magnetron apparatus and method is provided for sputtering material from a cathode target on a substrate, and in particular, for sputtering ceramic and diamond-like coatings. The electrically and magnetically enhanced magnetron sputtering source has unbalanced magnetic fields that couple the cathode target and additional electrode together. The additional electrode is electrically isolated from ground and connected to a power supply that can generate positive, negative, or bipolar high frequency voltages, and is preferably a radio frequency (RF) power supply. RF discharge near the additional electrode increases plasma density and a degree of ionization of sputtered material atoms.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

An example of such an apparatus and process is described in U.S. Publication No. 2008/0190760A1, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The I-PVD sputtering source is a magnetron sputtering source, in which magnetic field lines terminate on a target surface. The resputtering process, which is sputter etching, can be performed with argon gas ions or sputtered copper ions. In order to increase ionization of the gas and sputtered material ions, an ICP coil is positioned in a vacuum chamber between a magnetron sputtering source and a substrate.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disclosed embodiments relate to an electrically and magnetically enhanced I-PVD unbalanced magnetron and non-magnetron apparatus and method for sputtering.

The plasma source <b>1800</b> includes two magnetrons positioned adjacent to each other. One magnetron has a round target and the other magnetron has a ring-shaped target positioned around the round target. The round magnetron includes a cusp magnetic field geometry on a cathode target surface. The cusp magnetic field can form one or two race tracks on the ring cathode target surface. The cusp magnetic field provides magnetic coupling between the round target and the ring-shaped target. The magnetic coupling can be between the ring-shaped cathode target and an edge or center of the magnetron configuration positioned behind the round target. A primary purpose of the ring magnetron includes providing energetic electrons for discharge on the round magnetron in order to increase the degree of ionization of sputtered target material atoms from the round cathode target. During operation, the electrons formed by gas discharge on the ring-shaped cathode target drift towards the round cathode target and increase plasma density near the round cathode target. In an embodiment, the ring magnetron is connected to a high voltage pulse power supply or high power pulse power supply that can generate current density on the ring-shaped cathode target in the range of 0.1-3.0 A/cm<sup>2</sup>. In an embodiment, voltage pulse duration is in a range of 3-200 &#x3bc;s and frequency is in a range of 200 Hz-200 KHz. In an embodiment, voltage pulse duration is in the range of 1000 &#x3bc;s and 10000 &#x3bc;s. In an embodiment, voltage pulse frequency is in the range of 1 Hz and 200 Hz. Pulse voltage amplitude is in a range of 500-3000V. In an embodiment, a high power pulse power supply can generate voltage pulses with durations between 1 ms and 20 ms. In general, any power supply that can generate magnetron discharge can be connected to the ring magnetron. In an embodiment, the pulse negative voltage amplitude is the range of 500 V and 3000 V. In an embodiment, a pulse power supply that generates magnetron discharge on a ring magnetron is an asymmetrical bipolar power supply. In an embodiment, the negative voltage amplitude can be in the range of 400 V and 3000 V. In an embodiment, the positive voltage amplitude can be in the range of 40 V and 500 V. At the same time, the round electrode is connected to a variable DC (direct current) power supply that can generate and sustain discharge voltage in a range of 200-700 V. The variable DC power supply can operate in power control mode or in voltage control mode. If the variable DC power supply operates in power control mode during the pulse discharge, the electrons from the ring-shaped cathode target discharge drift towards the round cathode target surface, reduce the discharge voltage, and increase the discharge current. In an embodiment, ring magnetron and round magnetron are connected to the pulse power supplies. The voltage pulses from two power supplies can be synchronized in time. In an embodiment, voltage pulses can be applied simultaneously or with time shift. In an embodiment, the duration of the voltage pulses applied to the ring magnetron is 10 times less than duration of the pulses applied to the round magnetron.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">This operation is very useful, for example, for sputtering indium tin oxide (ITO) films. In this case, the round cathode target voltage, during the sputtering process, can be low and, therefore, plasma damage of the growing film is also low. Low damaged sputtered films exhibit high electrical conductivity.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The power applied to the additional magnetron ring discharge controls the degree of ionization of sputtered target material atoms from the round magnetron. Additional magnetron ring discharge can be used to perform re-sputtering of previously sputtered film on the substrate. The re-sputtering process is advantageous for forming thin film coatings inside a via or trench on a substrate. The re-sputtering process can be performed with sputtered target material ions, feed gas ions, or a combination thereof. During the re-sputtering process, the ring magnetron can be connected to a radio frequency (RF) power supply. In an embodiment, the ring magnetron inductively grounded.
