While effective, these techniques have proven to have considerable undesirable physical impacts of increasing erosion to adjacent land forms or other &#x201c;down-stream&#x201d; natural resources. This is primarily due to the hardness of these structures which reflect and/or transmit the energy contained in waves, currents, and scour from moving water onto the nearby landforms which have not been &#x201c;hardened&#x201d; through the installation of structural elements. The reflection of waves, currents, and scour results in increased erosion of adjacent resources such as beaches, tidal areas, subsurface features immersed in water, river courses, lakebeds, and important upland land features which often protect other structures such as homes, roadways, and utilities.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To address damage to adjacent resources, many regulatory agencies, environmental advocacy organizations, and environmental contractors have embraced bioengineering and the &#x201c;Living Shoreline&#x201d; approach, which is now a nationally-known campaign by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the United States of America. In some US states, state wetland regulations prohibit the use of conventional hard engineering structures to protect structures on properties. In these instances, &#x201c;soft&#x201d;, bioengineering measures such as those promoted by the NOAA Living Shoreline program are the only alternatives available for coastal property owners. Unfortunately, bioengineering measures promoted by the Living Shorelines program are not robust or structurally sound enough to defend against erosion in portions of the shoreline which are exposed to higher intensity storms such as oceanfront areas, coastal bays, larger estuaries, larger rivers, and lakes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional, environmentally friendly bioengineering approaches for stabilizing the base of landforms along exposed shorelines can provide structural integrity at the toe of landforms near the shoreline in order to stabilize these landforms. While these approaches are all somewhat effective at stabilizing exposed landforms, they are generally believed to have much lower success when used along ocean fronting land forms, within larger estuaries, larger rivers, and along the shorelines of larger lakes. It is important to note that an effective and reliable strategy for soft bioengineering methodology presently does not exist for most of the oceanfront, larger estuaries, larger rivers, and along the shorelines of larger lakes. Therefore, the owners of real estate must rely on conventional hard engineering structures, which typically exacerbate shoreline erosion in nearby locations or must rely on substandard soft engineering alternatives which are not robust enough for the given site conditions and level of exposure.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention addresses the problems of conventional bioengineering installations by providing an erosion control apparatus and methods of installing same. Fiber rolls and fabric encapsulated soil (FES) lifts are combined in anchored configurations together with synthetic mesh netting, to create bioengineered installations with greater durability, greater resistance to storm, sea and water erosion, and corresponding longer useful life, lengthening repair cycles and facilitating the repair process.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, an erosion control apparatus comprises a plurality of fiber rolls, wherein the rolls are arranged relative to a contour of a shoreline; a plurality of anchors coupled to the fiber rolls, the anchors inserted at a depth through the apparatus; a plurality of soil lifts comprising fiber, the soil lifts are connected to the fiber rolls. A mesh can comprise a layer contacting the soil lifts, wherein the anchors pass through the mesh and the soil lifts and optionally enter the soil underneath the apparatus. This operates to distribute the anchoring force across the system. The fiber rolls are situated directly over a plurality of anchors at different levels of the system so that coupling of the system elements causes compression and loading of the anchor system. Thus, the weight of the entire system serves to aid in the retention of the anchor placements.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The plurality of fiber rolls can comprise a coir fiber and can be either high density or low density. In an embodiment, the plurality of anchors are duckbill anchors. The anchors can be spaced at intervals across each fiber roll to distribute loading across the structure. Each anchor can include a cable or rod connected to an anchor point surface sized to support an overlying cone of material. In an embodiment, the intervals range from twenty-four inches to thirty inches, for example. In an embodiment, the anchors can be inserted at a depth of at least forty-two inches below a slope or grade of the apparatus and can provide at least three thousand pounds of holding force at each insertion point. The anchors preferably extend at an angle that is orthogonal to the plane of the rolls. However, certain embodiments can be configured such that the anchors extend at an angle that is within 45 degrees of the orthogonal direction, or preferably within 30 degrees of the orthogonal direction from the plane of the rolls.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The soil lifts can comprise at least one layer of coir fabric and may be configured to retain sediment. In some embodiments, the sediment is compacted and can have a depth of at least twelve inches. In some embodiment, the mesh contacting the soil lifts comprises polypropylene, polyethylene, or similar synthetic material. In other embodiments, the mesh comprises coir fiber.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the apparatus further comprises at least a first trench at a highest end of the apparatus. In further embodiments, the apparatus further comprises a second trench located at a lowest end of the apparatus. Each trench can be backfilled with sand or soil. In some embodiments, the first trench and the second trench are at least six inches wide and at least six inches deep. In some embodiments, each trench is covered with sand or soil.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the apparatus further comprises plant material on or with at least one fiber roll.

and methods, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. In this application, the use of &#x201c;or&#x201d; means &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term &#x201c;including&#x201d;, as well as other forms, such as &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and &#x201c;included&#x201d;, is not limiting. Any range described herein will be understood to include the endpoints and all values between the endpoints.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Prior to this disclosure, there has not been a reliable and robust bioengineering method of stabilizing an exposed landform in locations of higher erosion risk, such as oceanfront, estuarine, riverfront, lakefront, and other features of land bordering a body of water.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present disclosure incorporates the benefits of mass and weight of sediment-filled lifts and the benefits of fiber rolls to prevent sediment from liquefying and flowing through the fabric in storm or flooding events. The present disclosure also relies on anchoring the fiber rolls with the use of earth anchors. The earth anchors can include different structures such as helical-style anchors and duckbill-style anchors, provided they can be positioned below grade and provide superior holding power. In some embodiments, the earth anchors are produced by A. B. Chance Company located in Centralia, Mo. In some embodiments, the anchors are rock anchors such as those produced by MilSpec&#xae; Anchors located in Alexander City, Ala. In an embodiment, earth anchors provide a minimum of 3,000 pounds of holding force at each anchor point. In an embodiment, each element of the disclosed apparatus provides a minimum of 3,000 pounds of holding force. Anchor points are installed at intervals of approximately twenty-four to thirty inches along an edge of each fiber roll. In some embodiments, anchor points are installed at intervals of approximately twenty-four to ninety-six inches along an edge of each fiber roll. In an embodiment, the anchor points are installed every thirty inches from along the top and bottom edge of each fiber roll.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Prior to this disclosure, property owners were faced with choosing between substandard, soft bioengineering techniques which require frequent repairs or fail during storm conditions. Such conditions increase the forces of moving water on the bioengineering components or conventional engineering approaches which tend to reflect storm energy and exacerbate erosion damage to adjacent or down-stream natural resources. Neither conventional engineering approaches or prior bioengineering techniques were well-matched for sea level rise. Conventional engineering measures for erosion control do not support plants and often cannot be expanded in a modular technique without major foundational reconstruction. While fiber rolls and similar bioengineering methods provide good support for the root systems of plants, the inability to hold the fiber rolls in place during a storm event undermines the ability for plants to become established as the plants are damaged every time the array becomes dislodged. Successful bioengineering relies extensively on the integrity of the plant root systems for long-term performance.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present disclosure not only provides substantially more structural integrity than any other bioengineering method for shoreline protection, but due to its superior structural integrity and ability to support plant growth, the important role plants play in all bioengineering designs is enhanced and secured on a substantially longer timeframe. The disclosed apparatus are also readily expandable, making it possible to increase the number of lifts over time by simply constructing more lifts on the top or sides of the array without making any other structural changes to the array or damaging the supporting bioengineering materials and plants. In some instances, more than one apparatus can be installed at the same site vertically, horizontally, or a combination thereof. Conversely, conventional engineering methods such as sea walls often require substantial increases in their foundation or embedment below grade before their height can be increased. The expandability of the present disclosure makes it a preferred alternative in marine environments undergoing sea level rise.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The disclosed apparatus, in some embodiments, is installed in a site above ground water in the surrounding soil. In other embodiments, the lowest section of the disclosed apparatus is inserted no more than one foot into ground water.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a side view of an erosion control apparatus, according to some embodiments. The apparatus <b>100</b> comprises at least one coir fiber roll <b>110</b>. The coir fiber rolls <b>110</b> may be either high density or low density. For one example, 20&#x2033; diameter by 10&#x2032; long, high density fiber rolls are measured at a nine pound per cubic foot density, comprised of a mattress of inner coir fibers encased in a UV stabilized synthetic polypropylene mesh. Alternatively, the high density fiber rolls are comprised of a mattress of inner coir fibers encased in a 100% biodegradable coir rope mesh. In a further example, 20&#x2033; diameter by 20&#x2032; long, low density fiber rolls are measured at a seven pound per cubic foot density, comprised of a mattress of inner coir fibers encased in a UV stabilized synthetic polypropylene mesh. In some embodiments, some or all of the low density fiber rolls are 20&#x2033; diameter by 10&#x2032; long.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The coir fiber rolls <b>110</b> are arranged along a shoreline, riverbank, lakefront, or other waterfront. The soil behind the coir fiber rolls <b>110</b>, relative to the shoreline, riverbank, lakefront, or other waterfront, may be graded. In some embodiments, the soil is graded at a slope angle in a range of 0 to 45 degrees (1:1 slope). In an embodiment, the soil is graded at a slope angle in a range of 20 to 50 degrees. In a further embodiment, the soil is graded at a slope angle no greater than 33 degrees (2:1 slope). The slope angle may be 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 degrees, or any angle in between. In some embodiments, the soil of the apparatus <b>100</b> can include varying slope angles throughout the apparatus <b>100</b>. The coir fiber rolls are described in greater detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.

The anchors <b>120</b> may be referred to as &#x201c;earth anchors&#x201d; and may be helical-style anchors, duckbill-style anchors, or any other type of anchor that can be driven below grade. The anchors <b>120</b> are inserted at a specified depth into the soil lifts <b>130</b> or the soil underneath the apparatus <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the anchors <b>120</b> are inserted adjacent to the plurality of the coir fiber rolls <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, each anchor <b>120</b> provides a minimum of three thousand pounds of holding force. The distribution of anchors is described with more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an embodiment, the anchors <b>120</b> are installed across a face of the coir fiber rolls <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the anchors <b>120</b> are inserted adjacent to the coir fiber rolls <b>110</b> to secure the coir fiber rolls <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the anchors <b>120</b> are inserted adjacent to multiple coir fiber rolls <b>110</b>. The anchoring system of the apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises &#xbc;&#x2033; galvanized aircraft cable <b>116</b> and zinc-coated copper crimps. The crimps are used to form a loop in the cable <b>116</b>. Cables <b>116</b> are attached to each earth anchor <b>120</b> by forming a loop with a crimp. One cable <b>116</b> may be joined to another cable <b>116</b> by securing two loops together. These cables <b>116</b> form a network of cables <b>116</b> which harness the coir fiber rolls <b>110</b> and all tie back to the individual anchors <b>120</b> to create a high degree of integrity. The anchors <b>120</b> are placed to a depth of at least 42&#x2033; below finished slope grade into naturally or artificially compacted soil using a hardened steel driving rod. Deeper anchor placements can be used with greater slope angles or more exposed formations.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises a plurality of fiber encased soil lifts <b>130</b>. The soil lifts <b>130</b> can comprise two layers of seven hundred-gram (or heavier) woven coir fabric encased by high tenacity polypropylene or polyethylene synthetic mesh <b>140</b> that is resistant to ripping. The soil lifts <b>130</b> are configured to retain sediment and allow the sediment to naturally compact within the soil lift <b>130</b>. All sediment in each soil lift <b>130</b> preferably has a consistent depth of approximately 12&#x2033;, but the depth of each soil lift <b>130</b> can vary across the apparatus <b>100</b>. The sediment in each soil lift <b>130</b> can be compacted using a portable plate compactor at 6&#x2033; soil depth intervals.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, each soil lift <b>130</b> in an apparatus <b>100</b> is of uniform length.

In some embodiments, the top soil lift <b>130</b> has a length of eight feet and each other soil lift <b>130</b> has a length of four feet.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The soil lifts <b>130</b> are connected to the coir fiber rolls <b>110</b>. Additional soil lifts <b>130</b> can be added to the apparatus <b>100</b> over time by constructing the additional soil lifts <b>130</b> onto the top of the coir fiber rolls <b>110</b>, for example. The completed series of coir fiber rolls and soil lifts may be referred to as a protection array, configured to protect a shoreline. In some embodiments, the coir fiber rolls <b>110</b> are incorporated into, or encapsulated within, the soil lifts <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the soil lifts <b>130</b> can optionally be coupled to one another by fasteners or coupling elements <b>108</b> such as stakes, hog rings, or clips. As an example, hog rings may be inserted through two adjacent soil lifts <b>130</b> and subsequently bent with pliers, or other manipulation means, to bend the hog rings into a circular shape to couple the adjacent soil lifts <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the fasteners or coupling elements <b>108</b> are stainless steel. In some embodiments, rope is weaved through the surface of adjacent soil lifts <b>130</b> to couple the soil lifts <b>130</b>. The fasteners or coupling elements <b>108</b> serve to mechanically couple the soil lifts <b>130</b> together.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The synthetic mesh <b>140</b> is incorporated as an outward layer of fabric used for developing fabric encased soil lifts. In some embodiments, the mesh <b>140</b> comprises raschel polypropylene knotless netting, 3 mm high tenacity (rip resistant), 1&#xbd;&#x2033; mesh opening, with enhanced UV stabilization.

Such formed blocks, cylinders, or other desired shapes can be attached to fiber rolls by cables, rods, or other coupling fixtures. These can be attached by threaded fixtures or formed loops to the formed components.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B</figref> are side views of an anchoring system including helical anchors according to some embodiments. Each helical anchor <b>1520</b> includes a cable <b>1516</b>. The cables <b>1516</b> are coupled to fiber rolls <b>110</b> with crimps <b>1517</b>. The crimps <b>1517</b> tighten and fasten the cables <b>1516</b>. In some embodiments, the crimps <b>1517</b> are zinc plated copper crimps. A method of installing an erosion control apparatus including helical anchors <b>1520</b> is described below.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">According to some embodiments, installation of an erosion control apparatus begins with preparation of the soil at an excavation site. The soil is compacted and graded at a specified slope angle. In some embodiments, the soil is graded at a slope angle in a range of 0 to 45 degrees (1:1 slope). In an embodiment, the soil is graded at a slope angle in a range of 20 to 50 degrees. In a further embodiment, the soil is graded at a slope angle no greater than 33 degrees (2:1 slope). The slope angle may be 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 degrees, or any angle in between. In some embodiments, the soil of the apparatus can include varying slope angles throughout the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Next a plurality of anchors are selected. The anchors may be helical anchors including a cable connected to an anchor point surface sized to support an overlying cone of material. The anchors provide at least 3,000 pounds of holding force at each insertion point. After the anchors are selected, the anchors are spaced approximately every twenty-four to thirty inches. In one embodiment, at least twenty to twenty-nine anchors are inserted per one hundred square feet.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Then, a layer of mesh is placed within an excavated site. The mesh may comprise raschel polypropylene knotless netting (or comparable equivalent), 3 mm high tenacity (rip resistant), 1&#xbd;&#x2033; mesh opening, with UV stabilization, or may comprise polyethylene or coir fiber. The netting can be biodegradable or in a preferred embodiment is non-photodegradable. In some embodiments, the mesh opening can range from &#xbd;&#x2033; to 7&#x2033;. Next, at least one layer of coir fabric is placed over the mesh. In some embodiments, two layers of seven hundred gram (or heavier) coir fabric is layered over the mesh. In some embodiments, one or two layers of 700-gram woven coir fabric encased by high tenacity (rip resistant) polypropylene synthetic mesh comprise a soil lift.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Coir fiber rolls are then arranged in the site relative to the shoreline and connected within the soil lifts. A coir fiber roll may be a 20&#x2033; diameter by 10&#x2032; long, measured at a nine pound per cubic foot density, comprised of a mattress of inner coir fibers encased in a UV stabilized synthetic polypropylene mesh. Alternatively, the coir fiber roll may be a mattress of inner coir fibers encased in a 100% biodegradable coir rope mesh.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Next the anchor cables are passed through the mesh, the layer of coir fabric, the plurality of coir fiber rolls, and the soil lifts. Passing the anchors through the mesh, coir fabric, fiber rolls, and soil lifts of the apparatus overlaps the frustum cone of each anchor with the mesh, coir fabric, fiber rolls, and soil lifts, sharing the loads of each anchor with the mesh, coir fabric, fiber rolls, and soil lifts of the apparatus. Such an overlap provides for stronger reinforcement of the area within the frustum cone of each anchor.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Then the mesh and the coir fabric are folded over the coir fiber rolls and soil lifts. In an embodiment, the number of coir fiber rolls in the apparatus and the number of coir fiber rolls covered by the mesh are determined by specific design criteria varying with each installation site. In an embodiment, the mesh is installed as each lift is constructed. The completed series of coir fiber rolls and soil lifts may be referred to as a protection array.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The cables are then tightened and fastened to the coir fiber rolls. In some embodiments, each cable is tightened and fastened with a crimp. In further embodiments, the crimps are zinc plated copper crimps. The crimps may be attached an end of the cable opposite the end of the anchor comprising the anchor surface area.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some embodiments, after the cables are fastened at least one coir fiber roll is filled with plant material as described above. Next at least one biodegradable erosion control blanket is installed and secured with posts inserted along at least a first fiber roll as described above. A first trench is excavated at a highest end of the apparatus and a second trench is excavated at a lowest end of the apparatus as described above. The trenches are backfilled, seeded, and lightly mulched with sterilized, weed-free chopped straw or comparable equivalent mulch product.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref> is a side view of an anchor cable system according to some embodiments.
