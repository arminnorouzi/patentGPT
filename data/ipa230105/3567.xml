Obviously, the embodiment is just a part of embodiments of the present invention, not all of them. Based on the embodiment of the present invention, all the other embodiments obtained by those ordinarily skilled in the art without making creative endeavors shall fall into the scope of protection of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the background art, there are no devices in cities supporting real-time monitoring and early warning of urban waterlogging, and only some navigation software allows users to report ponded sections. As a result, only the roads reported by the users can be inquired for ponding information, which may not be the latest news. Drivers and pedestrians are thereby limited to the capable mobile phone software for ponding information, which is far from achieving real-time monitoring and on-site warning effects.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly, the water gauge for on-site monitoring and early warning disclosed in the embodiment of the present invention comprises a control part <b>3</b>, an alarm part <b>1</b> and a retractable part <b>2</b>. If the device is placed into the waterlogging-prone section in advance and the retractable water gauge is raised to the highest level, when the water on the road rises to the warning line of 30 cm set on the water gauge during a rainstorm, the warning light on the top of the water gauge will start to flash. At the same time, the water gauge will give an alarm through the speaker, reminding the pedestrians and vehicles not to pass the section for the time being, to avoid the risk of drowning or vehicle breakdown.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Specifically, an embodiment of the present invention discloses a water gauge for on-site monitoring and early warning, as shown in FIGURE, which comprises an alarm part <b>1</b>, a control part <b>3</b> and a retractable part <b>2</b>. The retractable part <b>2</b> is fixedly connected with the alarm part <b>1</b> at the top, and the control part <b>3</b> at the bottom; the alarm part <b>1</b> is electrically connected with the control part <b>3</b> through a wire; the control part <b>3</b> compares the water level measured by the retractable part <b>2</b> with a preset threshold, to determine whether the alarm part <b>1</b> needs to give an alarm.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, the retractable part <b>2</b> measures the water level, compares it with a preset threshold, and determines the alarm level according to water depth. For example, a water depth of 5 cm can be determined as a Level 1 alarm, indicating that there is no danger, but the passers should pass the section carefully, and the alarm level will be higher as the water depth increases.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">To further optimize the above technical scheme, the control part <b>3</b> comprises a control box, a circuit board and a battery. The battery is placed at the bottom of the control box; the circuit board is installed in the control box; the battery powers the circuit board.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">To further optimize the above technical scheme, the circuit board comprises a wireless charging module, a control module and a wireless communication module. The wireless charging module is electrically connected to the battery; the control module is connected to the alarm part <b>1</b> and the wireless communication module; the wireless communication module wirelessly interacts with the cloud.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To further optimize the above technical scheme, the alarm part <b>1</b> consists of one or more of a visual alarm, an auditory alarm, a tactile alarm and an olfactory alarm.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Specifically, different alarm devices are optional, among which visual and audible alarms are the most common.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">To further optimize the above technical scheme, the alarm part <b>1</b> comprises an insulating housing and a sensor set in it. The sensor is used to detect the current water level.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">To further optimize the above technical scheme, the insulating housing comprises outer and inner tubes. The inner tube in n sections is sleeved with the outer tube, and slides inside the said outer tube.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">To further optimize the above technical scheme, the water gauge further comprises a level gauge, to determine the inclination angle of the retractable part.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Specifically, the setting of the level gauge ensures that the water level can be corrected according to the inclination angle of the level gauge, to prevent any false alarms. For example, with an angle between the retractable part <b>2</b> and the horizontal plane of 60 degrees, and a water level of 30 cm, the control part <b>3</b> can calculate the actual water level of 25.98 cm based on the trigonometric function, which does not reach the alarm level.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">To further optimize the above technical scheme, the water gauge further comprises a cloud server and a terminal. The cloud server communicates with the wireless communication module and the terminal.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Specifically, when the waterlogged water level comes to a certain scale on the water gauge placed beside the target road section, the sensor in the retractable part <b>2</b> transmits the current water data to the control part <b>3</b>, which is then transmitted to the cloud server through the wireless communication module of the control part <b>3</b>, and further to the terminal through the cloud server. When the water depth reaches the warning line of 30 cm set on the water gauge, the controller triggers the warning light to flash continuously, and the waterproof speaker to give the instruction of &#x201c;pedestrians and vehicles are prohibited from passing this section&#x201d; until the water subsides below the warning line.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each embodiment in this specification is described in a progressive manner, focusing on its differences from other embodiments, and the same and similar parts between embodiments can be referred to mutually. For the device disclosed in the embodiment, the description is relatively simple since it corresponds to the method disclosed in the embodiment, and reference can be made to the method description section when needed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The above description of the disclosed embodiment enables those skilled in the art to practice or use the present invention. Modifications to these embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein can be implemented in other embodiments without departing from the essence or scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention will not be limited to the embodiment described herein, but will cover the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
