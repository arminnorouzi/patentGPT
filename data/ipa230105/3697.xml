The state of the art approach to evaluate the extent or risk of carry over is described by regulatory guidelines like CLSI C62-A (Lynch (2016), Clinical Chemistry 62(1):24-29). These guidelines suggest assessing carry over during method development as well as verification and validation phase by using a blank sample after a high concentrated sample. The resulting peak area of these blank samples is used to calculate the potential carry over. Zeng et al. (2006), Rapid Comm Mass Spectrom 20:635 teaches estimating the influence of the preceding sample on the peak area of an analyte in a following sample based on the concentration of the analyte in the preceding sample in an HPLC-MS system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An evaluation of carry over during method development gives a general overview on the risk of carry over and its extent. But this approach is not suitable to provide information on an actual sample measurement. For batch mode analysis, usually a re-analysis of samples following high concentrated samples is triggered, but this is not feasible in the case of random access where the analyte of the previous sample is different to the analyte of the actual one.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is still a need in the art for means and methods assisting in detecting and, if possible, correcting for, carry over in LC-MS measurements.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for determining a carry over of an analyte from a previous sample into a sample of interest on a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer (LC-MS) device is provided, the method comprising the following steps: (a) providing at least one chromatogram of said sample of interest on said LC-MS device; (b) determining a background height of the chromatogram; and (c) determining the carry over of the analyte from said previous sample into the sample of interest based on the background height.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, a system for determining a concentration of at least one analyte in a sample is provided comprising: (I) at least one liquid chromatography mass spectrometer (LC-MS) device, wherein the LC-MS device is configured for measuring the analyte in the sample and for determining at least one chromatogram, and (II) at least one evaluation device, wherein the evaluation device is configured to determine a background height of the chromatogram and for determining a carry over based on the background height.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for determining a relationship between a background height and a carry over of an analyte on a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer device, the method comprising the following steps: (i) conducting at least one first measurement for a first sample; (ii) conducting at least one second measurement for a second sample and determining at least one chromatogram thereof, wherein said second sample is devoid of said analyte; (iii) determining an apparent amount or a signal corresponding thereto of the analyte in said second sample; (iv) determining a background height of the chromatogram; and (v) repeating steps (i) to (iv) for at least two further first samples, said first samples comprising non-identical concentrations of said analyte, (vi) correlating the apparent amount of the analyte or a signal corresponding thereto determined in steps (iii) with the background heights determined in step (iv), (vii) thereby, determining a relationship between a background height and a carry over of an analyte.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other features and advantages of the embodiments of the present disclosure will be more fully understood from the following detailed description taken together with the accompanying claims.

As used in the following, the terms &#x201c;have&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; or &#x201c;include&#x201d; or any arbitrary grammatical variations thereof are used in a non-exclusive way. Thus, these terms may both refer to a situation in which, besides the feature introduced by these terms, no further features are present in the entity described in this context and to a situation in which one or more further features are present. As an example, the expressions &#x201c;A has B&#x201d;, &#x201c;A comprises B&#x201d; and &#x201c;A includes B&#x201d; may both refer to a situation in which, besides B, no other element is present in A (i.e., a situation in which A solely and exclusively consists of B) and to a situation in which, besides B, one or more further elements are present in entity A, such as element C, elements C and D or even further elements. Also, as is understood by the skilled person, the expressions &#x201c;comprising a&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprising an&#x201d; typically refer to &#x201c;comprising one or more&#x201d;, i.e., are equivalent to &#x201c;comprising at least one&#x201d;. Likewise, the term &#x201c;determining an X&#x201d; refers to determining one X, as well as to determining more than one of X, e.g., two, three, or four of X. Also, the term &#x201c;plurality&#x201d; relates to a multitude, in an embodiment at least two, in a further embodiment, in a further embodiment at least three in a further embodiment at least for, in a further embodiment at least five, of the indicated items.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, as used in the following, the terms &#x201c;typically&#x201d;, &#x201c;more typically&#x201d;, &#x201c;most typically&#x201d;, &#x201c;particularly&#x201d;, &#x201c;more particularly&#x201d;, &#x201c;specifically&#x201d;, &#x201c;more specifically&#x201d; or similar terms are used in conjunction with optional features, without restricting further possibilities. Thus, features introduced by these terms are optional features and are not intended to restrict the scope of the claims in any way. The present disclosure may, as the skilled person will recognize, be performed by using alternative features. Similarly, features introduced by &#x201c;in an embodiment&#x201d; or similar expressions are intended to be optional features, without any restriction regarding further embodiments of the present disclosure, without any restrictions regarding the scope of the present disclosure and without any restriction regarding the possibility of combining the features introduced in such way with other optional or non-optional features of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; relates to the indicated value with the commonly accepted technical precision in the relevant field, typically relates to the indicated value &#xb1;20%, more typically &#xb1;10%, most typically &#xb1;5%. Further, the term &#x201c;essentially&#x201d; indicates that deviations having influence on the indicated result or use are absent, i.e., potential deviations do not cause the indicated result to deviate by more than &#xb1;20%, more typically &#xb1;10%, most typically &#xb1;5%. Thus, &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; means including the components specified but excluding other components except for materials present as impurities, unavoidable materials present as a result of processes used to provide the components, and components added for a purpose other than achieving the technical effect of the present disclosure. For example, a composition defined using the phrase &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; encompasses any known acceptable additive, excipient, diluent, carrier, and the like. Typically, a composition consisting essentially of a set of components will comprise less than 5% by weight, more typically less than 3% by weight, even more typically less than 1%, most typically less than 0.1% by weight of non-specified component(s). As referred to herein, measured and calculated parameters are described on an exemplary basis; as the skilled person understands, the parameters may be modified by standard mathematical operations, in particular by multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, reciprocal forming, scaling, and other operations known to the skilled person; in an embodiment, references are adjusted accordingly, in particular by applying the same mathematical operations. Measured and calculated parameters may also be used in the calculation of a score, which may be calculated on the basis of one or more parameter values, which may optionally be weighted, and/or by further mathematical operations in particular as specified above, e.g., scaling.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The method for determining a carry over is an in vitro method. Moreover, it may comprise steps in addition to those explicitly mentioned above. For example, further steps may relate, e.g., to providing a sample for step a), or further calculations in step b) and/or c). Moreover, one or more of said steps may be performed by automated equipment. In an embodiment, in particular steps b) and c) are performed by a processor, in particular by a computer, which may be configured as an evaluation device, as specified elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term &#x201c;providing&#x201d;, as used herein, relates to making available the indicated information or object. Thus, in case of providing a chromatogram, the chromatogram may be provided as data, e.g., as a graphical representation, as a list of measurement values, e.g., as value pairs such as elution time/quantifier value pairs and/or elution time/qualifier value pairs, or as a mathematical model. The chromatogram may be provided via any medium deemed appropriate by the skilled person, in particular via an operative connection between an MS device and an evaluation device, via a data connection such as a data network, or via a data storage medium. In an embodiment, providing is determining as specified herein below.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term &#x201c;determining&#x201d; is understood by the skilled person as referring to settling on, concluding on, or ascertaining a fact and/or data. Thus, in an embodiment, determining relates to a qualitative determination; in a further embodiment, to a semiquantitative determination; in a further embodiment, to a quantitative determination. Thus, &#x201c;determining a carry over&#x201d; includes establishing the fact that carry over occurred (qualitative determination), establishing whether the extent of carry over is within acceptable limits (semiquantitative determination), as well as establishing the quantity of carry over (quantitative determination). In an embodiment, determining relates to quantitative determination. Also, &#x201c;determining a chromatogram&#x201d; relates to measuring a chromatogram, specifically recording, and optionally storing on a suitable storage device, data points representing a signal of an LC/MS device recorded over the progress of an LC/MS run. As the skilled person understands, in the case of determining a chromatogram, determination in an embodiment is quantitative. Similarly, &#x201c;determining a background height&#x201d;, in an embodiment, is quantitatively ascertaining the value of a background height as specified elsewhere herein; the term may, however, also relate to semiquantitative determination of background height, e.g., by determining whether the background height exceeds pre-determined exclusion criteria.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, the term &#x201c;sample&#x201d;, also referred to as &#x201c;test sample&#x201d;, relates to any type of composition of matter; thus, the term may refer, without limitation, to any arbitrary sample such as a biological sample. In an embodiment, the sample is a liquid sample, in a further embodiment an aqueous sample. In an embodiment, the test sample is selected from the group consisting of: a physiological fluid, including blood, serum, plasma, saliva, ocular lens fluid, lacrimal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, sweat, urine, milk, ascites, mucus, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, and amniotic fluid; lavage fluid; tissue, cells, or the like. The sample may, however, also be a natural or industrial liquid, in particular surface or ground water, sewage, industrial wastewater, processing fluid, soil eluates, and the like. In an embodiment, the sample comprises or is suspected to comprise at least one chemical compound of interest, i.e., a chemical which shall be determined, which is referred to as &#x201c;analyte&#x201d;. The sample may comprise one or more further chemical compounds, which are not to be determined and which are commonly referred to as &#x201c;matrix&#x201d;. The sample may be used directly as obtained from the respective source or may be subjected to one or more pretreatment and/or a sample preparation step(s). Thus, the sample may be pretreated by physical and/or chemical methods, in an embodiment by centrifugation, filtration, mixing, homogenization, chromatography, precipitation, dilution, concentration, contacting with a binding and/or detection reagent, and/or any other method deemed appropriate by the skilled person. In, i.e., before, during, and/or after, the sample preparation step, one or more internal standard(s) may be added to the sample. The sample may be spiked with the internal standard. For example, an internal standard may be added to the sample at a predefined concentration. The internal standard may be selected such that it is easily identifiable under normal operating conditions of a mass spectrometry device. The concentration of the internal standard may be pre-determined and significantly higher than the concentration of the analyte.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As indicated above, the term &#x201c;analyte&#x201d;, as used herein, relates to any chemical compound or group of compounds which shall be determined in a sample.

As is understood by the skilled person, in LC-MS measurements, carry over may occur before the LC step, resulting essentially in an unwanted increase in the analyte peak caused by analyte from the previous sample (peak carry over). Carry over may, however, also occur after the LC step, causing an increase of the background in a chromatogram (background carry over). As was found surprisingly in the work underlying the present disclosure, the two types of carry over correlate, in particular are directly proportional, such that measuring background carry over can be used to determine and, if required correct for, peak carry over.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The term &#x201c;liquid chromatography mass spectrometer device&#x201d;, abbreviated as &#x201c;LC-MS device&#x201d;, is understood by the skilled person.

In an embodiment, the term relates to a correlation plot of a quantitative measure of signals obtained from a sample and determined by an MS detector with the progress of a chromatographic separation, in an embodiment over time, e.g., retention time, and/or elution volume. In an embodiment, said quantitative measure of signals correlates with the concentration of at least part of sample constituents, in particular with the analyte; thus, the quantitative measure of signals may in particular be a signal intensity. Thus, in an embodiment, the chromatogram is an MS chromatogram, in a further embodiment an MS/MS chromatogram. As will be understood by the skilled person, the aforesaid representation may be, but does not have to be, a graphical representation; the representation may, however, also be provided, e.g., as a list of value pairs, e.g., elution time/quantifier value pairs and/or elution time/qualifier value pairs, or as a mathematical model. In an embodiment, said quantitative measure of signals comprises an analyte signal intensity and/or an internal standard signal intensity. In an embodiment, said quantitative measure of signals comprises an analyte quantifier, an internal standard quantifier, an analyte qualifier and/or an internal standard qualifier.

As the skilled person understands, elution time may be replaced by any other measure of LC progress deemed appropriate by the skilled person, in particular by elution volume or by retention time.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The terms &#x201c;quantifier&#x201d; and &#x201c;qualifier&#x201d;, in the context of the present description, are understood by the skilled person. In an embodiment, the terms relate to signals of fragments of an analyte generated in tandem MS, wherein generally the most abundant and/or most reliably detected fragment is used for quantifying the analyte (analyte quantifier), whereas a second transition (fragment) is used for confirmation of identity of the analyte (analyte qualifier). Corresponding terms are frequently abbreviated as AQN (analyte quantifier) and AQL (analyte qualifier). The values of the two parameters are usually determined as signal intensity of ions having the corresponding m/z value, in particular determined as peak areas, e.g., after peak integration. These values may be correlated with LC progress to result in the chromatogram of the present description. As is understood by the skilled person, the terms &#x201c;qualifier&#x201d; and &#x201c;quantifier&#x201d; and values thereof are used in the art to refer to raw values measured as signal intensities, but also to values derived therefrom, in particular by peak integration. Thus, unless otherwise indicated, the terms quantifier and qualifier are used for signal intensities as measured, including values derived therefrom by standard mathematical operations, in particular multiplication, ratio calculation, curve smoothing, or calculation of an average, but not to integrated values derived thereof, which are referred to as &#x201c;integrated qualifier&#x201d; and &#x201c;integrated quantifier&#x201d;, respectively. Thus, in an embodiment, the values, in particular if used for the calculation of quantifier/qualifier ratios, are single-cycle values, i.e., intensities determined in one scan cycle, selected ion monitoring (SIM) cycle, or multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) cycle. The expression &#x201c;determining a quantifier to qualifier ratio&#x201d; relates to calculating the ratio by dividing the value of the qualifier by the value of the quantifier; similarly, the expression &#x201c;determining an integrated quantifier to integrated qualifier ratio&#x201d; relates to calculating the ratio by dividing the value of the integrated qualifier by the value of the integrated quantifier. In an embodiment, the integrated AQN/AQL ratio is a compound-specific and measurement method-specific parameter of an analyte.

The peak integration may allow determining of one or more of peak area, retention time, peak height, and peak width. In an embodiment, peak integration is automatic peak integration, i.e., peak integration performed by at least one computer and/or computer network and/or machine. Specifically, the automatic peak integration may be performed without manual action or interaction with a user.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The term &#x201c;background&#x201d; is known to the skilled person. In an embodiment, the term relates to the signal measured by a detection device, e.g., an MS device, which is not being caused by a peak as specified herein above. In accordance, the term &#x201c;background height&#x201d; relates to a quantitative measure of background in a chromatogram; thus, the term background height may also relate to a value of a background height. The skilled person is, in principle, able to determine background height, e.g., by determining the offset of a chromatogram graph from the zero line, by determining the area under the baseline, and the like. In an embodiment, background height is determined close to an analyte peak, in particular as at least one minimum signal intensity value within the upper and lower peak boundary of the analyte peak. In a further embodiment, background height is determined shortly upstream of the upper peak boundary and/or shortly downstream of the lower peak boundary, the term &#x201c;shortly&#x201d; in this case referring to up to 1 peak width, in an embodiment up to &#xbd; peak width, in a further embodiment up to &#xbc; peak width upstream or downstream, respectively. In an embodiment, background height is determined as part of a peak integration process, which is, typically, performed by automated equipment. In an embodiment, background height is determined as average of values, e.g., as a median, a mean, or another parameter indicative of an average deemed appropriate by the skilled person. In an embodiment, at least two, in a further embodiment at least five, in a further embodiment at least ten single cycle values are used for said average calculation; in an embodiment, of from 2 to 1000, in a further embodiment of from 5 to 250, in a further embodiment of from 10 to 100 single cycle background values are used for said average calculation, the term &#x201c;single cycle&#x201d; referring to a single cycle of signal intensity measurement by the MS unit generating the recorded signal.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to step c) of the method, determining the carry over of the analyte from the at least one previous sample into the sample of interest is based on the background height, i.e., on the value of the background height determined in step b).

In such case, a correlation of the peak area and background height with a corrected peak area or value derived therefrom may be established, such that a corrected analyte value can be stablished directly from such a three-parameter correlation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As indicated herein below, depending on the result of determining step c), the method for determining a carry over further may comprise the step of marking the result of step a) as unreliable and, optionally, initiating a re-run of said sample of interest, in case the result of step c) indicates a carry over of the analyte from said at least one previous sample exceeding a pre-determined threshold. Thus, the LC-MS device may not provide a determination for the analyte, may indicate that the result of determination is unreliable, and/or may cause a repeat at least of the chromatogram determination, in an embodiment all of steps a) to c) of the method for the affected sample. In an embodiment, said repeat is performed directly after a control sample lacking the analyte or directly after a sample with known low concentration of the analyte. In a further embodiment, a resulting amount or concentration determined from the chromatogram established in step a) may be corrected for the carry over of the analyte from said at least one previous sample. As specified herein above, step b) of the method provides a background height, which correlates with carry over, enabling the skilled person to correct an amount or concentration of an analyte determined from the chromatogram established in step a) for the carry over that occurred.

As will be understood, the confirmation step is optional, since for quality control purposes it may be sufficient to establish that carry over possibly confounded the values measured for an analyte. In an embodiment, determining reliability of the background height comprises analyzing a quantifier signal and/or a qualifier signal of background data points, in an embodiment of background data points used for determining background height of the chromatogram. In a further embodiment, determining reliability of the background height comprises analyzing a quantifier signal and a qualifier signal, in particular a ratio of a quantifier signal to a qualifier signal, i.e., a quantifier/qualifier ratio, of background data points, in an embodiment of background data points used for determining background height of the chromatogram.

Thus, in an embodiment, determining reliability of the background height comprises determining an average, in an embodiment a mean, in particular a median, an arithmetic mean, or a geometric mean of quantifier/qualifier ratios of background data points, in an embodiment of background data points used for determining background height of the chromatogram, which may be a reliability parameter.

In an embodiment, the reference is a quantitative indicator, in a further embodiment is a value, e.g., a threshold value, is a range, e.g., a range of values indicative of reliable carry over determination, is a score, or is any other value or range deemed appropriate by the skilled person. In an embodiment, depending on the type of reference selected, the reference is an analyte specific, device specific, and/or method specific parameter, in a further embodiment is an analyte specific parameter. Methods for establishing appropriate references are provided elsewhere herein on an exemplary basis. In view of the above, the reference is, in an embodiment, determined using the same type of LC-MS device as is used in the method specified herein.

Thus, in case a quantifier/qualifier ratio is determined, the reference may be a quantifier/qualifier ratio or an integrated quantifier/qualifier ratio determined for pre-purified or essentially pure analyte and/or in a carry over-free analytic run. The skilled person is able to determine appropriate reference values, e.g., during assay development; on an exemplary basis, in an embodiment, the reference is a threshold value or a reference range, e.g., in case a quantifier/qualifier ratio is determined.

Height</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0106">In an experimental LC-MS setup data were generated of high concentrated samples followed by blank samples; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a correlation between analyte peak area of blank samples to the analyte peak area of the previous samples was observed. The slope of this function is a measure for the extent of carry over. Analyte carry over typically occurs in two forms, as a peak from carry over before LC column and as broad baseline increase (background signal) from carry over after LC column (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0107">While both types of carry over can be measured within analyte free samples like blank samples, double blanks, or solvent samples, only the background increase can be measured within a real patient sample. Hence, result deviation by carry over cannot be directly measured. Unexpectedly, both types of carry over were found to show a rather clear correlation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Thus, a background signal can be used to monitor carry over within the sample measured. Using this correlation, calculation of the effect of carry over on the quantified result of patient samples can be estimated.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 2: Confirmation of Carry Over Measurements</heading><p id="p-0118" num="0108">In principle, increase of background signal can have several causes. Typical contributors are chemical noise (interferences), background interferences, instrument noise, and carry over. Particularly instrument noise changes over the time as it is a function of ion source aging and detector aging/voltage. In order to distinguish effects by carry over from unspecific sources of background signal increase, the quantifier/qualifier ratio of every single data point (single cycle ratios) can be used to confirm this finding by comparing against target values. Moreover the coefficient of variation (cv) of single cycle ratios can be used for confirmation, too (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 3: Application in Testosterone Measurement</heading><p id="p-0119" num="0109">Concentration of testosterone in patient samples can be determined by reading out the concentration value for the measured peak area ratio of analyte quantifier and internal standard quantifier (AQN/IQN) by means of a calibration function (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0120" num="0110">Three different samples were compared. Sample 1 with very low analyte concentration was measured after a very high concentrated sample. Sample 2 with low analyte concentration was measured after a high concentrated sample and sample 3 with medium concentration was measured after a very high concentrated sample.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0111">Using the correlation according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, measured values could be validated for carry over; results are summarized in Table 1:</p><p id="p-0122" num="0112">Column 2 shows values of peak area AQN, peak area IQN, AQN/IQN ratio calculated therefrom, as well as background height determined for the respective samples.

In conclusion, in sample 1, 62% of the measured concentration was actually caused by carry over.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0114">Column 5 of Table 1 shows confirmatory measures: the respective upper rows show medians of single cycle AQN/AQL ratios calculated for data points shortly outside peak boundaries, pre-determined reference ranges, and the result of a comparison between the respective value and the reference, OK referring to the measured value lying within the reference range, i.e., confirming carry over, NO indicating the value lying outside the reference range, i.e., not confirming carry over. The respective lower rows show coefficients of variation (cv) of single cycle AQN/AQL ratios calculated for data points shortly outside peak boundaries, pre-determined reference ranges, and the result of a comparison between the respective value and the reference, OK and NO having the meanings as indicated above.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0115">As shown in Table-1, in samples 1 and 3 interference by carry over is confirmed, although the interference in sample 3 is only minor.
