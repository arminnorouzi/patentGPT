num="0002">The present invention relates to a film forming apparatus for forming a film on the surface of a substrate including a printed circuit board and a film substrate, and to a control apparatus and a film forming method for the film forming apparatus.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an implementation step of implementing electronic components on substrates including printed circuit boards and film substrates, an adhesive layer serving as a base for wiring connected to the electronic components and a seed layer for forming the wiring by plating are formed. The respective layers are formed by, for example, plating or sputtering.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H07-310180 discloses a method for forming a thin film under a low-pressure rare gas environment, which comprises a gas evacuating/replacing step of evacuating gas in a vacuum chamber by vacuum drawing and then introducing a rare gas into the vacuum chamber, and a film forming step of forming a thin film forming material on an adherend under a rare gas environment, in order to form a thin film having excellent adhesion in a short time. A thin film forming method is described in which the film forming step is performed after the gas evacuation/substitution step is performed at least twice or more.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the thin film forming method described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H07-310180, hydrogen and oxygen due to water (H<sub>2</sub>O) gas are mixed in the interface between the adhesive film and the substrate and in the adhesive film, and sufficient adhesion between the adhesive film and the substrate cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H02-050959, in order to form a pure rare earth metal thin film, a rare earth metal thin film forming apparatus is described in which a main cathode on which a main target of a rare earth metal is mounted, a substrate held by a substrate holder at a position opposed to the main target of the rare earth metal, an auxiliary cathode on which an active metal auxiliary target is mounted facing the inner wall of the chamber at a side position of the substrate holder are respectively installed in a vacuum chamber of a magnetron type sputtering apparatus, and an inert gas introducing tube is mounted on a vacuum chamber wall.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in the film forming apparatus described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H02-050959, the auxiliary cathode to which the active metal auxiliary target is attached faces the inner wall side of the chamber at a side position of the substrate and the substrate holder, so that the auxiliary cathode is insufficient as a getter for capturing residual oxygen, nitrogen, and the like in a space other than the inner wall side of the chamber.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a film forming apparatus, a control apparatus for the film forming apparatus, and a film forming method which can improve the adhesion between a substrate and an adhesive film without lowering productivity.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one example aspect of the present invention recited in claim <b>1</b>, a film forming apparatus comprises a process chamber and a processing unit provided in the process chamber for forming adhesive films on substrates, wherein surface of the inner wall of the process chamber is formed of a material having a large getter effect on gas or water (H<sub>2</sub>O) remaining in the process chamber.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another example aspect of the present invention recited in claim <b>5</b>, a control apparatus for controlling a film forming apparatus comprises a process chamber, a processing unit provided in the process chamber configured to form adhesive films on substrates, an exhaust unit capable of evacuating the process chamber, and a gas introduction unit introducing gas for forming the adhesive films in the process chamber, wherein the control apparatus further comprises a storing unit storing a control program, and wherein the control program comprises a first step of forming, in the process chamber, a material having a large getter effect on gas or water (H<sub>2</sub>O) remaining in the process chamber, a second step of exhausting the process chamber for a predetermined period of time after the first step, a third step of forming, in the process chamber, the material having a large getter effect on gas or water (H<sub>2</sub>O) remaining in the process chamber after the second step, a fourth step of exhausting the process chamber for a predetermined period of time after the third step, and an adhesive film forming step of forming adhesive films on the substrates provided in the process chamber after the fourth step, wherein the exhaust unit and the gas introduction unit are controlled so that duty cycle D=P1/P becomes 34% or more and 66% or less, when P1 is a time of the first step or the third step and P is a total time of the first step and the second step or a total time of the third step and fourth step.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another example aspect of the present invention recited in claim <b>9</b>, film forming method comprises a first step of forming, in a process chamber, a material having a large getter effect on gas or water (H<sub>2</sub>O) remaining in the process chamber, a second step of exhausting the process chamber for a predetermined period of time after the first step, a third step of forming, in the process
