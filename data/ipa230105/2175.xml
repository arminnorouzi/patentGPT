The AGV refers to a transport vehicle that is capable of traveling along a prescribed guiding path. Navigation and positioning of the AGV are generally important in practice of the AGV.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The navigation of the AGV adopts several approaches such as line guiding, simultaneous locating and mapping (SLAM), reflective plate laser scan, vision guiding, inertial guiding based on gyroscope, or combination thereof, etc. In the line guiding, the AGV travels along a guiding line with magnetic tapes attached onto a floor surface of the manufacturing plant, and the navigation is realized through magnetic induction signals.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are some traditional solutions for an AGV to escort a pallet carrying material to a production line. Chinese Patent Publication No. CN106103316A discloses a conveying system where a body of an AGV together with a pallet carried thereon is turned 90 degree to enter to a hosting station for positioning, detection, and unloading of material. Chinese Patent Publication No. CN106103006A discloses a conveying system where the AGV moves towards its side way without turning the body or pallet carried thereon when approaching a host station to unload material.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In these traditional solutions, since the AGV should dramatically decrease its velocity when turning or side moving, the time cost for loading or unloading processes increases, resulting in massive traffic jam in the manufacturing plant. Moreover, due to the turning or movement of the AGV relative to the host station, it is difficult to align the AGV trajectory with the guiding line and may eventually result in loss of guidance of the AGV along the guiding line.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is desirable to provide an improved solution of loading and unloading for an AGV</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to at least partially solve the above and potentially other problems, embodiments of the present disclosure provide an improved solution of loading and unloading for an AGV.

Other definitions, explicit and implicit, may be included below.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As mentioned above, the traditional solutions for an AGV to load or unload material is unbeneficial. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, an improved solution is proposed. In this solution, an AGV travels and stops along a guiding line to load a pallet to a receiving station or unload a pallet from the receiving station. When the AGV stops near the receiving station, a carriage of the receiving station hooks the pallet and is moved by linear drive equipment. To load the pallet from the AGV onto the receiving station, the linear drive equipment moves the carriage in a first direction away from the AGV such that the pallet is moved along with the carriage away from the AGV To unload the pallet from the receiving station onto the AGV, the linear drive equipment moves the carriage in an opposite second direction towards the AGV such that the pallet is moved along with the carriage towards the AGV. The pallet is engaged with one or more retractable engagement member when being carried on the AGV during travelling of the AGV</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to this solution, the loading and unloading time of the pallet between the AGV and the receiving station is shorten by avoiding turning or side moving of the AGV, which can smooth the motion of the AGV and increase a total uptime of the AGV. Further, the AGV is possible to perform both loading and unloading tasks in one dispatchment, which can reduce the total number of dispatched AGV on site and/or reduce the traffic jam on site, thereby improving the overall efficiency. In addition, no extra drive equipment is required on the AGV to move the pallet, which can simplify the AGV design.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Hereinafter, some example embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Structures of an AGV <b>1</b>, a receiving station <b>2</b>, and a pallet <b>3</b> are first introduced with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>.
