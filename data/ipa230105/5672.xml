Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Noble metals for metal contacts have been the common material to build residential circuit breakers over years and silver (Ag) is the preferred material for this purpose but this type of metal contacts have some performance issues due to their chemistry/nature. For example, it has a high tendency to suffer from: soldering between contacts because of its low melting point, increasing of the presence of sub-products between the contacts, reducing of the effective contact area and finally increasing of the temperature of a circuit.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Until now, to solve the issues emerging from the use of noble metals and its application for metal contacts, like using Ag, is by incorporation of some compounds to reduce this tendency to the soldering, and the most common types of alloys applied for metal contacts include: Ag&#x2014;Ni, Ag&#x2014;SnO2, Ag&#x2014;CdO, Ag&#x2014;W, Ag&#x2014;C, Cu&#x2014;W, Ag&#x2014;WC, Ag&#x2014;WC/C. However, this type of alloys still has some technical disadvantages, like the low wear resistance, which could increase the contact resistance and cause the breaker to test more nonconformances. Besides these technical issues, the high cost of Ag represents other issue in this type of metal contacts for the construction of circuit breakers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need for a better metal contact of a circuit breaker for a residential application.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Briefly described, aspects of the present invention relate to a metal contact of an electronic circuit breaker for a residential application that includes ordered ceramic microparticles. This ceramic content has a highlighted impact in electrical conductivity and hardness. The change of the used alloy for metal contacts, by one with a better wear resistance, hardness and with good electrical conductivity is a solution to decrease the price of the circuit breaker and extend the service life of it. The use of a different alloy based in Ag-free materials with a better wear resistance helps to reduce the issues related with the metal contacts as this material has the characteristic to be conductive and at the same time it has better or similar corrosion resistance. With the mentioned alloy and the ordered distribution of the ceramic microparticles, one can obtain metal contacts with competitive properties in comparison with the Ag contacts. In weight proportions for metal/ceramic particle combination the metal contents are 30 to 50 wt. %, whereas the balance belongs to the ceramic particle content. With the use of a proposed combination of alloy/ceramic properties and with the control in the size of the latter, one can obtain a material with similar properties as offered by the Ag contacts but cheaper. Specifically, in the case of miniature circuit breakers (MCBs), the price reduction is around 15% against the price of Ag contact.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with one illustrative embodiment of the present invention, a metal contact of a residential circuit breaker is provided.

In particular, they are described in the context of a metal contact of a residential circuit breaker that includes ordered ceramic microparticles. This invention provides the use of ordered microparticles structures to improve the performance of the metal contacts in combination with the use of Ag-free materials. Until now, the use of expensive materials, like Ag, is the best way to make front of the metal contacts. Cu alloy contacts offer price reduction and such contacts could be a very good candidate to replace the Ag or Ag alloy contacts used in the construction of current residential circuit breakers. Embodiments of the present invention, however, are not limited to use in the described devices or methods.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The components and materials described hereinafter as making up the various embodiments are intended to be illustrative and not restrictive.

The metal contact <b>112</b> of the residential circuit breaker <b>115</b> comprises an electrical contact material <b>117</b> comprising the metal alloy <b>107</b> and the ceramic particles <b>110</b>. Both materials the metal alloy <b>107</b> and the ceramic particles <b>110</b> are present together as a metal compound <b>120</b> but without forming an alloy. The metal compound <b>120</b> is a matrix and reinforcement being the ceramic particles <b>110</b> such that first the ceramic particles <b>110</b> has a sintering step <b>125</b>(<b>2</b>) to get a homogeneous preform for the metal compound <b>120</b> being porous with a controlled size obtained by pressing <b>125</b>(<b>1</b>) a particle size of about 2 micrometers of the ceramic particles <b>110</b> and then a liquid metal infiltration step <b>125</b>(<b>3</b>) to provide a homogenous distribution <b>130</b> of the metal alloy <b>107</b> and the ceramic particles <b>110</b> in a three-dimensional open porous arrangement <b>135</b> and the homogenous distribution <b>130</b> results in ordered microstructures <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the ceramic particles <b>110</b> are tungsten carbide (WC) and the metal alloy <b>107</b> is copper alloy (Cu alloy). The particle size of the ceramic particles <b>110</b> is about 2 micrometers. The copper alloy (Cu alloy) is formed with addition of relatively small amounts of Ag and Ni as follows, Cu&#x2014;Ag<sub>X</sub>&#x2014;Ni<sub>Y </sub>(where X=1 to 4 wt % and Y=0.5 to 1.5 wt %). In weight proportions of the metal alloy/ceramic particles, the metal alloy <b>107</b> content may be about 30 to 50 wt %. For example, weight proportions may be 30 wt % the metal alloy <b>107</b> as a conductor metal and 70 wt % the ceramic particles <b>110</b>. Cu&#x2014;Ag<sub>X</sub>&#x2014;Ni<sub>Y </sub>is an Ag-free alloy as Ag is missing as the main metal while Ag is acting only as a alloying element.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As noted above, before the sintering step <b>125</b>(<b>2</b>) the pressing step <b>125</b>(<b>1</b>) of the ceramic particles <b>110</b> is done. The liquid metal infiltration step <b>125</b>(<b>3</b>) will take place by filling the metal compound <b>120</b> being porous by metal to obtain the metal matrix composite material <b>105</b>. By using the ordered microstructures, the superficial properties of the metal alloy <b>107</b> are balanced like electrical conductivity and wear resistance thus allowing the metal matrix composite material <b>105</b> to have similar performance in comparison with silver (Ag) contacts. With control on the particle size, a general distribution is more homogeneous thus providing the homogeneous distribution <b>130</b> of a surface's mechanical properties.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it illustrates a general processing method <b>205</b> to obtain a metal contact <b>207</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The process to obtain a functional material for metal contacts purpose, in general term, involve three main steps <b>210</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>). A general diagram of the mentioned steps is showed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Processing of the metal contact <b>207</b> for a circuit breaker application includes a pressing step <b>210</b>(<b>1</b>) of pressing the ceramic particles <b>110</b> and a sintering step <b>210</b>(<b>2</b>) of sintering the ceramic particles <b>110</b> and a liquid metal infiltration step <b>210</b>(<b>3</b>). The general processing method <b>205</b> to obtain the metal contact <b>207</b> is normally divided in three different steps, where the result is a material with a synergic combination of the properties of each compound. It will provide an improved material, but without an alloy formed between them. The control of ceramic particle size at 2 &#x3bc;m, will allow to control the sintering step <b>210</b>(<b>2</b>), leaving it porous with a controlled size and distribution as an ordered structure. The liquid metal infiltration step <b>210</b>(<b>3</b>) will take place next, filling this porous structure by metal to obtain the metal matrix composite material <b>105</b> with a homogeneous distribution of two main compounds, metal like Cu alloy, and the ceramic particles, like tungsten carbide. This homogenous distribution will result in an ordered with homogeneous properties distribution.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Here is the more detailed information for the above mentioned three steps. In the pressing step <b>210</b>(<b>1</b>), the ceramic particles <b>110</b> are pressed to obtain a preform of the microceramic particles such that a precise control in the size of these ceramic particles is required to generate an ordered microceramic structure. The sintering step <b>210</b>(<b>2</b>) is executed at high temperatures but below the melting point of the ceramic particles where the binder will be out gassed, leaving an ordered structure with a three-dimensional open porous arrangement which will be filled by a liquid metal. In liquid metal infiltration step, the ordered microceramic structure is heated at high temperature to avoid the fast solidification of the liquid metal. Once it reaches a homogeneous temperature, the liquid metal is infiltrated into the ordered structure under a constant pressure and controlled environment to fill out the three-dimensional open porous arrangement.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The ceramic particles of tungsten carbide (WC) have a controlled size of 2 &#x3bc;m. The used Cu alloy <b>107</b><i>a </i>for the last step is the key for this type of metal contact. In this case, the metal matrix composite material <b>105</b> was developed using a Cu alloy, which was formed with the addition of small amounts of Ag and Ni as follows, Cu&#x2014;Ag<sub>X</sub>&#x2014;Ni<sub>Y </sub>(where X=1 to 4 wt % and Y=0.5 to 1.5 wt %). With the Cu alloy <b>107</b><i>a </i>and the ordered distribution of the ceramic microparticles, one can obtain metal contacts with competitive properties in comparison with the Ag contacts. In weight proportions, the metal alloy/ceramic particles combination may have metal alloy contents at 30 to 50 wt % whereas the balance belongs to the ceramic particles <b>110</b> content. With the use of this proposed combination of alloy/ceramic properties, and with the control in the size of the last one, one can obtain a material with similar properties as offered by the Ag contacts, but with the advantage of the proposed one is cheaper in cost. Specifically, in the case of MCB's breakers, the price reduction is around 15% against the price of Ag contact, which is currently in use.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it illustrates the angle results for Ag contacts obtained from a shear test applied into the Cu contacts in comparison with the Ag contacts in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the shear results for Ag contacts obtained from a shear test applied into the Cu contacts in comparison with the Ag contacts in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, it illustrates the angle results for Cu contacts obtained from a shear test applied into the Cu contacts in comparison with the Ag contacts in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.

The validation of performance was measured by different type of tests like a shear test, a temperature rise test and validated it with microstructural characterization. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref> it is possible to observe the obtained results during a shear test in comparison against the Ag contacts.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, it is possible to observe the result by controlling the distribution of the ceramic particles in an analysis via an optical microscope at different magnifications.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As we can see in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, the ordered distribution was determined with an optical microscope at 50&#xd7; and 100&#xd7; magnification and it is evident how the ordered distribution could affect the surface distribution of the conductive metal. The Ag contacts without a particle size control of the ceramic particles shows areas without conductive metal (whit spots) and others with cluster or agglomeration of it. In opposite way, with control on the particle size the general distribution looks more homogeneous for Cu contact which should result in a homogeneous distribution of the surface mechanical properties. The impact of this ordered distribution could be corroborated with the performance of the metal matrix composite material <b>105</b> installed in the residential circuit breaker <b>115</b> where it was tested under the conditions required for the temperature rise test.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates performance of the Cu contacts vs. Ag contacts into a residential circuit breaker under the conditions required for a temperature rise test in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In addition to the above-mentioned advantages of this type of material in residential circuit breakers such as cost savings and shear test performances further its performance under a more specific test called the temperature rise test is presented. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows the performance in comparison with the Ag contact materials. The graphs show the behavior of the proposed material being installed in a residential circuit breaker against the Ag contacts. The shown performances exhibit good trend in terms of the temperature with small effects due to the change in the applied current during the brazing process but in general term the trend is lighter being more &#x201c;cooler&#x201d; than the one observed in the Ag contacts. This point could be related with the ordered and homogeneous distribution of the Cu alloy in the ceramic skeleton during a metal contact manufacture process and for the properties obtained with the metal matrix composite material <b>105</b>. According with the above results, the potential price reduction in the Cu alloy contacts makes them a very good candidate to replace the Ag contacts used in the construction of current residential circuit breakers.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a side view of a metal contact <b>1200</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates a back view of the metal contact <b>1200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates a view of a circuit breaker <b>1405</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
