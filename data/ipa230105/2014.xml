Field of Invention</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to means for removably installing fins to a board used in water sports such as surfboards, wake boards, wind surfers, and stand up paddleboards.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">2. Background</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known for the tail end of such boards such as a surfboard to have one or more fins. The description in this specification will generally refer to surfboards but it is to be understood that the discussion of any point will also apply to the other boards envisaged by this invention.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Each fin may serve as a hydrofoil to improve stability and control as a surfer steers the board through the water using their feet. Surfboards are sometimes supplied without fins, with the intention that the fins will be purchased separately and retro-fitted. Also, over time fitted fins can become damaged, for example when surfing or transporting surfboards, and need replacement. It is also possible that fins can detach during conditions of adverse use, such as by coming into contact with the ground during surfing such that a fin will detach involuntarily. And, in some cases, it is desirable to change the size or style of fin used depending on wave conditions. Fitting or replacing fins can be problematic in that the process may require the application of significant force or the use of tools.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Object of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of preferred forms of the invention to go at least some way towards addressing the above problem. While this applies to at least preferred forms it should be understood that the object of the invention per se is simply to provide a useful choice. Therefore, any benefits or advantages applicable to a preferred embodiment should not be read-in as a limitation on any claims expressed more broadly.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Interpretation</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; or related terms such as &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; should not be interpreted exclusively.

Given the above disclosure, one skilled in the art could devise variations that are within the scope and spirit of the invention disclosed herein. Further, the various features of the embodiments disclosed herein can be used alone, or in varying combinations with each other and are not intended to be limited to the specific combination described herein. Thus, the scope of the claims is not to be limited by the illustrated embodiments.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0060">As mentioned above the invention is broadly concerned with boards for use in watersports. The invention will be illustrated by reference to the accompanying drawings in which a surfboard is referred to. It is to be understood that the illustrated embodiments can be also applied to other boards such as wake boards, windsurfing boards and stand up paddleboards.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the surfboard <b>1</b> has cavities <b>2</b> on the underside of the deck into each of which a mount, for example a fin box <b>3</b>, is installed securely such that it will remain in place when the surf board <b>1</b> is in use. The fin box <b>3</b> is normally secured within the cavities <b>2</b> such as by fibreglass as a board is being manufactured. Such conventional processes can be used in this invention.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0062">The box <b>3</b> is adapted to receive a surfboard fin <b>4</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> embodiment the surfboard is designed for two fin boxes and two fins, but in other embodiments there may be one, three, or more.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the fin <b>4</b> has a base <b>5</b> comprising a groove <b>6</b> in its rear end, a series of openings <b>7</b> and a recess such as a notch <b>8</b> in its front end. The notch <b>8</b> in fin manufacture is normally &#x2018;V&#x2019; shaped. Other shapes can be provided and the projections on the pivoting member as discussed below will be adjusted to complement the notch shape.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0064">The function of the openings <b>7</b> is to reduce the weight of the fin <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0065">Some fin designs do not have a continuous base but have two or more projections depending from the base portion of the fin. Each of those projections will have a base portion that engages with a slot in the mount in a similar way.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the fin box <b>3</b> has a cam at one end including a pivoting member <b>9</b> which includes a pivoting member plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>for hand force to be applied such as plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>. The fin box <b>3</b> has an elongate slot, for example a channel <b>11</b>. By hand force is meant that one or more fingers optionally together with a thumb can apply pressure to cause the pivoting member <b>9</b> to pivot about a pivot pin <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0067">The cam has the pivot pin <b>10</b> for allowing the pivoting member <b>9</b> to pivot between a locked position as shown to lock the fin <b>4</b> in the fin box <b>3</b> and thus to the surfboard <b>1</b>, and a release or unlocked position where the fin <b>4</b> can be removed by hand. The pivoting member plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>has a rearward portion <b>9</b><i>c </i>and an opposing forward portion <b>9</b><i>b </i>. The. The cam is designed such that hand force applied to the rearward portion <b>9</b><i>c </i>of the pivoting member plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>of the pivoting member <b>9</b> in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> will cause the plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>to rotate about the pivot pin <b>10</b> to a position where the fin <b>4</b> is not locked and can be removed. The plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>locks at a position where a lug <b>12</b> in a cam as discussed below is designed to match the position of the notch <b>8</b> on the fin <b>4</b> when installed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0068">As shown, the fin box <b>3</b> incorporates a Koru design resembling waves. Alternatively other images, designs, brand names or marketing slogans can be incorporated into the box <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0069">The pivot pin <b>10</b> needs to have sufficient strength to withstand the forces on it when the surfboard <b>1</b> is in use. A suitable material is a 316 grade stainless steel pin, 3 mm in diameter.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0070">The fixing of the fin <b>4</b> in the fin box <b>3</b> is described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> where, for simplicity, the box <b>3</b> is illustrated cut away without the stylistic features of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the pivoting member <b>9</b> has a projection, such as the lug <b>12</b>, that extends at a downwards angle from the plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>away from the top surface <b>9</b><i>d </i>into the channel <b>11</b>. The lug <b>12</b> has a shape complementary to the fin notch <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0072">The plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>also has a projection such as a raised node <b>13</b> on its front edge. and the node <b>13</b> is adapted to engage with a complementary depression (not shown) in a neighbouring edge of the fin box <b>3</b> when rotated to the locked position.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0073">The lug <b>12</b> is preferably integrally moulded with the plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>from a suitable plastics material. Alternatively, the lug <b>12</b> may be made of steel and may not be integral with the plate <b>9</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0059" num="0074">The pivoting member <b>9</b> can be pivoted to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> position by hand force, for example by pressing down on the rearward portion <b>9</b><i>c </i>of the pivoting member plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>with one's finger or thumb or with one or more fingers optionally together with a thumb.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0075">The rear end of the fin's base <b>5</b> is positioned in the channel <b>11</b> so that the groove <b>6</b> fits around a tongue <b>14</b> extending from the rear end of the box <b>3</b>. The rearward portion <b>9</b><i>c </i>extends towards the tongue <b>14</b> and the forward portion <b>9</b><i>b </i>extends away from the tongue <b>14</b>. The base <b>5</b> of the fin <b>4</b> is then moved by a user holding the upper part of the fin <b>4</b> so that the front end swings into position resting in the channel <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, once the front end of the fin <b>4</b> is moved so that the base <b>5</b> sits resting within the channel <b>11</b>, the pivoting member <b>9</b> is pivoted by finger or thumb, or at least one finger optionally together with a thumb, pressure on the forward portion <b>9</b><i>b </i>of the pivoting member plate <b>9</b><i>a </i>, causing the end of the lug <b>12</b> to move into complementary engagement with the notch <b>8</b>.
