During such a procedure, the natural glenoid surface of the scapula is resurfaced or otherwise replaced with a prosthetic glenoid component which provides a bearing surface for a head of the humerus or a head portion of a humeral prosthesis (hereinafter &#x201c;humeral head&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various glenoid components have heretofore been designed to include a base component that defines a bearing surface on a humeral-facing side and a number of pegs that extend from a scapula-facing side of the base component. These pegs may include relatively long anchor pegs having a plurality of radially extending fins and/or relatively short stabilizing or anti-rotation pegs which may or may not have a series of grooves defined therein. One example of an existing glenoid component possessing the above-described configuration is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,911,047, the disclosure which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The pegs of this type of existing glenoid component extend from the scapula-facing side of the base component so that the axes defined by the pegs are parallel with respect to each other. One drawback of glenoid components with parallel oriented pegs is the inability in some instances to reach healthy bone stock remaining in a patient's scapula. In particular, there are many clinical situations in which a patient's scapula possesses deficient bone stock at the locations which align with the relatively long, parallel anchor pegs. Thus, upon implantation of the glenoid component, the anchor pegs reside in deficient bone stock thereby causing an unstable attachment of the glenoid component to the patient's scapula. Interestingly, in many of these clinical situations, healthy bone stock is observed in other locations of the glenoid region of the scapula.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to address this problem, some existing glenoid components possess pegs extending from the scapula-facing side of the base component which are divergent with respect to each other. Being configured divergent, the pegs are targeted to be embedded in healthier scapula bone stock for more effective anchoring of the pegs. One example of this type of glenoid component is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,448 (hereinafter &#x201c;the '448 patent&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, providing the pegs of the glenoid component with a non-parallel orientation (e.g. divergent or convergent) causes some challenges for implantation of the device. Significantly, during implantation, the pegs of the glenoid component do not physically align with the bores drilled in the scapula for receiving the pegs. In contrast, pegs having a parallel orientation with respect to each other align with drilled bores thereby facilitating implantation of the glenoid component. In order to address the implantation challenge of non-parallel peg type glenoid components, the '448 patent teaches that its base component is configured to flex or deform so as to cause its pegs to become temporarily more aligned with the holes defined in the scapula so that insertion of the pegs therein is enabled.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are drawbacks associated with providing a glenoid component having a readily flexible or deformable base component. Indeed, the base component of a glenoid component, when implanted, receives a significant amount of force during normal use. In particular, the humeral head articulates against the base component of the glenoid component during normal human use. If the base component flexes or deforms when the humeral head is urged against it, unnatural forces may be applied to the soft tissue and muscles that interconnect the humerus to the scapula. These unnatural forces may cause damage to such soft tissue and muscles. In addition, pain or discomfort to a person in which the glenoid component is implanted may result due to the unnatural forces.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally, creating a base component of a glenoid component from materials that are more flexible or deformable may result in a base component which is less durable in relation to non-flexible or non-deformable base components (i.e. conventional base components). Thus, during normal use of the shoulder joint, articulation of the humeral head against the flexible or deformable base component may cause relatively rapid deterioration of the base component thereby resulting in early failure of the glenoid component. Moreover, wear debris may be more readily generated in such a device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">What is needed therefore is an improved glenoid component that possesses non-parallel oriented pegs (e.g. diverging or converging pegs). What is also needed is an improved method of implanting such a glenoid component in the scapula of a patient. What is further needed is a glenoid component with non-parallel oriented pegs that has a base component which possesses the degree of structural integrity equivalent with base components of conventional glenoid components. What is additionally needed is a glenoid component having non parallel oriented pegs that has a base component that does not flex or deform significantly during articulation of a humeral head there-against. What is also need is a glenoid component having non parallel oriented pegs that do not generate significant wear debris during articulation of a humeral head there-against. What is further needed is a glenoid component having non parallel oriented pegs that do not cause unnatural forces to be applied to the soft tissue and muscles that interconnect the humerus to the scapula during articulation of the humeral head against the base component of the glenoid component. What is further needed is a glenoid component having non parallel oriented pegs that do not cause damage to such soft tissue and muscles that interconnect the humerus to the scapula during articulation of the humeral head against the base component of the glenoid component. What is also needed is a glenoid component having non parallel oriented pegs that does not cause pain or discomfort to a patient in which the glenoid component is implanted during articulation of the humeral head against the base component of the glenoid component. Additional features and advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a glenoid assembly.

Initially, a bore <b>56</b>, a bore <b>58</b>, a bore <b>60</b>, and a bore <b>62</b> are drilled in the scapula <b>14</b> in the glenoid region <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The bores <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, and <b>62</b> are created to substantially correspond to the angular orientations, lengths, and diameters of the pegs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> in their relaxed state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. Note that an opening <b>56</b>A defined by the bore <b>56</b> and an opening <b>58</b>A defined by the bore <b>58</b> are offset by a first distance D<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The pegs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> will be ultimately advanced into the bores later in the procedure. Note that due to the non-parallel orientation the anchor pegs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, these pegs will have to be flexed prior to insertion of their distal end portions <b>32</b>E, <b>34</b>E into the bore openings <b>56</b>A, <b>58</b>A. Significantly, in the relaxed state of the pegs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> of the glenoid component <b>10</b>, the distal end portion <b>32</b>E of the peg <b>32</b> is offset from the distal end portion <b>34</b>E of the peg <b>34</b> by a distance D<b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) which is significantly greater than D<b>1</b>. Any attempt to simultaneously advance the end portions <b>32</b>E, <b>34</b>E of the pegs respectively into the openings <b>56</b>A, <b>58</b>A would be unsuccessful since the offset distance D<b>2</b> of the end portions <b>32</b>E, <b>34</b>E does not correspond to the offset distance D<b>1</b> of the openings <b>56</b>A, <b>58</b>A. What is meant herein by the term &#x201c;correspond&#x201d; or &#x201c;corresponds&#x201d; with respect to the discussion of distances (e.g. distances D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>, and D<b>3</b> (discussed later)) is that two distances correspond with each other if the two distances are similar enough to enable simultaneous advancement of the distal end portions <b>32</b>E, <b>34</b>E into the openings <b>56</b>A, <b>58</b>A so that the pegs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be respectively inserted into bores <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>. On the other hand, what is meant herein by the phrase &#x201c;do not correspond&#x201d; with respect to the discussion of distances (e.g. distances D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>, and D<b>3</b> (discussed later)) is that two distances do not correspond with each other if the two distances are dissimilar enough to prevent simultaneous advancement of the distal end portions <b>32</b>E, <b>34</b>E into the openings <b>56</b>A, <b>58</b>A so that the pegs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> cannot be respectively inserted into bores <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, the next step of the procedure is to flex the peg <b>32</b> and the peg <b>34</b> so that the first end portion <b>32</b>E of the first peg <b>32</b> and the second end portion <b>34</b>E of the second peg <b>34</b> are offset by a distance D<b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) which corresponds to the distance D<b>1</b>. The flexing step is performed when the glenoid component <b>10</b> is spaced apart from the scapula <b>14</b>. With the end portions <b>32</b>E, <b>34</b>E positioned so that they are offset by the distance D<b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the end portion <b>32</b>E of the first peg <b>32</b> and the end portion <b>34</b>E of the second peg <b>34</b> are simultaneously advanced through the opening <b>56</b>A and into the bore <b>56</b> and through the opening <b>58</b>A and into the bore <b>58</b>A, respectively.

The first intermediate portion <b>72</b> is pivotably coupled to the second intermediate portion <b>78</b>. It should be appreciated that movement of the first handle end portion <b>68</b> and the second handle end portion <b>74</b> towards each other causes the first contact end portion <b>70</b> and the second contact end portion <b>76</b> to move towards each other.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus, according to this preferred manner of performing the flexing step, the following is performed.

Thus, an associated distinction in the manner of implanting the glenoid component <b>300</b> in the glenoid region <b>12</b> of the scapula <b>14</b> (in comparison to the implantation of the glenoid component <b>200</b>) is that the bores <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) have to be drilled in the scapula to substantially correspond to the angular orientations of the pegs <b>32</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;, <b>34</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; in their relaxed state which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>13</b></figref>. Further, a bore (not shown) would have to be drilled in the scapula to substantially correspond to the angular orientation, length, and diameter of the peg <b>302</b> which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>13</b></figref>. A further associated distinction in the manner of implanting the glenoid component <b>300</b> in the glenoid region <b>12</b> of the scapula <b>14</b> (in comparison to the implantation of the glenoid component <b>200</b>) is that the pegs <b>32</b>&#x2032;, <b>34</b>&#x2033; would have to be flexed in different directions so that the first end portion <b>32</b>E&#x2032;&#x2033; of the first peg <b>32</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; and the second end portion <b>34</b>E&#x2032;&#x2033; of the second peg <b>34</b>&#x2033; are offset by the distance D<b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) which corresponds to the distance D<b>1</b>. As with the implantation method described in connection with the glenoid component <b>10</b>, the pegs <b>32</b>&#x2032;, <b>34</b>&#x2033; could flexed by fingers of a person's hand or an instrument <b>64</b>&#x2033;. Of course, the instrument <b>64</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; would need to be redesigned so that movement of the first handle end portion <b>68</b>&#x2032; and the second handle end portion <b>74</b>&#x2033; towards each other by a medical personnel's hand causes the first end portion <b>32</b>E&#x2032;&#x2033; of the first peg <b>32</b>&#x2032; and the second end portion <b>34</b>E&#x2032;&#x2033; of the second peg <b>34</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; to move with respect to each other until the end portions <b>32</b>E&#x2033;, <b>34</b>E&#x2032;&#x2033; are offset by the distance D<b>3</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As with the alternative glenoid components <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, other parts of the glenoid component <b>300</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>13</b></figref>. As was similarly noted with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>11</b></figref> above, due to the similarity in configuration of the glenoid component <b>300</b> and the glenoid component <b>200</b>, like numbers are used to describe both glenoid components, with the exception that a triple prime symbol is included after each of the various reference numerals indicating various portions of the glenoid component <b>300</b> and associated parts. For example, reference numerals <b>32</b>&#x2033;, <b>34</b>&#x2033; are used for indicating the anchor pegs of the glenoid component <b>200</b>, while the reference numerals <b>32</b>&#x2032;, <b>34</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; are used for indicating the anchor pegs of the glenoid component <b>300</b>.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Instrument <b>400</b></heading><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref> show an alternative embodiment of an instrument <b>400</b> that is used in place of the instrument <b>64</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref>) to perform the flexing step discussed above. The instrument <b>400</b> is similar in construction and operation to the instrument <b>64</b> in the sense that it is a generally scissors-shaped device. Also, the instrument <b>400</b> is used in the exact same manner as the instrument <b>64</b> as discussed above to carry out the implantation of the glenoid component <b>10</b>, with one exception. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the two distal arm segments (i.e. distal arm segments <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>) approach the anchor pegs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> from a common side of the glenoid component <b>10</b> during an implantation procedure instead of approaching from opposite sides (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref> in connection with the use of instrument <b>64</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> also shows the instrument <b>400</b> approaching the anchor pegs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> from a common side similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, but from a slightly different direction. It should be appreciated that many manners of approaching the anchor pegs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> with an instrument (e.g. instrument <b>64</b>, <b>400</b>) are possible during implantation of the glenoid component <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">There is a plurality of advantages arising from the various features of each of the embodiments of the glenoid assembly and associated method described herein.
