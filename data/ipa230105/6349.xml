However, as recognized by the present inventors, in the former method, the entire antenna module has a larger thickness, which prevents the antenna module from having a small size and a low profile.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the latter method, whereas the reflection characteristics in a wider bandwidth are obtained due to decrease of the effective dielectric constant, the peak gain may be made large and the directivity may be changed to a sharp one, resulting in a narrow beam width in which a predetermined gain is attainable. That is, when the effective dielectric constant is decreased, return loss reduction in a wide bandwidth and acquisition of a wide directivity have a tradeoff relationship.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure is made to solve such an issue, as well as other issues, and one aspect thereof is to achieve return loss reduction in a wide bandwidth and a wide directivity in an antenna module.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Solutions to Problems</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An antenna module according to an aspect of the present disclosure includes a first dielectric substrate, in or on which a first radiating element is disposed, a second dielectric substrate, in which a ground electrode is disposed, and a conductive member. The second dielectric substrate is disposed opposite the first dielectric substrate. When viewed in plan in the direction normal to the first radiating element, the conductive member is disposed around the first radiating element. A low-dielectric-constant layer having a dielectric constant lower than that of the first dielectric substrate is disposed between the first dielectric substrate and the second dielectric substrate. The conductive member is formed in the low-dielectric-constant layer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An antenna module according to another aspect of the present disclosure includes a first dielectric substrate, in or on which a first radiating element is disposed, a second dielectric substrate, in which a ground electrode is disposed, and a conductive member.

A low-dielectric-constant layer (air layer) having a dielectric constant lower than that of the first dielectric substrate is formed between the two dielectric substrates. Forming the low-dielectric-constant layer causes reduction of the effective dielectric constant, achieving return loss reduction in a wide bandwidth. In addition, arrangement of conductive members around the radiating element in the low-dielectric-constant layer causes part of an electromagnetic field, which occurs between the radiating element and the ground electrode, to be blocked, achieving a wide directivity.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief

For portable terminals in recent years, there has been a demand for achieving antenna characteristics, such as return loss and gain, in a further wider bandwidth, in addition to a demand for reduction in size and in thickness.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Typically, for acquisition of return loss in a wider bandwidth in an antenna module including a planar patch antenna, the following methods are known: a method in which the distance between a radiating element and a ground electrode is increased; a method in which an effective dielectric constant of a dielectric substrate included in an antenna module is decreased. However, an increase of the distance between a radiating element and a ground electrode as in the former method results in the entire antenna module having a larger thickness, which may prevent the antenna module from having a low profile and a small size.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In contrast, when the effective dielectric constant of a dielectric substrate is decreased as in the latter method, in addition to return loss in a wider bandwidth, the peak gain may be increased, and a sharp directivity may be obtained. An increase of peak gain itself is desirable because the reachable range of radio waves is increased. However, concentration of energy of emitted radio waves in a certain direction may cause a space, in which a predetermined gain is attainable, to be narrowed. This may cause a desired gain to fail to be obtained in a spatial range which is a target.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the antenna module <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment, the feed element <b>121</b> and the ground electrode GND are formed in the different dielectric substrates <b>130</b> and <b>140</b>, respectively. The air layer <b>185</b> is formed between the dielectric substrate <b>130</b> and the dielectric substrate <b>140</b>. Typically, the dielectric constant of air is lower than those of the dielectric substrates <b>130</b> and <b>140</b>. Therefore, the air layer <b>185</b> formed between the dielectric substrates as in the antenna module <b>100</b> enables the effective dielectric constant between the feed element <b>121</b> and the ground electrode GND to be decreased, compared with the case without the air layer <b>185</b>. This enables return loss to be reduced, achieving return loss in a wider bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, in the antenna module <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment, as described above, the conductive members <b>170</b> are disposed in the air layer <b>185</b> around the feed element <b>121</b> in plan view. The antenna module <b>100</b> functions as an antenna through electromagnetic-field coupling between the feed elements <b>121</b> and the ground electrode GND, and an electromagnetic field occurs between the feed element <b>121</b> and the ground electrode GND. An electric flux at that time occurs mainly between the ground electrode GND and the side orthogonal to the polarization direction of the feed element <b>121</b> (that is, the side parallel to Y axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), as illustrated by using arrows AR<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Therefore, the conductive members <b>170</b> disposed at positions spaced apart from the feed element <b>121</b> capture part of the electromagnetic field which occurs. Thus, although the peak gain at the resonant frequency is slightly decreased, a reduction of gain in a wide range may be suppressed.
