Touch sensor devices typically include a sensing region, often demarked by a surface, in which the touch sensor device determines the presence, location and/or motion of one or more input objects, typically for purposes allowing a user to provide user input to interact with the electronic system. Another type of input device may be a touchscreen that includes a plurality of electrodes and is also capable of allowing the user to provide user input to interact with the electronic system.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Existing foldable devices (e.g., laptops or foldable mobile phones), including foldable devices with touch sensor devices, use a dedicated sensor, such as an infrared (IR) or a Hall Sensor, for determining when a device is open or closed. When closed, the display of the foldable device changes its setting such as by entering a low-power state. For laptops, a magnetic switch or mechanical switch in the hinge is used. However, using a dedicated sensor for detecting the operating state (e.g., open or closed) of the foldable device may be unnecessary and may increase complexity. Further, a magnetic switch may also interfere with the display. For instance, the dedicated sensor may fail at a certain point during the lifetime of the foldable device, which may create problems, and even if it is operational, it still presents an additional expense when manufactured and takes up space as an additional sensor needs to be included within the device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below.

Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding background, summary and brief description of the drawings, or the following detailed description.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Exemplary devices and methods discussed herein provide for detecting a state (e.g., an orientation such as an open state, a closed state, and/or an angle of the opening) for foldable devices such as a laptop, foldable phone, gaming device, and/or other types of foldable devices. The foldable device may use a display device such as a touch screen and/or one or more input devices such as a touchpad to determine the state of the foldable device. For example, the foldable device may use only the capacitive touchscreen to detect the state of the device, which eliminates the need for a dedicated open/closed sensor such as an IR sensor or a hall sensor for detecting this state. Additionally, and/or alternatively, the foldable device may be a laptop and the touchscreen may interact with the touchpad to determine the state of the laptop.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">By using the touchscreen and/or touchpad to detect the state of the foldable device, the foldable device might not require a dedicated open/closed sensor. As such, the devices and methods described herein provide for various advantages relative to conventional devices with the dedicated sensor&#x2014;including, but not limited to reduction in bill of material (BOM) costs, assembly labor, simplification of product design, avoidance of interference to the display caused by magnetic switch, improved reliability (a statistical side effect of fewer parts), and so on.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram depicting an input device according to one or more examples of the present application. The input device <b>100</b> may be configured to provide input to an electronic system. As used herein, the term &#x201c;electronic system&#x201d; (or &#x201c;electronic device&#x201d;) broadly refers to any system capable of electronically processing information. Some non-limiting examples of electronic systems include personal computers of all sizes and shapes, such as desktop computers, laptop computers, netbook computers, tablets, web browsers, e-book readers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and wearable computers (such as smart watches and activity tracker devices). Additional examples of electronic systems include composite input devices, such as physical keyboards that include input device <b>100</b> and separate joysticks or key switches. Further examples of electronic systems include peripherals such as data input devices (including remote controls and mice), and data output devices (including display screens and printers). Other examples include remote terminals, kiosks, and video game machines (e.g., video game consoles, portable gaming devices, and the like). Other examples include communication devices (including cellular phones, such as smart phones), and media devices (including recorders, editors, and players such as televisions, set-top boxes, music players, digital photo frames, and digital cameras). Additionally, the electronic system may be a host or a slave to the input device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The input device <b>100</b> may be implemented as a physical part of the electronic system, or can be physically separate from the electronic system. As appropriate, the input device <b>100</b> may communicate with parts of the electronic system using any one or more of the following: buses, networks, and other wired or wireless interconnections. Examples include Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Personal System/2 (PS/2), Universal Serial Bus (USB), Bluetooth, radio frequency (RF), and Infrared Data Association (IRDA).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a sensor <b>105</b> is included with the input device <b>100</b>. The sensor <b>105</b> comprises one or more sensing elements configured to sense input provided by one or more input objects in a sensing region. Examples of input objects include fingers, styli, and hands. The sensing region encompasses any space above, around, in and/or near the sensor <b>105</b> in which the input device <b>100</b> is able to detect user input (e.g., user input provided by one or more input objects). The sizes, shapes, and locations of particular sensing regions may vary from embodiment to embodiment. In some embodiments, the sensing region extends from a surface of the input device <b>100</b> in one or more directions into space until signal-to-noise ratios prevent sufficiently accurate object detection. The distance to which this sensing region extends in a particular direction, in various embodiments, may be on the order of less than a millimeter, millimeters, centimeters, or more, and may vary significantly with the type of sensing technology used and the accuracy desired. Thus, some embodiments sense input that comprises no contact with any surfaces of the input device <b>100</b>, contact with an input surface (e.g., a touch surface) of the input device <b>100</b>, contact with an input surface of the input device <b>100</b> coupled with some amount of applied force or pressure, and/or a combination thereof. In various embodiments, input surfaces may be provided by surfaces of sensor substrates within which or on which sensor elements are positioned, or by face sheets or other cover layers positioned over sensor elements.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The input device <b>100</b> comprises one or more sensing elements for detecting user input. Some implementations utilize arrays or other regular or irregular patterns of sensing elements to detect the input object. The input device <b>100</b> may utilize different combinations of sensor components and sensing technologies to detect user input in the sensing region.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The input device <b>100</b> is a capacitance (e.g., transcapacitive) input device, wherein voltage or current is applied to create an electric field. Nearby input objects cause changes in the electric field, and produce detectable changes in capacitive coupling that may be detected as changes in voltage, current, or the like.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The input device utilizes arrays or other regular or irregular patterns of capacitive sensing elements to create electric fields. In some instances, separate sensing elements may be ohmically shorted together to form larger sensor electrodes. Some other instances may utilize resistive sheets, which may be uniformly resistive.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The input device may utilize &#x201c;mutual capacitance&#x201d; (or &#x201c;transcapacitance&#x201d;) sensing methods based on changes in the capacitive coupling between sensor electrodes. In various embodiments, an input object near the sensor electrodes alters the electric field between the sensor electrodes, thus changing the measured capacitive coupling. In one implementation, a transcapacitive sensing method operates by detecting the capacitive coupling between one or more transmitter sensor electrodes (also &#x201c;transmitter electrodes&#x201d; or &#x201c;drive electrodes&#x201d;) and one or more receiver sensor electrodes (also &#x201c;receiver electrodes&#x201d; or &#x201c;pickup electrodes&#x201d;). Transmitter sensor electrodes may be modulated relative to a reference voltage to transmit transmitter signals. Receiver sensor electrodes may be held substantially constant relative to the reference voltage to facilitate receipt of resulting signals. The reference voltage may be, for example, a substantially constant voltage or system ground. In some embodiments, transmitter sensor electrodes and receiver sensor electrodes may both be modulated. The transmitter electrodes are modulated relative to the receiver electrodes to transmit transmitter signals and to facilitate receipt of resulting signals. A resulting signal may comprise effect(s) corresponding to one or more transmitter signals, and/or to one or more sources of environmental interference (e.g. other electromagnetic signals). Sensor electrodes may be dedicated transmitters or receivers, or may be configured to both transmit and receive.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Some implementations of the input device <b>100</b> are configured to provide images that span one, two, three, or higher dimensional spaces. The input device <b>100</b> may have a sensor resolution that varies from embodiment to embodiment depending on factors such as the particular sensing technology involved and/or the scale of information of interest. In some embodiments, the sensor resolution is determined by the physical arrangement of an array of sensing elements, where smaller sensing elements and/or a smaller pitch can be used to define a higher sensor resolution.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The input device <b>100</b> may be implemented as a fingerprint sensor having a sensor resolution high enough to capture discriminative features of a fingerprint. In some implementations, the fingerprint sensor has a resolution sufficient to capture minutia (including ridge endings and bifurcations), orientation fields (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;ridge flows&#x201d;), and/or ridge skeletons. These are sometimes referred to as level <b>1</b> and level <b>2</b> features, and in an exemplary embodiment, a resolution of at least 250 pixels per inch (ppi) is capable of reliably capturing these features. In some implementations, the fingerprint sensor has a resolution sufficient to capture higher level features, such as sweat pores or edge contours (i.e., shapes of the edges of individual ridges).

In a placement sensor implementation, the sensor is configured to capture a fingerprint input as the user's finger is held stationary over the sensing region. Typically, the placement sensor includes a two dimensional array of sensing elements capable of capturing a desired area of the fingerprint in a single frame. In a swipe sensor implementation, the sensor is configured to capture to a fingerprint input based on relative movement between the user's finger and the sensing region. Typically, the swipe sensor includes a linear array or a thin two-dimensional array of sensing elements configured to capture multiple frames as the user's finger is swiped over the sensing region. The multiple frames may then be reconstructed to form an image of the fingerprint corresponding to the fingerprint input. In some implementations, the sensor is configured to capture both placement and swipe inputs.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, a fingerprint sensor is configured to capture less than a full area of a user's fingerprint in a single user input (referred to herein as a &#x201c;partial&#x201d; fingerprint sensor).

Some exemplary imaging areas for partial placement sensors include an imaging area of 100 mm<sup>2 </sup>or less. In another exemplary embodiment, a partial placement sensor has an imaging area in the range of 20-50 mm<sup>2</sup>.

In particular, the foldable device <b>300</b> includes the processing system <b>110</b> and an input/output device <b>310</b>. The processing system <b>110</b> is described above. The input/output device <b>310</b> may be any type of device that is capable of receiving inputs (e.g., user inputs) and outputting information. For instance, the input/output device <b>310</b> may include the sensor <b>105</b> that comprises one or more sensing elements configured to sense input provided by one or more input objects (e.g., fingers, hands, styli, and so on) in a sensing region. In other words, the input/output device <b>310</b> may include electrodes such as the transmitter sensor electrodes and/or the receiver sensor electrodes of the sensor <b>105</b>. For example, the first set of electrodes <b>320</b> may be operated as a set of transmitter electrodes and the second set of electrodes <b>330</b> may be operated as a set of receiver electrodes. Based on instructions from the processing system <b>110</b>, the transmitter electrodes may be configured to provide a signal that is detectable by the receiver electrodes. For example, the foldable device <b>300</b> may be in an open state (e.g., lying flat). The processing system <b>110</b> may instruct the transmitter electrodes (e.g., the first set of electrodes <b>320</b>) to provide one or more sensing signals. Since the foldable device <b>300</b> is in an open state (e.g., due to the distance), the receiver electrodes (e.g., the second set of electrodes <b>330</b>) might not be able to detect the signal. As such, based on this, the processing system <b>110</b> may determine that the foldable device <b>300</b> is in an open state (e.g., the orientation of the device <b>300</b> is in an unfolded orientation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>).

For instance, the foldable device <b>300</b> may be in a completely open or flat state (e.g., 180 degrees). It may also be in a closed state (e.g., 0 degrees). Further, the foldable device <b>300</b> may be in an intermediate state such as a portion of the device <b>300</b> (e.g., the top portion) being upright and another portion (e.g., bottom portion) being on a flat surface such as a table. In other words, the two portions of the foldable device <b>300</b> may be oriented at a 90 degree separation. The foldable device <b>300</b> may be oriented any at angle (e.g., 0 degrees may be when the device is folded onto itself, 180 degrees may be in a completely open or flat state, and any angle in-between) and the processing system <b>110</b> may use the first and second set of electrodes <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> to detect this angle.

In an upright position (e.g., 90 degrees as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>), there may be no resulting signals detected on the sixth, seventh and eighth electrodes <b>530</b>, <b>532</b>, <b>534</b>, and a very weak or no resulting signal detected on the fifth electrode <b>528</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">At block <b>406</b>, the processing system <b>110</b> determines a state of the computing device based on the plurality of resulting signals. For instance, in a simplified example, the processing system <b>110</b> may use the resulting signals to determine whether the foldable device <b>300</b> is in an open state or a closed state. For example, the processing system <b>110</b> may compare the resulting signals with one or more thresholds (e.g., a single threshold for all four receiver electrodes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> or an individual threshold for each of the receiver electrodes from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). Based on the comparison, the processing system <b>110</b> may determine whether the foldable device <b>300</b> is in an open state or a closed state. In other words, the processing system <b>110</b> may determine a relative state or position of a first portion of the foldable device (e.g., the portion above the foldable portion <b>508</b>) as compared to (e.g., relative to) a second portion of the foldable device (e.g., the portion below the foldable portion <b>508</b>).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Additionally, and/or alternatively, the processing system <b>110</b> may use one or more ratios between resulting signals received on respective receiver electrodes to determine whether the foldable device <b>300</b> is in an open or closed state and/or to determine an angle of opening. For instance, the processing system <b>110</b> may determine one or more ratios between resulting signals received via the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth electrodes <b>528</b>, <b>530</b> <b>532</b>, <b>534</b>. The processing system <b>110</b> may use these ratios (e.g., by comparing it with one or more thresholds) to determine the state of the foldable device <b>300</b>. The ratios include, for example, a first ratio between the fifth and sixth electrodes <b>528</b>/<b>530</b>, a second ratio between the fifth and seventh electrodes <b>528</b>/<b>532</b>, a third ratio between the fifth and eighth electrodes <b>528</b>/<b>534</b>, a fourth ratio between the sixth and seventh electrodes <b>530</b>/<b>532</b>, a fifth ratio between the sixth and eighth electrodes <b>530</b>/<b>534</b>, and/or a sixth ratio between the seventh and eighth electrodes <b>532</b>/<b>534</b>. An advantage of utilizing these ratios is that the detection process is less susceptible to noise which affects the receiver electrodes, thereby providing differential measurements which removes such common noise. It will be appreciated that in a closed (0 degree state), the ratios (assuming substantially uniform drive signals on the transmitter electrodes) would be close to 1, and as the device becomes more and more open, the ratios will proportionally get farther and farther from 1. For example, if the processing system is taking into consideration a ratio of resulting signals obtained via the fifth electrode <b>528</b> to resulting signals obtained via the sixth electrode <b>530</b>, the ratio will get larger and larger as the angle of opening starts from 0 and increases. On the other hand, if the processing system is taking into consideration a ratio of resulting signals obtained via the sixth electrode <b>530</b> to resulting signals obtained via the fifth electrode <b>528</b>, the ratio will get smaller and smaller as the angle of opening starts from 0 and increases.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some instances, the processing system <b>110</b> may use a look-up table (LUT) that stores one or more ratio to determine the state/angle of the foldable device <b>300</b>. Based on the values from the LUT, the processing system <b>110</b> may determine the angle of the foldable device <b>300</b>. For example, the processing system <b>110</b> may initially calibrate the foldable device <b>300</b> by driving the transmitter electrodes and obtaining the resultant signals at the receiver electrodes. The processing system <b>110</b> may then determine one or more ratios based on the resultant signals and obtain (e.g., via user input) a state/angle of the foldable device <b>300</b>. The processing system <b>110</b> may then store these ratios as well as the state/angle into the LUT. The processing system <b>110</b> may continue this process for one or more other states/angles of the foldable device <b>300</b> and store these values into the LUT as well. Afterwards, the processing system <b>110</b> may store the LUT in memory and then use the LUT to determine the state/angle of the foldable device <b>300</b> in operation. In some examples, by using a LUT with the ratios, the calibration may be sufficient to determine the state/angle of the foldable device <b>300</b> over a long period of time (due to the use of differential readings, wear and tear on the device which would affect the readings on all receiver electrodes would not degrade the accuracy of the calibration). In some variations, the stored LUT may include a plurality of entries. For example, each of the entries may indicate an angle of the foldable device <b>300</b> and one or more ratios associated with the angle.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">At block <b>408</b>, the processing system <b>110</b> changes one or more settings of a display device based on the determined state. For instance, in a simplified example with an open and closed state, the processing system <b>110</b> may determine whether the foldable device <b>300</b> is in an open state or a closed state based on the resulting signals. Then, the processing system <b>110</b> may change one or more settings for the display device based on the state. For example, the processing system <b>110</b> may use a power saver mode for the display device and/or for the entire foldable device <b>300</b> based on the determination that the foldable device is in a closed state. The power saver mode may attempt to preserve power such as by turning off the display device.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some instances, the settings may be based on an angle or orientation of the foldable device <b>300</b>. For instance, the processing system <b>110</b> may engage the power saver mode based on the foldable device <b>300</b> reaching a certain angle (e.g., 10 degrees). Additionally, and/or alternatively, the processing system <b>110</b> may apply display setting such as applying gamma compensation to the foldable device <b>300</b>. For instance, the processing system <b>110</b> may apply a gamma value to the top portion of the display of the foldable device that is different from a display setting for the bottom portion of the display based on the angle of the foldable device <b>300</b>. Gamma compensation or correction may control an overall brightness of the display. For example, gamma correction may be a nonlinear operation used to encode and/or decode luminance, brightness, and/or tristimulus values for a display. Gamma correction may use a value (e.g., a gamma value) for this compensation. The processing system <b>110</b> may determine, based on the angle of the foldable device, these values (e.g., a first and second gamma values) for the top portion and bottom portion of the foldable device and use these values for gamma compensation.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Additionally, and/or alternatively, the display settings may further include, but are not limited to, changing the color gamut and/or the brightness (e.g., luminance) levels. For instance, the processing system <b>110</b> may change the color gamut and/or brightness level based on the angle of the foldable device <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some examples, the processing system <b>110</b> may use a driving scheme that instructs all of the transmitter electrodes to generate the sensing signals at the same time (e.g., firing the transmitter electrodes at the same time) to determine the state/angle of the foldable device <b>300</b>. In other examples and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the processing system <b>110</b> may use a driving scheme that causes each of the transmitter electrodes to generate the sensing signals in a sequential order. For example, the processing system <b>110</b> may cause a first transmitter electrode (e.g., the first electrode <b>520</b>) to generate a sensing signal and each of the receiver electrodes (e.g., electrodes <b>528</b>-<b>534</b>) may attempt to detect the resulting signal. Then, the processing system <b>110</b> may cause a second transmitter electrode (e.g., the second electrode <b>522</b>) to generate a sensing signal, and so on. The processing system <b>110</b> may use the resultant signals associated with each of the transmitter electrodes to determine the state and/or angle of the foldable device <b>300</b>. For example, the processing system <b>110</b> may determine ratios from the resultant signals and determine the state/angle of the foldable device <b>300</b> based on the state/angle.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some variations, the processing system <b>110</b> may dim the display of the foldable device <b>300</b> (e.g., reduce the brightness of the display) as the angle of the foldable device decreases. For instance, based on the foldable device <b>300</b> being above a threshold such as above a 30 degree angle (e.g., above the orientation shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>), the display screen of the foldable device may be at full brightness. Then, the foldable device <b>300</b> may dim the display as the angle of the foldable device <b>300</b> decreases. For instance, in some examples, for every 10 degrees (e.g., 20 degrees and 10 degrees), the foldable device <b>300</b> may dim the display by a certain amount until the foldable device <b>300</b> is closed (e.g., at 0 degrees). Once closed, the foldable device <b>300</b> may turn off the display. In other examples, the foldable device <b>300</b> may dim the display based on the angle of the display. For instance, the foldable device <b>300</b> may dim the display for every degree under 30 degrees (e.g., the brightness dims by 1/30 for each degree below 30 degrees). This may confirm to the user that the foldable device is turned off. Additionally, and/or alternatively, this functionality may also serve as a &#x201c;night light.&#x201d; By dimming the foldable device <b>300</b> based on the angle, the foldable device <b>300</b> may auto-dim and the user might not need to manually dim the display.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The electrode configuration (e.g., the bars and stripes electrode configuration) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> is merely an example and process <b>400</b> may use any type of electrode configuration to determine the state/angle of the foldable device <b>300</b>.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the foldable device <b>300</b> includes a dotted line <b>602</b> denoting a foldable portion for the foldable device <b>300</b>. Above the foldable portion <b>602</b> are individual electrodes <b>604</b>-<b>626</b> and below the foldable portion <b>602</b> are electrodes <b>628</b>-<b>650</b>. Each of the electrodes <b>604</b>-<b>650</b> may be capable of being transmitter electrodes as well as receiver electrodes. For instance, the first set of electrodes <b>320</b> (e.g., the transmitter electrodes) may be the set of electrodes <b>604</b>-<b>626</b> that are above the foldable portion <b>602</b> and the second set of electrodes <b>330</b> (e.g., the receiver electrodes) may be the set of electrodes <b>628</b>-<b>650</b> that are below the foldable portion <b>602</b>.

Process <b>400</b> may use the electrode pairs of transmitter/receiver electrodes (e.g., electrode <b>604</b> may be the transmitter and electrode <b>646</b> may be the receiver) to determine the state/angle of the foldable device <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In yet other examples, process <b>400</b> may use other types of electrode configurations. It will be appreciated that the principles discussed herein may be applied to many different variations of foldable devices having electrodes on both sides of a folding element (e.g., a hinge), wherein the electrodes on one side may be operated as transmitter electrodes and the electrodes on the other side may be operated as receiver electrodes. In some instances, the electrodes of the foldable device <b>300</b> may be driven at the same time and/or driven using code division multiplexing (CDM). By using CDM, noise may be reduced.
