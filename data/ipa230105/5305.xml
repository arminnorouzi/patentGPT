description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the benefit of priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0085486, filed on Jun. 30, 2020, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein for all purposes by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to a method of diagnosing a judder detection module and, more particularly, to a judder detection module diagnosing method for diagnosing whether or not a judder detection module mounted on a vehicle is operating normally.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Brake judder occurring during braking of a vehicle refers to a phenomenon where the vehicle body vibrates, or vibrations or noise are generated from the brake pedal, the steering wheel, or the like when the brake is being pressed. It is known that the brake judder is mainly caused by the thermal deformation or the thickness deviation of the brake disc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the thermal deformation or the thickness deviation of the brake disc arises, the difference in the coefficient of friction between the brake disc and a friction material causes a change in the braking torque of the disc. This change vibrates the wheel. Such vibration occurring in the wheel is transferred to the steering wheel through the suspension and the steering unit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods of determining judder may include a method of determining whether or not judder actually occurs by repeatedly braking a vehicle in a high-speed driving condition, a method of directly measuring a difference in the thickness of the brake disc, a method of using a dynamo, and the like. However, none of these methods may be regarded as being significantly efficient, due to time and costs required for performing the methods.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, in place of these methods, a judder detection logic is mounted on a vehicle to detect judder and store information regarding the occurrence of the judder. Thus, a repair shop or a service center may easily determine the amount of judder using a detector. However, as a problem of the judder detection logic, it is difficult to determine whether or not the judder detection logic is operating normally.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, in situations, such as where no judder has occurred in a vehicle on which the judder detection logic is mounted (that is, even when the judder detection logic is operating normally, it is impossible to determine whether or not the judder detection logic is operating normally unless judder has occurred) and where the judder detection logic is not operating normally due to a problem, such as a logical error or a system defect, or the like, it is impossible to determine whether or not the judder detection logic actually is operating normally.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, data regarding the operation of the detection logic is helpful in providing relevant information to a user. There may be a situation in which a vehicle owner has brought his/her vehicle to a service center for testing because of a judder problem, but no judder is detected by a detection logic. In this case, when reporting to the vehicle owner that no judder is detected, it would be more reliable that actual data regarding the judder detection is provided.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there is a demand for the development of a technology that can make it possible to diagnose whether or not a judder detection function is operating normally.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The information disclosed in the Background section above is to aid in the understanding of the background of the present disclosure, and should not be taken as acknowledgement that this information forms any part of prior art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, the present disclosure has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the related art, and the present disclosure is intended to propose a method and system for diagnosing whether or not a judder detection module mounted on a vehicle is operating normally.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The objective of the present disclosure is not limited to the aforementioned description, and other objectives not explicitly disclosed herein will be clearly understood by a person having ordinary skill in the field to which the present disclosure pertains (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;person having ordinary skill in the art&#x201d;) from the description provided hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to achieve at least one of the above objectives and perform at least one of characteristic functions of the present disclosure to be described later, the present disclosure has following features.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, provided is a method of diagnosing a judder detection module.
