This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present disclosure. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines various standards as part of the duties of the collaborative organization. For example, 3GPP has defined a 5G New Radio (NR) Frequency Range 2 (FR2) specification telling the UE and a Next Generation NodeB (gNB) how to communicate using 5G communications. The 3GPP NR FR2 specifies that the UE using beamforming. A 3GPP NR FR2 link is in centimeter or millimeter wave band and relies on beamforming for connections. In beamforming, reference signals (RS) are transmitted to obtain and track beams as network overhead. The RS may include a synchronization signal block (SSB) or channel site information reference signal (CSIRS) in a downlink. In an uplink, the RS may include a sounding reference signal (SRS).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The 3GPP NR FR2 specification also supports robustness and reliability improvement by allowing downlink and uplink slot aggregation. Specifically, when an aggregationFactorDL is configured to be greater than 1, the UE will expect that a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) is repeated over multiple consecutive slots. Similarly, when an aggregationFactorUL is configured as greater than 1, the UE will repeat a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) over multiple consecutive slots. Both PDSCH and PUSCH may be used in slot aggregation scheduled by a downlink control information (DCI) with only one beam indicated for the aggregated slots.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A FR2 UE may be in a &#x201c;local&#x201d; high mobility state having constant/repeated rotation and/or small movements of the UE. A &#x201c;strongest&#x201d; beam may change and may be re-selected through beam measurement and reporting. In certain deployments where the UE is in a frequently changing environment (crowds, moving vehicles, and the like), the beams may be blocked and unblocked in a frequently changing manner where beam tracking/update may be performed using beam measurement and reporting. However, in these high-mobility scenarios, the use of frequent beam training and reports may lead to an impermissible amount of network overhead. Furthermore, even with frequent beam management, there may be a delay from an actual change of which beam is the strongest beam to an update of beam usage by the UE. This delay may occur due to transmission from a transmission reception point (TRP) in a downlink or a UE panel in an uplink may only use one beam in a slot resulting in a high latency and a quality of signal (QoS) degradation when transmitting to multiple directions. In addition, panel selection also uses measurement and report, adding to the latency and network overhead.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various aspects of this disclosure may be better understood upon reading the following detailed description and upon reference to the drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an electronic device used to communicate with a base node, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is one example of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is another example of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is another example of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is another example of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram of a wireless communication between a cellular device and a base node of a wireless network, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a process for sweeping beams using slot aggregation, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram of a transmission beam sweeping, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram of transmission and receiving beam sweeping, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flow diagram of an event-driven beam sweep using slot aggregation, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">One or more specific embodiments of the present disclosure will be described below. These described embodiments are only examples of the presently disclosed techniques. Additionally, in an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, all features of an actual implementation may not be described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but may nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present disclosure, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements.

With multiple TRPs in the network and/or multiple antenna panels in UE, PDSCH and PUSCH can be transmitted/received from different directions. As discussed below, extending multi-slot PDSCH/PUSCH with beam sweeping can be a solution to the high mobility challenge. When downlink or uplink slot aggregation is configured, the PDSCH/PUSCH may be repeated in multiple time slots while beam sweeping. Using multiple beams from multiple panels increases the chance that beam points to the gNB, avoiding the increased latency in updating beams/panels and/or the requirement of beam alignment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As will be described in more detail below, the electronic device <b>10</b> may be any suitable electronic device, such as a computer, a mobile phone, a portable media device, a wearable device, a tablet, a television, a virtual-reality headset, a vehicle dashboard, and the like.

In those periods, slots for the cell <b>58</b> may be aggregated together and signals (over PDSCH/PUSCH) may be repeated during consecutive slots to aid in identifying the best beam in a timely manner even in high mobility situations for the UE <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a process <b>60</b> that may be performed by the UE <b>50</b>. The UE <b>50</b> receives a configuration of slot aggregation for communication with the gNB <b>52</b> (block <b>62</b>). This received configuration may be included in a downlink control information (DCI) signal and/or other signals, such as Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling. The received configuration may include an indication a number of slots to be aggregated, an indication of whether transmission beams and/or receiver beams are to be swept during the aggregated slots, and/or indications of additional details discussed below. During the aggregated slots, the UE <b>50</b> sweeps through beams (block <b>64</b>). For example, if the UE <b>50</b> may repeat PUSCH across multiple slots using different beams to determine a best beam to be used for the uplink <b>54</b> with the gNB <b>52</b>. The UE <b>50</b> receives an indication of a best beam of the beam sweep from the gNB <b>52</b> and selects that best beam (block <b>66</b>).

Using multiple beams from multiple panels increases the chance that beam points to the gNB <b>52</b>, avoiding the increased latency in updating beams/panels or the requirement of beam alignment. Repeating PDSCH/PUSCH in slot aggregation may be analogous to transmit diversity with no or partial channel information in MIMO techniques.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">As previously noted, beam sweeping may refer to sweeping transmission beams, sweeping receiving beams, or a combination of sweeping both transmission and receiving beams. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, when a PUSCH is repeated in multiple slots, a UE <b>50</b> may sweep through transmission beams when only the transmission beam sweep of the UE <b>50</b> is scheduled. For instance, in a first PUSCH slot <b>102</b>, the UE <b>50</b> uses a first transmission beam <b>104</b>. In a second PUSCH slot <b>106</b>, the UE <b>50</b> uses a second transmission beam <b>108</b>. In a third PUSCH slot <b>110</b>, the UE <b>50</b> uses a third transmission beam <b>112</b>. In a fourth PUSCH slot <b>114</b>, the UE <b>50</b> uses a fourth transmission beam <b>116</b>. Since only the transmission beams are swept through the transmission beams <b>104</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>116</b>, a gNB <b>52</b> may utilize a single receiving beam <b>122</b> for each PUSCH slot. When a PDSCH is repeated in multiple slots, the UE <b>50</b> may sweep through its beams when only the transmission beam sweep is scheduled. Regardless of whether PDSCH or PUSCH beam sweeping is applied, beam sweeping may be configured and scheduled as discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">Further, although the illustrated embodiment shows only the beams of the UE <b>50</b> being swept across the slots while a same beam (e.g., beam <b>122</b>) of the gNB <b>52</b> is used, the gNB <b>52</b> may sweep through beams while the UE <b>50</b> uses a same beam in the slots <b>102</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of a beam sweep of both transmission and receiving beams. For instance, in the first PUSCH slot <b>102</b>, the UE <b>50</b> uses a first transmission beam <b>104</b> while the gNB <b>52</b> uses the first receiving beam <b>122</b>. In a second PUSCH slot <b>106</b>, the UE <b>50</b> uses a second transmission beam <b>108</b> while the gNB <b>52</b> uses a second receiving beam <b>124</b>.

For both transmission beam and receiving beam sweeps, the gNB <b>52</b> and the UE <b>50</b> may sweep as a pair in either order such that the gNB <b>52</b> may sweep its beam in response to the UE transmission beam sweep or the gNB <b>52</b> may be sweep its transmission beam in response to the UE beam sweep.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0000">Configuring Downlink Slot Aggregation with Beam Sweep</p><p id="p-0047" num="0044">Repeating PDSCH in multiple slots with a receiving beam sweep can be configured by the network through Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling. For instance, a new RRC information element (IE) may be added to enable and/or disable beam sweeping when downlink aggregation is configured. When the new IE is set to TRUE, PDSCH is transmitted by the same transmission beam and the UE <b>50</b> can sweep receiving beams over the slots. When the new IE is set to FALSE, PDSCH is transmitted by the different transmission beams and the UE <b>50</b> uses the corresponding receiving beams over the slots.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">Additionally or alternatively, a new RRC IE may be added to indicate a number of transmission beams over the aggregated slots. If the number of aggregated slots N is divisible by the number of transmission beams M, the UE <b>50</b> can sweep up to N/M receiving beams for each transmission beam. If N is not divisible by M, the UE <b>50</b> can sweep up to a ceiling function of (N/M) receiving beam for the first M-1 transmission beams and sweep fewer numbers of receiving beams for the last transmission beam. In other words, the UE <b>50</b> may sweep all receiving beams until the last transmission beam is swept. During the last transmission beam, less than all of the receiver beams are swept. Alternatively the UE <b>50</b> can sweep up to a floor function of (N/M) receiving beam for the first M-1 transmission beams and sweep more numbers of receiving beams for the last (one or more) transmission beams. In other words, the UE <b>50</b> may sweep less than all receiving beams for some of the transmission beams (e.g., all but last transmission beam) while sweeping all receiving beams for at least some of the beams (e.g., the last transmission beam).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0046">Additionally or alternatively, a new RRC IE may be added to indicate a bitmap of the transmission beam repetition. A new RRC IE may also be used to configure one or more transmission beam patterns and define a Media Access Control Element (MAC CE) to activate and deactivate the transmission beam patterns. The transmission beam pattern for multi-slot PDSCH is a new RRC IE that defines the transmission/receiving beam sweep pattern on each slot. Multiple transmission beam patterns for multi-slot PDSCH can be configured, and one or more pattern may be added, modified or released. When the new IE is not configured, PDSCH may or may not be transmitted by different transmission beams, but the UE <b>50</b> is expected to use the same receiving beams over different slots.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0000">Transmission Configuration Indicator (TCI) States for Downlink Slot Aggregation with Beam Sweep</p><p id="p-0051" num="0047">A TCI may be configured for a single spatial quasi-colocation (QCL) (i.e., a beam). For a transmission beam sweep and/or a receiving beam sweep, multiple transmission beams and hence multiple spatial quasi-colocation (QCL) may be configured. For instance, a new TCI-State-PDSCH-Aggregation RRC IE may be defined to contain multiple TCI-State elements. The order of the TCI-State elements corresponds to the order of the transmission beams applied over the aggregated slots. Alternatively, an extended TCI-State may be defined to contain multiple spatial QCL-Info elements. The order of spatial QCL-Info elements corresponds to the order of transmission beams applied over the aggregated slots. Hereafter both the new TCI-State-PDSCH-Aggregation IE and the extended TCI-State IE are referred as the &#x201c;new&#x201d; TCI-State. A single new TCI-State may be contained in the transmission beam pattern and/or multiple new TCI states may also be configured in other RRC signaling and activated/deactivated by MAC CE.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0000">Schedule Multi-Slot PDSCH with Beam Sweep.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0048">After a transmission beam sweeping pattern and/or a receiving beam sweeping pattern is defined by RRC signaling (and activated by the MAC CE), a modified TCI field in downlink DCI signals the transmission beam. For example, up to M TCI fields may be defined in the DCI, where M is the number of transmission beams used over the N aggregated slots as configured by higher layer signaling. Additionally or alternatively, when the new TCI-State elements are defined, the TCI-State elements may indicate one of the activated new TCI-state corresponding to multiple transmission beams over aggregated slots.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0049">After receiving the DCI, the UE <b>50</b> sweeps the receiving beams if configured to do so. A time offset (e.g., Threshold-Sched-Offset) may be applied to determining when transmission beam sweeping and/or receiving beam sweeping may be applied. This time offset provides time to prepare an antenna and/or panel hardware.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0050">In some embodiments, no additional time offset beyond the default Threshold-Sched-Offset is used. The Threshold-Sched-Offset is applied by the TCI in normal DCCH/PDSCH time offset even when multi-slot PDSCH is configured. However, the UE <b>50</b> may foresee that receiving beam sweep may be configured (e.g., UE <b>50</b> may request sweep). In response, the UE <b>50</b> may set the panel/antenna(s) to the appropriate power state such that the panel/antenna(s) may be in active mode with no further time offset used.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0051">Alternatively, in some embodiments, an additional time offset may be used beyond the default Threshold-Sched-Offset. In such embodiments, a new time offset threshold (i.e., Threshold-Sched-Offset-Beam-Sweep) may be used that is larger than the Threshold-Sched-Offset. The threshold levels may be used to imply transmission beam sweeping and/or receiving beam sweeping. For instance, in some embodiments, if the time offset between the DCI and the scheduled multi-slot PDSCH with both transmission beam sweep and/or receiving beam sweep is greater than Threshold-Sched-Offset-Beam-Sweep, the UE <b>50</b> may assume the transmission beam sweep is indicated by DCI in addition to the receiving beam sweep. If the time offset between DCI and the scheduled multi-slot PDSCH with both transmission/receiving sweep is shorter than Threshold-Sched-Offset-Beam-Sweep but not shorter than Threshold-Sched-Offset, the UE <b>50</b> may only sweep the receiving beams.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0000">Configure Uplink Slot Aggregation with Beam Sweep</p><p id="p-0058" num="0052">Repeating the PUSCH in multiple slots with a transmission beam sweep can be configured by network through RRC signaling. For instance, a new RRC IE may be added to enable and/or disable beam sweep when downlink aggregation is configured. When the new IE is set to FALSE, PUSCH is transmitted by different transmission beams so the UE <b>50</b> may sweep the corresponding transmission beams over the aggregated slots. When the new IE is set to TRUE, PUSCH is transmitted by the same transmission beam.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0053">Additionally or alternatively, a new RRC IE may be added to indicate a number of transmission beams over the aggregated slots. If the number of aggregated slots N is divisible by the number of transmission beams M, the UE <b>50</b> can transmit PUSCH up to N/M slots for each transmission beam. If N is not divisible by M, the UE <b>50</b> can transmit PUSCH a number of slots for the first M-1 transmission beams, where the number is found using a ceiling function of (N/M). For the last transmission beam, the UE <b>50</b> may transmit PUSCH in fewer slots. Alternatively, when N cannot be divided by M, the UE <b>50</b> can transmit PUSCH a number of slots for the first M-1 transmission beams, where the number is found using a floor function of (N/M). For the last transmission beam, the UE <b>50</b> may transmit PUSCH in more slots.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0054">Additionally or alternatively, a new RRC IE may be added to indicate a bitmap of the transmission beam repetition. A new RRC IE may also be used to configure at least one transmission beam pattern and define the MAC CE to activate and deactivate the transmission beam patterns. The transmission beam pattern for multi-slot PUSCH is a new RRC IE that defines the transmission/receiving beam sweep pattern on each slot. Multiple transmission beam patterns for multi-slot PUSCH can be configured, and one or more pattern may be added, modified, or released. When the new IE is not configured, PUSCH may or may not be transmitted by the same transmission beams but the gNB <b>52</b> may not use different receiving beams over slots.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0000">Sounding Reference Signal Resource Indicator (SRI) for Uplink Slot Aggregation with Beam Sweep</p><p id="p-0062" num="0055">An SRI may typically indicate a single Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) resource (and a corresponding transmission beam). Each SRS resource contains a resource allocation for the SRS transmission. In some embodiments, the SRI may optionally contain a spatial relation to a Reference Signal (RS). For a transmission beam sweep and/or a receiving beam sweep, multiple transmission beams and hence multiple SRS resources may be indicated in a single SRI. For instance, a new SRS-Resource-Aggregation RRC IE may be defined to contain multiple SRS resources. The order of SRS resources corresponds to the order of transmission beams applied over the aggregated slots. Alternatively, an extended SRS resource may be defined to contain multiple resource allocations (and optionally multiple spatial relations). The order of resource allocations corresponds to the order of transmission beams applied over the aggregated slots. Hereafter, both the new SRS-Resource-Aggregation IE and the extended SRS resource IE are referred as the &#x201c;new&#x201d; SRS resource. The new SRS resource may be contained in the transmission beam pattern, and/or multiple new SRS resources can also be configured in other RRC signaling and activated/deactivated by MAC CE.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0000">Schedule Multi-Slot PUSCH with Beam Sweep.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0056">After a transmission beam sweeping pattern and/or a receiving beam sweeping pattern is defined by RRC signaling (and activated by the MAC CE), a modified SRI field in uplink DCI signals the transmission beam. For example, up to M SRI fields may be defined, where M is the number of transmission beams used over the N aggregated slots as configured by higher layer signaling. Additionally or alternatively, when the new SRS resource IEs are defined, the SRI field indicates one of the activated new SRS resources corresponding to multiple transmission beams over aggregated slots.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0057">In response to receiving a DCI, the UE <b>50</b> sweeps the transmission beams, if configured to do so. A time offset (e.g., preparation time) may be applied to determining whether transmission beam sweeping and/or receiving beam sweeping may be applied. This time offset provides time to prepare an antenna and/or panel hardware.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0058">Similar to the PDSCH, no additional time offset beyond the Threshold-Sched-Offset may be used in some embodiments. Thus, the Threshold-Sched-Offset is applied by the TCI in normal DCCH/PDSCH time offset. In such embodiments, when multi-slot PUSCH is configured, the UE <b>50</b> may foresee that the transmission beam sweep would be configured. In response, the UE <b>50</b> may set the panel/antenna(s) to the appropriate power state such that the panel/antenna(s) may be in active mode with no further time offset used.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0059">Alternatively, in some embodiments, an additional time offset may be used beyond the Threshold-Sched-Offset used for normal PUSCH preparation procedure time. In such embodiments, a new time offset threshold (i.e., Threshold-Sched-Offset-Beam-Sweep) may be used that is larger than the Threshold-Sched-Offset. The threshold levels may be used to imply transmission beam sweeping and/or receiving beam sweeping. For instance, in some embodiments, if the time offset between the DCI and the scheduled multi-slot PUSCH with both transmission beam sweep and/or receiving beam sweep is greater than Threshold-Sched-Offset-Beam-Sweep, the UE <b>50</b> may apply the transmission beam sweep as indicated by DCI. Otherwise, the UE <b>50</b> may either discard the DCI, or only transmit the PUSCH in the slots with the first indicated transmission beam.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0000">Event-Triggered Slot Aggregation with Beam Sweep Request</p><p id="p-0069" num="0060">Slot aggregation may occur in response to events detected at the UE <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a process <b>150</b> that may be used to change aggregation based on events. The UE <b>50</b> determines whether an event has occurred (block <b>152</b>). These events may be defined in the specifications. For instance, the event may include a rate of beam change for communication with/from the UE <b>50</b> above a threshold, quality-of-service (QoS) having a delta above a QoS threshold and occurring more frequent than a frequency threshold, and/or other events. The UE <b>50</b> (and/or the network) determines whether this event is to have a corresponding change in slot aggregation (block <b>154</b>). For instance, the UE <b>50</b> may determine whether a crossed threshold corresponds to a higher level of slot aggregation than is currently being used (e.g., no slot aggregation) in communications using the UE <b>50</b>. In some embodiments, multiple thresholds may be used for each event type and regions between thresholds may be associated with a corresponding slot aggregation in a look-up table in the network and/or the UE <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0061">When an event occurs and aggregation is to be changed, the UE <b>50</b> sends an event-triggered request to the network via the gNB <b>52</b> (block <b>156</b>). If slot aggregation (either downlink or uplink or both) is not configured, the UE <b>50</b> requests to configure slot aggregation including any of the foregoing configuration techniques. The UE <b>50</b> then requests to configure beam sweep over the aggregated slots. Additionally, in some embodiments, the UE <b>50</b> may request (e.g., in the request) a number for the aggregated slots, a number of receiving beams to sweep for downlink slot aggregation, and/or a number of transmission beams to sweep for uplink slot aggregation. Furthermore, the UE <b>50</b> may also send an expected duration for such a request thereby setting an expiration for the slot aggregation absent a subsequent request.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0062">In response to the request, the UE <b>50</b> receives configuration of the slot aggregation and/or beam sweep (e.g., slot allocations and time offsets) to be used (block <b>158</b>). Using the newly sent configuration or previously set configuration, the UE <b>50</b> and the gNB <b>52</b> perform beam sweeping using the aggregated slots (block <b>160</b>). During the sweep, the UE <b>50</b> and/or the network selects a best beam combination for communication between the UE <b>50</b> and the gNB <b>52</b> (block <b>162</b>). The UE <b>50</b> and the gNB <b>52</b> then uses corresponding beams for communications (block <b>164</b>).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0063">Since slot aggregation uses network and/or UE <b>50</b>, the UE <b>50</b> may monitor for when the event has ended to determine when to free up resources (block <b>166</b>). When the criteria of such an event is no longer met, the UE <b>50</b> can send a new event-triggered report to withdraw the previous request and to reduce slot aggregation (block <b>168</b>). Reducing slot aggregation may include disabling slot aggregation. Additionally or alternatively, the network may use the expected duration in the request or may independently determine when to stop slot aggregation based on a duration of the slot aggregation versus the expected duration or the independent determination.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Related UE Capabilities</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0064">Capabilities of the UE <b>50</b> may be defined corresponding to each or some of the UE <b>50</b> features previously described and/or may be sent to the network to indicate capabilities of the UE <b>50</b>.
