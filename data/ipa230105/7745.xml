The computer components with light-emitting elements can be classified into two types. One is directly mounted on the motherboard, such as a memory directly installed on the motherboard, which does not require an additional transmission line or power cable. The other type must be associated with the motherboard through transmission lines, such as an RGB fan installed on the chassis or an RGB water pump installed on the CPU.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, a limited number of transmission interfaces (such as USB interfaces) provided on the motherboard restricts the number of light-emitting computer components. In addition, the transmission interfaces of the motherboard cannot provide the light-emitting computer components with enough energy, so the light-emitting computer components must also be provided with a power cable to receive enough power from the power supply. In such a case, the number of wires in the chassis will be unavoidably increased.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Refer to U.S. patent Ser. No. 10/514,732B2, it relates to a smart computer case. The smart computer case is provided with a micro controller unit, a plurality of computer case fans, an RGB LED logo, an integrated lighting feature, and a power supply. A plurality of light-emitting elements (LEDs) are configured in the plurality of computer case fans. The micro controller unit is associated with the transmission interface of the motherboard, and the plurality of computer case fans and the RGB LED logo are associated with the micro controller unit, so that the smart computer can send the instructions for controlling the light or fan speed of the plurality of computer case fans, as well as the color and intensity of the light.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The micro controller unit can transmit data, but cannot provide enough power to the plurality of computer case fans. Therefore, the plurality of computer case fans must require additional power cables to receive enough power, so the computer case will be avoidably stuffed with many wires. Not only will such an arrangement cause a messy space, but it will also increase the difficulty of the wiring configuration. In addition, the number of transmission interfaces on the micro controller unit is restricted, which also restricts the number of computer case fans.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The conventional controlling system with light-emitting computer components has the following disadvantages:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">1. Restricted Component Number</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since a limited number of transmission interfaces (such as USB interfaces) provided on the motherboard restricts the number of light-emitting computer components, the number of light-emitting elements on the chassis is also restricted, so that a conventional chassis is difficult to configure with more light-emitting elements.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">2. Increased Number of Wires</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The microcontroller associated with the motherboard can only transmit data, but cannot provide the plurality of light-emitting elements with enough power, so that the plurality of light-emitting elements must require additional power cables to receive power, which will increase the wires in the chassis.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">3. Restricted Configuration</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The light-emitting elements installed in various locations of the chassis are connected by the microcontroller or power supply. The common light-emitting elements have fixed wire length. When the distance between the light-emitting elements in the chassis and the microcontroller or power supply is too far, the wire is not long enough for connecting the microcontroller and the power supply, which will restrict the location of the light-emitting elements.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, it is desirable to provide a larger number of light-emitting elements in the chassis with reduced number of wires in the chassis to simplify the wiring configuration of the light-emitting elements in the chassis.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Fora better understanding of the aforementioned aspects of the invention as well as additional aspects and embodiments thereof, reference should be made to the Description of Embodiments below, in conjunction with the following drawings in which like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the figures.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a single rail control system with receiver modules, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a single rail control system with receiver modules comprising a transmitter module, a connector module, and a receiver module, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a single rail control system with receiver modules comprising a transmitter module, a connector module, and a receiver module with a fan, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a single rail control system with receiver modules comprising a transmitter module, a connector module and two receiver modules, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a single rail control system with receiver modules, in which a transmitter module is associated with two connector modules, and the two connector modules are associated with a receiver module, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a single rail control system with receiver modules comprising a transmitter module, a connector module, and a receiver module with a guide rail, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a single rail control system with receiver modules, in which a transmitter module is associated with a connector module, and the connector module is associated with two receiver modules, wherein one of the receiver modules is equipped with a fan, and another one is equipped with a water block with pump, according to certain embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Methods, systems, user interfaces, and other aspects of the invention are described.
