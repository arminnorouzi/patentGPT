According to the Frost &#x26; Sullivan survey, the global in-vitro diagnosis market recorded an annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3%, starting at about 47 billion dollars in 2013 and reaching a scale of about 63 billion dollars in 2017. In addition, among various technical fields in the rapidly growing in-vitro diagnosis market, molecular diagnostic and on-site diagnostic fields have been observed to be the technical fields recording the highest growth rates, namely 12.7% and 8.4%, respectively. Molecular diagnostic technology enables the direct detection of genetic information (DNA/RNA) of a pathogen that causes a disease, and thus is receiving much attention as a technology capable of addressing disadvantages of immunodiagnostic technology for detecting indirect factors of a disease on the basis of known antigen/antibody reactions. In addition, on-site diagnostic technology is a technology that can remarkably reduce the time and expense associated with use of large hospitals or specialized diagnostic centers for checkups, unlike conventional diagnostic technologies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the rapid advance in these molecular diagnostic and on-site diagnostic technical fields, the severity of disease-related problems caused by RNA viruses has recently emerged. An example that can show the severity of RNA virus diseases is the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). MERS is a viral respiratory infection caused by coronavirus (a type of RNA virus), and in 2015, 1,599 cases of MERS infections occurred worldwide, and a fatality rate of about 40% was recorded (as of Jun. 26, 2015). In the same year in Korea, 186 MERS cases occurred as of July 5, starting with the first confirmed patient on May 20, and 38 deaths occurred by November. As such, in the case of diseases caused by RNA viruses, great human damage easily occurs, and this can be said to result from a high mutation rate, which is a characteristic of RNA viruses. Due to this characteristic of RNA viruses, it is difficult to diagnose whether or not an infection occurs, and as a result, it is difficult to diagnose and deal with a disease early.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Technology has been developed to address these problems, and among various technologies that have been developed to date, the most representative diagnostic technology used in RNA virus detection is a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR is a technique of generating complementary DNA (cDNA) from target RNA using a reverse transcriptase before a DNA amplification reaction and then amplifying the produced complementary DNA through PCR. This technique is advantageous in that a target DNA can be detected with high sensitivity using the high amplification efficiency of PCR, and is a technique that has been essentially used to confirm a disease to date. However, in order to implement such a RT-PCR technique, sophisticated temperature control for a nucleic acid amplification reaction is required, which acts as a factor that hinders the miniaturization of diagnostic devices. Therefore, the RT-PCR technique is disadvantageous in that it can be used only in limited facilities such as large hospitals or specialized diagnostic centers equipped with diagnostic equipment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As an RNA detection technique capable of addressing the disadvantage of the aforementioned RT-PCR technique, nucleic-acid-sequence-based amplification (hereinafter referred to as NASBA) was developed (Kievits et al., Journal of Virological Methods, 35:273, 1991). NASBA involves amplification and detection reactions of target RNA under isothermal conditions (41&#xb0; C.), and thus has been used as a new isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique capable of addressing the problems of existing RT-PCR. NASBA is based on a reaction in which a T7-promoter-containing double-stranded DNA is produced from target RNA, and then a large amount of anti-sense RNA is produced through a T7 RNA polymerase transcription reaction. In addition, the produced anti-sense RNA can be used as a substrate for the production reaction of a T7-promoter-containing double-stranded DNA, thereby implementing an amplification reaction with high efficiency. However, NASBA is disadvantageous in that the anti-sense RNA amplification reaction is dependent only on the transcription reaction of T7 RNA polymerase. Thus, when the efficiency of the reaction in which a T7-promoter-containing double-stranded DNA is produced from target RNA is low, a problem may also occur in the efficiency of the anti-sense RNA amplification reaction based on the transcription reaction of T7 RNA polymerase, which may act as a factor that generates a false signal.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, as a result of having made intensive efforts to address the above-described problems with the related art, the inventors of the present invention confirmed that, by introducing a primer modified with an nicking enzyme recognition nucleotide sequence into existing NASBA, the exponential amplification reaction of a T7-promoter-containing double-stranded DNA was performed on the basis of nicking enzyme and DNA polymerase activity, and then an anti-sense RNA was produced, and as a result, a new concept isothermal nucleic acid amplification reaction with high amplification efficiency compared to the existing NASBA can be implemented, and thus completed the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of increasing target RNA detection sensitivity by enhancing the nucleic acid amplification reaction efficiency of existing NASBA through nicking/extension-chain-reaction-system-based isothermal nucleic acid amplification.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a method of detecting of a target RNA based on a nicking/extension chain reaction system, comprising:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(a) hybridizing a target RNA with a first primer including a sequence complementary to the target RNA, a T7 promoter sequence, and a DNA nicking enzyme recognition nucleotide sequence, and then producing complementary DNA of the target RNA using a reverse transcriptase;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">(b) degrading the target RNA bound to the complementary DNA produced in step (a) by a ribonuclease;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">(c) hybridizing the complementary DNA with a second primer including a sequence complementary to the complementary DNA and a DNA nicking enzyme recognition nucleotide sequence, and then producing a double-stranded DNA including a T7 promoter and the nicking enzyme recognition nucleotide sequence using a reverse transcriptase;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">(d) treating the double-stranded DNA produced in step (c) with a DNA endonuclease to cleave a DNA nicking enzyme recognition site of the double-stranded DNA, and then amplifying the T7-promoter-containing double-stranded DNA using DNA polymerase;

Preferably, the polymerase is a thermostable DNA polymerase that can be obtained from various bacteria species, and examples thereof include <i>Thermus aquaticus </i>(Taq), <i>Thermus thermophilus </i>(Tth), <i>Thermus filiformis, Thermus flavus, Thermococcus litoralis, </i>and <i>Pyrococcus furiosus </i>(Pfu). When a polymerization reaction is performed, components required for the reaction may be provided in excess amounts in a reaction container. Excess amounts of components required for an amplification reaction refer to amounts such that the amplification reaction is not substantially limited by the concentrations of the components.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0041">In the present invention, the DNA nicking enzyme may be a nicking endonuclease, and is not limited, as long as it is an enzyme that recognizes and cleaves the specific recognition site of a DNA nucleotide sequence. The nicking endonuclease is an enzyme that catalyzes recognition of the specific nucleotide sequence of a double-stranded DNA molecule and cleavage of a portion thereof or the periphery thereof, and most nicking endonucleases cleave DNA at a location with a specific nucleotide sequence, which is referred to as a recognition site or a restriction site.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0042">The site recognized by a nicking endonuclease has a specific sequence called a palindrome. That is, this means that the recognition site has the same nucleotide sequence in the 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; direction of both strands. The specific nucleotide sequence denotes a recognition site. For example, the enzyme EcoRI cleaves DNA only when it meets the nucleotide sequence of GAATTC in a DNA double helix to form a 5&#x2032;-overhanging sticky end. In the present invention, the nicking endonuclease is not limited, as long as it is an enzyme that recognizes and cleaves the specific recognition site of a DNA nucleotide sequence, and may be, for example, EcoRI, BamHI, HindiIII, KpnI, NotI, PstI, SmaI, XhoI, or the like.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0043">In the present invention, &#x201c;anti-sense&#x201d; refers to an oligomer with a sequence of nucleotide bases and a backbone between sub-units that allow the anti-sense oligomer to hybridize with a target sequence in RNA by Watson-Crick base pairing, to form a RNA:oligomer heteroduplex within the target sequence, typically with mRNA. The oligomer may have exact sequence complementarity to the target sequence or near complementarity. It is required to add co-factors such as Mg<sup>2+</sup>, dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP to a reaction mixture to the extent to which a desired amplification degree can be achieved. All enzymes used in the amplification reaction may be active under the same reaction conditions. In fact, buffers provide conditions close to an optimum reaction conditions for all enzymes. Thus, the amplification process of the present invention may be carried out on a single reactant without changing conditions such as adding reactants.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0044">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a molecular beacon including a sequence complementary to the target RNA is used as a means for detecting an anti-sense RNA. In addition, various types of probes that bind to the target nucleic acid may be used, and the term &#x201c;probe&#x201d; as used herein refers to a single-strand nucleic acid molecule which includes a sequence complementary to a target nucleic acid sequence. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the probes of the present invention may be modified within the scope that does not impair the advantages of the probes of the present invention, i.e., improvement in hybridization specificity. These modifications, i.e., labels, may provide a signal to detect the presence or absence of hybridization, and may be linked to oligonucleotides. Suitable labels include fluorophores (e.g., fluorescein, phycoerythrin, rhodamine, lissamine, and Cy3 and Cy5 (Pharmacia)), chromophores, chemi-luminophores, magnetic particles, radioisotopes (P<sup>32 </sup>and S<sup>35</sup>), mass labeling, electron dense particles, enzymes (alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase), cofactors, substrates for enzymes, heavy metals (e.g., gold) and hapten, with specific binding partners such as antibodies, streptavidin, biotin, digoxigenin and chelating groups, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Labeling may be performed using various methods commonly used in the art, for example, a nick translation method, a random priming method (Multiprime DNA labelling systems booklet, &#x201c;Amersham&#x201d; (1989)), and a Kination method (Maxam &#x26; Gilbert, Methods in Enzymology, 65:499(1986)). Labels provide signals detectable using fluorescence, radioactivity, colorimetry, gravimetric measurement, X-ray diffraction or absorption, magnetism, enzymatic activity, mass analysis, binding affinity, hybridization high frequency, and nanocrystals.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a probe may be used as a means for detecting an anti-sense RNA, and the probe of the present invention may be immobilized on a water-insoluble carrier (e.g., a nitrocellulose or nylon filter, a glass plate, a silicone and a fluorocarbon support) to be manufactured as a microarray. In the microarray, the probe of the present invention is used as a hybridizable array element. The immobilization onto the water-insoluble carrier is performed by a chemical bonding method or a covalent bonding method such as UV. For example, the hybridizable array element may bind to a glass surface modified so as to include an epoxy compound or an aldehyde group, and may also bind to a polylysine coating surface by UV. In addition, the hybridizable array element may bind to a carrier via a linker (e.g., an ethylene glycol oligomer and a diamine). When the probe is used, the probe is hybridized with an anti-sense RNA molecule. In the present invention, suitable hybridization conditions may be determined through a series of processes by an optimized procedure. For example, conditions such as temperature, the concentration of components, hybridization and washing time, buffer components, and pH and ionic strength thereof depend on various factors such as the length of a probe, GC content, a target nucleotide sequence, and the like. The detailed conditions for hybridization can be confirmed in Joseph Sambrook, et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (2001); and M. L. M. Anderson, Nucleic Acid Hybridization, Springer-Verlag New York Inc. N.Y. (1999). After the hybridization reaction, a hybridization signal generated through the hybridization reaction is detected. Detection of hybridization signaling may be performed using various methods, for example, depending on the type of label bound to the probe. For example, when the probe is labeled with an enzyme, a substrate of the enzyme may be reacted with a hybridization reaction product to confirm the presence or absence of hybridization. Suitable combinations of enzyme/substrate include a peroxidase (e.g., horseradish peroxidase) and chloronaphthol, aminoethylcarbazole, diaminobenzidine, D-luciferin, bis-N-methylacridinium nitrate (lucigenin), resorufin benzyl ether, luminol, an Amplex red reagent (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine), p-phenylenediamine-HCl and pyrocatechol (HYR), tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), 2,2&#x2032;-azine-di[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate] (ABTS), o-phenylene diamine (OPD), and naphthol/pyronine; alkaline phosphatase and bromochloroindolyl phosphate (BCIP), nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), naphthol-AS-B1-phosphate and ECF substrate; glucose oxidase and nitroblue tetrazolium (t-NBT); and the like. When the probe is labeled with gold particles, this may be detected by a silver staining method using silver nitrate. By analyzing the intensity of the hybridizable signal through the above-described hybridization process, the target RNA may be detected.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0046">In the NESBA of the present invention, unlike the existing NASBA, primers including DNA nicking enzyme recognition nucleotide sequences are used to produce a double-stranded DNA including a T7 promoter and the DNA nicking enzyme recognition nucleotide sequence. A single strand of the double-stranded DNA is cleaved by the activity of a nicking enzyme recognizing the nicking enzyme recognition nucleotide sequence present in a sample. A short DNA strand produced by the cleavage reaction is used as a primer for new DNA synthesis, and thus a new DNA synthesis reaction proceeds based on the activity of DNA polymerase present in the sample. The DNA polymerase used in this reaction has strand displacement activity on DNA bound to a template in the DNA synthesis reaction. Thus, when new DNA is synthesized using the produced short DNA strand as a primer, the DNA bound to a template is released, and this DNA released from the template may be used as a template to which a primer that has not participated in the reaction can bind. Accordingly, the nicking/extension chain reaction is implemented through the nicking enzyme and DNA polymerase activity, thereby exponentially amplifying a T7-promoter-containing double-stranded DNA, which may be a core factor that can realize enhanced amplification efficiency compared with existing NASBA reactions.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a NESBA technique of the present invention, wherein (A) illustrates a reaction in which a T7-promoter-containing double-stranded DNA is produced from a target RNA, (B) illustrates a reaction in which the T7-promoter-containing double-stranded DNA produced as illustrated in (A) is exponentially amplified through a nicking/polymerase chain reaction, and (C) illustrates a reaction in which an anti-sense RNA is produced from the T7-promoter-containing double-stranded DNA produced as illustrated in (B) through the activity of T7 RNA polymerase.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">In one embodiment of the present invention, as a result of experimentally examining whether or not amplification efficiency of the NESBA technique of the present invention is enhanced, it was confirmed that the present invention showed a much higher amplification efficiency in an experiment for detecting a target RNA at the same concentration (H3N2 influenza gRNA, 800 fM) compared to existing NASBA reactions (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">In addition, in another embodiment of the present invention, it was confirmed that the limit of detection (LOD) of target RNA for the NESBA technique of the present invention was 0.72 fM, from which it was confirmed that the NESBA technique has very high detection sensitivity.
