Fields of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a bicycle cross bar adaptor, and more particularly, to a retractable bicycle cross bar adaptor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Descriptions of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The bicycle cross bar adaptor is used to be installed between the seat tube and the head tube of a bicycle so that when the bicycle is carried by a bicycle rack on a vehicle, the bicycle rack supports or clamps the cross bar adaptor.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Taiwanese Utility Model No. M559826 discloses a retractable bicycle cross bar adaptor that includes a bar, a movable unit and a securing unit. The bar has multiple notches, and the movable unit is slidably connected to the bar. The movable unit includes a base, a slide and a stop, wherein the slide is slidably connected to the base so as to be in contact with the stop optionally. The stop is engaged one of the notches of the bar. The securing unit is connected to the movable unit and is connected to a bicycle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the length of the retractable bicycle cross bar adaptor can be adjusted, it involves too many pars and the parts have complicated shapes. The slide is biased by two springs which moves the slide back and forth when the user pushes the base to allow the stop to move, such that the bar can be extended or retracted to adjust the length of the cross bar adaptor. It is noted that the movable unit and the securing unit includes many parts that have different sizes and shapes, some of the parts are tiny, therefore the manufacturing cost of the retractable bicycle cross bar adaptor is high and cannot compete with other similar products in the market.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention intends to provide a retractable bicycle cross bar adaptor to eliminate the shortcomings mentioned above.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates to a retractable bicycle cross bar adaptor and comprises a bar having a first tube, a second tube and a control unit. The control unit is located between the first tube and the second tube. A hook is connected to each of the first and second tubes. The first tube has a non-circular cross section, and includes a first connection end formed to the first end of the first tube. The second tube has a second connection end formed to the first end of the second tube. The second connection end is slidably inserted into the first connection end. The second tube includes a groove defined axially in the outside of the second tube.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The control unit includes a collar, a lever and a block. The collar has a passage defined axially therethrough. The first connection end is inserted into the first end of the passage, and the second connection end is inserted into the second end of the passage and slidably inserted into the first connection end. A space is formed in the collar and located between the outside of the second connection end and the inner periphery of the passage. A hole is defined through the wall of the collar and communicates with the space. Two lugs extend from the outer surface of the collar. The hole is located between the two lugs.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The lever includes an eccentric end formed to one end thereof, and the eccentric end pivotably connected between the two lugs and includes a cam portion. The block is located in the space and includes a convex engaging face which is removably engaged with the groove. The block includes a push face that is located opposite to the convex engaging face.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the first tube includes a ridge extending axially and inward from the inner periphery of the first connection end. The ridge is located corresponding to the groove. The collar includes a first flange extending inward from the second end of the passage. A protrusion extends from the inner periphery of the first flange and located corresponding to the groove so as to guide the second tube to move linearly. The convex engaging face of the block is removably engaged with the groove.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, an end cap is connected to the second connection end.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, a pin extends through the two lugs and pivotably connects the eccentric end between the two lugs.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the block is an elongate block and made of rubber. The convex engaging face is shaped to be matched with a shape of the groove. The push face is a flat face.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, a second flange extends inward from the inner periphery of the passage. The first connection end of the first tube contacts the second flange. The space is located between the first and second flanges.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The eccentric portion of the lever includes the cam portion so that the lever performs as a quick-release, and the lever is pivoted about the pin to control the block to be engaged with or removed from the groove such that the second tube is slidably moved relative to the first tube to adjust the length of the cross bar adaptor. The operation is simple and easy, and the block is made of rubber to provide sufficient friction with the groove to secure the adjusted length of the cross bar adaptor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention will become more obvious from the following description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings which show, for purposes of illustration only, a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view to show the retractable cross bar adaptor of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is another perspective view to show the retractable cross bar adaptor of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded view of the retractable cross bar adaptor of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross sectional view to show that the lever is pivoted to contact the block against the groove;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross sectional view to show that the lever is pivoted to an opposite direction to remove the block against the groove;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an end cross sectional view of the status in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows that the retractable cross bar adaptor of the present invention is used to a bicycle.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, the retractable cross bar adaptor of the present invention comprises a bar <b>10</b> having a first tube <b>20</b>, a second tube <b>30</b> and a control unit <b>40</b>.
