The disclosed foam article includes the second component disposed on at least a portion of the first component. The first component is a foam component that includes a foamed thermoplastic copolyester composition having a microcellular open-cell or closed-cell foam structure. The second component has a second polymeric composition that includes a second polymeric material which can one or more thermoplastic copolyesters, or a polymeric material that can be substantially free of thermoplastic copolyesters. The second polymeric composition can comprise a thermoplastic elastomer or thermoplastic vulcanizate material. of the first component of the foam article can be a midsole or a midsole component. The second component of the foam article can be a ground contacting component such as an outsole or a rand on an article of footwear, a reinforcing skin or a containment layer on a cushioning element, or other application.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Conventionally, vulcanized and peroxide-cured natural and synthetic rubbers such as isoprene and polybutadiene rubbers have been used to form durable, abrasion-resistant outer protective layers for a wide variety of articles, including outsoles for articles of footwear. Rubber formulations used for outsoles also typically provide traction. One disadvantage of using conventional rubber materials is that these materials are highly crosslinked during the curing process, rendering the cured rubber a thermoset material and making it difficult to recycle or reuse the cured rubber. Also, it can be difficult to bond other materials to the cured rubber. Both the rubber materials and foam materials typically used in a wide variety of consumer good are highly crosslinked materials, which are formed and cured separately and then adhered to each other using an adhesive system. These adhesive systems require several manually-intensive processing steps, such as cleaning the surfaces, priming the surfaces, applying adhesive to the surfaces, and pressing the surfaces together to bond them.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It has been found that thermoplastic copolyester compositions (i.e., polymeric compositions comprising one or more thermoplastic copolyester) can be used to form microcellular foams having advantageous properties for use in consumer article such as cushioning elements. When foamed as described herein, these foams retain thermoplastic properties, making it possible to readily recycle and reuse the foams. Additionally, it has been found that these foams can be directly molded and foamed onto other polymeric materials (i.e., onto second polymeric materials as described herein), which bonds the foam securely to the second polymeric material without the need for additional adhesives, or the manual process steps of applying an adhesive system. The second polymeric material which is bonded to the thermoplastic copolyester-based foam is a thermoplastic elastomeric material, such as a second thermoplastic copolyester composition or a thermoplastic vulcanizate material as described herein. Examples of both second thermoplastic copolyester compositions and thermoplastic vulcanizate materials which, when used either in solid form or in a lightly foamed form (e.g., having a specific gravity of 0.85 or greater) have been found which both bond well to the thermoplastic copolyester-based foam during a molding and foaming process, and which also provide high levels of abrasion resistance and traction under wet and dry conditions. When the second polymeric material is a second thermoplastic copolyester material, the fact that the foam comprises a first thermoplastic copolyester composition and that the protective layer comprises a second thermoplastic copolyester compositions provides the advantage that the entire article can easily be melted down and combined material can be recycled. In this scenario, the second copolyester composition can each individually include one or more of the same individual copolyesters present in the first thermoplastic copolyester composition, either in the same proportions or in different proportions. Alternatively, the first and second copolyester compositions can each individually comprise different copolyesters.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The foam components disclosed herein are formed by foaming polymeric compositions comprising one or more thermoplastic copolyester into a microcellular foam having an open-cell or closed-cell foam structure. Examples of thermoplastic copolyesters include polymers which have one or more carboxylic acid moiety present in the polymeric backbone, on one or more side chains, or both in the polymeric backbone and on one or more side chains. The one or more carboxylic acid moiety of the thermoplastic copolyester can include a free carboxylic acid, a salt of a carboxylic acid, or an anhydride of a carboxylic acid. In particular examples, the carboxylic acid moiety can be an acrylic acid moiety or a methacrylic acid moiety. The foam articles comprising a microcellular open-cell or closed-cell thermoplastic copolyester foam and a polymeric layer of the present disclosure are suitable for use in a variety of articles including for athletic equipment and apparel, particularly footwear (e.g., athletic footwear midsoles/outsoles). As discussed below, the microcellular open-cell or closed-cell thermoplastic copolyester foam exhibits a unique balance of properties such as high energy efficiency or energy return, high split tear, low specific gravity, and low compression set. The presence of the layer on at least a portion of the exterior surface of the foam reduces liquid uptake by the microcellular foams, particularly microcellular open-cell foams, increasing their performance when used under conditions where the foam come into contact with liquids. Furthermore, the thermoplastic copolyester foam can also be reprocessed with minimal loss in physical properties (e.g., for recycling), providing a solution for materials sustainability.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The second polymeric material of the polymeric layer can be selected to allow the entire foam article to be recycled in a single step, without the need to remove or separate the polymeric layer from the foam. For example, the second polymeric material can comprise one or more thermoplastic copolyesters.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The foam article or foam component comprising the thermoplastic copolyester foam can be formed by injection molding and foaming the thermoplastic copolyester polymeric material as described herein, or by injection molding and foaming the thermoplastic copolyester polymeric material as described herein into a foam pre-form and subsequently compression molding the foam-preform into a finished foam. The second polymeric material can be disposed onto an exterior surface of the foam component during an injection molding and foaming process, in which the first thermoplastic material is injected into a mold which includes the second polymeric material, and the second polymeric material bonds to the foam during the molding process.

An extruder (e.g., single or twin screw) can be used to provide a composition. The extruder can have a motor to turn a screw inside the extruder. Extruder may be a single screw or twin screws made of individual elements of various sizes and pitches appropriate for mixing or kneading the specific materials used. In some examples, the extruder has a twin screw.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The various components that make up the compositions used to form the thermoplastic copolyester foam of the various examples described herein are added into the extruder through one or more port. The various components can be added as a melt or as appropriately-sized solid particles, for example chips or pellets, that are melted in section as they are mixed in the barrel of the extruder. The contents of the extruder can be heated to melt the composition. A supercritical fluid can be added into the melt as a physical blowing agent. In particular examples, the thermoplastic copolyester foam is prepared by using a physical blowing agent which foams the composition after it exits the extruder, and the thermoplastic copolyester foam is thus substantially free of a chemical blowing agent or decomposition product thereof.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The compositions can be added as a melt at a temperature close to the melting temperature of the polymeric component of the composition.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">If a chemical blowing agent is used, the processing (melting) temperature used can be sufficiently below the temperature that would trigger the blowing agent. In order to foam the composition, the temperature near the exit of the extruder can be increased to a temperature close to or at the triggering temperature of a chemical blowing agent, thereby producing a chemically foamed thermoplastic copolyester foam as the composition exits the extruder (e.g., as the composition is injected into an injection mold).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Alternatively or in addition, a physical blowing agent can be used for foam the composition to form a physically foamed thermoplastic copolyester foam, or a physically and chemically foamed thermoplastic copolyester foam. For example, a supercritical fluid such as supercritical carbon dioxide or supercritical nitrogen can be mixed with the molten polymeric composition in the barrel of the extruder to form a single-phase solution. As the single-phase solution exits the extruder, the pressure drop between the higher pressure in the extruder and the lower pressure outside the extruder causes the supercritical fluid to transition to the gas phase and foam the molten polymeric composition.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Various examples include methods of manufacturing an article of footwear or components for an article of footwear.

The decomposition may be a result of thermal energy in the system. Endothermic foaming agents absorb energy and typically release a gas, such as carbon dioxide, upon decomposition. Exothermic foaming agents release energy and generate a gas, such as nitrogen, when decomposed. Regardless of the chemical foaming agent used, thermal variables of the polymer composition being molded and thermal variables of the foaming agent to be decomposed are coupled together such that process parameters are selected so that the polymer can be molded and the foaming agent can decompose at an appropriate phase of the molding operation.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The disclosed foamed polymeric materials and articles can be prepared by using systems such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Appl. No. 62/734,912, which is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the system provides for decreased pressure losses across the system as well as to control (e.g., deliberately increase or decrease) the elongation, apparent shear, and/or zero shear viscosities of the molten polymeric material that is flowed into the mold. The method includes flowing a molten polymeric material into a shot tuning chamber from an upstream device and adjusting a temperature, a pressure, or both, within the shot tuning chamber to create a tuned molten polymeric material. The method additionally includes flowing the tuned molten polymeric material into a mold cavity from the shot tuning chamber. It will be appreciated that fine-tuning the temperature of and/or pressure applied to the molten polymeric material enables the system to have a desired impact on the physical and mechanical properties of the molded article. In particular, the temperature of the molten polymeric material may be controlled to achieve a desired range of shear/extensional viscosities, which reduces (e.g., substantially eliminates) uncontrolled bubble growth and/or nucleation. In one example, the method may also include adjusting (e.g., increasing and/or decreasing) a pressure in the mold cavity via a gas counter pressure (GCP) assembly prior to or while the molten polymeric material is flowed from the shot tuning chamber into the mold cavity. In such an example, the molten polymeric material may be flowed into the mold cavity at pressures well above ambient pressure. Furthermore, GCP may be introduced into the mold cavity to control nucleation and bubble growth during polymer foaming as well as increase surface quality of the molded article. Nucleation and bubble growth control enhances cell density uniformity and mechanical properties of the molded polymeric material. In some examples, the improvement in cell density homogeneity may be particularly beneficial in articles having low densities such as articles that have a density less than or equal to 0.3 grams per cubic centimeter and/or in articles having large dimensions such as articles having a thickness that is &#x2265;1.0 cm, for instance.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The system can include a shot tuning chamber configured to receive a molten polymeric material from an upstream device. The shot tuning chamber is also configured to adjust one or more of a temperature of and a pressure applied to the molten polymeric material to create an adjusted molten polymeric material and to dispense the adjusted molten polymeric material. In this way, the system can selectively adjust tuning chamber temperature and/or pressure to achieve desired properties, as previously mentioned. In one example, the system may further include an adjustable mold runner configured to regulate fluidic communication between the shot tuning chamber and a mold cavity in a mold. In another example, the system can further include a GCP assembly coupled to the mold cavity and configured to regulate an amount of counter pressure gas flow into and out of the mold cavity. Providing GCP adjustment allows for additional tuning of the polymeric material as it enters and cools in the mold.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Alternatively, the disclosed foamed polymeric materials and articles can be prepared using methods and systems as described in International Patent Appl. No. PCT/US2018/035128. Briefly, the method can comprise a method for molding a single-phase solution comprised of a polymer composition and a gas. The polymer composition and the gas are maintained under pressure during the molding operation to prevent a cellular structure from being formed by the dissolved gas in the polymer composition coming out of solution. The mold cavity in which the single-phase solution is introduced for molding purposes is pressurized to a mold pressure that is sufficient to maintain the single-phase solution as a single-phase solution as the mold cavity is filled. Subsequent to filling the mold cavity with the single-phase solution under pressure, the resulting article may solidify entrapping the compressed gas, or the article may be exposed to a reduction in pressure causing the entrapped gas to form a microcellular structure.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The method can include forming the single-phase solution, such as through introduction of pressurized gas with a polymer composition that is melted, e.g., from about the T<sub>m </sub>up to about 50 degrees C. above the T<sub>tail </sub>of the thermoplastic copolyester as described elsewhere, in an injection molding apparatus's barrel (e.g., screw) that is effective to mix and dissolve the gas with the polymer composition while under pressure. The method continues with pressurizing a mold cavity of a mold above atmospheric pressure to a mold pressure. Atmospheric pressure is a pressure of the environment in which the mold cavity is exposed (e.g., general environment pressure). The mold pressure is at least a pressure to maintain the single-phase solution as a single single-phase. The method further includes injecting the single-phase solution into the pressurized mold cavity. The method also includes maintaining at least the mold pressure in the mold cavity during the injecting of the single-phase solution. As a result, the pressure in the mold cavity prevents the gas from coming out of solution to form a two-phase mixture (e.g., foaming) upon exit from the injection molding apparatus. As the pressure is maintained, premature foaming as the polymer composition is injected from the injection molding apparatus is avoided to allow a decoupling of process parameters associated with the foaming agent and the polymer composition.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A molding system can be utilized to prepare the disclosed foamed polymeric materials that includes a device configured to receive a polymeric material and heat the polymeric material to form a molten polymeric material. The molding system additionally includes a shot tuning chamber configured to receive the molten polymeric material from the device and adjust a temperature of or a pressure applied to the molten polymeric material. The molding system also includes an adjustable mold runner configured to regulate the flow of the molten polymeric material between the shot tuning chamber and a mold cavity. In one example, the device may be an injection device or an extrusion device. The molding system allows the characteristics of the polymeric material to be adapted to achieve desired end-use goals.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some aspects, the present disclosure is directed to a compression molded thermoplastic copolyester foam, and to a method of forming compression molded thermoplastic copolyester foam for, among other applications, articles of footwear or athletic equipment. In some examples, the method can be a process comprising providing (e.g., preparing) a thermoplastic copolyester foam preform and then compression molding the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform to form a compression molded thermoplastic copolyester foam. For example, the thermoplastic copolyester foam can be compression molded by placing the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform in a compression mold having a height less than the initial height of the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform and closing the mold, thereby compressing the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform to the height of the mold. Simultaneously or sequentially with the compressing, the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform can be heated in the closed compression mold. During the compression molding, the temperature of at least a portion of the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform in the closed mold can be raised to a temperature within &#xb1;30 degrees C. of the softening temperature of the composition. The temperature can be raised by heating the closed mold. Following the raising of the temperature, while the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform remains closed in the compression mold, the temperature of at least a portion of the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform can be lowered. The temperature can be lowered by cooling the closed mold. The lowering can lower the temperature of at least a portion of the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform to a temperature at least 35 degrees C. below the softening temperature of the composition, thereby forming the compression molded thermoplastic copolyester foam. Following the cooling, the compression mold can be opened, and the compression molded thermoplastic copolyester foam can be removed from the compression mold.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Examples contemplated herein are directed to methods of manufacturing articles of footwear or athletic equipment. For example, the method can comprise providing components such as midsoles and inserts of an article of footwear in accordance with the present disclosure, and combining the component with a footwear upper and an outsole to form the article of footwear.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">One method of making compression molded thermoplastic copolyester foam articles such as midsoles and inserts or components of articles such as components of midsoles or components of inserts described herein comprises forming a thermoplastic copolyester foam preform and compression molding the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform to make a compression molded thermoplastic copolyester foam. In some examples, the foam preforms of the various examples described herein are obtained by blowing the composition by about 150 percent to about 240 percent (e.g., from about 150 percent to about 220 percent; about 150 percent to about 200 percent, about 175 percent to about 225 percent, about 180 percent to about 230 percent or about 160 percent to about 240 percent) in at least one dimension (e.g., the vertical dimension) using a blowing agent. In some examples, the blown composition can be compression molded to about 120 percent to about 200 percent (e.g., from about 120 percent to about 180 percent; about 130 percent to about 190 percent; about 150 percent to about 200 percent; or about 160 percent to about 190 percent) in at least one dimension.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Thus for example, if the foaming of the composition is about 200 percent, the blown composition can be compression molded by a net 20 percent by compression molding to about 180 percent. In another example, if the composition is blown into a 20 millimeter (height)&#xd7;10 centimeter (width)&#xd7;5 centimeter (depth) slab (wherein hereinafter, &#x201c;mm&#x201d; will be used to indicate millimeter and &#x201c;cm&#x201d; will be used to indicate centimeter), and the slab is compression molded in the height direction by 20 percent, the compression molded slab would have the dimensions 18 mm (height)&#xd7;10 cm (width)&#xd7;5 cm (depth). In some examples, the compression molding is substantially maintained.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The thermoplastic copolyester foam can be made using a process that involves impregnating a composition (e.g., at or above a softening temperature of the composition) with a physical blowing agent at a first concentration or first pressure. The impregnated composition can then be foamed, or can be cooled (when applicable) and re-softened (when applicable) for blowing at a later time. In some instances, the impregnated composition is foamed by reducing the temperature or pressure, impacting the solubility of the physical blowing agent. The reduction in solubility of the physical blowing agent can release additional amounts of the impregnated physical blowing agent from the composition to further blow the composition forming a thermoplastic copolyester foam (e.g., a thermoplastic copolyester foam having a microcellular structure).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The compression molding process can be conducted by heating the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform in a closed compression mold. The thermoplastic copolyester foam preform is heated to a temperature close to its softening temperature, to allow the foam to retain the shape of the compression mold. For example, the foam preform can be heated to a temperature within plus or minus 30 degrees C. of its softening temperature, or within plus or minus 20 degrees C. of its softening temperature, or within plus or minus 10 degrees C. of its softening temperature, or within plus or minus 5 degrees C. of its softening temperature. For example, the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform can be heated to a temperature of from about 100 degrees C. to about 250 degrees C., or of from about 140 degrees C. to about 220 degrees C., or of from about 100 degrees C. to about 150 degrees C., or of from about 130 degrees C. to about 150 degrees C.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The material used to form the compression mold can be any material which can withstand the temperatures used during the process, such as machined metals, including aluminum. The compression mold can be made using two pieces, such as a top and a bottom mold. Depending on the shape of the foam component to be molded, a multiple-piece mold may be used in order to more easily release the compression molded foam from the mold.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The injection molded thermoplastic copolyester foam can have a closed skin. A closed skin can be formed by foaming and molding a thermoplastic copolyester foam in a closed mold. A closed skin can also be formed by compression molding a thermoplastic copolyester foam preform in a compression mold. However, care should be taken during the compression molding not to subject the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform to conditions such that more than a desired amount of the closed cell structures of the foam collapse. One way to avoid collapsing more than a desired amount of the closed cell structures is to control the temperature of the thermoplastic copolyester foam during the compression molding process, for example, by controlling the temperature of the mold. For example, during the compression molding step, the heating of the thermoplastic copolyester foam preform in the compression mold can be conducted for time of from 100 seconds to 1,000 seconds, or of from 150 seconds to 700 seconds.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Once the thermoplastic copolyester foam has been heated in the compression mold at the appropriate temperature for the desired length of time to soften the thermoplastic copolyester foam to the desired level, the softened preform is cooled, for example, to a temperature at least 35 degrees C. below its softening temperature, or at least 50 degrees C. below its softening temperature, or at least 80 degrees C. below its softening temperature, to re-solidify the softened foam, thereby forming the compression molded foam. Once cooled, the compression molded thermoplastic copolyester foam is removed from the compression mold. Following the heating, the cooling of the foam preform in the compression mold can be conducted for a time of from 50 to 1,000 seconds, or for a time of from 100 to 400 seconds.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The thermoplastic copolyester foam can be foamed using any one of the methods described above.

For 3D shapes, aspect ratio is defined herein as the ratio of the shape's maximum dimension to its minimum dimension. Thus, for regular shapes, (e.g., spheres, cubes, rectangles, cylinders, and the like), aspect ratio is defined herein as length/width. However, for irregular shapes, such as those frequently encountered in injection molding of commercially useful articles or components, such as, but not limited to, a midsole or a midsole component, no single dimension accurately represents the shape in a manner similar to a regular shape. Accordingly, for irregular shapes, aspect ratio is defined herein as the ratio of the maximum distance from the center of mass of the equivalent solid of the shape to the surface of the shape (L<sub>max</sub>) relative to the minimum distance from the same point to the surface (L<sub>min</sub>). It is understood that injection cavities with multiple gates, the volume allocated to each gate can be considered as having its own characteristic aspect ratio based on the fractional volume of the cavity it fills.

The methods can further comprise manufacturing an article or component of an article comprising providing a midsole or a component of a midsole, then providing an upper and/or an outsole or outsole component for an article of footwear; and followed by combining the midsole or midsole component with the upper and/or the outsole or outsole component to make an article of footwear. In some instances, the method of manufacturing the article of footwear includes combining an article comprising a thermoplastic copolyester foam, an upper, and an outsole to make an article of footwear. In various aspects, the upper and/or outsole can comprise the same or a different thermoplastic copolyester material, a second polymeric material, or combinations thereof. In some instances, the outsole used in the method can be foamed, partially foamed, or essentially not foamed. It is understood that a midsole, midsole component, outsole, or outsole component can be foamed or partially foamed using the methods disclosed herein for the preparation of a foam article.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The various disclosed methods can include coupling a first component to a second component. In certain aspects, the disclosed methods comprise forming the first component and second component together. For example, the polymeric material for the first component, i.e., a disclosed thermoplastic copolyester, and the second polymeric material can be added to a mold sequentially during an injection molding process to provide a unitary component having a first component, i.e., a foam portion and a second component, i.e., a polymeric layer comprising the second polymeric material. In this aspect, a mold can be provided having a first mold portion having a mold surface. The second polymeric material can be added to the mold, so as to form a polymeric layer on at least a portion of the mold surface. The polymeric material for the first component, i.e., a disclosed thermoplastic copolyester, can be injected into the mold containing the second component, i.e., the polymeric layer comprising the second polymeric material, and foamed while in contact with the polymeric layer. The resultant injection-molded component is a unitary component, with the second component, i.e., the polymeric layer, bonded to the first component, i.e., the foam component.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Alternatively or additionally, the second component can be disposed onto the exterior surface of the first component during a compression molding step. For example, a first component can be made such as by injection molding, and the foam component can thereafter be compression molded in a mold which includes the second component, and the first component bonds to the surface of the second component during the compression molding process.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The second component can be provided as an already formed component, e.g., a second component, to the injection mold or compression mold. For example, the second component, e.g., a film, can be inserted into an injection mold and held in place against a target surface of the mold via vacuum ports, electrostatic charge or other method. The second component may be conformed to the target surface of the mold, for example, with the application of heat or vacuum before or after it is inserted into the mold. The polymeric material for the first component, i.e., a disclosed thermoplastic copolyester, can then be injected into the mold containing the film, and foamed as described herein. As a result the second component becomes an integral part of the molded component.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Alternatively or additionally, the second component can be disposed onto the foam component after the foam component has been formed. According to some of the disclosed methods, the second component that is provided separately from the first component, and are thereafter operably coupled so that the second component is in contact with a targeted portion of an exterior surface of the first component. The second component may be coupled with the exterior surface of a first component using any suitable method. In an aspect, the second component may be adhesively laminated to the first component. In another aspect, the second component may be coupled with the first component may be thermally laminated to an exterior surface of the first component. For example, heat may be applied to an exterior surface of the first component, to a surface of the second component, or both, to soften or melt the heated surface(s), and the two surfaces may be joined when one or both are in the softened or melted state. In an aspect, the second component may be coupled with the first component using a flame lamination process.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The second component can be provided as a polymeric coating. For example, a polymeric coating can be formed by applying a liquid polymeric material onto the foam component, such as by spraying, dip coating, tumble-coating, brushing, or a combination thereof. The liquid polymeric material can then be dried or cured while in contact with the first component.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The polymeric coating can be formed by applying a powered polymeric material onto the foam component, such as by spraying, powder-coating, electrostatically coating, tumble-coating, or a combination thereof. In some aspects, an adhesive could be used to affix the powder to the midsole, and/or a coating can be applied over the powder to hold it in place on the foam component. Once the powder is affixed to the midsole, it can be left in the form of a powder, or it can be treated so as to form a more uniform coating, such as by heating it to melt it, by applying a solvent to solubilize it, etc.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Alternatively, the polymeric layer can take the form of a separate element which is applied to all or a portion of an exterior surface of the foam component when incorporating the midsole into an article of footwear. For example, the foam component can be a midsole component of an article of footwear, and the polymeric layer can be a rand or foxing tape applied around a perimeter of the midsole. The polymeric layer can be an extension of an outsole covering all or a portion of the bottom surface of the midsole, and which wraps up and covers at least a portion of the sidewall of the midsole. The polymeric layer can be the &#x201c;shell&#x201d; portion of a core-shell sole structure, which covers both the bottom surface and the sidewalls of the midsole, and which is attached to the upper of the article of footwear.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The foam articles and components can be foamed using any one of the methods described above.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In various aspects, the disclosed methods of manufacturing articles comprising a first component and a second component, the second component comprising a second polymer material can produced separately via injection molding with or without the addition of compressed gas, supercritical fluids or other blowing agents upon which the foam article is produced.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some instances, the disclosed methods of manufacturing articles comprising a first component and a second component comprise injection via overmolding.

The second component can be produced separately via injection molding with only sufficient compressed gas, supercritical fluids or other blowing agents to achieve a density of 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter, 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter, or 0.80 grams per cubic centimeter.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some instances, the disclosed methods of manufacturing articles comprising a first component and a second component comprise a step of corona treatment.

The resultant injection-molded component is a unitary component, with the second polymeric material bonded to the foam component. Alternatively or additionally, the second polymeric material can be disposed onto the exterior surface of the foam component during a compression molding step. For example, a foam component can be made such as by injection molding, and the foam component can thereafter be compression molded in a mold which includes the second polymeric material, and the second polymeric material bonds to the surface of the foam during the compression molding process.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0157">The second polymeric material can be provided as a discrete layer or film to the injection mold or compression mold.

The layer or film may be conformed to the target surface of the mold, for example, with the application of heat or vacuum before or after it is inserted into the mold. The thermoplastic polyester composition can then be injected into the mold containing the film, and foamed as described herein. As a result the second polymeric material of the layer or film becomes an integral part of the molded component.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0158">Alternatively or additionally, the second polymeric material can be disposed onto the foam component after the foam component has been formed. According to some of the disclosed methods, the second polymeric material is provided as a layer or film that is provided separately from the foam component, and are thereafter operably coupled so that the second polymeric material forms a layer on the targeted portion of the exterior surface of the foam. The second polymeric material may be coupled with the exterior surface of a foam component or article using any suitable method. In an aspect, the second polymeric material may be adhesively laminated to the foam component. In another aspect, the second polymeric material may be coupled with the foam component such as by thermally laminating to an exterior surface of the foam. For example, heat may be applied to an exterior surface of the foam component, to a surface of the second polymeric material, or both, to soften or melt the respective heated surface(s), and the two surfaces may be joined when one or both are in the softened or melted state. In an aspect, the second polymeric material may be coupled with the foam component using a flame lamination process.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0159">The second polymeric material can be provided as a polymeric coating. For example, a polymeric coating can be formed by applying a liquid polymeric material onto the foam component, such as by spraying, dip coating, tumble-coating, brushing, or a combination thereof. The liquid polymeric material can then be dried or cured while in contact with the midsole.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0160">The polymeric coating can be formed by applying a powered polymeric material onto the foam component, such as by spraying, powder-coating, electrostatically coating, tumble-coating, or a combination thereof. In some aspects, an adhesive could be used to affix the powder to the midsole, and/or a coating can be applied over the powder to hold it in place on the foam component. Once the powder is affixed to the midsole, it can be left in the form of a powder, or it can be treated so as to form a more uniform coating, such as by heating it to melt it, by applying a solvent to solubilize it, etc.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0161">Alternatively, the second polymeric material can take the form of a separate element which is applied to all or a portion of an exterior surface of the foam component when incorporating the midsole into an article of footwear. For example, the foam component can be a midsole component of an article of footwear, and the second polymeric material can be a rand or foxing tape applied around a perimeter of the midsole. The second polymeric material can be an extension of an outsole covering all or a portion of the bottom surface of the midsole, and which wraps up and covers at least a portion of the sidewall of the midsole. The second polymeric material can be the &#x201c;shell&#x201d; portion of a core-shell sole structure, which covers both the bottom surface and the sidewalls of the midsole, and which is attached to the upper of the article of footwear.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0162">The resulting article comprising the first component with the second polymeric material can be characterized by good bonding strength between the second polymeric material and the foam component. The ply adhesion strength between the second polymeric material and the foam component is greater than 2.5 kg force/centimeter or greater than 3.0 kg force/centimeter, when determined using the Ply Adhesion Test method described herein.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0163">Second Polymeric Material Properties</p><p id="p-0187" num="0164">The disclosed second polymeric material can be characterized by one or more properties.

In practice, two processes are essentially used, one being a 2-step process and the other a one-step process.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0246">In the two-step process, the polyamide blocks having dicarboxylic chain ends are prepared first, and then, in a second step, these polyamide blocks are linked to the polyether blocks. The polyamide blocks having dicarboxylic chain ends are derived from the condensation of polyamide precursors in the presence of a chain-stopper dicarboxylic acid. If the polyamide precursors are only lactams or &#x3b1;,&#x3c9;-aminocarboxylic acids, a dicarboxylic acid is added. If the precursors already comprise a dicarboxylic acid, this is used in excess with respect to the stoichiometry of the diamines. The reaction usually takes place between 180 and 300 degrees centigrade, preferably 200 to 290 degrees centigrade, and the pressure in the reactor is set between 5 and 30 bar and maintained for approximately 2 to 3 hours. The pressure in the reactor is slowly reduced to a T<sub>m</sub>ospheric pressure and then the excess water is distilled off, for example for one or two hours.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0247">Once the polyamide having carboxylic acid end groups has been prepared, the polyether, the polyol and a catalyst are then added. The total amount of polyether can be divided and added in one or more portions, as can the catalyst. The polyether can be added first and the reaction of the OH end groups of the polyether and of the polyol with the COOH end groups of the polyamide starts, with the formation of ester linkages and the elimination of water. Water is removed as much as possible from the reaction mixture by distillation and then the catalyst is introduced in order to complete the linking of the polyamide blocks to the polyether blocks. This second step takes place with stirring, preferably under a vacuum of at least 50 mbar (5000 Pa) at a temperature such that the reactants and the copolymers obtained are in the molten state. By way of example, this temperature can be between 100 and 400 degrees centigrade and usually between 200 and 250 degrees centigrade. The reaction is monitored by measuring the torque exerted by the polymer melt on the stirrer or by measuring the electric power consumed by the stirrer. The end of the reaction is determined by the value of the torque or of the target power. The catalyst is defined as being any product which promotes the linking of the polyamide blocks to the polyether blocks by esterification. Advantageously, the catalyst is a derivative of a metal (M) chosen from the group formed by titanium, zirconium and hafnium.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0248">The derivative can be prepared from a tetraalkoxides consistent with the general formula M(OR)<sub>4</sub>, in which M represents titanium, zirconium or hafnium and R, which can be identical or different, represents linear or branched alkyl radicals having from 1 to 24 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0249">The catalyst can comprise a salt of the metal (M), particularly the salt of (M) and of an organic acid and the complex salts of the oxide of (M) and/or the hydroxide of (M) and an organic acid. The organic acid can be formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, phenylacetic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, phthalic acid and crotonic acid. Acetic and propionic acids are particularly preferred. M can be zirconium and such salts are called zirconyl salts, e.g., the commercially available product sold under the name zirconyl acetate.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0250">The weight proportion of catalyst can vary from about 0.01 to about 5 percent of the weight of the mixture of the dicarboxylic polyamide with the polyetherdiol and the polyol. The weight proportion of catalyst can vary from about 0.05 to about 2 percent of the weight of the mixture of the dicarboxylic polyamide with the polyetherdiol and the polyol.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0251">In the one-step process, the polyamide precursors, the chain stopper and the polyether are blended together; what is then obtained is a polymer having essentially polyether blocks and polyamide blocks of very variable length, but also the various reactants that have reacted randomly, which are distributed randomly along the polymer chain. They are the same reactants and the same catalyst as in the two-step process described above. If the polyamide precursors are only lactams, it is advantageous to add a little water. The copolymer has essentially the same polyether blocks and the same polyamide blocks, but also a small portion of the various reactants that have reacted randomly, which are distributed randomly along the polymer chain. As in the first step of the two-step process described above, the reactor is closed and heated, with stirring. The pressure established is between 5 and 30 bar. When the pressure no longer changes, the reactor is put under reduced pressure while still maintaining vigorous stirring of the molten reactants. The reaction is monitored as previously in the case of the two-step process.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0252">The proper ratio of polyamide to polyether blocks can be found in a single poly(ether block amide), or a blend of two or more different composition poly(ether block amide)s can be used with the proper average composition.

The copolymer can comprise a blend of two different poly(ether-block-amide)s comprising at least one block copolymer having a level of polyether blocks below about 35 wt percent, and a second poly(ether-block-amide) having at least about 45 wt percent of polyether blocks.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0253">The thermoplastic elastomer can be a polyamide or a poly(ether-block-amide) with a melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) from about 90 degrees centigrade to about 120 degrees centigrade when determined in accordance with ASTM D3418-97 as described herein below.

As a consequence, many nucleation sites will result in many gas cell domains. In a particular example, the nucleating agent can include a metal salt of a fatty acid. In some aspects, the nucleating agent is zinc stearate. In some aspects, the composition or material contains about 0.1 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, about 0.1 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, about 0.1 weight percent to about 2 weight percent, or about 0.5 weight percent to about 2 weight percent of the nucleating agent based upon a total weight of the composition or material.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0302">In some aspects, the additive is a nucleating agent such as talcum, metal oxides such as titanium dioxide or magnesium oxide, phosphates, carbonates or sulfates of, preferably, alkaline earth metals, or mixtures thereof. Alternatively, the nucleating agent can be a mono- or polycarboxylic acids, and the salts thereof, e.g., 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid, adipic acid, diphenylacetic acid, sodium succinate, sodium benzoate, or mixtures thereof. In a further aspect, the additive can be a nucleating agent comprising both an inorganic and an organic material as disclosed herein above.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0303">In some aspects, the rheology modifier can be a nano-particles having comparatively high aspect ratios, nano-clays, nano-carbon, graphite, nano-silica, and the like.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0304">In some aspects, the additive is a filler or reinforcing agent such as clay, kaolin, talc, asbestos, graphite, glass (such as glass fibers, glass particulates, and glass bulbs, spheres, or spheroids), mica, calcium metasilicate, barium sulfate, zinc sulfide, aluminum hydroxide, silicates, diatomaceous earth, carbonates (such as calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and the like), metals (such as titanium, tungsten, zinc, aluminum, bismuth, nickel, molybdenum, iron, copper, brass, boron, bronze, cobalt, beryllium, and alloys of these), metal oxides (such as zinc oxide, iron oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, magnesium oxide, zirconium oxide and the like), metal hydroxides, particulate synthetic plastics (such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyamide, polyester, polyurethane, polyimide, and the like), synthetic fibers (such as fibers comprising high molecular weight polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyamide, polyester, polyurethane, polyimide, and the like), particulate carbonaceous materials (such as carbon black and the like), wood flour and flours or fibers of other natural products, as well as cotton flock, non-cotton cellulose flock, cellulose pulp, leather fiber, and combinations of any of the above. Non-limiting examples of heavy density filler components that can be used to increase the specific gravity of the cured elastomer composition can include titanium, tungsten, aluminum, bismuth, nickel, molybdenum, iron, steel, lead, copper, brass, boron, boron carbide whiskers, bronze, cobalt, beryllium, zinc, tin, metal oxides (such as zinc oxide, iron oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, magnesium oxide, and zirconium oxide), metal sulfates (such as barium sulfate), metal carbonates (such as calcium carbonate), and combinations of these. Non-limiting examples of light density filler components that can be used to decrease the specific gravity of the elastomer compound can include particulate plastics, hollow glass spheres, ceramics, and hollow spheres, regrinds, and foams, which can be used in combinations.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0305">In some examples, the disclosed foamed polymeric materials can also include a nanofiller. Nanofillers can not only serve as mechanical reinforcement but also nucleating agents. A variety of nanofillers can be used in lieu of or in addition to the zinc stearate. Nanofillers can include nanomaterials having one-dimensional structures such as of plates, laminas and/or shells; two-dimensional structures such as nanotubes and nanofibres having a diameter lower than 0.1 micrometer; or three-dimensional nanostructures such as nanoparticles or beads. Nanoplate fillers can be natural or synthetic clays, as well as phosphates of transition metals. Clay-based nanocomposites generate an overall improvement in physical performances. The most widely used ones are the phyllosilicates. Nanofillers can include nano-oxides such as nanoparticles of Titanium dioxide or Rutile. Other nanofillers can include nanoparticles of alumina or aluminum oxide, diatomite, and nanoscale carbon materials such as single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) or double-wall carbon nanotubes (DWCNT).</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0350" num="0306">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs.

Neat Sampling Procedure</p><p id="p-0373" num="0329">The neat sampling procedure can be used to obtain a neat sample of a foamed or unfoamed thermoplastic copolyester composition, an unfoamed or foamed second polymeric material, or, in some instances, a sample of a material (e.g., polymer) used to form a thermoplastic copolyester composition or second polymeric material. The material can be provided in media form, such as flakes, granules, powders, pellets, and the like. If a source of the thermoplastic copolyester composition or second polymeric material is not available in a neat form, the sample can be cut from another component containing the composition or material, thereby isolating a sample of the composition or material.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0330">b. Plaque Sampling Procedure&#x2014;Solid Composition or Material</p><p id="p-0375" num="0331">The thermoplastic copolyester composition or second polymeric material is molded into a plaque having dimensions of about six inches by about 4 inches and a thickness of about 20 millimeters (or as otherwise specified by the test method).

A sample of the component which includes the composition or material is obtained as formed into the component, or cut from the article of footwear using a blade. This process is performed by separating the component from an associated footwear upper, if present, and removing any materials from the article's top surface (e.g., corresponding to the top surface). For example, the article's top surface can be skinned, abraded, scraped, or otherwise cleaned to remove any upper adhesives, yarns, fibers, foams, and the like that could potentially interfere with the test results.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0336">The resulting component sample includes the composition or material. As such, any test using a Component Sampling Procedure can simulate how the composition or material will perform as part of an article of footwear. As specified by the test method, the component may be tested as a full component (e.g., full midsole component), or it can be extracted as a sample having a certain geometry. A sample of a component is taken at a location along the component that provides a substantially constant thickness for the component (within plus or minus 10 percent of the average thickness), such as in a forefoot region, mid-foot region, or a heel region of the article. Unless otherwise specified, the desired harvested geometry is a cylindrical puck with a 45-millimeter diameter and a cylinder height of at least about 10 millimeters, preferably from about 20 to 25 millimeters.

The test is conducted using a DSC system such as a TA instruments Q2000. 10-30 mg samples are cycled from negative 90 degrees C. to 225 degrees C. at a rate of 20 degrees C./min and cooled to negative 90 degrees C. at a rate of 10 degrees C./min. Each sample is run in duplicate. The melting temperature and glass transition temperature values are recorded from the second cycle. The melt &#x201c;peak&#x201d; was identified as the local maximum of the second heating cycle. If there was more than one peak in the DSC curve, the peak occurring at hotter temperatures was chosen as the molding temperature reference. The tail was identified as the intersection of the tangent of the line of the higher temperature side of the melt peak with the extrapolated baseline. A schematic illustrating the method for determining peak and tail temperatures is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0339">Cyclic Tensile Test</p><p id="p-0384" num="0340">The cyclic tensile testing is carried out on solid samples prepared using the Plaque Sampling Procedure or the Component Sampling Procedure, having a dog-bone shape as described in ASTM D638 with a 2 mm thickness. In the test, the specimen is placed under a pre-load of 5 N. Strain is controlled to extend the sample to an extension 6 percent at a strain rate of 5 Hz. The stiffness is the load at 6 percent strain divided by the extension at 6 percent strain, giving a value in N/mm. The maximum load (N) observed over the test cycle of 500 cycles is also recorded.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0341">Melt Flow Index Test</p><p id="p-0386" num="0342">The melt flow index is determined using a sample prepared using the Neat Sampling Procedure, or on a portion of a sample prepared using the Plaque Sampling Procedure or the Component Sampling Procedure, according to the test method detailed in ASTM D1238-13 Standard Test Method for Melt Flow Rates of Thermoplastics by Extrusion Plastometer, using Procedure A described therein. Briefly, the melt flow index measures the rate of extrusion of thermoplastics through an orifice at a prescribed temperature and load. In the test method, approximately 7 grams of the sample is loaded into the barrel of the melt flow apparatus, which has been heated to a specified temperature of 210 degrees C., 220 degrees C., or 230 degrees C. A weight of 2.16 kilograms is applied to a plunger and the molten sample is forced through the die. A timed extrudate is collected and weighed. Melt flow rate values are calculated in g/10 min, and are reported with the specified temperature (i.e., 210, 220 or 230 degrees C.) and the weight applied to the plunger (i.e., 2.15 kilograms).</p><p id="p-0387" num="0343">Solid Polymer Abrasion Test (Akron)</p><p id="p-0388" num="0344">Abrasion loss is tested on a sample sheet having a thickness of 3 millimeters, prepared using the Plaque Sampling procedure or the Component Sampling Procedure.

The sample is cut into a rectangular shape measuring approximately 3.0 inches by 3.3 inches, and having a thickness of about 2 millimeters. The sample is permanently adhered to a 1 centimeter thick piece of EVA foam having a density of approximately 0.25 grams/cubic centimeters and having a Durometer hardness of 50C.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0351">For a dry test (i.e., to determine a dry-state coefficient of friction), the sample is initially equilibrated at 25 degree C. and 20 percent humidity for 24 hours. For a wet test (i.e., to determine a wet-state coefficient of friction), the sample is fully immersed in a deionized water bath maintained at 25 degree C. for 24 hours. After that, the sample is removed from the bath and blotted with a cloth to remove surface water.</p><p id="p-0396" num="0352">The measurement is performed with an aluminum sled mounted on a test track, which is used to perform a sliding friction test for test sample on the surface of the test track. The surface of the test track may include a specified test track material, such as aluminum, wood court surface (wet or dry), smooth concrete surface (wet or dry). The test track measures 127 millimeters wide by 610 millimeters long. The aluminum sled measures 76.2 millimeters by 76.2 millimeters, with a 9.5 millimeter radius cut into the leading edge. The contact area of the aluminum sled with the track is 76.2 millimeters by 66.6 millimeters, or 5,100 square millimeters).</p><p id="p-0397" num="0353">The dry or wet sample is attached to the bottom of the sled using a room temperature-curing two-part epoxy adhesive commercially available under the tradename &#x201c;LOCTITE 608&#x201d; from Henkel, Dusseldorf, Germany. The adhesive is used to maintain the planarity of the wet sample, which can curl when saturated. A polystyrene foam having a thickness of about 25.4 millimeters is attached to the top surface of the sled (opposite of the test sample) for structural support.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0354">The sliding friction test is conducted using a screw-driven load frame. A tow cable is attached to the sled with a mount supported in the polystyrene foam structural support, and is wrapped around a pulley to drag the sled across the aluminum test track. The sliding or frictional force is measured using a load transducer with a capacity of 2,000 Newtons. The normal force is controlled by placing weights on top of the aluminum sled, supported by the foam structural support, for a total sled weight of 1000 Newtons). The crosshead of the test frame has a speed of 0.4 meters/second, and the total test displacement is 250 millimeters. The coefficient of friction is calculated based on the steady-state force parallel to the direction of movement required to pull the sled at constant velocity. The coefficient of friction itself is found by dividing the steady-state pull force by the applied normal force. Any transient value relating static coefficient of friction at the start of the test is ignored.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0355">Ply Adhesion Testing</p><p id="p-0400" num="0356">Ply adhesion testing determines the adhesion between two bonded plies of material (e.g., a thermoplastic copolyester composition and a second polymeric material) using a tensile testing device such as an Instron Electropuls E10000 (Instron, Norwood, Mass., USA). Sample plies of each material may be provided using the Neat Sampling Procedure or the Plaque Sampling Procedure or Component Sampling Procedure, and the plies are thereafter bonded using a specified method. Alternatively, a sample of bonded plies may be provided by using the Component Sampling Procedure. On one end of the sample, the bond between the plies is carefully separated to provide approximately 0.5 centimeter unbonded length that may be inserted into the crossheads of the tensile testing device. A first ply is inserted into a first grip of the tensile tester, and a second ply is inserted into a second grip of the tensile tester so that the sample between the grips is substantially straight. The crosshead speed is set to 50 millimeters per minute. The peel strength is measured throughout the separation of the bonded sample until the bond fully separates or the sample fails. The force per peel distance is reported (kilograms force/centimeter), and the mode of failure (either adhesive or cohesive) is recorded for each sample.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">Foam Characterization.</heading><p id="p-0401" num="0357">Density Test</p><p id="p-0402" num="0358">The density is measured for samples taken using the Plaque Sampling Procedure, or the Component Sampling Procedure, using a digital balance or a Densicom Tester (Qualitest, Plantation, Fla., USA).

A 1-centimeter core sample is removed from a foam sample prepared using the Plaque Sampling Procedure or Component Sampling Procedure, starting from the side wall of the foamed article, e.g., the midsole of an article of footwear. The core is then cut to provide a cylindrical sample having a 1-centimeter cylinder height, ensuring that the side wall remains as part of the core sample. The sample is conditioned in an oven for 24 hours at 50 degrees C. plus or minus 3 degrees C. After conditioning, the sample is cooled for 30 minutes in a lab environment at a temperature of 22 degrees C. plus or minus 2 degrees C., and then is immediately weighed, and the weight recorded in grams (W_0). The surface of the side wall is masked with masking tape, while all other surfaces are sealed with a nonpermeable coating. When the surfaces are fully coated, the sidewall surface is unmasked.

Each sample is compressed to 50% strain at 5 Hz for 500 cycles. Stiffness, efficiency, and energy return are measured from the force vs. displacement curves for cycles 200, 300, 400, and 500. Stiffness of a particular foam sample is the stress at the maximum strain divided by the maximum strain, giving a value in kPa or N/mm. Efficiency of a foam sample is the integral of the unloading force-displacement curve divided by the integral of the loading force-displacement curve. Energy return of a foam sample is the integral of the unloading force-displacement curve, giving a value in mJ. The reported value for each metric is the average of each metric between cycles 200, 300, 400, and 500. All fatigue metrics are defined as relative differences in properties at the end of the test compared to the same properties at the beginning of the test (i.e., cycle 1).</p><p id="p-0411" num="0365">In some cases, a full midsole is tested using a footform for impact instead of a cylindrical tupp to more accurately simulate full gate loading. For these tests, a US mens size 10 midsole is tested, and a mens size 9 footform used for impact, with a load of 2000N being applied to the midsole with the footform at a loading rate of 5 Hz. All of the metrics from the footform test are collected and analyzed as described above.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0366">As with when a cylindrical tupp is used, when a footform is used, energy input is taken as the integral of the force-displacement curve during compression force loading. Energy return is taken as the integral of the force displacement curve during unloading. Hysteresis is taken as the ratio: (energy return)/(energy input), which can also be viewed as the energy efficiency of the foam. Fatigue behavior is judged by changes in the foam displacement at the max load of a cycle. All measured properties: stiffness, hysteresis, and fatigue are measured for thousands of cycles for both running and walking compression cycles.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0367">Durometer Hardness Test&#x2014;Shore A</p><p id="p-0414" num="0368">The test used to obtain the hardness values for the foam articles is as follows. A flat foam sample is prepared using the Plaque Sampling Procedure or the Component Sampling Procedure, where the sample has a minimum of 6 mm thick for Shore A durometer testing. If necessary, samples are stacked to make up the minimum thickness. Samples are large enough to allow all measurements to be performed at a minimum of 12 mm from the edge of the sample and at least 12 mm from any other measurement. Regions tested are flat and parallel with an area at least 6 mm in diameter. A minimum of five hardness measurements are taken and tested using a 1 kilogram head weight.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0369">Split Tear Test</p><p id="p-0416" num="0370">The split tear test can determine the internal tear strength for a foam material. A sample may be provided either using the Plaque Sampling Procedure or the Component Sampling Procedure. The sample is die cut into a rectangular shape having a width of 1.54 centimeters and a length of 15.24 centimeters (1 inch by 6 inches), and having a thickness of 10 millimeters, plus or minus 1 millimeter. On one end, a cut is made into the sample that bisects the thickness, the cut extending the full width of the sample, and 3 centimeters from the end of the sample. Starting from the end of the cut, 5 marks are placed along the length of the sample spaced 2 centimeters apart. The cut ends of the sample are placed in the clamps of a tensile tester. Each section of the sample is held in a clamp in such a manner that the original adjacent cut edges form a straight line joining the centers of the clamps. The crosshead speed is set to 50 millimeters per minute. The tear strength is measured throughout the separation of the crossheads. If necessary, a sharp knife may be used to keep separating the foam in the center of the sample, discarding the readings caused by cutting of the knife. The lowest split tear strength values are recorded for each of the five marked segments of the sample (between each of the 2-centimeter markings). An average split tear strength value is recorded for each sample. If a segment of a sample has an air bubble measuring more than 2 millimeters, the tear strength for the segment is discarded, and the air bubble recorded as a test defect. If more than one segment of a sample has an air bubble measuring more than 2 millimeters, the entire sample is discarded.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0371">Hand Pull Test</p><p id="p-0418" num="0372">The hand pull test can evaluate the bond strength between two foams, compositions or materials, such as between a solid and a foam or between two different foams. Depending upon the bonding method used, a sample of two pre-bonded foams, compositions or materials may be provided either using the Plaque Sampling Procedure or the Component Sampling Procedure. Alternatively, separate samples of a foam, a composition or a material can be prepared using the Plaque Sampling Procedure or the Component Sampling Procedure, and then can be bonded together using the bonding method to be evaluated. The sample is die cut into a rectangular shape having a width of 1.54 centimeters and a length of 15.24 centimeters (1 inch by 6 inches), and having a thickness of 10 millimeters, plus or minus 1 millimeter. On one end, a cut is made into the sample that bisects the thickness, the cut extending the full width of the sample, and 3 centimeters from the end of the sample. Starting from the end of the cut, 5 marks are placed along the length of the sample spaced 2 centimeters apart. The cut ends of the sample are held in the tester's hand and pulled at a rate of approximately 50 millimeters per minute. If necessary, a sharp knife may be used to keep separating the material in the center of the sample, discarding the readings caused by cutting of the knife. Tear strength values are recorded for each of the five marked segments of the sample (between each of the 2-centimeter markings), using the following scoring rubric: easy to peel or adhesive failure is given a score of 1; an adhesive failure but some resistance is given a score of 2; cohesive foam failure is given a score of 3 to 4.5 based on the accompanying level of foam skin failure, where 3 is the highest level of foam skin failure and 4.5 is the lowest level of foam skin failure; and unable to separate is given a score of 5. The scores for each segment are averaged to give value recorded for each sample. If a segment of a sample has an air bubble measuring more than 2 millimeters, the tear strength for the segment is discarded, and the air bubble recorded as a test defect. If more than one segment of a sample has an air bubble measuring more than 2 millimeters, the entire sample is discarded.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Aspects</heading><p id="p-0419" num="0373">The following listing of exemplary aspects supports and is supported by the disclosure provided herein.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0000">Aspect 1.

Exemplary Hand Pull Data</heading><p id="p-0455" num="0391">A foam article was prepared comprising a first foam component and a second s component. The first foam component was an open-cell foam formed from a first thermoplastic copolyester composition comprising HYTREL 4068 which contained less than 1 weight percent of non-polymeric materials. The first thermoplastic copolyester composition was injection molded, foamed and bonded in place to the second solid component. The thermoplastic copolyester composition was foamed using the MUCELL process by forming a single-phase solution of carbon dioxide and the thermoplastic copolyester composition. The first thermoplastic copolyester composition was injection molded and foamed onto a preformed second component as described herein below. The second solid component was prepared as a solid plaque using a second thermoplastic copolyester composition, i.e., a second polymeric material comprising one of the four listed copolyesters shown in the table below (MP IN15074, HYTREL 3078, TRIEL 5202SU, and SP9339, which are further described in Table 8). The first foam component was bonded to the second foam component, i.e., a plaque comprising a solid second polymeric material, by injecting, foaming, and molding a single-phase solution of carbond dioxide and a thermoplastic copolyester composition comprising HYTREL 4068 onto the outsole plaque in an injection mold. Prior to placing the outsole plaque into the mold, one of the following treatments was used: a) no surface preparation was conducted on the surface of the outsole plaque onto which the foam was injected (i.e., control sample); b) the outsole plaque surface was wiped with methyl ethyl ketone prior to insertion into the mold; c) the outsole plaque surface was treated using a rotating cone open air plasma treatment immediately prior to insertion into the mold and injection of the foam composition, where the plaque surface was held 1 cm away from the emitting head, and the plaque was moved passed the emitting head at a rate of about 100-200 mm/sec; or d) the outsole plaque was heated using an infrared lamp for at least 30 seconds immediately prior to insertion into the mold and injection of the foam composition. The equipment used was a Plasmatreat OPENAIR-PLASMA System with an RD1004 head (Plasmatreat GmbH, Steinhagen, Germany).</p><p id="p-0456" num="0392">Hand pull data were obtained using the Hand Pull Test as described herein above. The data obtained are shown in Table 7 below. The data in Table 7 indicate that good bonding of the foam to an outsole material can be achieved using a direct bonding process with little if any additional process steps prior to foaming and molding in place the first foam component.</p><p id="p-0457" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00007" num="00007"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="161pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 7</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Surface Prep of</entry><entry>Outsole Polymer*</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Foam Plaque</entry><entry>MP IN15074</entry><entry>HY3078</entry><entry>TRIEL 5202SU</entry><entry>SP9339</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>No treatment</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>3.5</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry>MEK wipe</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry>Plasmatreat</entry><entry>1.5</entry><entry>4.5</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>3.5</entry></row><row><entry>IR pre-treatment</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>4.5</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00001">*Values correspond to the following results in Hand Pull Test: 1-easy to peel adhesive failure;</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00002">2-adhesive failure, but some resistance;</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00003">3-4.5 cohesive foam failure, varying levels of foam skin failure;</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00004">and 5-unable separate)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">Example 4.
