This environment includes surrounding features such as vehicles, objects, and obstacles. Cellular vehicle-to-everything (CV2X) is a communication standard for exchanging information regarding a vehicle's environment. CV2X can include communication between CV2X-capable vehicles, and between CV2X-capable vehicles and other CV2X-capable entities, such infrastructure-based devices (commonly-termed road-side units (RSUs)), pedestrians, cyclists or other road users. CV2X can use cellular-based communication such as long-term evolution (LTE), fifth generation (5G), and/or other cellular technologies in a direct-communication mode as defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Traffic messaging technologies such as CV2X could be particularly useful for the management of traffic intersections, with respect to both autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles. For example, with such management, a vehicle could pass through intersections without stopping or with reduced delay, thus reducing transit time and fuel consumption. Problematically, current solutions for intersection-management messaging would be ineffective in providing effective intersection management, especially for a large number of vehicles.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Techniques described herein address these and other issues by providing for a hybrid control mechanism to manage the traversal of vehicles through a traffic intersection. In the hybrid control mechanism, a management system that is part of an infrastructure component managing the intersection, such as a Road-Side Unit (RSU), can group vehicles approaching a traffic intersection into one or more motion groups based on their motion characteristics. The management system can also select a leader vehicle for each of the one or more motion groups. The management system can coordinate the traversal of each motion group through the traffic intersection by transmitting a group maneuver target to the leader vehicle of each motion group. The leader vehicle of each motion group can determine a vehicle maneuver target for the each member vehicle within the motion group based on the group maneuver target, and coordinate the traversal of each member vehicle within the motion group through the traffic intersection based on transmitting the vehicle maneuver target to the each member vehicle. The communication of the group assignments, group maneuver targets, as well the vehicle maneuver targets can be based on messages using CV2X.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An example method of managing traversals of one or more vehicles through a traffic intersection and implemented by a management system such as an RSU, according to the description, comprises: receiving a first message of one or more motion characteristics of one or more vehicles approaching the traffic intersection; forming a motion group; grouping a subset of the one or more vehicles into the motion group based on the one or more motion characteristics; assigning a leader vehicle for the motion group; determining a group maneuver target for the motion group to traverse through the traffic intersection; and transmitting, to the leader vehicle of the motion group, a second message including the group maneuver target for the motion group, to enable the leader vehicle of the motion group to determine, based on the group maneuver target of the motion group, a vehicle maneuver target of each member vehicle of the motion group to traverse through the traffic intersection, and to transmit a third message including the respective vehicle maneuver target to the each member vehicle of the motion group.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An example method of managing traversals of one or more vehicles through a traffic intersection and implemented by a vehicle approaching the traffic intersection, according to the description, comprises: transmitting, by the vehicle and to a management system, a first message indicating one or more motion characteristics of the vehicle, to enable the management system to assign, based on the one or more motion characteristics, the vehicle to a motion group; receiving, from the management system, a second message indicating that the vehicle is assigned to the motion group and a group maneuver target of the motion group; determining, based on comparing a target maneuver of the vehicle through the traffic intersection and the group maneuver target of the motion group, whether to accept the assignment to the motion group; based on determining to accept the assignment to the group, transmitting a third message indicating acceptance to the management system to enable the management system to group the vehicle into the motion group; and receiving, from the management system and after transmitting the third message, a fourth message indicating one or more properties of the motion group, the one or more properties comprising at least one of: one or more member vehicles of the motion group including the vehicle, a leader vehicle of the motion group, or the group maneuver target of the motion group.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Example devices, means, and non-transitory computer readable medium storing instructions for performing the aforementioned methods are also described.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate example scenarios of management of a traffic intersection.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate example methods of management of a traffic intersection.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref> illustrate examples of a hybrid control mechanism to manage a traffic intersection.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrate example components of a traffic intersection management system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates example components of a vehicle management system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> illustrate example methods of managing traversal of vehicles through a traffic intersection.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> illustrate examples of system architectures for implementing examples of hybrid control mechanism of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of a mobile computer system.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of a fixed computer system.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements, in accordance with certain example implementations.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, as trajectory <b>104</b> of vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and trajectory <b>106</b> of vehicles <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>intersect, the maneuvers of vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>can be coordinated to avoid collision at traffic intersection <b>100</b> and based on other policies. For example, to reduce the total amount of time spent by vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>in waiting and traversing through traffic intersection <b>100</b>, vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can be controlled to stop or to slow down as they approach traffic intersection <b>100</b> from the west, while vehicles <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b </i>can be controlled to move through traffic intersection <b>100</b> along trajectory <b>104</b>, as it may take far longer for vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>to move through traffic intersection <b>100</b> than vehicles <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>b</i>. After vehicles <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b </i>have moved through traffic intersection <b>100</b>, vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>can be controlled to move through traffic intersection <b>100</b> along trajectory <b>104</b>. In some examples, vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can also be controlled to move through traffic intersection <b>100</b> before vehicles <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>based on, for example, vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>having a higher priority (e.g., being emergency vehicles) than vehicles <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates another example scenario of management of traffic intersection <b>100</b>.

For example, as described above, vehicles need to communicate with other vehicles approaching traffic intersection <b>100</b> to negotiate their maneuvers through traffic intersection <b>100</b>.

As the vehicles may need to wait or even stop before the maneuver arrangement is determined, distributed mechanism <b>120</b> can add delay to the maneuver of the vehicles and slow down the traffic. The problem of trajectory deadlock can be further exacerbated when, for example, the properties of a vehicle (e.g., priority, intended trajectory, speed, direction of movement, etc.) change during the determination of the maneuver arrangement, which can lead to a chain effect of trajectory adjustment of the rest of vehicles and can lead to trajectory deadlock if no adjustment can accommodate the changed properties of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a centralized mechanism <b>140</b> of managing the maneuver of vehicles through traffic intersection <b>100</b>.

Such arrangements can reduce the number of trajectories (of different vehicles) considered in determining the maneuver of a vehicle, as well as the communication and processing performed by each vehicle in determining the maneuver.

The state of motion may include, for example, a speed and a direction of motion of the vehicle, a position of the vehicle, etc. The intended motion of the vehicle may include, for example, a target direction of maneuver (e.g., direction of turning) at the traffic intersection, a target lane to move into after the vehicle moves through the traffic intersection, etc.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In step <b>604</b>, upon receiving the state of motion and intended motion message, motion group management module <b>402</b> of the management system can determine one or more motion groups.

This can happen when, for example, the group maneuver of the motion group is slower than and/or has a different trajectory from the target maneuver of the vehicle. As another example, the vehicle is an emergency vehicle and cannot stay in a formation with other vehicles in a motion group, as the vehicle must go through the traffic intersection in the shortest time possible. In such a case, traffic intersection management system <b>400</b> can form a motion group that contains just the emergency vehicle, and motion group module <b>502</b> can reject the assignment until the assignment indicates that the motion group only includes the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In step <b>610</b>, motion group module <b>502</b> of each vehicle can transmit a message including a group formation response back to motion group management module <b>402</b>. The group formation response may indicate whether the group formation request is accepted or rejected, and if the request is rejected, the reason for rejecting the request.

For example, motion group management module <b>402</b> can form a motion group to include only the emergency vehicle.

The message can prepare each vehicle approaching the traffic intersection for the subsequent traffic intersection management operations. For example, from the message each non-leader member vehicle and the leader vehicle of a motion group can identify each other based on the group identifier of the motion group as well as the leader vehicle identifier and the member vehicle identifiers for that motion group. As a result of the identification, a leader vehicle can establish unicast communication channels with each member vehicle within the motion group to transmit vehicle maneuver targets as well as vehicle motion state and sensor data.
