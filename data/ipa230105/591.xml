Prior to applying a dental crown to a natural tooth, the tooth is first prepared by grinding down the affected tooth to a peg or post-shaped element that is free of disease and is structurally sound. Thereafter, intra-oral digital scans, measurements and/or impressions of the teeth are taken and the coloring of the surrounding teeth is measured. This information is provided to a lab that fabricates a crown that is customized to the shape of the prepared tooth, the ideal final shape of the prepared tooth, the spacing of the mouth and teeth around the prepared tooth, and the color of the surrounding teeth.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Custom fabrication of the crown, however, is time consuming and expensive and requires that the patient be brought in on multiple occasions. On a first visit, the patient may consult with the dentist and a course of treatment may be determined. On this visit or on a second visit, the affected tooth may be prepared and impressions may be taken. A temporary crown may then be installed on the prepared tooth. If the temporary crown falls out prior to the installation of the permanent crown, which is not unusual, then an emergency visit to the dentist's office for repair or replacement may be required. After the final crown is custom fabricated, the patient returns to the dentist's office to have the temporary crown removed and the custom crown installed. If the custom crown fails to fit properly during installation, which may be possible if a bad impression was taken or the crown was made improperly by the lab, additional time is required to replace the custom crown, the patient may require a new temporary crown and another visit to place the replacement crown. Similar problems may occur if the color of the crown does not match that of the surrounding teeth. It is also possible for the prepared tooth to change position in the time between the preparing of the tooth and the installation of the custom crown, as the prepared tooth no longer has the constant opposing force of the opposite teeth. This change in position may cause the custom crown to either not fit or fit awkwardly, requiring trimming or polishing during installation, or in extreme cases, the need for a new crown to be made.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One option for providing single-visit dental crowns is in-office/chairside milling.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to this approach, an intraoral scanning device is used to image the patient's mouth with the prepared tooth. The image is then sent to a local workstation where the design for the crown can be customized and approved. From there, the digital design is sent to a chairside mill that automatically grinds out the crown based on the design. The crown may then be prepared, directly pigmented, glazed, and polished and then its fit may be tested in the patient's mouth. The crown may then be installed in the patient's mouth in that same visit.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">While chairside milling may be effective at reducing the number of visits needed to perform the restoration, this approach is time consuming (it could take more than <b>90</b> minutes to perform chairside milling), requires significant training of the dentist and dental staff, and requires significant capital investment on the part of the treating dentist.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A dental restoration device includes a sleeve having an exterior surface and an interior pocket that is at least partially filled with a dental cement, and a crown having an exterior surface and an interior surface that is mated to the exterior surface of the sleeve and bonded thereto by an adhesive disposed between the exterior surface of the sleeve and the interior surface of the crown.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A method for installing a dental restoration includes preparing an affected tooth of a patient by removing diseased and/or damaged matter so as to achieve a substantially post-shaped prepared tooth, determining a desired crown shape based on a size and/or spacing of the patient's mouth and a type of the affected tooth, determining a desired tooth color based on observing a color of teeth proximate to the affected tooth, selecting a prefabricated crown in accordance with the determined crown shape and determined desired tooth color, from among a kit of prefabricated crowns of different sizes and colors, the selected prefabricated crown being associated with a prefabricated sleeve, filling an interior pocket of the associated prefabricated sleeve with dental cement, placing the filled sleeve with the crown disposed thereon over the prepared tooth, pressing the filled sleeve to a desired position with respect to a gum line of the patient by the patient biting down on the crown, removing the crown from the sleeve, curing the dental cement with a light source that is cast through the sleeve, and bonding the interior surface of the crown to the exterior surface of the sleeve using an adhesive.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A kit of prefabricated dental crowns includes a plurality of prefabricated dental crowns organized by tooth type, size, and shade, and a plurality of sleeves, each of which is associated with a corresponding crown of the plurality of prefabricated dental crowns.

describing exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology is employed for sake of clarity. However, the present disclosure is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The present disclosure is organized into five main sections, namely: 1) dental crown restorations, 2) digital guidance, 3) haptic guidance, 4) colored sleeves, and 5) shaded crowns. It is to be understood, however, that each of these three sections describes aspects of a unified system for utilizing a kit of prefabricated crowns and sleeves for use in single-visit dental restorations and that each and every detail described with respect to one section of the present disclosure may be applied equally to every other section of the present disclosure. Thus, while certain details are not described repeatedly in each section, for the purpose of providing a more concise disclosure, it is to be understood that details of each section may be mixed and matched, and in particular, elements described in one section may be substituted for similar or corresponding elements described in another section.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, the digital guidance and haptic guidance described in sections 2 and 3 may be used as part of a method for installing the prefabricated crowns and sleeves described in section 1. For example, the concepts of the colored sleeves or shaded crowns of sections 4 and 5 could be applied to the prefabricated crowns of section 1. Additionally, all other possible combinations of features of the various sections of the disclosure are contemplated to be mix and matchable, to the greatest extent possible, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Dental Crown Restorations</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an approach for performing a dental crown restoration in a single sitting. According to this approach, pairs of crowns and sleeves are prefabricated in a variety of different sizes and pigment shades and are added to a kit that is provided to a dentist. When a patient requires a crown, the tooth is prepped, an appropriately sized and colored crown and its associated sleeve are bonded to the prepared tooth in the manner described herein, without the patient having to come back for a second visit and without requiring the dentist to purchase expensive in-office milling equipment.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cutaway view illustrating a prepared tooth with a sleeve-crown pair installed thereon in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. As can be seen from this figure, an at least partially translucent sleeve <b>20</b> is bonded to the properly prepared tooth <b>50</b> using light-curing cement <b>40</b>, in the manner described herein. The crown <b>10</b> is then glued to the sleeve <b>20</b> using an adhesive or cement compound <b>30</b> thereby giving the patient a permanent crown in a single sitting.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">While the figures and their associated description discuss the fitting of the aforementioned sleeve-crown pair to a prepared tooth <b>50</b> that remains attached to a natural tooth root <b>60</b>, it is to be understood that the sleeve-crown pair may be similarly installed onto an abutment of a dental implant that has been installed into the jaw bone of the patient.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a representation of a diseased or damaged tooth <b>1</b> that has not yet been prepared. The damaged tooth <b>1</b> may be damaged as a result of tooth decay, physical trauma, or structural break down of a natural tooth or a previously applied restoration that may occur over time with normal use. Where this damage cannot be effectively repaired by fillings, inlays, or onlays, a dental crown may be used according to a dentist's preferred course of treatment.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> are flow charts illustrating a method for performing a dental crown restoration in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. The structures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>8</b></figref> will now be explained in connection with the method represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention may begin with the preparation of the damaged tooth <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a prepared tooth <b>50</b> in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. As can be seen from this figure, the prepared tooth <b>50</b> may be prepared by grinding the outer surface of the tooth to achieve a prepared tooth having a post-shape (Step S<b>901</b>). The size and shape of the prepared tooth may depend largely on the extent of the damage to the tooth as the prepared tooth must be free of damage. In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the dentist may use judgement to prepare the tooth to a post of a desired size and shape.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">After preparation has been completed, the shape of the prepared tooth, mouth, and surrounding teeth may be analyzed to select an appropriate size of prefabricated crown (Step S<b>902</b>) and the color of the surrounding teeth may be analyzed to select an appropriate crown color (Step S<b>903</b>).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Selecting the appropriate size for the crown may include scanning the prepared tooth and surrounding mesial-distal area with a digital scanner. A computer may then be used to determine the optimal crown size to use such that the selected crown will fit well between the neighboring teeth and engage well with the bite of the opposite tooth. The digital scanner and computer may also be used to assess tooth color and select an appropriate crown color.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Rather than use digital sizing, a mechanical dental caliper or printed sizing gauge tool may be used to measure the optimal size of the crown to be used and a printed color chart may be used to select a desired color. However, it is to be understood that some amount of trimming and/or polishing may be performed at a later point to allow the selected crown to better fit between neighboring teeth, where necessary. It is also to be understood that the exact height at which the sleeve-crown pair fits upon the prepared tooth may be adjusted in the manner described below and so there is some degree of customization that can be performed on the selected prefabricated tooth to allow for a smaller number of crown sizes to choose between.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">There may be any number of differently sized prefabricated crowns to choose from and there may be a different selection of crown sizes that depend on the type of tooth being repaired. For example, there may be some number of sizes of prefabricated crowns for molars, some number of sizes of prefabricated crowns for premolars, some number of sizes of prefabricated crowns for canines, and some number of prefabricated crowns for incisors. While it is contemplated that exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be used to crown any tooth, the crowning of molars is primarily described herein for the purpose of providing a simplified disclosure. According to one exemplary embodiment, there may be five differently sized crowns to fit each of the molars of most adults.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The crowns of each size may be made available in one of a number of different shades.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The number of different shades that may be prefabricated and included as part of a dental restoration kit may depend on the type of tooth being crowned as the closeness of a color match for incisors may be easier to detect than the closeness of a color match for molars. Thus, a kit of prefabricated crowns and sleeves that would include incisors and molars may include more color shade options for incisors than for molars. Some kits may be limited to prefabricated crown and sleeve pairs for just molars, other kits may include prefabricated crown and sleeve pairs for all teeth, including incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, or any combination thereof. According to one exemplary embodiment, there may be three differently colored crowns to crown the molars of most adults.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Accordingly, the kit of prefabricated molar crowns may include crowns of five different sizes, each with three different shades, for a total of fifteen different crowns for restoring one tooth.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the dental restoration kit, each crown may be coupled to a matching sleeve and so the optimal selection of crown size and color may be made and picked from the dental restoration kit along with its matched sleeve (Step S<b>904</b>). However, in the dental restoration kit, each crown need not be pre-matched with a proper sleeve and in that case, a kit guide may be used to select an appropriate sleeve size for the desired crown.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cutaway view illustrating a sleeve-crown pair in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. As can be seen from this figure, the selected crown <b>10</b> and its associated at least partially translucent sleeve <b>20</b> may be temporarily engaged with each other, which is to say, the crown <b>10</b> may be placed over the sleeve <b>20</b> without adhesives. The crown <b>10</b> and sleeve <b>20</b> pair may then be placed over the prepared tooth <b>50</b> to provide a preliminary test fit. If the crown <b>10</b> is too wide to fit between neighboring teeth, the crown <b>10</b> may be trimmed and/or polished a bit to allow for the preliminary test fitting. If the preliminary test fitting reveals that the incorrect crown size had been selected or the incorrect color had been selected, then the selection of the optimal sleeve-crown pair may need to be redone at this time.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Once the preliminary test fitting has been successfully performed, the inner cavity of the sleeve <b>20</b>, which may be referred to herein as the sleeve pocket <b>40</b>, may be filled with a light-curing cement having a high Young's modulus (Step S<b>905</b>). This cement may include a composite resin such as a glass ionomer. The cement may have the same Young's modulus as the crown <b>10</b> and sleeve <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It is noted that the crown <b>10</b> may be made of a base material such as a polymer with ceramic particles dispersed therein. Traditionally, crowns may be made of partially stabilized zirconia (zirconium dioxide ZrO<sub>2</sub>+ Yttrium Oxide Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) or porcelain fused to metal (PFM) which provide for a strong crown having a realistic tooth-like appearance. However, to better allow for trimming/polishing, exemplary embodiments of the present invention may construct the prefabricated crowns <b>10</b> using a polymer base, which may facilitate trimming/polishing and may also allow for fabrication by injection-molding or printing, which would not be practical for zirconia or porcelain crowns. The polymer base may be impregnated with ceramic particles and/or glass particles, or strong nanomaterials, to provide the crown with an enduring hardness that is resistant to chipping and cracking. For example, the particles of ceramic and/or glass may comprise 40-85% of the total volume of the impregnated polymer. Any polymer may be used for this purpose. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>19</b></figref> are tables illustrating examples of materials that may be used in the dental crowns in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a table illustrating examples of materials that may be used to form the crowns <b>10</b> and/or sleeves <b>20</b> in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.

To the extent that the measured composition differs from the compositions provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, it is noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows idealized values while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows measured values.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a table illustrating examples of materials that may be used to form the crowns <b>10</b> and/or sleeves <b>20</b> in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. Shown are the material names, a brief description of how these materials may be used, and other pertinent technical details.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, the sleeve <b>20</b> may include the same or different materials from the crown <b>10</b>. For example, the crown and sleeve may each include Bego Varseo (which can be 3D printed), HR smart blocks (hybrid ceramic) (injection moldable), Camouflage from Glidewell (injection moldable), GC initial LRF block (leucite reinforced glass ceramic) (machinable), tetric CAD (hybrid ceramic resin) (machinable), and/or Shofu block HC (hybrid ceramic) (machinable). Each of these aforementioned materials may be considered a polymer.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The crown <b>10</b> may have an exterior surface that is smooth and made to look like a natural tooth having a natural pattern of cusps, grooves, and pits on the occlusal surface. The interior surface of the crown <b>10</b> may substantially match the exterior surface of the crown so as to provide a nearly constant thickness throughout the crown <b>10</b>, although it is to be understood that the interior surface of the crown <b>10</b> does not necessarily have the same level of detail as the exterior surface of the crown <b>10</b>. According to some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the crown <b>10</b> may have a nearly constant thickness throughout all side surfaces, with a somewhat larger thickness at the occlusal surface. However, it is to be understood that the thickness of the crown <b>10</b> along the side surfaces may tapper towards the gumline.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">By conforming the contours of the inner surface of the crown <b>10</b> to the contours of the outer surface of the crown <b>10</b>, the crown <b>10</b> may achieve maximum structural strength while allowing for a large cavity within its inner surface.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The shape of the exterior surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> may precisely match the shape of the interior surface of the crown <b>10</b>, in an inverted manner, so that the two elements may precisely engage and mate together. Thus, the exterior surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> may have a similar shape to the exterior surface of the crown <b>10</b>, which may be a substantially anatomical shape of the occlusal surface of the crown <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Alternatively, the interior surface of the crown <b>10</b> may be domed and the exterior surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> may be inversely domed. However, this arrangement might not distribute biting force as well as the above-described approach, might create a weaker bond between crown and sleeve, and might make for a thicker crown <b>10</b> at its sides and thereby reduce the ability of the sleeve <b>20</b> to accommodate thicker prepared tooth posts. Thus, by conforming the shape of the outer surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> to that of the outer surface of the crown <b>10</b>, the sleeve <b>20</b> may be made to accommodate a wider range of prepared tooth sizes.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The interior surface of the crown <b>10</b> and the exterior surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> may alternatively be shaped with any manner of structures to increase coupling between crown <b>10</b> and sleeve <b>20</b>, however, as described above, the conformal shape design may allow for the accommodation of a wider range of prepared tooth sizes.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">It is further noted that the interior surface of the crown <b>10</b> may be made rough and the exterior surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> may be made similarly rough so as to better allow for the bonding of these surfaces to an adhesive that is applied between these two surfaces, as is described in greater detail bellow. This roughness may be equivalent to an RA of 40-150. However, more generally, this roughness may be equivalent to an RA of 12-350.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The sleeve <b>20</b> may be constructed of a material that is at least partially translucent to light of a wavelength that is used to cure dental cement such as that described in greater detail below. The sleeve <b>20</b> may have substantially the same composition as the crown <b>10</b>. This will allow the two elements to better bond together without separation over time. Where different materials are used for the sleeve <b>20</b> and the crown <b>10</b>, they should have the same stiffness, for example, the same Young's modulus.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">For example, the sleeve <b>20</b> may be constructed of a polymer. The sleeve <b>20</b>, like the crown <b>10</b>, may be made by injection molding and so a polymer is well suited for this means of fabrication. However, the sleeve <b>20</b> may alternatively be made by printing, casting, or milling and so the sleeve may be constructed of other materials that are at least partially translucent in the desired wavelength. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the sleeve <b>20</b> may be made of the same material as the crown <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The sleeve <b>20</b> may be non-porous so as to prevent the dental cement from penetrating its interior surface and the sleeve <b>20</b> may be rigid so as to maintain its fixed shape.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The interior surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> may also be conformal to its exterior surface so as to permit the sleeve <b>20</b> to be thinner while keeping a desired structural strength. In this case, the interior surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> would also have the aforementioned anatomic shape. Alternatively, the interior surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> may be shaped as a simple dome or cylinder with a domed top <b>624</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">It is noted that the interior pocket of the sleeve <b>20</b> should be relatively large. This may allow for the sleeve <b>20</b> to be relatively thin so as to enhance translucency thereof. Also, the relatively large interior pocket of the sleeve <b>20</b> may allow for the accommodation of a larger prepared tooth post <b>50</b>, as it is not known at the time of fabrication how large the prepared tooth post <b>50</b> will be. However, a majority of the internal volume <b>40</b> of the sleeve <b>20</b> may be filled with the cement, after the restoration is complete. For example, the prepared tooth may occupy 20% to 50% of the volume of the internal volume <b>40</b> of the sleeve <b>20</b>, with the cement occupying the remaining 80% to 50%. However, this is not necessarily the case, and the prepared tooth <b>50</b> may occupy a majority of the internal volume <b>40</b> of the sleeve <b>20</b>, for example, between 50% and 80% thereof, with the cement occupying the remaining 50% to 20% of the internal volume <b>40</b> of the sleeve <b>20</b>. However, as is described below, the internal cavity <b>40</b> of the sleeve <b>20</b> may be fully filled with the cement prior to applying the sleeve <b>20</b> to the prepared tooth <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The sleeve pocket <b>40</b> is filled with a dental cement (Step S<b>905</b>). The dental cement used should be light-curing and should have a high Young's modulus so as to be sufficiently rigid to allow for proper chewing on the crown <b>10</b>, even when the volume of the sleeve pocket <b>40</b> is relatively large. The dental cement, once light-cured, may occupy a substantial volume of the complete dental restoration and so for this reason, it needs to be sufficiently rigid.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Accordingly, the crown <b>10</b>, the sleeve <b>20</b>, and the cement should have a high Young's modulus within a range of 2 and 60 GPa. Moreover, the Young's modulus of the crown <b>10</b>, the sleeve <b>20</b>, and the cement should substantially match each other. For example, the Young's modulus of the sleeve <b>20</b> should be within +/&#x2212;3% of that of the crown <b>10</b>. The Young's modulus of the cement should be within 1% to 35% of that of the sleeve <b>20</b>, as the matching between the Young's modulus of the cement to the sleeve <b>20</b> is less critical than that of the sleeve <b>20</b> to the crown <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As discussed above, the crown <b>10</b> may be shaded with one of a selection of particular colors. The coloration of the crown <b>10</b> may block light. Even though both the sleeve <b>20</b> and the crown <b>10</b> may be made of the same material, the sleeve <b>20</b> may be more translucent to light than crown <b>10</b> because it is thinner and also because it is not shaded.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure may provide premade crowns <b>10</b> of one of a number of different shades. There are 16 shades within Vita Pan Classical Shade Guide and so exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure may have as many as 16 differently shaded crowns <b>10</b>. However, this many shades might not be necessary as 3 different shades may be used to match with up to 85% of the population, with molar crowns <b>10</b> requiring fewer shades than other teeth as it may be harder to perceive shading in such teeth.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Examples of suitable dental cements having a high Young's modulus may include GC FujiCEM. Suitable dental cements may be light-curing, such as infra-red or ultraviolet light curing. The dental cement may include a silane additive, which may be used to increase polymer bond. The dental cement may be a glass ionomer material that may include one or more of, for example, silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>), alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), aluminum fluoride (AlF<sub>3</sub>), calcium fluoride (CaF<sub>2</sub>), sodium fluoride (NaF), aluminum phosphate (AlPO<sub>4</sub>), barium oxide, strontium oxide, polyacrylic acid, a copolymer of acrylic acid, other carboxylic acids (e.g., itaconic acid or maleic acid), and/or tartaric acid.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cutaway view illustrating a sleeve-crown pair temporarily placed on a prepared tooth <b>50</b> in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. With the crown <b>10</b> still disposed over the sleeve <b>20</b>, without the use of adhesives therebetween, and the sleeve pocket filled with the light-curing high Young's modulus cement, the dental restoration is placed over the prepared tooth <b>50</b> (Step S<b>905</b>). However, at this stage, the dental restoration is placed at a relatively high level above the plane of the gum line. The patient is then asked to slowly bite or tap down thereby pushing the dental restoration into its ideal height, relative to the gum line (Step S<b>906</b>). Any runoff of uncured cement may be cleaned away at this time.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Continuing on to the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the crown <b>10</b> is then gently removed from the sleeve <b>20</b> such that the sleeve <b>20</b> maintains its ideal distance from the gum line (Step S<b>907</b>). This exposes the exterior surface of the sleeve.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cutaway view illustrating the light-curing of cement through a sleeve <b>20</b> fitted to a prepared tooth <b>50</b> in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. As seen in this figure, a light source <b>70</b> is then used to light cure the dental cement within the interior volume <b>40</b> of the sleeve <b>20</b> through the at least partially translucent sleeve <b>20</b> (Step S<b>908</b>) while the crown <b>10</b> has been removed. For example, an infrared light source may be used to cure the dental cement, which is an infrared-curing material. Alternatively, the light source <b>70</b> may be an ultraviolet light source and the dental cement may include an ultraviolet-cured material. In either case, because the sleeve <b>20</b> is relatively thin and at least partially translucent to the spectrum of light produced by the light source <b>70</b>, the dental cement within the interior volume <b>40</b> may be effectively cured so as to form the aforementioned dominant volume of the dental restoration.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Next, the fit of the crown <b>10</b> over the sleeve <b>20</b> may be fully tested. This may include placing the crown <b>10</b> back over the sleeve <b>20</b>, without the use of an adhesive therebetween (Step S<b>909</b>). If the fit is perfect (Yes, S<b>910</b>) then the method may proceed to the permanent adhesion of the crown <b>10</b> to sleeve <b>20</b>. However, if there is insufficient space between the sides of the crown <b>10</b> and the sides of the neighboring teeth (insufficient mesial/distal spacing) (No, Step S<b>910</b>) then the crown <b>10</b> may be trimmed and/or polished (Step S<b>911</b>). The process of performing the test fitting and trimming/polishing may be repeated until the perfect fit is achieved (Yes, S<b>910</b>).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cutaway view illustrating the application of an adhesive to an outer surface of a cemented sleeve <b>20</b> in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. As can be seen from this figure, the crown <b>10</b> may be once again removed from the sleeve <b>20</b> and the exterior surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> may be covered with an adhesive (Step S<b>912</b>), for example, suing a brush <b>80</b> or other application device. The adhesive may also be, or may alternatively be, applied to the interior surface of the crown <b>10</b> and then the crown <b>10</b> may be placed over the sleeve <b>20</b> so as to permanently lock the crown <b>10</b> to the sleeve <b>20</b> (Step S<b>913</b>). The adhesive used may be any of a wide range of suitable dental adhesive or dental cement used for dental restorations such as lute glass or <b>3</b>M Relyx Unicem dental cement or adhesive.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cutaway view illustrating a crown <b>10</b> adhered to a cemented sleeve <b>20</b> in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. As can be seen from this figure, the dental restoration is complete.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">It is noted that there might be no elements disposed between the crown <b>10</b> and sleeve <b>20</b> other than the aforementioned adhesive and the interior surface of the crown <b>10</b> and the exterior surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> may be so shaped for precise mating. Thus, according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, no structure of plastic or metal, whether rigid or mesh, is disposed between crown <b>10</b> and sleeve <b>20</b>, other than a thin layer of adhesive. It is further noted that the thin layer of adhesive is applied to the interior surface of the crown <b>10</b> and/or the exterior surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> in a substantially liquid or gelatinous form so as to conform to the shapes and structures of the crown <b>10</b> and sleeve <b>20</b> and so this adhesive is not applied as a rigid and/or solid mass.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Additionally, in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the sleeve <b>20</b> itself, as described above, is substantially rigid and is formed of a contiguous and homogeneous material. Thus, the sleeve <b>20</b> is not a fabric, mesh, chain-link, etc. For example, the sleeve <b>20</b> may be non-porous and, as described above, may be made of a same material as the crown <b>10</b>. The sleeve <b>20</b> may therefore be at least partially translucent to the frequency of light used to cure the cement contained in its inner volume <b>40</b> by virtue of light being able to pass through the material of its composition, rather than by being able to pass through holes or pores thereof. However, alternatively, the sleeve <b>20</b> may be opaque in which case the dental cement may be cured by another means such as time curing or by the conduction of heat through the sleeve <b>20</b> by a heating element.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">It is further noted that the sleeve <b>20</b> is disposed between the crown <b>10</b> and the prepared tooth <b>50</b> and, according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the sleeve <b>20</b> is not intended and is not suitable for use as a crown <b>10</b> itself. For example, the sleeve <b>20</b> is not polished to be smooth as a natural tooth would be and the sleeve <b>20</b> is not tinted to match the color of the patient's surrounding tooth. It is further noted that the sleeve <b>20</b> need not have an anatomical look of a tooth and may instead have any suitable shape, such as a substantially cylindrical structure with a flat or domed top. It is only the crown <b>10</b> that is polished and tinted so as to appear as a natural tooth. This arrangement allows for the cement within the interior volume <b>40</b> of the sleeve <b>20</b> to be more easily cured using light, such as infrared light, as it is understood that polishing the surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> and/or tinting the surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> could make transmission of curing light therethrough more difficult.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Moreover, by utilizing the sleeve <b>20</b> and crown <b>10</b> combination in which the crown <b>10</b> may be trimmed to fit between surrounding teeth, no trimming or polishing of the sleeve <b>20</b> may be needed. However, according to some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the sleeve <b>20</b> may be trimmed or polished to provide a better fit, particularly (although not necessarily) in the interior of the sleeve <b>20</b> so as to better accommodate the prepared tooth <b>50</b>. Moreover, the exterior surface of the sleeve <b>20</b> may also be trimmed, along with the crown <b>10</b>, to better accommodate the mesial-distal spacing between the neighboring teeth.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref> are perspective views illustrating a molar crown in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.

The intraoral images may include a visual image of the exterior surfaces of the patient's dental arch as well as x-rays of the interior structure of the dental arch. These intraoral images are then digitally processed to generate a three-dimensional model of the patient's dental arch in which both interior and exterior visualizations are merged.

Computer vision is then used to segment an area of disease within the affected tooth within the merged model. A desired volume of removal is then automatically identified from within the merged model based on removing the area of disease from the affected tooth and then creating a desired shape from the remaining healthy tooth, the desired shape being suitable to interface with a prefabricated bushing/sleeve and a prefabricated crown.

Before the affected tooth is prepared, an optical imager <b>210</b>, such as a digital camera, etc., may be used to acquire an intraoral optical image of the patient's entire dental arch, or some portion thereof (Step S<b>2101</b>). The acquired image may be a 3D image that is taken either with a stereographic imager or an imager with a single lens may be used to acquire intraoral images from multiple different angles. An x-ray imager <b>220</b>, or some other imaging modality able to acquire structural/internal images of the patient's teeth, may be used to acquire structural/internal images of the entire dental arch, or some portion thereof (Step S<b>2102</b>). For the purpose of providing a simplified description, this imaging modality that acquires structural/internal images of the teeth will be referred to herein as an x-ray imager <b>220</b>, although it is to be understood that other modalities may be used such as a sonogram, MRI, etc. This x-ray imager <b>220</b> may also be a 3D imager or it may be used to acquire x-ray images from multiple angles so as to generate a 3D image at a later step.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The acquired images (both optical and x-ray) may be sent to an image processing server <b>200</b>. The image processing server <b>200</b> may either be local to the dental office, or remote and accessible over a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet, and thus may be embodied as a cloud-based service. The image processing server <b>200</b> may perform image registration so as to generate a 3D model that identifies each individual tooth of the dental arch, and the bounds and limits thereof (Step S<b>2103</b>). Image registration may be performed volumetrically for both the optical images and the x-ray images and then the two sets of images may be combined into a single 3D model that includes optical data for the surfaces of the teeth as well as x-ray data for the interior and structural elements of the teeth.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The image processing server <b>200</b> may thereafter perform computer vision segmentation on the teeth so as to label each voxel of the 3D model as either disease or healthy (Step S<b>2104</b>). This determination may either automatic or assisted. Where it is assisted, a clinician may use a guidance console <b>230</b> to label one or more points of the 3D model as seed points for diseased tissue and then a region growing algorithm, for example, may be used to identify all other voxels that are part of the region of disease. The clinician may be shown the segmentation on the guidance console <b>230</b> and may use the guidance console <b>230</b> to adjust or accept the segmentation results. The guidance console <b>230</b> may be a computer terminal or another means for digital input/output and the clinician may also use the guidance console <b>230</b> to show a desired portion of the 3D model and/or the optical images and x-rays so as to verify that the segmentation results accurately reflect the bounds of the diseased tissue.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The image processing server <b>200</b> may thereafter define a removal volume on the 3D model (Step S<b>2105</b>). The removal volume may be an area which the clinician is to remove from the tooth. The removal volume therefore includes an entirety of the diseased tissue plus some predetermined margin of healthy tissue and such additional healthy tissue as is needed to be removed so as to be left with a shape of a prepared tooth that is suited for fitting within one of a plurality of sleeve sizes.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The sleeve and/or bushing (referred to herein as &#x201c;sleeve&#x201d;) is an adaptive element configured to receive the prepared tooth at one end thereof (a &#x201c;tooth-wise end&#x201d;) and to receive the prefabricated crown at an opposite end thereof (a &#x201c;crown-wise end&#x201d;). The clinician may be in possession of a set or kit of sleeves that have a combination of different sizes at the tooth-wise end and different sizes at the crown-wise end. There may be a finite set of different sizes at each of the crown-wise end and the tooth-wise end. The shape of the tooth-wise end may be a substantially cylindrical cavity with a radius and height. For example, there may be 4 different radiuses and 4 different heights to the cylindrical cavity of the tooth-wise end. In this case there need not be 16 different possible combinations of radius and height as smaller radiuses may only be associated with smaller heights and larger radiuses may be associated with larger heights, but there will be some number of possible sizes for the tooth-wise end, for example, there may be 8 different sizes.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Similarly, the crown-wise end of the sleeve may have a peg shape configured to mate with a plurality of differently sized and shaped prefabricated crowns. According to some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, there need only be one such size of peg for the crown-wise end of the sleeve. However, there may alternatively be several differently sized pegs with larger peg shapes being used for larger crowns and smaller peg shapes being used with smaller crowns. Thus, there may be 3 different peg shapes for the crown-wise end of the sleeve. Thus, there may be 24 different sleeves in the kit representing every possible combination of tooth-wise ends and crown-wise ends, although these numbers are merely offered as an example, and there may be any number of shapes or sleeves used.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The dimensions of the available sleeves are recorded in a selection database <b>240</b> that is accessible by the image processing server <b>200</b> and so these dimensions may be used by the image processing server <b>200</b> in computing the removal volume so that after the removal volume is removed from the affected tooth, the affected tooth has a perfect shape to receive one of the sleeves, which has been selected according to some criteria, such as the largest possible radius that allows for the complete removal of the diseased tissue plus the aforementioned margin.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The image processing server <b>200</b> may thereafter compute, from the removal volume, preparation guidance (Step S<b>2106</b>). Preparation guidance is an indication of the delineation between the removal volume and what is to remain of the affected tooth so as to mate with the tooth-wise end of the sleeve so as to serve as guidance for the clinician to know what potions of the tooth are to be removed. The preparation guidance may be displayed in one or more different forms. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating some of the possible forms in which preparation guidance may be displayed.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In a simplest form, the preparation guidance may be displayed on the guidance console <b>230</b>. In this example, the clinician may see from the display on the guidance console <b>230</b> what must be removed from the tooth, and as this guidance may be updated as the clinician drills, the clinician may look back and forth between the guidance console <b>230</b> and the tooth to ensure accurate drilling.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Alternatively, the preparation guidance may be displayed on a small display <b>310</b> that has been mounted on the dental drill <b>300</b>. This small display <b>310</b> may include a display unit, an attachment means for attaching the small display <b>310</b> to the dental drill <b>300</b>, an image processing unit, such as a system-on-chip (and other related components), a battery for supplying power, and a wireless adapter for receiving the preparation guidance wirelessly, from the image processing server. The small display <b>310</b> may alternatively receive preparation guidance from a wire connection that runs parallel to the power connection of the dental drill <b>300</b>. By mounting this display <b>310</b> to the dental drill <b>300</b>, the clinician need not have to look away from the tooth to see the preparation guidance.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Alternatively, a guidance projector <b>320</b> may be incorporated into the dental drill <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">This element may be embodied as a laser-diose laser pointer that is mechanically actuated and/or includes a lens/mirror element that is mechanically actuated or otherwise controlled by electrical signal. The laser-diode laser pointer <b>320</b> may project cut lines <b>340</b> using one or more laser points that are scanned across the tooth surface <b>330</b>. Alternatively, the guidance projector <b>320</b> may use a backlight, an LCD imager, and lenses to project a display of the projected guidance <b>340</b> onto the affected tooth <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">According to another approach, the guidance may be displayed using augmented reality glasses <b>350</b> worn by the dental clinician so that the guidance may be highlighted in 3D over the actual tooth, as seen by the dental clinician, for example, as coloration or some iconic indicator.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">As mentioned above, the preparation guidance may be updated in real-time as the clinician drills. This may be accomplished, for example, by the continuous use of the optical imager <b>210</b> to determine a current image of the affected tooth, which may be used to update the 3D model and thus the guidance (Step S<b>2107</b>). As it may be difficult to obtain a clear view of the teeth during the drilling, an optical imager <b>210</b> may be incorporated into the drill <b>300</b> and/or accelerometers may be used in the drill <b>300</b> to keep track of its movements so as to help infer what has been removed from the tooth in real-time.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">This monitoring and adaptation of the preparation guidance may continue until the desired shape of the prepared tooth is obtained. However, should the clinician determine that further drilling is required to clear the diseased tissue, the preparation guidance may adapt to additional drilling beyond the preparation guidance by defining a new removal volume that leaves a smaller prepared tooth and perhaps fits a smaller-sized tooth-wise end of a sleeve.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">After the tooth has been fully prepared, the optical imager may be used to ensure the desired tooth preparation has been achieved and then the image processing server may select a desired prefabricated crown (Step S<b>2109</b>) so as to best match the size and shape of the dental arch and mouth of the patient and may select a desired sleeve (Step S<b>2108</b>) so as to have the desired tooth-wise end to match the prepared tooth and to have the desired crown-wise end to match the selected crown. The guidance console may show the clinician which crown and sleeve have been selected. Thereafter, the clinician may cement the sleeve to the prepared tooth and the crown to the sleeve so as to implement the restoration.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> shows an example of a computer system which may implement a method and system of the present disclosure.

According to this approach, intraoral images of the patient's mouth may be taken prior to preparing the affected tooth. The intraoral images may include a visual image of the exterior surfaces of the patient's dental arch as well as x-rays of the interior structure of the dental arch. These intraoral images are then digitally processed to generate a three-dimensional model of the patient's dental arch in which both interior and exterior visualizations are merged. The affected tooth is then either automatically identified or selected by the dental clinician. Computer vision is then used to segment an area of disease or other structural defect within the affected tooth within the merged model. A desired volume of removal is then automatically identified from within the merged model based on removing the area of disease from the affected tooth and then creating a desired shape from the remaining healthy tooth, the desired shape being suitable to interface with a prefabricated bushing/sleeve and a prefabricated crow. Tooth preparation guidance is then created so as to delineate the volume of removal from the desired shape. The preparation guidance is then displayed to the clinician. The dental clinician may then utilize the digital guidance display in the preparation of the affected tooth, for example, by drilling away the volume of removal using a dental drill that incorporates a haptic sleeve. Intraoral images are captured as the drilling is performed and these images are registered to the 3D model to compare the present location of the drill to the volume of removal. When the drill is determined to come into contact with a boundary between the volume of removal and the volume of tooth to be preserved, haptic feedback is provided by haptic sleeve so that the clinician may be made aware of having reached the boundary. This may continue until the preparation of the tooth has been completed.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Thereafter, the prepared tooth may be fitted with a bushing/sleeve and a prefabricated tooth may be installed over the bushing/sleeve.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a system for providing haptic guidance in the preparation of a tooth to be used in conjunction with prefabricated crowns and related bushings/sleeves and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating for providing haptic guidance in the preparation of a tooth to be used in conjunction with prefabricated crowns and related bushings/sleeves, in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The patient <b>450</b> may have one or more affected teeth.

As the optical imager may acquire imagery of the drill as it enters the patient's 450 mouth, the image processing server <b>400</b> may monitor the position of the drill with respect to the removal volume within the 3D model. When it is determined, based on the monitored position of the drill within the 3D model, that the drill is within a designated distance from an interface between the removal volume and the preservation volume (Yes, Step S<b>2508</b>), the image processing server may transmit to the haptic sleeve an activation signal and the haptic sleeve may provide haptic feedback in response to the received activation signal (Step S<b>2509</b>). The haptic feedback may be a vibration, which is to say, a rapid back-and-forth motion, or the haptic feedback may be a kick sensation such as the drill being pushed in a direction away from the affected tooth. In either case, the image processing server may be used to calculate a precise distance between the drill and the aforementioned interface and the closer the drill gets to the interface, the more forceful the haptic feedback may become. For example, there may be three levels of haptic feedback, the first level being a subtle vibration, the second level being a stronger vibration in combination with an intermittent kick and the third level, representing the drill being closest to the interface, may be a strongest vibration in combination with a quick set of repeated kicks. Details concerning the structure and operation of the haptic sleeve are described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">This monitoring and haptic feedback may continue until the desired shape of the prepared tooth is obtained and the clinician ends the drilling.

The weight may be magnetic and may either be a permanent magnet or may be a ferric material with one or more electromagnetic coils disposed around it. There may also be electromagnetic coils around each end of the rail so that electricity may be used to pull the weight to one side and then the other so as to create a haptic vibration as the electrical signal supplying power to the electromagnetic coils oscillates. The aforementioned kick sensation may be provided by activating at least one electromagnetic coils with a direct current signal so as to cause the weight to knock once against one side of the rail, rather than to vibrate continuously.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">It is to be understood that the aforementioned knock sensation need not actually move the drill away from the tooth, but rather creates a directional sensation on the hand of the clinician who is holding the drill. Further, the sensation of vibration may be tuned by adjusting the length of the rail upon which the weight slides, the spacing of the electromagnetic coils and/or the oscillation of the driving signal so as to make the vibration of the haptic sleeve <b>540</b> feel substantially different from the natural vibration of the dental drill <b>530</b>.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Chairside Milling</heading><p id="p-0142" num="0141">While exemplary embodiments of the present invention are generally described herein as using a pre-fabricated crown that may be polished to correct for the use of a crown that is somewhat larger than is ideal, it is to be understood that the embodiments described herein may make use of a modified chairside milling approach.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In traditional chairside milling, a crown, or other dental restoration, may be milled on-site from a solid block of ceramic, resin, zirconia, or other material using a 3D design expressed within a CAD/CAM file so that the patient does not have to leave the dentist's office for the number of days needed for the crown to be fabricated at the lab. This approach may be time consuming as chairside milling systems may take as much as an hour to fashion a crown from the solid block. While high-speed chairside milling systems are available and may be able to produce the desired crown within as little as ten minutes, these systems tend to be very expensive and so may not be suitably priced for widespread adoption.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention may therefore adapt one or more of the approaches described herein with a partial chairside milling approach. Accordingly, rather than milling a crown, or other dental restoration, from the solid block, which may be substantially box or cube shaped, a prefabricated crown, that is shaped as described elsewhere within the instant application, may be milled into the shape of a smaller crown. Therefore, the chairside milling may be performed more quickly than if milling were to be performed from the solid block, even when using less expensive and more readily available chairside milling systems. Further, this approach may lead to less material waste and may provide less wear and tear on the milling machine and its burrs.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">This approach of partial chairside milling from a substantially prefabricated crown, or other dental restoration, need not be limited to prefabricated crowns that are designed to interface with sleeves, as described herein, and may be readily applied to crowns that are intended to be adhered directly to a prepared tooth or implant abutment. Thus, chairside milling may be performed on a unit that is substantially crown-shaped, tooth-shaped or some other intermediate shape between a solid block and a finished crown or other dental restoration.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">It is to be further understood that the shape of a prefabricated sleeve, as herein described, may be similarly customized by chairside milling.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">As it may be difficult to perform milling on a prefabricated crown, as described herein, owing to the shape of the prefabricated crown, exemplary embodiments of the present invention may utilize a special milling chuck to engage the prefabricated crown within the milling machine during the formation chairside milling. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>, which is an exploded view illustrating a prefabricated crown <b>3550</b> being inserted into a milling chuck <b>3510</b>, the milling chuck <b>3510</b> may be adapted to accommodate the prefabricated crown <b>3550</b> by including a chuck base <b>3520</b> with a ridge <b>3530</b> disposed thereon. A center peg <b>3540</b> may be disposed onto the chuck base <b>3520</b> with the center peg <b>3540</b> being shaped to accommodate a central cavity of the prefabricated crown <b>3550</b>. The prefabricated crown <b>3550</b> may be affixed to the milling chuck <b>3510</b> by friction between the interior of the prefabricated crown <b>3550</b> and the center peg <b>3540</b> as well as friction between the exterior of the prefabricated crown <b>3550</b> and the ridge <b>3530</b>. The prefabricated crown <b>3550</b> may be alternatively or additionally affixed to the milling chuck <b>3510</b> by an adhesive disposed between the center peg <b>3540</b> and the prefabricated crown <b>3550</b>. In this way, the prefabricated crown <b>3550</b> may be spun within the milling machine as it is further milled by one or more burrs of the milling machine so as to obtain the desired size and shape.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">This modified chairside milling approach may be combined with the kit of prefabricated crowns described above with either any of the prefabricated crowns being suited for milling or additional items may be added to the kits to provide for more customizable crown shapes.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Colored Sleeves</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a kit of prefabricated sized and pigmented sleeves for use in conjunction with a set of prefabricated dental crown restorations, and a method for performing dental restorations using the same. According to this approach, a diseased or damaged tooth is prepared by drilling the affected tooth to a prepared state. Thereafter a selected prefabricated sleeve is installed onto the prepared tooth and a selected prefabricated crown is installed onto the sleeve. The sleeve is selected from a set of prefabricated sleeves in accordance with the size constraints of the prepared tooth and surrounding mouth as well as the desired color of the surrounding teeth, with a sleeve of a desired size being available for selection in one of a set of prefabricated pigmentation levels. The translucent and/or semi-opaque nature of the prefabricated crown allows for pigmentation of the selected sleeve to at least partially show through to an exterior surface of the crown thereby providing a desired pigmentation to the crown/sleeve combination that matches the surrounding teeth, without having to treat or otherwise apply coloring agents to the crown itself.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a system for performing dental crown restorations using prefabricated pigmented bushings/sleeves, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>A and <b>29</b>B</figref> includes detailed schematic views of a sleeve for use in the aforementioned dental crown restorations, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for dental crown restoration using prefabricated pigmented sleeves in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The patient may have one or more affected teeth. An affected tooth is one in which there is disease or damage, such as decay or other structural impairments, that required dental restoration. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, a diseased or otherwise damaged tooth <b>600</b> is illustrated. While the affected tooth <b>600</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> as including the tooth root, it is to be understood that the affected tooth <b>600</b> is within the mouth of the patient and the root is within the patient's gum line so that only a top portion of the affected tooth <b>600</b> is seen above the gumline. As is then shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, the affected tooth <b>600</b> is then prepared (Step S<b>3010</b>). Preparation of the affected tooth <b>600</b> includes drilling away as much diseased and/or structurally damaged tooth volume as necessary to arrive at a shape of a prepared tooth <b>610</b> that is substantially peg-like. The prepared tooth <b>610</b> may have a flat or domed top and may have a cylindrical or somewhat conical base that gets wider at points closer to the tooth root. The clinician may prepare the affected tooth <b>600</b> so as to comply with a shape of the dental sleeves and/or bushings (referred to herein more simply as &#x201c;sleeves&#x201d; <b>620</b>) that are part of the prefabricated sleeve kit, as will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Next, a size and shape of the desired crown <b>640</b> may be selected (Step S<b>3020</b>). This selection may be based on the size and spacing of the patient's mouth and the type of tooth that is being restored (e.g., incisor, cuspid, molar, etc.). The crown <b>640</b> of the desired size and shape may be selected from a kit of prefabricated crowns <b>640</b> of a plurality of different sizes and shapes. Each and every crown <b>640</b> of this kit may be substantially identical in color, being made of a translucent and/or semi-transparent material such as zirconium, or a different material such as nano-ceramics, lithium disilicate, etc. Each and every crown <b>640</b> of this kit may have a bottom surface hole/cavity of an identical size for accommodating each of the plurality of sleeves <b>620</b> of the sleeve kit, or the crowns <b>640</b> of the crown kit may have one of two, three, or four differently sized bottom surface holes/cavities for accommodating one of several differently sized sleeves <b>620</b>. However, for the purpose of providing a simplified explanation, it will be assumed that each and every crown <b>640</b> of this kit may have a bottom surface hole/cavity of an identical size for accommodating each of the plurality of sleeves <b>620</b> of the sleeve kit.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">After the desired crown <b>640</b> has been selected from the crown kit, a sleeve size may be selected from the sleeve kit according to the size of the prepared tooth <b>610</b>, and/or the size/shape of the desired crown <b>640</b> (Step S<b>3040</b>). The sleeve kit may include a set of prefabricated sleeves, organized by size, particularly, by prepared tooth size. For example, the diameter of the prepared tooth (e.g., a largest diameter, a smallest diameter, and/or an average diameter) may be measured and a table may be referred to showing which sleeve <b>620</b> to select for a given diameter of prepared tooth. For a given sleeve size, the sleeve kit may include sleeves of multiple different pigmentation levels, as sown by element <b>660</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">The desired final color of the crown restoration <b>640</b> may be determined by examining the surrounding teeth of the patient, for example, by referencing a set of printed colored cards against the patient's teeth or by using an electronic tooth color reader (Step S<b>3030</b>). A color table <b>3060</b> may then be referenced that provides a desired sleeve pigmentation level for a desired final color for the crown restoration <b>640</b> (Step S<b>3050</b>). As the crown <b>640</b> itself is translucent and/or semi-transparent, and as all crowns <b>640</b> of the crown kit are substantially identically colored, by using differently pigmented sleeves <b>660</b>, some color of the sleeve <b>620</b> will show through the exterior surface of the dental restoration <b>640</b> so as to give the restored tooth a desired color. As the degree to which sleeve pigmentation may show through the final restoration may vary depending on the size and shape of the selected crown <b>640</b>, the color table <b>3060</b> may take crown size and shape into account.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Once the desired sleeve size and pigmentation is known, a conforming prefabricated sleeve <b>620</b> may be selected from the sleeve kit that most closely matches the desired sleeve size and pigmentation (Step S<b>3070</b>).</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">The sleeve <b>620</b>, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, has an exterior surface and an interior surface (shown in broken lines). Each sleeve <b>620</b> of the sleeve kit may be constructed of a ceramic material, a plastic material, and/or a metal. The exterior surface of the sleeve <b>620</b> may be pigmented, as described above. This pigmentation may be painted, coated or glazed onto the exterior surface of the sleeve <b>620</b> during manufacture, or the material of the sleeve may be pigmented, after manufacture, according to the level of pigmentation for that particular sleeve <b>620</b>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">The exterior surface of the sleeve <b>620</b> may be uniformly pigmented or the exterior surface of the sleeve may be differentially pigmented with portions of the sleeve <b>620</b> that are designed to be covered by more volume of crown <b>640</b> being more heavily pigmented than portions of the sleeve <b>620</b> that are designed to be covered by less volume of crown <b>640</b>, so as to achieve a uniform pigmentation at a visible surface of the crown <b>640</b>. For example, as the base of the sleeve <b>620</b> may be covered by a relatively thin section of crown <b>640</b> and the top of the sleeve <b>620</b> may be covered by a relatively thick section of crown <b>640</b>, the sleeve <b>620</b> may be more heavily pigmented towards its top. However, this may be similarly the case for each level of pigmented sleeve <b>660</b> and so an average level of pigmentation may be higher for more heavily pigmented sleeves, even as each sleeve <b>620</b> itself may have a varied level of pigmentation.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The selected sleeve <b>620</b> may be installed onto the prepared tooth <b>610</b>, for example, by mating the bottom opening of the sleeve to the prepared tooth <b>610</b> and applying bonding agent between the prepared tooth <b>610</b> and selected sleeve <b>620</b> and then curing the bonding agent (Step S<b>3080</b>). In this way, the selected sleeve <b>620</b> may be installed to the prepared tooth <b>610</b> so as to arrive at a sleeved tooth <b>630</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">The selected crown <b>640</b>, which has an opening that substantially conforms to the shape of the top of the sleeve <b>620</b>, may then be bonded to the sleeved tooth <b>630</b>, for example, using a bonding agent that is substantially transparent/translucent (Step S<b>3090</b>). The substantially transparent/translucent bonding agent may be one that cures substantially transparent/translucent. However, where the bonding agent is known to cure partially transparent/translucent, this may be taken into account in the color table <b>3060</b> so as to use a more heavily pigmented sleeve <b>620</b> for a given final restoration color. It is to be understood, however, that the same bonding agent may be used for all such restorations, without regard to the desired color appearance of the finished restoration, so as to simplify installation and lessen the possibility of error. Moreover, the same bonding agent may be used to bond the sleeve <b>620</b> to the prepared tooth <b>610</b> so as to simplify installation, even as the color of the bonding agent used between the prepared tooth and the sleeve might not be relevant to the appearance of the finished restoration.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Installation may include applying the bonding agent between sleeved tooth <b>630</b> and crown <b>640</b> and curing the bonding agent once the crown <b>640</b> is in place so as to arrive at the crowned tooth <b>650</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>. While the present invention is described in terms of bonding the sleeve <b>620</b> to the prepared tooth <b>610</b> before bonding the crown <b>640</b> to the sleeved tooth <b>630</b>, this order may be reversed and the crown <b>640</b> may first be bonded to the sleeve <b>620</b> and then the crowned sleeve may be bonded to the prepared tooth <b>610</b>.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">While the shape of the sleeve <b>620</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> as being substantially cylindrical, this shape is offered as an example. It is to be understood that the sleeve <b>620</b> may have a dome shape, a narrow dome shape (e.g., semi-ovaloid), a domed shape that narrows from base to top (narrowing dome), or a substantially cylindrical shape that is capped by a dome or narrow/narrowing dome. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref>, the sleeve <b>620</b> may have a smaller diameter towards the top <b>623</b> than towards the bottom <b>621</b>. While the sleeve shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref> is discontinuous having an abrupt change of diameter <b>622</b> from a thick section to a thin section, this transition may be gradual so as to achieve one of the above-described shapes.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Also as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>B</figref>, the underside of the sleeve <b>620</b> may include an opening hole <b>625</b> for receiving the prepared tooth <b>610</b>.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Shaded Crowns</heading><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an approach for performing a dental crown restoration in a single sitting. This may be performed at least in one of three ways. According to the first approach, the patient's tooth may be prepared by grinding the outer surface of the tooth to remove decayed or cracked portions of the tooth. This may result in a prepared tooth having a post-shape. Thereafter, an appropriately sized prefabricated sleeve may be filled with a dental cement and placed upon the prepared tooth. The dental cement may be cured through the sleeve using a light source. The sleeve may be at least partially translucent to light that may be used to cure the cement and so the cement may be easily cured through the sleeve. Thereafter, an appropriately sized prefabricated crown may be adhered to the sleeve using dental cement or some other adhesive, thereby creating a permanent dental restoration.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">According to the second approach, the sleeve may be omitted and an appropriately sized prefabricated crown may be directly adhered to the prepared tooth.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">According to the third approach, an entirety of the tooth may be extracted and an implant may be inserted through the gums and into the jawbone of the patient. An abutment may be placed on the dental implant and an appropriately sized prefabricated crown may be adhered to the abutment.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">In each of these approaches, a prefabricated crown may be used. As it is not feasible to keep an unlimited number of differently sized and shaped prefabricated crowns on hand, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method and process for sizing and fabricating a limited number of crowns that are well suited for use in the mouths of a majority of patients without requiring undue cutting or polishing of the prefabricated crown so that a patient may receive a single-visit dental restoration that is at least as good as a lab-made custom dental crown in terms of both function and aesthetics.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating an approach for sizing and producing dental crowns for use in single-visit dental restorations in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. First, data of actual sizes of patient's teeth may be acquired (Step S<b>3110</b>). This data may be acquired on the basis of tooth type. As there are four types of human teeth (i.e., incisors, canines, premolars and molars), data may be separately acquired for each of these tooth types. Alternatively, data may be acquired separately on the basis of tooth sub-type including central incisor, lateral incisor, canine, first premolar, second premolar, first molar, second molar, and third molar or wisdom teeth. Alternatively, data may be acquired separately on the basis of individual teeth.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">In acquiring size data for each tooth type/subtype/individual tooth, various size parameters may be measured. These size parameters may include: (1) the buccal-lingual distance (e.g., the thickness of the tooth from buccal to lingual), (2) the mesial-distal distance (e.g., the width of the tooth from mesial to distal), (3) the occlusal distance (e.g., the height of the tooth measured from the cervix to the cusps), and (4) the cervical margin (e.g., the circumference of the tooth at the cervix). However, this list is not intended to be exhaustive and other size parameters may be used.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">This data may be acquired automatically from analyzing intra-oral images or digital scans of physical shape models (e.g., taken from impressions). Computer vision techniques may be used to identify key landmarks for each tooth in 3D space, such as the buccal edge, the lingual edge, the mesial edge, the occlusal edge, the cervical margin, the cusps, etc. and measurements may be made, and data collected, electronically.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">After the data has been acquired, the data may be analyzed to develop average ratios between each of these size parameters (Step S<b>3111</b>). This may be performed by looking at the size parameters of each tooth and determining a ratio of each size parameter to a single size parameter. For example, the chosen single size parameter may be the mesial-distal distance. In this example, a ratio of mesial-distal distance to each of the other size parameters may be measured. Then, for each tooth of the data, the same set of ratios may be determined and averaged together to determine an average ratio between mesial-distal distance to each of the other size parameter. For example, an average ratio between mesial-distal distance to buccal-lingual distance may be gleaned, an average ratio between mesial-distal distance to occlusal distance may be gleaned, an average ratio between mesial-distal distance to cervical margin may be gleaned. By finding each of these average ratios over a very large data set (for example, from thousands of intra-oral images), tooth size may be understood by using only this selected single size parameter (here, mesial-distal distance, although it is to be understood that any of the size parameters may be used as the selected single size parameter). As these average ratios are calculated on a per-tooth basis (or per tooth type or tooth sub-type), the size of any given tooth may be characterized by only its single size parameter (e.g., the mesial-distal distance) and the known ratios to the other average size parameters.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Then, for each tooth type/subtype/individual tooth, the selected single size parameter may be plotted for all of the data. This may create a Gaussian distribution of the data, as may be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> which is a plot of the selected single size parameter (here, the mesial-distal distance). As can be seen from this graph, the average value for the selected single size parameter may be found at the center of the Gaussian distribution. From there, one or more additional sizes may be selected. As shown in this example, two additional larger sizes and two additional smaller sizes are selected so as to arrive at 5 total sizes. Each size has an associated group and each data point of the tooth size data that falls within one of these 5 groups.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">The placement of the additional sizes may be made based on a predetermined number of standard deviations from the average. For example, the first smaller size may be selected as &#x2212;1 standard deviation from the average, the second smaller size may be selected as &#x2212;2 standard deviations from the average, the first larger size may be selected as +1 standard deviation from the average, and the second larger size may be selected as +2 standard deviations from the average. Thus, a given number of values (here, 5) for the selected single size parameter (here, mesial-distal distance) may be selected based on a distribution plot of the data by tooth type/subtype/individual tooth (Step S<b>3112</b>).</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">It is understood that as it is better for a prefabricated crown to be slightly bigger than ideal than to be slightly smaller than ideal (as a crown that is a little too large can be trimmed or polished), each of the selected values may be enlarged (Step S<b>3113</b>). Therefore, the average group tooth size (measured by the selected single size parameter) may be slightly larger than the average value, the first smaller size may be slightly larger than &#x2212;1 standard deviation from average, the second smaller size may be slightly larger than &#x2212;2 standard deviations from average, the first larger size may be slightly larger than +1 standard deviation from average, and the second larger size may be slightly larger than +2 standard deviations from average. Enlargement may be based on a fixed amount (e.g., each value is enlarged by 2 mm) or enlargement may be based on the distribution curve (e.g., each value is enlarged by 0.2 standard deviations).</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Alternatively, each crown may be enlarged by a fixed percentage of size. For example, each crown may be enlarged by 2%.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">Next, for each tooth type/subtype/individual tooth, the enlarged selected values of the single selected size parameter may be used to develop a CAD image for a set of crowns to be prefabricated (Step S<b>3114</b>). This may be performed by starting with the enlarged selected value (which may be, for example, a mesial-distal distance) and using the set of average ratios to determine a full set of corresponding size parameters for each enlarged selected values of the single selected size parameter. For example, the average ratio of mesial-distal distance to buccal-lingual distance may be used to calculate a buccal-lingual distance that corresponds to the average selected size parameter. This may be performed for all of the selected values and all of the size parameters so for each enlarged selected size value (e.g., all 5) there is a full set of size parameters that have been calculated using the set of average ratios.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">In constructing the CAD images, the size parameters may be used to perform a rigid or elastic deformation on a basic shape model. There may be one basic shape model created for each tooth type/subtype/individual tooth. The basic shape model may be constructed by digitally averaging the topography of a large set of images of teeth of the particular tooth type/subtype/individual tooth captured from intra-oral scans of a large number of subjects or digital scans of physical shape models (e.g., taken from impressions). This process may be performed using finite element analysis (FEA) using a computer application such as SOLIDWORKS, a solid modeling computer aided design (CAD) program published by Dassault Syst&#xe9;mes. The result of this process is to obtain a basic shape model that includes smooth cusps and pits.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">Thereafter, each of the constructed CAD models may be modified for injection molding</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">(Step S<b>3115</b>). This may include automatically editing the CAD model so as to change features that would be incompatible with certain injection molding techniques. These edits may include: (1) in corner design, making an outside radius of curvature one wall thickness larger than an inside radius of curvature so as to maintain a constant wall thickness through the corners, (2) convert abrupt steps to curves, (3) edit angles to better alight walls parallel to a direction of mold separation, (4) reduce or remove concavities that may make the cervical diameter smaller than a diameter of the crown closer to the cusps, and (5) edit the geometry of the cusps and pits of the crown to make sure pits do not widen in a direction towards the cervix.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Upon editing the CAD models to account for injection molding concerns, the crowns may be manufactured, in each size, for example, by injection molding (Step S<b>3116</b>). Alternatively, other approaches may be used to manufacture the crowns such as by 3D printing, milling, etc., and where injection molding is not used, the step of modifying the CAD model for injection molding may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">The process of manufacturing the crowns in all sizes may be repeated using different materials having different levels of pigment so that the end result, as may be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, is a kit of prefabricated crowns in a plurality of different sizes and pigment levels. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> shows such a kit produced for use in restoring molars, however, similar kits may also be manufactured for other types of teeth.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, there may be multiple sets of prefabricated crowns for one tooth type, here shown as molars. A first set <b>700</b> may be prefabricated for a first shade level.

Then, when a patient presents at the office of a dentist for a dental restoration, the selected size parameter, for example, the mesial-distal distance, may be measured in the patient for the tooth being restored (Step S<b>3117</b>). A prefabricated tooth may then be selected from the kit based on the measured selected size parameter (Step S<b>3118</b>), for example, using a size guide that references ranges of the selected size parameter for each prefabricated crown size. This step may alternatively be performed automatically by taking an intra-oral scan of the patient's mouth, measuring the mesial-distal distance of the affected tooth, and referencing a size guide table to select a particular prefabricated crown size and display the selected size to the dentist.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">Also, at this step, the pigment of the patient's teeth may be assessed, either by using color cards or automatically by analyzing the intra-oral scan taken when determining the crown size to use. As the kit of prefabricated crowns may only include a particular number of different pigments, for example, 3, 4, or 5 different pigments, a closest available pigment may be selected from among the prefabricated crowns of the kit. Alternatively, the kit might only include prefabricated crowns of one particular color and the pigment of the crown may be adapted by applying a coloring agent to the prefabricated crown.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">After the desired prefabricated crown has been selected from the kit, the dentist may perform the restoration using the selected crown (Step S<b>3119</b>). This may include, for example, preparing the patient's tooth by grinding away the affected tissue until the tooth has a peg-shape, affixing a sleeve to the prepared tooth, and then cementing the prefabricated crown to the sleeve. Alternatively, the sleeve may be omitted and the selected prefabricated tooth may be cemented directly to the prepared tooth. Alternatively, the tooth may be removed, an implant may be inserted into the patient's mouth, an abutment may be mounted on the implant, and the selected prefabricated crown may be affixed to the abutment.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">As mentioned above, the process of selecting a prefabricated tooth may be performed automatically from an intra-oral scan using an arrangement such as the computer system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>. An intra-oral scanner <b>3408</b> may be used to acquire the intra-oral scan. The intra-oral scanner <b>3408</b> may be connected to a computer system either by a wired connection, for example, using a USB cable, or by a wireless connection such as Bluetooth or WiFi. The computer system may then analyze the intra-oral scan using a CPU <b>3402</b> in conjunction with RAM <b>3403</b> and other computer components which may all be connected to each other along one or more communications busses <b>3400</b>. The computer system may analyze the intra-oral scan to determine crown size and pigment, as described above, using a computer vision application that is stored in a storage unit <b>3401</b> such as an SSD or HDD. The aforementioned size guide table may also be stored within this, or another, storage unit <b>3401</b>. The computer system may display a name or reference number of the selected prefabricated crown using a GPU <b>3404</b> and display device <b>3406</b>. The computer system may additionally include a network adapter <b>3405</b> to connect to a computer network <b>3407</b> such as a local area network LAN or a wide area network WAN such as the Internet so that, for example, the selected prefabricated crown may be displayed on a connected device, such as a small display incorporated into the intra-oral scanner or a smartphone/smartwatch carried by the dentist.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">Exemplary embodiments described herein are illustrative, and many variations can be introduced without departing from the spirit of the disclosure or from the scope of the appended claims.
