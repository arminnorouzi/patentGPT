id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present utility model relates to the field of daily appliances, and more particularly a push-button locking cup lid with double sealing valve structure, and a thermos cup.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Currently, the thermos cup in the prior art comprises a cup body and a lid arranged on an opening part of the cup body; this kind of lid is usually provided with a water outlet valve on its top part. When the water outlet valve is opened, both steam and water are discharged from the water outlet valve, and thus often cause injury to users due to the discharge of steam, while it is also inconvenient to operate. Therefore, a Chinese utility model CN204363611U (application no. 201420871559.7) has disclosed a cup lid with double sealing valves, and a thermos cup, wherein a water outlet valve and a steam outlet valve operate asynchronously, so that steam and water can be discharged at separate times and directions, thereby avoiding injury to users caused by the discharge of high temperature steam; however, as the valves can be opened by pressing a button, users may be burnt accidentally when the button is pressed by mistake. Therefore, this kind of thermos cup is not suitable for carrying in a handbag.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is an object of the present utility model to provide a push-button locking cup lid, and a thermos cup, which can avoid accidental discharges of steam or water caused by unintended presses against a button rod.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To attain the above object, the present utility model provides the following technical solutions: A push-button locking cup lid, comprising a top lid, an inner plug, and a double sealing valve structure mounted inside the top lid; a water outlet and a steam outlet are provided respectively on the top lid and the inner plug; wherein the double sealing valve structure comprises a button rod, a water outlet valve rod configured to open or close the water outlet, a steam outlet valve rod configured to open or close the steam outlet, a front spring, a rear spring, and a spring mounting box fixedly connected to the top lid; a first end of the water outlet valve rod is provided with an axial hole; two symmetrical holes are provided on a wall of the axial hole; a first end of the steam outlet valve rod is inserted into the axial hole; a position limiting pin is connected to the first end of the steam outlet valve rod; two ends of the position limiting pin pass through the two holes respectively; two ends of the front spring are fixedly connected to an inner front side wall of the spring mounting box and the position limiting pin respectively; two ends of the rear spring are fixedly connected to an inner rear side wall of the spring mounting box and the position limiting pin respectively; a water sealing silicone and a steam sealing silicone are provided on the water outlet valve rod and the steam outlet valve rod respectively; a middle part of the button rod is articulated to the top lid, and an upper end part of the button rod is articulated to a second end of the steam outlet valve rod; a side wall of the top lid which aligns with the button rod is provided with a slider switch which is capable of being moved up and down; a blocker is provided on the slider switch to block the second end of the steam outlet valve rod.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, the top lid comprises a lid body and a side lid connected to the lid body; a vertical groove is provided on the side lid; the slider switch is slidably mounted in the vertical groove.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, a dust-proof inner lid is detachably arranged on the inner plug, and a rubber cushion is provided between the inner plug and the dust-proof inner lid.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present utility model further discloses a thermos cup, comprising a cup body and the push-button locking cup lid discussed above; the cup body and the push-button locking cup lid are in threaded connection.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The beneficial effects of the present utility model include: as the double sealing valve structure and the slider switch are provided, the slider switch is configured to lock the button rod, so that the double sealing valve structure is in a locked status, which will not lead to leakage of liquid from the cup body by accidentally pressing the button rod under any circumstances, thereby enhancing customers' experience. Meanwhile, as the steam outlet valve rod and the water outlet valve rod are driven to move asynchronously, during a single pressing progress, the steam is first discharged, and then the water, so as to prevent injury to consumers caused by the discharge of high temperature steam, thereby ensuring consumers' safety.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a sectional view of the cup lid of the present utility model connected to the cup body.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic view of the steam outlet valve rod of the present utility model in a locked status.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic view of the steam outlet valve rod of the present utility model in an unlocked status to discharge steam.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic view of the steam outlet valve rod of the present utility model in an unlocked status to discharge both steam and water.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a schematic view of the steam outlet valve rod as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> being moved to open only the steam outlet.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a schematic view of the steam outlet and the water outlet as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> both in an opened status.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a schematic view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> in a condition of pouring out liquid.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a schematic view of the dust-proof inner lid in a disassembled status.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For those of ordinary skill in the art to better understand the technical solutions of the present utility model, the following will describe in detail the present utility model with reference to the accompanying drawings and embodiments.
