However, the first assignment of numerical weights of the expert system <b>104</b> also assigns a numerical weight along a linear scale to each of the qualitative axis delimiters, namely the &#x201c;simple,&#x201d; &#x201c;moderate,&#x201d; and &#x201c;complex&#x201d; delimiters on the x-axis <b>302</b> and the &#x201c;low,&#x201d; &#x201c;moderate,&#x201d; and &#x201c;high&#x201d; delimiters on the y-axis <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment, the first assignment of numerical weights by the expert system <b>104</b> assigns to the delimiters of the x-axis <b>302</b> and y-axis <b>304</b> the same linear numeral range that is assigned to the first set of predefined answers.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As an example, with the first set of predefined answers being &#x201c;Low&#x201d; with an assigned numerical weight of one (1), &#x201c;Medium&#x201d; with an assigned numeral weight of two (2), and &#x201c;High&#x201d; with an assigned numeral weight of three (3), the x-axis <b>302</b> delimiters are &#x201c;simple&#x201d; with an assigned a numerical weight of one (1), &#x201c;moderate&#x201d; with an assigned weight of two (2), and &#x201c;complex&#x201d; with an assigned weight of three (3).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Similarly, the y-axis <b>304</b> delimiters are &#x201c;low&#x201d; with an assigned weight of one (1), &#x201c;moderate&#x201d; with an assigned weight of two (2), and &#x201c;high&#x201d; with an assigned weight of three (3).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The Kraljic matrix <b>300</b> includes four quadrants centered around the intersection of the midpoints <b>310</b>, <b>316</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The first quadrant is labeled &#x201c;leverage&#x201d; <b>318</b> and represents procurement categories which have a high value and a low supply market complexity risk. The purchaser possesses power in this purchaser and supplier relationship and should leverage this strength. Suppliers can be easily substituted as their offerings are much the same. Traditionally, procurement professionals have exploited this status to lower prices.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The second quadrant is labeled &#x201c;strategic&#x201d; <b>320</b> and represents procurement categories which have high supplier risk based on supply market complexity and a high value. The suppliers are critical to the purchaser's business. These procurement categories usually represent only a couple of suppliers, but ensuring an effective and predictable supplier relationship is key to the future of the purchaser's company. Typical strategies within such a procurement category are changing the nature of demand using proactive development and innovation and establishing a partnership with the supplier. Managing strategic suppliers can consume a significant proportion of executive time in sponsoring and directing the purchaser and supplier relationship.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The third quadrant is labeled &#x201c;non-critical&#x201d; <b>322</b> and represents procurement categories which have low risk relative to supply market complexity and low value. One example of such a procurement category is office supplies. Although office supplies are important for employees in everyday work, pens, and paper will have a negligible impact on the purchaser's business. A shortage of office supplies will not represent a serious threat. Strategies deployed within such a procurement category focus on efficiency and reducing administrative burden. The responsibilities can be redirected to suppliers or to internal customers that are requisitioning the goods.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Lastly, the fourth quadrant is labeled &#x201c;bottleneck&#x201d; <b>324</b> and represents procurement categories with a high risk relative to supply market complexity and a low value. In this procurement category, the power is on the side of the supplier. The market usually consists of few suppliers that can behave in an oligopolistic manner and to dictate upward price development. The purchaser's relationship with the supplier is demanding, even though suppliers have a limited impact on the purchaser's company profitability. This market structure may force purchasers to accept unfavorable deals. Typical strategy approaches within this procurement category include damage control and changing the nature of demand. Innovative internal activities can redevelop end product and service requirements such that the procurement category can be replaced with a substitute, preferably sourced from a leverage supplier.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">To determine a purchaser's quadrant within the Kraljic matrix <b>300</b>, the Kraljic matrix engine <b>114</b> first determines a value for the supply market complexity axis <b>302</b>.
