As used herein, unless otherwise stated, the term &#x201c;above&#x201d; describes the relationship of two parts relative to Earth. A first part is above a second part, if the second part has at least one part between Earth and the first part. Likewise, as used herein, a first part is &#x201c;below&#x201d; a second part when the first part is closer to the Earth than the second part. As noted above, a first part can be above or below a second part with one or more of: other parts therebetween, without other parts therebetween, with the first and second parts touching, or without the first and second parts being in direct contact with one another.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used in this patent, stating that any part (e.g., a layer, film, area, region, or plate) is in any way on (e.g., positioned on, located on, disposed on, or formed on, etc.) another part, indicates that the referenced part is either in contact with the other part, or that the referenced part is above the other part with one or more intermediate part(s) located therebetween. As used herein, connection references (e.g., attached, coupled, connected, and joined) may include intermediate members between the elements referenced by the connection reference and/or relative movement between those elements unless otherwise indicated. As such, connection references do not necessarily infer that two elements are directly connected and/or in fixed relation to each other. As used herein, stating that any part is in &#x201c;contact&#x201d; with another part is defined to mean that there is no intermediate part between the two parts.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Unless specifically stated otherwise, descriptors such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; &#x201c;third,&#x201d; etc., are used herein without imputing or otherwise indicating any meaning of priority, physical order, arrangement in a list, and/or ordering in any way, but are merely used as labels and/or arbitrary names to distinguish elements for ease of understanding the disclosed examples. In some examples, the descriptor &#x201c;first&#x201d; may be used to refer to an element in the detailed description, while the same element may be referred to in a claim with a different descriptor such as &#x201c;second&#x201d; or &#x201c;third.&#x201d; In such instances, it should be understood that such descriptors are used merely for identifying those elements distinctly that might, for example, otherwise share a same name.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; and &#x201c;about&#x201d; refer to dimensions that may not be exact due to manufacturing tolerances and/or other real world imperfections. As used herein &#x201c;substantially real time&#x201d; refers to occurrence in a near instantaneous manner recognizing there may be real world delays for computing time, transmission, etc. Thus, unless otherwise specified, &#x201c;substantially real time&#x201d; refers to real time +/&#x2212;1 second. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;in communication,&#x201d; including variations thereof, encompasses direct communication and/or indirect communication through one or more intermediary components, and does not require direct physical (e.g., wired) communication and/or constant communication, but rather additionally includes selective communication at periodic intervals, scheduled intervals, aperiodic intervals, and/or one-time events.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, &#x201c;processor circuitry&#x201d; is defined to include (i) one or more special purpose electrical circuits structured to perform specific operation(s) and including one or more semiconductor-based logic devices (e.g., electrical hardware implemented by one or more transistors), and/or (ii) one or more general purpose semiconductor-based electrical circuits programmed with instructions to perform specific operations and including one or more semiconductor-based logic devices (e.g., electrical hardware implemented by one or more transistors). Examples of processor circuitry include programmed microprocessors, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that may instantiate instructions, Central Processor Units (CPUs), Graphics Processor Units (GPUs), Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), XPUs, or microcontrollers and integrated circuits such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). For example, an XPU may be implemented by a heterogeneous computing system including multiple types of processor circuitry (e.g., one or more FPGAs, one or more CPUs, one or more GPUs, one or more DSPs, etc., and/or a combination thereof) and application programming interface(s) (API(s)) that may assign computing task(s) to whichever one(s) of the multiple types of the processing circuitry is/are best suited to execute the computing task(s).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Automation of agricultural vehicles is commercially desirable because automation can improve the accuracy with which operations are performed, reduce operator fatigue, improve efficiency, and accrue other benefits. Some automated vehicles include and/or are otherwise enabled for automation functionality, but the user may need to engage and/or disengage the automation functionality. For example, a user could switch a vehicle into an autonomous mode of operation, but the vehicle would not autonomously drive until the user presses a button or toggles a switch to &#x201c;engage&#x201d; automation. As such, the vehicle can be referred to as being in a &#x201c;standby&#x201d; autonomous mode of operation when automation is enabled but not engaged and in a &#x201c;fully&#x201d; autonomous mode of operation when automation is enabled and engaged. In either standby autonomous mode or fully autonomous mode, a user may be present within the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Whether in standby autonomous mode or fully autonomous mode, autonomous vehicles include one or more controllers to ensure that the autonomous vehicles traverse terrain properly. In examples disclosed herein, automated vehicles follow guidance paths when in fully autonomous mode. A controller may have many different modes of operation including an acquisition mode of operation and a tracking mode of operation. As used herein, &#x201c;tracking,&#x201d; &#x201c;tracking mode,&#x201d; &#x201c;tracking mode of operation,&#x201d; and/or their derivatives refer to following and/or tracking a guidance path (e.g., in a fully autonomous mode). As used herein, &#x201c;acquisition,&#x201d; &#x201c;acquisition mode,&#x201d; &#x201c;acquisition mode of operation,&#x201d; and/or their derivatives refer to operation when the vehicle is travelling to a guidance path, a path, and/or acquiring a position that is substantially similar to (e.g., within one meter of, within a half meter of, within two meters of, etc.) a guidance path. The path a vehicle takes or may take during acquisition mode is referred to herein as &#x201c;an acquisition path,&#x201d; and &#x201c;an acquisition line,&#x201d; among others.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Guidance paths (e.g., target paths) are used by a navigation and/or location apparatus (e.g., a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver) and a controller in tracking mode to cause a vehicle to follow a prescribed path. In some examples, the prescribed path includes turns, curves, etc., for the vehicle to follow when operating in a field. Conventional controllers, sometimes referred to as guidance systems, allow users of a vehicle to specify a guidance path for the vehicle in the cab. In examples disclosed herein, the heading of a vehicle, also referred to as the yaw of the vehicle, is defined as the direction in which the vehicle is pointing. For example, the heading can be drawn by a straight line, starting from the front of the vehicle and extending in the direction the vehicle is traveling.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Some known guidance systems generate acquisition paths that are not based on a current curvature and/or maneuverability of the vehicle. As such, the acquisition paths generated by some known guidance systems require the vehicle to make sudden and/or rapid changes in direction, which may result in jerking motion of the vehicle and/or an inability of the vehicle to track the acquisition path.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Examples disclosed herein generate example acquisition paths that enable a vehicle to make smooth transitions from a current position to a target path. Examples disclosed herein obtain example input data associated with a vehicle, where the input data includes at least one of the current position, a current heading, a current speed, a wheel angle, a wheel angle rate, or a wheelbase of the vehicle. Examples disclosed herein calculate a threshold curvature and threshold curvature rate based on the input data, and generate one or more acquisition paths between the current position and an acquisition point on the target path that satisfy the threshold curvature and the threshold curvature rate.

For example, the order of execution of the blocks may be changed, and/or some of the blocks described may be changed, eliminated, or combined. Additionally or alternatively, any or all of the blocks may be implemented by one or more hardware circuits (e.g., processor circuitry, discrete and/or integrated analog and/or digital circuitry, an FPGA, an ASIC, a comparator, an operational-amplifier (op-amp), a logic circuit, etc.) structured to perform the corresponding operation without executing software or firmware. The processor circuitry may be distributed in different network locations and/or local to one or more hardware devices (e.g., a single-core processor (e.g., a single core central processor unit (CPU)), a multi-core processor (e.g., a multi-core CPU), etc.) in a single machine, multiple processors distributed across multiple servers of a server rack, multiple processors distributed across one or more server racks, a CPU and/or a FPGA located in the same package (e.g., the same integrated circuit (IC) package or in two or more separate housings, etc).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">The machine readable instructions described herein may be stored in one or more of a compressed format, an encrypted format, a fragmented format, a compiled format, an executable format, a packaged format, etc. Machine readable instructions as described herein may be stored as data or a data structure (e.g., as portions of instructions, code, representations of code, etc.) that may be utilized to create, manufacture, and/or produce machine executable instructions. For example, the machine readable instructions may be fragmented and stored on one or more storage devices and/or computing devices (e.g., servers) located at the same or different locations of a network or collection of networks (e.g., in the cloud, in edge devices, etc.). The machine readable instructions may require one or more of installation, modification, adaptation, updating, combining, supplementing, configuring, decryption, decompression, unpacking, distribution, reassignment, compilation, etc., in order to make them directly readable, interpretable, and/or executable by a computing device and/or other machine. For example, the machine readable instructions may be stored in multiple parts, which are individually compressed, encrypted, and/or stored on separate computing devices, wherein the parts when decrypted, decompressed, and/or combined form a set of machine executable instructions that implement one or more operations that may together form a program such as that described herein.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">In another example, the machine readable instructions may be stored in a state in which they may be read by processor circuitry, but require addition of a library (e.g., a dynamic link library (DLL)), a software development kit (SDK), an application programming interface (API), etc., in order to execute the machine readable instructions on a particular computing device or other device. In another example, the machine readable instructions may need to be configured (e.g., settings stored, data input, network addresses recorded, etc.) before the machine readable instructions and/or the corresponding program(s) can be executed in whole or in part.
