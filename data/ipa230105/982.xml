num="0000">The syntheses of two phosphoramidite building blocks based on BNSF and BNSMB structures are disclosed. Furthermore, some common molecular intermediates have been designed and linked to the central biphenyl core of the two molecules, resulting in a versatile and cost-effective design. These compounds can be effectively introduced to DNA oligonucleotides via the well-established standard cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry on the nucleic acid synthesizer. Fragmentation of these BNSF- and BNSMB-functionalized DNA strands is achieved by both one-photon and two-photon photolysis of photoliable bonds of [2-(2-nitrophenyl)propoxy]carbonyl groups on BNSF and BNSMB molecules respectively, resulting in two short pieces of single-stranded DNAs. The versatile design and facile synthesis of these two-photon photocleavage phosphoramidite molecules are beneficial to synthetic chemists and photochemists for the development of new caged compounds which enables to introduce into oligonucleotides as light-triggered carriers via solid-phase synthesis for a wide range of applications in materials science, polymer, chemistry, biology and DNA nanoecthnology.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="111.93mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230000983A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded

of biomolecules is &#x201c;turned off&#x201d; before reaching the sites of interest and then turned back &#x201c;on&#x201d; in response to an external stimulus. The addition of small molecules or enzymes, pH or temperature variation, ultrasound or magnetic field utilization, and photon irradiation have been used as external stimuli to trigger stimuli-responsive systems switching from &#x201c;off&#x201d; to &#x201c;on&#x201d; state. Of these methods, photo-control (e.g., photoirradiation) has a number of advantages over other external stimuli as light does not introduce contaminants into the reaction system.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Once a photo-responsive molecule is directly attached to oligonucleotides as a receptor, photo-regulation of the biological process regulated by that biomacromolecule could be achieved.

Herein a PCM refers to a molecule which when exposed to an appropriate source of electromagnetic radiation chemically disassociates from the biomolecule. Chemical disassociation of the PCM, for example by lysis of a chemical bond between the PCM and biomolecule, may allow the biomolecule to express its functionality or activity.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A PCM of the present disclosure comprises a 2,7-bis-(4-nitro-8-(3-(2-propyl)-styryl))-9,9-bis-(1-(3,6-dioxaheptyl))-fluorene (BNSF) group, a 4,4&#x2032;-bis-(8-(4-nitro-3-(2-propyl)-styryl))-3,3&#x2032;-dimethoxybiphenyl (BNSMB) group or a combination thereof.

They can be effectively introduced to DNA oligonucleotides via the well-established standard cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry on a nucleic acid synthesizer. Additionally, fragmentation of these BNSF- and BNSMB-functionalized DNA strands is achieved by both one-photon and two-photon photolysis of photoliable bonds of [2-(2-nitrophenyl)propoxy]carbonyl groups on the BNSF and BNSMB molecules respectively, resulting in two short pieces of single-stranded DNAs. The versatile design and facile synthesis of these two-photon photocleavage phosphoramidite molecules are beneficial to synthetic chemists and photochemists for the development of new caged compounds. These methodologies may enable the introduction of oligonucleotides as light-triggered carriers via solid-phase synthesis for a wide range of applications in materials science, polymer, biology, chemistry and DNA nanotechnology.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">The PCM-biomolecule conjugate is photocleavable. The photocleavable property of the PCM is within a two-photon excitation region which is beneficial to biological systems. The two-photon excitation region is a longer wavelength light source with lower energy which would allow for deeper tissue penetration, less photodamage to the living cells/tissues and three-dimensional control with femtoliter resolution.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">Furthermore, the present disclosure provides PCMs that can be applied in different linker strategies for regulating oligonucleotide activity with low energy light sources such as near infrared (NIR) light and widely used in biological systems. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, functional oligonucleotides can be deactivated by photocleavage into smaller fragments (a). In contrast, they can be activated by photo-induced cleavage of an intermolecular inhibitor nucleic acid (b). Alternatively, a circularized oligonucleotide can be activated by photocleavage into a linear, single-stranded oligonucleotide for further action (c).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">A PCM-biomolecule conjugate of the type disclosed herein provides for photo-release of materials such as therapeutic agents for disease treatment, siRNAs, miRNAs, and antisense oligonucleotides for light-controlled gene expression. In another aspect, a PCM-biomolecule conjugate of the type disclosed herein provides a building block for self-assembly of photo-responsive DNA-based nanocarriers for precise control over light-triggered drug/CRISPR-Cas9 release in living system for delivery applications/CRISPR editing. Herein CRISPR/Cas9 refers to a system that edits genes by precisely cutting DNA and then letting natural DNA repair processes to take over. In yet another aspect, the PCM-biomolecule conjugate of the present disclosure provides a tool to build light activated logic gate systems for data storage. In yet another aspect, the PCM-biomolecule conjugate provides for immobilization of photocleavable DNA strands on biochip for photopatterning and photolithography. In yet another aspect, a PCM-biomolecule conjugate of the type disclosed herein is a tool for two photon activation and imaging of live tissues</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">The PCM-biomolecule conjugates of the present disclosure may be used in the treatment of a disease or medical condition. Typically, the PCM-biomolecule conjugate is administered in an effective amount to a patient or subject in need thereof. Optionally, the PCM-biomolecule conjugates of this disclosure are prepared into a composition or formulation for administration to a subject.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">The PCMs of the present disclosure can be effectively introduced to DNA oligonucleotides via cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry using a nucleic acid synthesizer. In an aspect, fragmentation of a PCM (e.g., BNSF- and BNSMB-functionalized DNA strands) is achieved by one-photon photolysis. In an alternative aspect, fragmentation of these PCM (e.g., BNSF- and BNSMB-functionalized DNA strands) is achieved by two-photon photolysis. For example, photolysis of photoliable bonds of the [2-(2-nitrophenyl)propoxy]carbonyl groups on BNSF and BNSMB molecules respectively, resulting in two short pieces of single-stranded DNAs. The versatile design and facile synthesis of these two-photon photocleavage phosphoramidite molecules are beneficial to synthetic chemists and photochemists for the development of new caged compounds which enables to introduce into oligonucleotides as light-triggered carriers via solid-phase synthesis for a wide range of applications in materials science, polymer, biology, chemistry and DNA nanotechnology.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0065">The presently disclosed subject matter having been generally described, the following examples are given as particular aspects of the subject matter and to demonstrate the practice and advantages thereof.

Commercially available DNA nucleoside phosphoramidites, BNSF phosphoramidite and BNSMB phosphoramidite were site-specifically coupled onto the growing oligonucleotides chain as an artificial base with a prolonged detritylation and coupling time. To synthesize the photocleavable DNA oligonucleotides in a quantitative yield and with high purity, the synthetic protocol is optimized accordingly from standard method recommended by the synthesizer manufacturer. For instance, in each synthetic cycle, the frequencies of the de-blocking and coupling reactions are increased by 3 and 2 times, respectively. Additionally, the duration of each de-blocking reaction is extended from 30 s to 12 min while the duration of each coupling reaction is also extended from 60 s to 15 min. The coupling efficiency was monitored by the trityl concentration level. The DNA oligonucleotides were fully deprotected in concentrated ammonium hydroxide at 55&#xb0; C. for 48 h.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">Crude DNA oligonucleotides were purified on 15% polyacrylamide/8M urea polyacrylamide gels at constant current of 30 mA for 3 h (30 min at 250V followed by 2.5 hr at 500 V), using 1 X TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, the plates were wrapped in plastic and placed on a fluorescent TLC plate and then illuminated with a UV lam at 254 nm.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B</figref>, before photocleavage, the one-photon absorption spectra of BNSF- and BNSMB-containing oligonucleotides shows an additional red shifted UV/Vis absorption band with wavelength at &#x2dc;405 nm and 415 nm respectively which results from the &#x3c0;-&#x3c0;* transitions of the corresponding chromophores on top of the UV/Vis absorption band of nucleobases at 260 nm. BNSF and BNSMB are two well-known uncaging highly conjugated chromophores for two-photon applications. Their two-photon uncaging action cross section of 5.0 and 0.9 GM were determined respectively by Nicoud and his co-workers at 800 nm. They are pretty much higher than those of reported photon-sensitive photoremovable groups such as 2-nitrobenzyl or NPPOC units which exhibit two-photon uncaging action cross section of 0.01 GM or even less at 800 nm.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">To investigate their photochemical properties, photolysis was conducted by irradiation of the designed oligonucleotides (&#x2dc;0.2 &#x3bc;M) at wavelength 405 nm under 25 mW or 700 nm under 1 mW in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The UV/Vis spectra shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>C and <b>21</b>D</figref> after photolysis show similar decrease in absorbance at 405 nm (for BNSF-DNA) and 415 nm (for BNSMB-DNA) and increase in absorbance at 490 nm (for BNSF-DNA and BNSMB-DNA) upon photolysis as a function of irradiation time with 405 nm light. In contrast, there is not much change in the UV/Vis absorption maxima of BNSF-DNA and BNSMB-DNA until photolysis under 700 nm light for longer than 8 h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>E and <b>21</b>F</figref>). Even though the photocleavage molecules was optimized for two-photon uncaging, they still exhibit great sensitivities toward one-photon absorption.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis was also used to confirm the photocleavage of the designed oligonucleotides BNSF-DNA and BNSMB-DNA into two shorter fragments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B</figref>, the BNSF-DNA and BNSMB-DNA (lane 1) break into two fragments (lane 2) in which their molecular sizes are equivalent to the 19- and 15-mer of DNA strands (lane 3 and 4) after irradiating with 700 nm light. Similar results were obtained when the DNA samples were irradiated with 405 nm light at different time points (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B</figref>). These results are in good agreement with our designed caged DNA fragments, confirming the occurrence of bond breaking only in the photoliable NPPOC units.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">The photolytic release of caged DNAs was analysed quantitatively by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B</figref> and Table 1 shows the HPLC results of non-irradiated and irradiated samples. The non-irradiated sample a or c and the resulting photoproduct b or d were characterized by mass spectroscopy. As expected, the additional HPLC peak at 14.9 min presents the photoproducts 19-mer and 15-mer of DNAs resulted from linker cleavage of BNSF-DNA and BNSMB-DNA. which are confirmed by MALDI-TOF analyses as shown in Table 1. The two shorter fragments of broken DNA strands were confirmed with their corresponding MALDI-TOF m/z peak at 4656.4502 [M+Na]<sup>+</sup> (calculated m/z 4646.9097) and m/z peak at 5888.2720 [M+K]<sup>+</sup> (calculated m/z 5870.6499) as shown in SI. It was found that the photocleavage abilities of BNSF-DNA and BNSMB-DNA were about 32&#xb1;4.5% and 21&#xb1;0.7% at the saturation point (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>). A control DNA with no photocleavable moieties was also irradiated in the same manner but showed no evidence of degradation over the observed time points.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">The results demonstrate the design and synthesis of two phosphoramidite building blocks based on BNSF and BNSMB structures. Some common molecular intermediates have been designed and linked to the central biphenyl core of the two molecules, resulting in a versatile and cost-effective design. They can be effectively introduced to DNA oligonucleotides via the well-established standard cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry on the nucleic acid synthesizer. More importantly, fragmentation of these BNSF- and BNSMB-functionalized DNA strands is achieved by both one-photon and two-photon photolysis of photoliable bonds of [2-(2-nitrophenyl)propoxy]carbonyl groups on BNSF and BNSMB molecules respectively, resulting in two short pieces of single-stranded DNAs. The versatile design and facile synthesis of these two-photon photocleavage phosphoramidite molecules are beneficial to synthetic chemists and photochemists for the development of new caged compounds which enables to introduce into oligonucleotides as light-triggered carriers via solid-phase synthesis for a wide range of applications in materials science, polymer, chemistry, biology and DNA nanoecthnology.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230000983A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230000983A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230000983A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230000983A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230000983A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230000983A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230000983A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230000983A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230000983A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230000983A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230000983A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
