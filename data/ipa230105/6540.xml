The method <b>500</b> begins at <b>502</b> with integrating a current of a rectifier diode or rectifier transistor. In one example, the integrator circuits <b>152</b>, <b>153</b>, <b>162</b>, and <b>163</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>3</b></figref> integrate the respective currents (e.g., I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b>, I<b>3</b> and I<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of the respective rectifier transistors <b>345</b>, <b>346</b>, <b>347</b>, and <b>348</b> (or of the respective diodes <b>145</b>-<b>148</b>). The integration at <b>502</b> generates an integrator voltage signal (e.g., V<b>1</b>-V<b>4</b> and VI<b>1</b>P, VI<b>2</b>P, VI<b>1</b>N, and VI<b>2</b>N in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The method <b>500</b> continues at <b>504</b> with sensing a voltage of the rectifier circuit at an isolation circuit output. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>3</b></figref>, the signal detector circuits include the voltage sensing circuits <b>154</b> and <b>164</b> that sense the voltages VRX+, VRX&#x2212; of the rectifier circuit <b>144</b> to generate the respective sensor voltage signals VVP and VVN. The method <b>500</b> also includes summing the sensor voltage signals and the integrator voltage signals to generate a summed voltage signal. In the illustrated example, the summing circuits <b>151</b> and <b>161</b> some the sensor voltage signals VVP, VVN and the respective integrator voltage signals (VI<b>1</b>P, VI<b>2</b>P, VI<b>1</b>N, and VI<b>2</b>N in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) to generate the respective summed voltage signals VSP and VSN. At <b>508</b>, the method also includes filtering the summing circuit output voltage signal. In the above example, the differential filter <b>156</b> filters the differential summed voltage signal VSP, VSN to generate a filtered signal (e.g., graphs <b>450</b> and <b>460</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>4</b>A</figref>). At <b>510</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the method includes amplifying the filter output voltage signal. The differential amplifier <b>158</b> in the above examples amplifies the filtered differential signal from the filter <b>156</b>. At <b>512</b>, the method includes comparing the amplifier output voltage signal to a threshold, and determining at <b>514</b> whether the amplifier output voltage exceeds the threshold. In the above example, the comparator <b>159</b> compares the amplifier output voltage VDIF to the threshold voltage V TH (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). If the amplifier output voltage exceeds threshold (YES at <b>514</b>), the method <b>500</b> includes determining that the signal from the signal generator <b>120</b> is detected, and enabling the driver at <b>516</b>. Otherwise (NO at <b>514</b>), the method includes determining at <b>518</b> that no signal from the signal generator has been detected, and disabling the driver. In this manner, the method <b>500</b> includes selectively enabling (e.g., at <b>516</b>) or disabling (e.g., at <b>518</b>) the actuator circuit <b>133</b> based on the comparator output signal DET. In the illustrated example, the comparator <b>159</b> provides an active high comparator output signal DET that enables the actuator circuit <b>133</b> responsive to the amplified signal exceeding the threshold voltage VTH based on the comparator output signal DET (<b>516</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). In addition, the comparator <b>159</b> provides a low comparator output signal DET (<b>518</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) that disables actuator circuit <b>133</b> responsive to the amplified signal not exceeding the threshold voltage VTH based on the comparator output signal DET.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Modifications are possible in the described examples, and other implementations are possible, within the scope of the claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
