The support block <b>12</b> can be molded, for example, from recycled tires or rubber material. The support block <b>12</b> generally has a bottom wall <b>14</b>, a top wall <b>16</b>, and two end walls <b>18</b> extending between (e.g., perpendicular to) the bottom wall <b>14</b> and the top wall <b>16</b>. The top wall <b>16</b> has a width w<b>1</b> less than the width w<b>2</b> of the bottom wall <b>14</b>. The support block <b>12</b> also has two side walls <b>22</b> extending longitudinally between the end walls <b>18</b>. The side walls <b>22</b> slope downwardly and outwardly from the top wall <b>16</b> (having the narrower width w<b>1</b>) to the bottom wall <b>14</b> (having the wider width w<b>2</b>). In various aspects, the bottom portions <b>24</b> of the side walls <b>22</b> are not sloped and are generally perpendicular to the top wall <b>16</b> and the bottom wall <b>14</b>. The bottom wall <b>14</b> may include cavities <b>26</b> that allow a majority of the interior volume of the support block <b>12</b> to be hollow. A divider wall <b>30</b> can extend between the side walls <b>22</b> and the top <b>16</b> and bottom walls <b>14</b> to block off adjacent hollow cavities <b>26</b> and to provide additional support to the support block <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The support block assembly <b>10</b> further includes a strut <b>34</b> secured, as described in greater detail below, to the top wall <b>16</b> of the support block <b>12</b>. Generally, the strut <b>34</b> is secured to the top wall <b>16</b> of the support block <b>12</b> by at least one anchor <b>36</b> (e.g., two anchors). The strut <b>34</b> can be made of any suitable material, for example, metal (e.g., galvanized steel). The strut <b>34</b> can have a generally U-shaped cross section having a base <b>38</b>, which is directly adjacent the top wall <b>16</b> of the support block <b>12</b>, and two upright and opposing flanges <b>40</b> on either side of the base <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, two anchors <b>36</b> are overmolded with the support block <b>12</b>. As such, the anchors <b>36</b> are inserts on which the support block <b>12</b> is molded to form a mechanical and/or a chemical bond between the anchors and the support block. Each anchor <b>36</b> comprises a crown <b>42</b> and tangs <b>44</b> extending downward from respective opposite ends of the crown <b>42</b>. The tangs <b>44</b> are received in the support block <b>12</b> by virtue of the block being overmolded around the tangs. Each tang <b>44</b> comprises recesses <b>46</b> (e.g., cutouts) to facilitate mechanical attachment of the anchor <b>36</b> to the block <b>12</b>. In various aspects and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, a tongue <b>50</b> extends laterally outward from (e.g., generally perpendicular to) each tang <b>44</b> at a lower end thereof. The tongues <b>50</b>, like the tangs <b>44</b>, are received in the support block <b>12</b> by virtue of the block being overmolded around the flanges. The flanges <b>50</b> further facilitate mechanical attachment of the anchor <b>36</b> to the support block <b>12</b>. Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the bottom of the tang <b>44</b> may not include a tongue.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The strut <b>34</b> defines openings <b>54</b> in the base <b>38</b> thereof through which the tangs <b>44</b> of the anchor <b>36</b> extend. For example, when two anchors <b>36</b> are used, the base <b>38</b> of the strut <b>34</b> may define four openings <b>54</b>. Where the anchors <b>36</b> include tongues <b>50</b>, the openings <b>54</b> in the base <b>38</b> of the strut <b>34</b> may be larger to allow for clearance of the tongues <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). Alternatively, where the anchors <b>36</b> do not include tongues <b>50</b>, the openings <b>54</b> in the base <b>38</b> of the strut <b>34</b> may be narrower (smaller) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). With the tangs <b>44</b> (and tongues <b>50</b>) inserted through the respective openings <b>54</b> in the base <b>38</b> of the strut <b>34</b> and being encased with the support block <b>12</b>, the tangs extend through the top wall <b>16</b> of the block and the crown <b>42</b> engages the base <b>38</b> of the strut to couple the anchor to the strut and secure the strut to the top wall of the block.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an exemplary method of making the support assembly <b>10</b>, the tangs <b>44</b> (and tongues <b>50</b>) of the anchors <b>36</b> are inserted into the respective openings <b>54</b> in the base <b>38</b> of the strut <b>34</b>. The support block <b>12</b> is then overmolded around the tangs <b>44</b> (and tongues <b>50</b>) so that the tangs (and tongues) are encased within the support block to form a mechanical and/or chemical bond between the anchors <b>36</b> and the support block. As assembled, the crowns <b>42</b> engage the base <b>38</b> of the strut to hold and attach the strut on the top wall <b>16</b> of the block.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, another embodiment of the support block assembly is generally indicated at reference numeral <b>110</b>.

The anchors <b>136</b> generally include tangs <b>144</b> extending perpendicularly to the base <b>138</b> of the strut <b>134</b>. The tangs <b>144</b> can be punched out of the base <b>138</b> of the strut <b>134</b>, which causes the base <b>138</b> to define several openings <b>154</b> that generally correspond to the size and shape of the tangs <b>144</b>. As with the previous embodiment, the support block <b>112</b> is overmolded around the tangs <b>144</b> so that the tangs <b>144</b> extend through the top wall of the block and are encased in the support block to form a mechanical and/or chemical bond between the tangs and the support block and secure the strut to the top wall of the block.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, another embodiment of the support block assembly is generally indicated at reference numeral <b>210</b>.

The strut <b>234</b> of the support block assembly <b>210</b> generally comprises an elongate body <b>256</b> having a longitudinal axis A and defining an interior extending along the length of the body <b>256</b>. The body has an upper side <b>258</b>, a lower side <b>260</b>, a right side <b>262</b>, and a left side <b>264</b>, although the respective relative locations of the respective sides will depend on the orientation during use. The upper side <b>258</b> (or slotted side) defines a continuous slot <b>266</b> (i.e., the upper side is open). The upper side <b>258</b> has outer surfaces <b>268</b> on either side of the slot <b>266</b>, and inwardly (or downwardly) extending lips <b>270</b> leading to an open interior <b>272</b> of the strut <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each of the lower, right and left sides <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>264</b>, respectively, defines a fitting groove <b>274</b> having a length, extending lengthwise of the body <b>256</b>, and a depth extending generally toward the longitudinal axis A of the body <b>256</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the fitting groves <b>274</b> have substantially identical cross-sectional shapes and dimensions. Each fitting groove <b>274</b> is defined by opposing side walls <b>276</b> extending inwardly from generally planar outer surfaces <b>278</b> of the corresponding side and toward the interior of the body <b>256</b>. The side walls <b>276</b> extend to a bottom wall <b>280</b> that spans between and interconnects the side walls <b>276</b>. The side walls <b>276</b> flare away from one another as they extend inward from the outer surfaces <b>278</b> toward the bottom of the fitting groove <b>274</b>, so that each fitting groove <b>274</b> has a generally dove-tail cross-sectional shape.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In general, the support block <b>212</b> is overmolded on the strut <b>234</b>, such that the support block <b>212</b> is molded around the lower side <b>260</b> and partially up to the right and left sides <b>262</b>, <b>264</b>. In this way, the support block <b>212</b> is received in the bottom, left, and right fitting grooves <b>274</b>. The bottom fitting groove <b>274</b> is filled with the support block material, and the left and right fitting grooves are partially filled with the support block material. The overmolding of the support block <b>212</b> on the strut <b>234</b> forms a mechanical and/or chemical bond between the strut and the support block.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>14</b></figref>, another embodiment of the support block assembly is generally indicated at reference numeral <b>310</b>. The support block assembly <b>310</b> is similar to the support block assembly <b>10</b>, and corresponding features are generally indicated by the same reference number plus <b>300</b>. The support block <b>310</b> is overmolded on the strut <b>334</b>. The base <b>338</b> of the strut <b>334</b> defines several openings <b>354</b>, through which the material of the support block (e.g., rubber) extends once the overmolding process is complete. In this way, at least longitudinal portions of the base extending between the openings <b>354</b> are encased within the support block, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. In one example, a continuous rib <b>390</b> extends longitudinally over the center of the base <b>338</b> of the strut <b>334</b>. In another example, the rib may be non-continuous, thus defining a plurality of spaced apart nibs extending through the openings <b>354</b> in the base <b>338</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Having described the invention in detail, it will be apparent that modifications and variations are possible without departing from the scope of the invention defined in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment(s) thereof, the articles &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, &#x201c;the&#x201d; and &#x201c;said&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements.
