level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0085631, filed Jun. 30, 2021, the disclose of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a brake apparatus for a vehicle. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a brake apparatus for a vehicle equipped with a secondary brake unit.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Discussion of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The content described in this section merely provides background information on the present disclosure and does not constitute the prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As autonomous driving is developing to a higher level, a driver's intervention is reduced, so it is essential to secure safety technology for emergency situations. Therefore, a vehicle to which an autonomous driving function will be introduced in the future, such as an electric vehicle, should necessarily have a brake function to prepare for emergency situations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to prevent accidents, the vehicle may be equipped with a secondary brake system in addition to a primary brake system. In this case, even if a problem occurs in either of the primary brake system or the secondary brake system, the brake system operated normally performs the brake function of the vehicle, so that it is possible to brake the vehicle by a remaining brake system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the secondary brake apparatus is additionally installed, the entire brake apparatus additionally requires eight pipes, thus causing a complicated construction and leading to an increase in weight. Further, the delivery speed of working fluid may be reduced depending on a length of the pipe connecting the main brake system and the secondary brake system. This deteriorates braking response performance.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above, the present disclosure provides a brake apparatus for a vehicle, in which a primary brake unit and a secondary brake unit are installed in one pump housing, so that the configuration of the brake apparatus having a redundancy brake function can be simplified, and the weight of the brake apparatus can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, the present disclosure provides a brake apparatus for a vehicle, in which a primary brake unit and a secondary brake unit are installed in one pump housing, so that a redundancy brake function can be realized and braking response performance is excellent.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The problems to be solved by the present disclosure are not limited to the above-mentioned problems, and other problems which are not mentioned will be clearly understood by those skilled in the art from the following description.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to at least one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a brake apparatus for a vehicle, comprising: a reservoir configured to store a working fluid; a master cylinder connected to the reservoir; a hydraulic circuit connected to a wheel brake; a primary brake unit configured to supply a hydraulic pressure to the wheel brake through the hydraulic circuit; and a secondary brake unit configured to supply hydraulic pressure to at least one wheel brake through the hydraulic circuit, wherein the hydraulic circuit comprises: a first hydraulic circuit coupled to the reservoir, the master cylinder, and the secondary brake unit; a second hydraulic circuit coupled to the reservoir and the primary brake unit; and a third hydraulic circuit coupled to the primary brake unit, the secondary brake unit, and the wheel brake.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, a brake apparatus for a vehicle according to the present disclosure is advantageous in that a primary brake unit and a secondary brake unit are installed in one pump housing, so that the configuration of the brake apparatus having a redundancy brake function can be simplified, and the weight of the brake apparatus can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, a brake apparatus for a vehicle according to the present disclosure is advantageous in that a primary brake unit and a secondary brake unit are installed in one pump housing, so that a redundancy brake function can be realized and braking response performance is not deteriorated.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

The hydraulic circuit <b>130</b> connected to the wheel brake <b>160</b> may be formed in the pump housing <b>100</b>. The wheel brake may include at least one of Rear Right (RR) wheel, Rear Left (RL) wheel, Front Right (FR) wheel or Front Left (FL) wheel.

For example, this may include a pedal rod which is configured to pressurize the chamber by a driver's pedal stroke. Here, an operation by the pedal stroke includes a configuration in which the pedal rod connected to the pedal pressurizes a piston in the chamber by the driver's pedal stroke as well as a case in which the driver's pedal stroke generates an electric signal to operate the pressurizer.

By using the single chamber master cylinder <b>120</b> instead of the master cylinder <b>120</b> having a plurality of chambers to have a long length, it is possible to reduce the entire weight of the brake apparatus and secure the installation position of the secondary brake unit <b>150</b> on the front of the master cylinder <b>120</b> in the axial direction thereof. Further, by reducing the length of a suction line through which the secondary brake unit <b>150</b> sucks the working fluid from the master cylinder <b>120</b>, the braking response performance of the secondary brake unit <b>150</b> can be improved. As the volume of the chamber in the master cylinder <b>120</b> is reduced, the flow rate of the deliverable working fluid may be reduced.

Alternatively, the hydraulic pressure of the working fluid applied to the first hydraulic line and the second hydraulic line may be controlled.
