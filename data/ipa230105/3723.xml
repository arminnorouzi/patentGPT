Examples of the protein of the RS virus may include F protein and N protein, which are associated with cell fusion. N protein is also referred to as &#x201c;nucleoprotein,&#x201d; which consists of 391 amino acid residues. N protein is a structural component of a ribonucleoprotein complex, which is referred to as &#x201c;nucleocapsid.&#x201d; N protein surrounds the genomic RNA of the RS virus and forms a spiral structure. Preferably, an antibody against the RS virus N protein is used.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0015">In the present invention, when an anti-RS virus antibody is immobilized on a carrier, disaccharide and sugar alcohol are added, so that sensitivity to detect the RS virus can be improved.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0016">Examples of the disaccharide may include trehalose and maltose.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0017">Examples of the sugar alcohol may include mannitol and sorbitol.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0018">Disaccharide and sugar alcohol may be added to an anti-RS virus antibody solution used in the immobilization. The anti-RS virus antibody solution is produced by dissolving the antibody in a buffer solution such as a phosphate buffer solution or a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). At this time, the antibody concentration is several tens of pg/mL to several g/mL. The disaccharide concentration is 0.5% to 10% (w/v), preferably 1% to 5% (w/v), more preferably 1% to 4% (w/v), and particularly preferably 1% to 3% (w/v). The sugar alcohol concentration is 0.2% to 10% (w/v), preferably 0.5% to 5% (w/v), more preferably 0.5% to 4% (w/v), and particularly preferably 0.5% to 3% (w/v). These solutions may be, for example, linearly applied onto a carrier, and may be then dried.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0019">Disaccharide and sugar alcohol are added to the antibody solution, followed by immobilization. Thereby, the sensitivity to detect the RS virus antigen is increased by 1.5 times or more, preferably by 1.75 times or more, and more preferably 2 times or more, in comparison to the case of not adding such disaccharide and sugar alcohol.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0020">In the present invention, an antigen-binding fragment formed by separating only an antigen-binding site from the anti-RS virus antibody can also be used in the method of the present invention. That is to say, when fragments having specific antigen-binding ability (antigen-binding fragments), which are produced by known methods, such as Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)2, a single-chain antibody (scFv), dsFv, a diabody, and a minibody, are used, these fragments are encompassed in the present monoclonal antibody and are included in the scope of the present invention. In addition, the class of the monoclonal antibody is not limited to IgG, and may also be IgM or IgY.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0021">The monoclonal antibody used in the method of the present invention can be obtained by immunizing an animal to be immunized with a complex or extract containing an antigen of interest, or an antigen or a partial peptide thereof according to a known immunological method, and then producing hybridomas using the cells of the immunized animal. The length of the peptide used in immunization is not particularly limited, and a peptide consisting of preferably 5 or more amino acids, and more preferably 10 or more amino acids can be used as an immunogen. Such an immunogen can be obtained from a culture solution, but it can also be obtained by incorporating DNA encoding any given antigen into a plasmid vector and then introducing the vector into host cells, so that it can be expressed therein. Any given antigen used as an immunogen or a partial peptide thereof is expressed as a fusion protein that is fused with any of the below-exemplified proteins, and it can be used as an immunogen, after purification or in an unpurified state. For the production of fusion proteins, there can be utilized glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose-binding protein (MBP), thioredoxin (TRX), Nus tag, S tag, HSV tag, FRAG tag, polyhistidine tag, etc., which are commonly used as &#x201c;protein expression/purification tags&#x201d; by those skilled in the art. The fusion protein fused with any of these proteins is preferably used as an immunogen, after any given antigen or a partial peptide portion thereof has been separated from other tag portions by using a digestive enzyme, and has been then purified.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0022">A monoclonal antibody can be easily prepared from an immunized animal according to a publicly-known method of Kohler et al. (Kohler et al., Nature, vol. 256, pp. 495-497 (1975)). Specifically, antibody-producing cells such as spleen cells or lymphocytes are recovered from an immunized animal, and the recovered cells are then fused with mouse myeloma cells according to an ordinary method to produce hybridomas. The obtained hybridomas are cloned by a limiting dilution method, etc., and thereafter, among monoclonal antibodies produced from the cloned hybridomas, a monoclonal antibody having an antigen-antibody reaction with an antigen used in the immunization of the animal is selected.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0023">A monoclonal antibody can be purified from an ascitic fluid or a culture supernatant according to a known immunoglobulin purification method. Examples of the known immunoglobulin purification method may include a fractionation method according to salting-out using ammonium sulfate or sodium sulfate, a PEG fractionation method, an ethanol fractionation method, a DEAE ion exchange chromatography method, and a gel filtration method. Moreover, the monoclonal antibody can also be purified by an affinity chromatography method using a carrier binding to any of Protein A, Protein G, and Protein L, depending on the species of the immunized animal and the class of the monoclonal antibody.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0024">According to the immunoassay method of the present invention, a measurement is carried out by an immunoassay that utilizes the antigen-antibody reaction of the monoclonal antibody produced as described above or an antigen-binding fragment thereof (hereinafter, in the description until before Examples, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; means &#x201c;an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof,&#x201d; except for the case where it is clearly not the case from the context) with an antigen contained in a specimen. As an immunoassay method applied in the measurement, any of methods publicly known to those skilled in the art, such as a competitive method, an agglutination method, a Western blot method, an immunostaining method, and a sandwich method, can be applied. Besides, in the present invention, the term &#x201c;measurement&#x201d; includes any of quantification, semi-quantification, and detection.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0025">The immunoassay is preferably a sandwich method. In the sandwich method, an antigen is sandwiched between two antibodies to form a complex, and the formed complex is detected. The sandwich method itself is publicly known in the field of immunoassay, and this method can be performed, for example, according to an immunochromatography method or an ELISA method. Both of these sandwich methods are publicly known, and the method of the present invention can be carried out according to such a publicly known sandwich method, except for the use of the above-described monoclonal antibody that recognizes the N protein as an antigen.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0026">In the sandwich method, one or two or more types of antibodies that recognize an antigen (an antibody to be immobilized on a solid phase and a labeled antibody) are used. In the case of using two or more types of antibodies, at least any one of these two types of antibodies is the above-described monoclonal antibody that recognizes the N protein as an antigen. Otherwise, an antigen may be sandwiched between two antibodies of the same type to form a complex.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0027">In an immunoassay involving a sandwich method as a detection principle, as a solid phase on which the antibody is immobilized, all of those capable of immobilizing the antibody thereon according to a known technique can be used. For example, a known solid phase, such as a porous thin membrane (membrane) having capillary action, a particulate substance, a test tube, or a resin flat plate, can be arbitrarily selected. In addition, as a substance that labels the antibody, an enzyme, a radioisotope, a fluorescent substance, a luminescent substance, a colored particle, a colloidal particle, etc. can be used. From the viewpoint of, in particular, the simplicity and rapidity of a clinical test, among the aforementioned immunoassay methods using various materials, immunochromatography, which is a lateral flow immunoassay method using a membrane, is preferable.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0028">In the present invention, the present inventors also provide an immunoassay apparatus, which can perform a lateral flow immunoassay capable of improving sensitivity to detect an RS virus, by addition of disaccharide and sugar alcohol upon immobilization of an anti-RS virus antibody. The immunoassay apparatus provided by the present invention consists of: a carrier having a detection region, on which an antibody for capturing an analyte (an antigen) (Antibody 1) is immobilized; a label region having a movable labeled antibody (Antibody 2); a sample pad for adding dropwise a specimen; an absorption band for absorbing the spread specimen solution, and a backing sheet for adhering these members to one another. This is the immunoassay apparatus, in which at least either Antibody 1 or Antibody 2 is the monoclonal antibody recognizing the N protein as an antigen of the present invention. This immunoassay apparatus is also referred to as an &#x201c;immunochromatography test piece.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0029">The carrier is a material having an ability to immobilize an antibody for capturing a substance to be detected (an antigen), and the carrier also has an ability not to prevent the moving of a liquid in the horizontal direction. Preferably, the carrier is a porous thin membrane having capillary action, which is capable of transporting a liquid and a component dispersed in the liquid due to absorption. The material used for the carrier is not particularly limited, and examples of the material of the carrier may include cellulose, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), glass fiber, nylon, and polyketone. Among these materials, a thin membrane formed using nitrocellulose is more preferable. A membrane, on which the antibody is immobilized, is referred to as an &#x201c;antibody-immobilized membrane.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0030">The label region consists of a porous base material comprising a labeled antibody, and as a material used for the base material, commonly used glass fiber, non-woven fabric, etc. can be used. For impregnation with a large amount of labeled antibody, the base material is preferably a pad-shaped material having a thickness of approximately 0.3 mm to 0.6 mm. The porous base material that is impregnated with the labeled antibody and is then dried is also referred to as a &#x201c;dry pad.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0031">For labeling a labeled antibody, enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase, metal colloids such as gold colloids, silica particles, cellulose particles, colored polystyrene particles, colored latex particles, etc. are used in many cases. In the case of using metal colloidal particles, or colored particles such as colored polystyrene particles or colored latex particles, since coloration is generated as a result of agglutination of these labeling reagents, this coloration is measured. Particles, on which the antibodies are immobilized, are referred to as &#x201c;antibody-immobilized particles.&#x201d; The amount of the antibody immobilized is not particularly limited, and it is adequate if the antibody may be present in the label region in an amount of several ng to several tens of &#x3bc;g.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0032">The detection region indicates a partial region of the carrier, on which an antibody for capturing a substance to be detected (an antigen) is immobilized. In the detection region, at least one region, on which an antibody for capturing an antigen is immobilized, is established. The detection region may be included in the carrier, and an antibody may be immobilized on the carrier. As described above, when the anti-RS virus antibody is immobilized on the detection region, disaccharide and sugar alcohol are added into the anti-RS virus antibody solution. The amount of the antibody immobilized is not particularly limited, and it is adequate if the antibody may be immobilized on the detection region in an amount of several ng to several tens of &#x3bc;g. The detection region of the present invention detectably comprises disaccharide and sugar alcohol.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0033">The sample pad is a site to which a specimen is adding dropwise, and is a porous material. The sample pad is a site located most upstream of the immunoassay apparatus. As a material used for the sample pad, commonly used filter, glass fiber, non-woven fabric, etc. can be used. In order to use a large amount of specimen in the immunoassay, the sample pad is preferably a pad-shaped material having a thickness of approximately 0.3 mm to 1 mm. Examples of the specimen may also include a sample or the like that is obtained by allowing the specimen to float in another solution, and a sample prepared using the specimen.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0034">The absorption band is a member for absorbing a component that is supplied to the carrier and is not involved in the reaction in the detection region. As a material used for the absorption band, a water-retentive filter, sponge, etc. consisting of a common natural polymer compound or synthetic polymer compound, etc. can be used. In order to promote the developing of the specimen, a material having a high water absorption rate is preferable.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0035">The backing sheet is a member for adhering all of the aforementioned materials, namely, a carrier, a sample pad, a label region, an absorption band and the like, to one another, with partial overlapping, and for immobilizing them. The backing sheet is not always necessary, if these materials are disposed and immobilized with optimal intervals. However, for the convenience of production or use, it is generally preferable to use the backing sheet.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0036">The immunoassay apparatus of the present invention may further comprise a control display region (a member). The control display region is a site for showing that the test has been accurately carried out. For example, the control display region is located downstream of the detection region, and emits signals such as coloration, when a specimen sample passes through the detection region and reaches the control display region. On the control display region, a substance that binds to an antibody binding to a labeled carrier may be immobilized, or a reagent, such as a pH indicator whose color is changed when the specimen reaches, may be immobilized. When such a labeled carrier-binding antibody is a mouse monoclonal antibody, an anti-mouse IgG antibody may be used.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0037">The size of the immunoassay apparatus is not limited. For example, the present immunoassay apparatus has a vertical length of several cm to some dozen cm, and a horizontal length of several mm to several cm.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0038">The immunoassay apparatus of the present invention may be placed in a containment cassette (vessel). By using this containment cassette, deterioration of the immunoassay apparatus due to, for example, ultraviolet ray or moisture in the air, can be prevented. Moreover, in the case of using a specimen sample having contamination or infectivity, by using the containment cassette, a tester who performs an assay can be prevented from being contaminated or infected. For example, a resin case having an appropriate size may be used as a containment cassette, and the apparatus of the present invention may be placed in the case. The containment cassette and the immunoassay apparatus placed in the cassette are collectively referred to as an &#x201c;immunoassay device&#x201d; in some cases.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0039">An RS virus detection reagent containing the anti-RS virus N protein monoclonal antibody of the present invention comprises the above-described immunoassay apparatus.

As a result, a complex consisting of an immobilized substance, a substance to be detected, and a labeling reagent is formed on the solid-phase carrier, and the signals of the labeling reagent emitted from the complex are then detected (in the case of using a gold colloid, the solid-phase carrier portion, on which the substance capable of binding to the substance to be detected is immobilized, becomes red), so that the substance to be detected can be detected. This immunoassay method can be carried out at a temperature of 5&#xb0; C. to 35&#xb0; C., and preferably at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0041">According to the method of the present invention, whether or not a subject is infected with an RS virus can be detected.
