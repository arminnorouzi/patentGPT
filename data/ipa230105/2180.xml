The embossing roller <b>20</b> may be driven by a drive system (not shown) so as to rotate. The first and second pressing rollers <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> may be caused to rotate by engagement with the embossing roller <b>20</b>. The applicator roller <b>42</b> and the transfer roller <b>40</b> may be driven to rotate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">First and second endless plies of web material W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> are provided to the system <b>1</b> in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The plies of web material W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> may comprise fiber structure plies, such as non-woven plies, paper plies or like fiber structure plies. The first ply of web material W<b>1</b> passes over the first guide roller R<b>1</b>, engages the first pressing roller <b>10</b> and then passes through a first nip N<b>1</b> defined between the first pressing roller <b>10</b> and the embossing roller <b>20</b>. As the first ply of web material W<b>1</b> moves through the first nip N<b>1</b>, it is embossed by an embossing pattern formed on an outer surface <b>20</b>A of the embossing roller <b>20</b>. The first ply of web material W<b>1</b> continues to move with the embossing roller <b>20</b> and passes through a second nip N<b>2</b> defined between the embossing roller <b>20</b> and the applicator roller <b>42</b>, where a first side of the first ply of web material W<b>1</b> is coated with an adhesive <b>30</b>A by the applicator roller <b>42</b>. The applicator roller <b>42</b> receives the adhesive <b>30</b>A from the transfer roller <b>40</b>, which extends into the adhesive reservoir <b>30</b> containing the adhesive <b>30</b>A. The first ply of web material W<b>1</b> continues through a third nip N<b>3</b> defined between the embossing roller <b>20</b> and the second pressing roller <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The second ply of web material W<b>2</b> passes over the second and third guide rollers R<b>2</b> and R<b>3</b> and into the third nip N<b>3</b>, such that the second ply W<b>2</b> moves generally simultaneously with the first ply W<b>1</b> through the third nip N<b>3</b>. As the second ply of web material W<b>2</b> enters the third nip N<b>3</b>, it engages with the first side of the first ply of web material W<b>1</b> coated with adhesive. While in the third nip N<b>3</b>, the first and second plies of web material W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> are pressed together by the embossing roller <b>20</b> and the second pressing roller <b>12</b>, which functions as a marrying roller. The first and second plies of web material W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> exit the third nip N<b>3</b> joined together as a two-ply web paper product.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first pressing roller <b>10</b> includes an inner core <b>100</b> and a roller cover structure <b>110</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The roller cover structure <b>110</b> is adapted to be mounted on the inner core <b>100</b> for rotation with the inner core <b>100</b>. As discussed in further detail below, the roller cover structure <b>110</b> defines an outer surface <b>110</b>A to mate with the embossing roller <b>20</b>. The inner core <b>100</b> may have a tubular configuration for receiving a shaft (not shown), such that the core <b>100</b> is joined to the shaft for rotation with the shaft. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the inner core <b>100</b> receives at each of its opposing ends <b>100</b>A a corresponding shaft-like mounting member <b>101</b>. Each of the two mounting members <b>101</b> is rotatably mounted in a bearing B, so as to allow the pressing roller <b>10</b> to rotate about an axis A.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pressing roller <b>10</b> may have any length L, such as from 60 inches to 240 inches and preferably 110 inches. The roller cover structure <b>110</b> runs or extends the entire length of the pressing roller <b>10</b> and may be defined by a plurality of roller cover segments <b>120</b> having equal widths W, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. If, for example, the pressing roller <b>10</b> has a length L of 110 inches, the roller cover structure <b>110</b> may be defined by <b>110</b> roller cover segments <b>120</b>, with each roller cover segment <b>120</b> having a width W of 1 inch. In this example, the inner core <b>100</b> may comprise a single unitary structure having a length of about 110 inches. The width W of each roller cover segment <b>120</b> may vary from 0.5 inch to 3.0 inches.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each roller cover segment <b>120</b> comprises an inner ring <b>122</b> adapted to be fitted on the inner core <b>100</b> and may be secured to the inner core <b>100</b>, such as by a friction fit, adhesive or a fastener, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>A</figref>. The inner ring <b>122</b> may be formed from a rigid material, such as steel, aluminum, a fiber composite or a hard polymeric material. Each roller cover segment <b>120</b> may further comprise an outer ring <b>124</b>, having an outer surface <b>124</b>A forming a portion or section of the outer surface <b>110</b>A of the roller cover structure <b>110</b>. The outer ring <b>124</b>, in accordance with one embodiment, may be formed, such as by molding, from a material, which is both compressible and deformable, examples of which include compressible and deformable polymeric materials such as compressible and deformable elastomeric materials including polyurethane, a rubber or an elastomer, wherein the rubber/elastomer may have a hardness falling within the range of 50-200 Pusey and Jones hardness (P&#x26;J). One example of a compressible and deformable polymeric material is one that is commercially available from Valley Roller, of the Maxcess Group, under the product designation Val-Coat&#xae;. When the outer ring <b>124</b> is formed from a material that is compressible, the outer ring <b>124</b> is compressible in a radial direction, i.e., the outer ring's thickness T is compressible, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>. When the outer ring <b>124</b> is formed from a material that is also deformable, the outer ring <b>124</b> is capable of deforming inwardly so to conform to the shape of the embossing roller <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each roller cover segment <b>120</b> may still further comprise a deformable coupling structure <b>130</b> located between the inner ring <b>122</b> and the outer ring <b>124</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>. In the illustrated embodiments, the deformable coupling structure <b>130</b> may be formed from a super elastic material, such as, for example, a shape memory alloy (SMA). The SMA may comprise a nickel titanium alloy or an indium titanium alloy. The deformable coupling structure <b>130</b> may also be formed from a carbon fiber composite, formed from carbon fibers in an epoxy resin, or the structure <b>130</b> may be formed from a nylon. The deformable coupling structure <b>130</b> may have various geometries, which are discussed in detail below. It is believed that a deformable coupling structure <b>130</b>, when formed from a super elastic material such as SMA, a carbon fiber composite or nylon, may be capable of a high number of repeated deformation cycles as the first pressing roller <b>10</b> is deformed in the first nip N<b>1</b> without experiencing excessive fatigue which may change shape and related characteristics of the coupling structure <b>130</b>. Hence, it is believed that the first pressing roller's fatigue resistance will be improved such that use of the pressing roller <b>10</b> in combination with a mating roller may be extended before needing replacement.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As noted above, the first ply of web material W<b>1</b> passes through the first nip N<b>1</b> defined between the first pressing roller <b>10</b> and the embossing roller <b>20</b>. Because the outer ring <b>124</b> of the first pressing roller <b>10</b> may be formed from a material, which is both compressible and deformable, the outer ring <b>124</b> compresses radially in the first nip N<b>1</b> so as to conform to the embossing pattern formed on the embossing roller <b>20</b> to allow for a full or complete embossing of the first ply of web material W<b>1</b> by the embossing roller <b>20</b>. Further, because the outer ring <b>124</b> is formed from a material which is both compressible and deformable, and the outer ring <b>124</b> is supported on its inner surface by the deformable coupling structure <b>130</b>, a portion of the outer ring <b>124</b> in engagement with the embossing roller <b>20</b> is capable of deforming to the shape of the embossing roller <b>20</b> to increase the length of the first nip N<b>1</b> between the first pressing roller <b>10</b> and embossing roller <b>20</b>, thereby increasing the time that the first ply of web material W<b>1</b> is compressed in the first nip N<b>1</b>, i.e., the first nip N<b>1</b> is extended, so as to allow for a more complete embossing of the first ply W<b>1</b> by the embossing roller <b>20</b> while in the first nip N<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The deformable coupling structure <b>130</b>, formed in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, comprises a plurality of ribs <b>132</b>, where each rib <b>132</b> may be coupled to the inner ring <b>122</b> and the outer ring <b>124</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B and <b>4</b>C</figref>.

For example, when the deformable coupling structure <b>130</b> is formed from an SMA, the first end <b>132</b>A of each rib <b>132</b> may be mechanically deformed to form the curl on the first end <b>132</b>A. If the deformable coupling structure <b>130</b> is formed from a carbon fiber composite or nylon, the ribs <b>132</b> may be molded such that the first ends <b>132</b>A have a curled shape with a bore <b>132</b>B. The inner ring <b>122</b> may be molded with pairs of axially spaced apart connecting members <b>222</b> provided with bores <b>222</b>A through which a corresponding pin <b>133</b> extends, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>. Pairs of the connecting members <b>222</b> may be equally spaced apart circumferentially about the outer periphery of the inner ring <b>122</b>. A rib <b>132</b> may be positioned between a corresponding pair of connecting members <b>222</b>. A pin <b>133</b> or other fastener may be inserted into the bore <b>132</b>B of the rib first end <b>132</b>A and the bores <b>222</b>A of the corresponding connecting members <b>222</b> to join the rib <b>132</b> to the inner ring <b>122</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>C and <b>4</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each rib <b>132</b> may also include a second end <b>132</b>C, which extends into the outer ring <b>124</b>.

A second end <b>132</b>C of each rib may be inserted into a corresponding slot within the outer ring <b>124</b> after the outer ring <b>124</b> is formed and may be retained in the outer ring slot via friction, a fastener or adhesive.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a further embodiment of a deformable coupling structure <b>230</b> is illustrated where the coupling structure <b>230</b> comprises a plurality of ribs <b>232</b> coupled to the inner and outer rings <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>.

For example, when the deformable coupling structure <b>230</b> is formed from an SMA, the first end <b>232</b>A of each rib <b>232</b> may be mechanically deformed to form a curl on the first end <b>232</b>A, which curl defines the enlarged first end <b>232</b>A. If the deformable coupling structure <b>230</b> is formed from a carbon fiber composite or nylon, the ribs <b>232</b> may be molded such that the first ends have an enlarged first end <b>232</b>A. The inner ring <b>122</b> may be molded to include axially extending grooves <b>122</b>A, each sized to receive a corresponding rib first end <b>232</b>A. The grooves <b>122</b>A may be equally spaced apart circumferentially about the outer periphery of the inner ring <b>122</b>. An enlarged first end <b>232</b>A of each rib <b>232</b> is inserted into a corresponding one of the grooves <b>122</b>A so as to secure the rib <b>232</b> to the inner ring <b>122</b>. The grooves <b>122</b>A may have a narrow exit <b>122</b>B to prevent the enlarged first ends <b>232</b>A from radially exiting the grooves <b>122</b>A. The grooves <b>122</b>A and the rib first ends <b>232</b>A define interlocking joints.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The number of ribs defining the deformable coupling structure may be varied. As the number of ribs is increased, the deformable coupling structure may become more rigid, while as the number of ribs in decreased, the deformable coupling structure may become less rigid and more deformable.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The geometry of the deformable coupling structure can also be changed by varying the thickness of each rib. Increasing rib thickness may make the deformable coupling structure more rigid, while thinner ribs may make the deformable coupling structure less rigid.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each rib can have a thickness that varies along its length, where the length is defined as the distance from where the rib is coupled to the inner ring <b>122</b> to where the rib is coupled to the outer ring <b>124</b>. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>, the thickness of the rib <b>332</b> is greater starting at its first end <b>332</b>A and becomes thinner at a location partway between the first end <b>332</b>A and the second end <b>332</b>C. In this embodiment, the rib's thickness may be varied by staggering layers of SMA of different lengths. First and second outer layers L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2 </sub>of SMA are positioned on opposite sides of a third layer L<sub>3 </sub>of SMA. The first and second layers L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2 </sub>of SMA extend from the first end <b>332</b>A of the rib <b>332</b> and end approximately at a middle location between the first and second ends <b>332</b>A and <b>332</b>C. The third layer L<sub>3 </sub>extends the full distance from the first end <b>332</b>A to the third end <b>332</b>C. The first, second and third layers L<sub>1</sub>-L<sub>3 </sub>may be joined using fasteners <b>334</b>, such as pins or bolts, and/or an adhesive <b>336</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a further embodiment, the deformable coupling structure comprises main ribs and sub-ribs. For example, the ribs <b>132</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> may define main ribs and ribs <b>132</b>D shown in phantom may define sub-ribs. When the deformable coupling structure is formed from an SMA, the sub-ribs <b>132</b>D may be joined to the main ribs <b>132</b> using either adhesive or mechanical fasteners.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> depicts the interaction between the first pressing roller <b>10</b> and the embossing roller <b>20</b>. During the interaction, the outer surface <b>110</b>A of the roller cover structure <b>110</b> engages or mates with the outer surface <b>20</b>A of the embossing roller <b>20</b> to define the first nip N<b>1</b>, which receives the first ply of web material W<b>1</b>. Where the outer surface <b>110</b>A of the roller cover structure <b>110</b> and the outer surface <b>20</b>A of the embossing roller <b>20</b> engage, the roller cover structure <b>110</b> compresses to conform to the embossing pattern on the embossing roller <b>20</b>. The roller cover structure also deforms slightly inward to conform to the outer surface <b>20</b>A of the embossing roller <b>20</b>. The outer surface <b>20</b>A of the embossing roller <b>20</b> is much more rigid than the outer surface <b>110</b>A of the roller cover structure <b>110</b> such that the embossing roller outer surface <b>20</b>A essentially does not deform in the first nip N<b>1</b>. The deformation of the roller cover structure <b>110</b> at and near the first nip N<b>1</b> increases the nip time, i.e., the time that a given point on the first ply of web material W<b>1</b> is engaged by both the pressing and embossing rollers <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, which leads to an improve embossing of the first ply W<b>1</b>. The deformable coupling structure <b>17</b> of each roller cover segment <b>120</b>, which supports its corresponding outer ring <b>124</b>, along with the deformable material from which the outer ring <b>124</b> is formed, allows the roller cover structure <b>11</b> at and near the first nip N<b>1</b> to deform radially inward so as to create the increased nip time.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>E, <b>5</b></figref>, the ribs <b>132</b>, <b>232</b> and <b>332</b> are generally linear along all or a substantial portion of their lengths.

In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the ribs <b>532</b> have an angled profile along their lengths. The ribs <b>432</b> and <b>532</b> may be formed from any of the materials set out above from which the ribs <b>132</b>, <b>232</b> and <b>332</b> are formed and the ribs <b>432</b> and <b>532</b> may be joined to the inner and outer rings <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> in any manner discussed above in which the ribs <b>132</b>, <b>232</b> and <b>332</b> are coupled to the inner and outer rings <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>. It is noted that the shape/geometry of the ribs or other structures defining the deformable coupling structure may be designed so as to vary the nip profile between the embossing roller and a pressing roller. For example, based on the shape/geometry of the deformable coupling structure, the nip profile may extend a greater extend to one side or another of an axis that passes through center axes of both the embossing and pressing rollers and the nip, i.e., the nip may extend a greater distance in a direction toward an entrance or exit portion of the nip.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the deformable coupling structure may comprise a lattice structure.

Both lattice structures <b>630</b> and <b>730</b> may be formed by deforming single sheets of the super elastic material to create separate layers, which layers may or may not be coupled together. If the separate layers are coupled together, they may be coupled via adhesive or fasteners such as pins or bolts. If the layers are not coupled together, then the layers may be positioned adjacent to one another, i.e., stacked on top of one another in a radial direction, in the space between the inner and outer rings <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> to form the lattice structure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A first pressing roller <b>200</b> constructed in accordance with a further embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, where elements in the first pressing roller <b>200</b> which are the same as elements in the first pressing roller <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>A</figref> are referenced with the same reference numerals.
