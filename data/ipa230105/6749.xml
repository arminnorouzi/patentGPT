The pre-driver <b>112</b>A may pre-process a signal output from the multiplexer <b>110</b> and may transfer the pre-processed signal to the main driver <b>112</b>B. The main driver <b>112</b>B may transfer the signal to the output terminal of the serializer <b>100</b><i>a</i>, based on the signal transferred from the multiplexer <b>110</b> through the pre-driver <b>112</b>A.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The delay circuit <b>113</b>C may be connected with the output terminal of the multiplexer <b>110</b>. The delay circuit <b>113</b>C may delay the signal output from the multiplexer <b>110</b> as much as a unit time. For example, the delay circuit <b>113</b>C may delay the signal output from the multiplexer <b>110</b> as much as a time during which the rising edge of the pulse PL<b>0</b> is maintained (or as much as a duty of the pulse PL<b>0</b>). The pre-driver <b>113</b>A may pre-process a signal output from the delay circuit <b>113</b>C and may transfer the pre-processed signal to the de-emphasis driver <b>113</b>B. A configuration and an operation of the pre-driver <b>113</b>A may be similar to those of the pre-driver <b>112</b>A. The de-emphasis driver <b>113</b>B may attenuate a magnitude of the signal output from the pre-driver <b>113</b>A. For example, the de-emphasis driver <b>113</b>B may decrease the magnitude of the signal output from the pre-driver <b>113</b>A at a given ratio. As such a swing width of the voltage output from the pre-driver <b>113</b>A may decrease. The de-emphasis driver <b>113</b>B may transfer the attenuated (or amplified) signal to the output terminal of the serializer <b>100</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The data signal DQ output from the output terminal of the serializer <b>100</b><i>a </i>may correspond to a sum of the signal output from the main driver <b>112</b>B and the signal output from the de-emphasis driver <b>113</b>B. A magnitude of an edge of the data signal DQ, which corresponds to an edge of the input data of the serializer <b>100</b><i>a</i>, may be increased by the signal output from the de-emphasis driver <b>113</b>B, and thus, the intersymbol interference due to the edge may be prevented. At the same time, a power supply noise induced jitter (PSIJ) introduced into the data signal DQ may increase due to the attenuation operation of the de-emphasis driver <b>113</b>B. Also, as the signal output from the multiplexer <b>110</b> further passes through the delay circuit <b>113</b>C, the pre-driver <b>113</b>A, and the de-emphasis driver <b>113</b>B, an operating speed of the serializer <b>100</b><i>a </i>may become slower. As the de-emphasis driver <b>113</b>B operates in response to the clocks WCK0 to WCK270, the de-emphasis driver <b>113</b>B may be affected by frequencies of the clocks WCK0 to WCK270 and may cause an increase in the loading of the clocks WCK0 to WCK270.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, as the serializer <b>100</b><i>a </i>includes the multiplexer <b>110</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>7</b>B</figref>, the intersymbol interference may be prevented, and an operation of the de-emphasis driver <b>113</b>B may not be required.
