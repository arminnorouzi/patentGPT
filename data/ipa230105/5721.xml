The plasma processing apparatus includes an upper electrode, a lower electrode, and an electromagnetic wave emission port. The upper electrode is provided to be capable of ejecting a processing gas into a processing container. The lower electrode is provided to be capable of holding a workpiece in the processing container. The electromagnetic wave emission port is provided at a height position between a height position of the upper electrode and a height position of the lower electrode, and is open toward a center of the processing container.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0020">Electromagnetic waves are emitted from the electromagnetic wave emission port, and travel toward the center of the processing container. By absorbing energy of the electromagnetic waves, the processing gas in the processing container is plasmarized. Since the electromagnetic waves propagate in a horizontal direction, plasma intensity in a horizontal plane is likely to be more uniform compared to a case of propagating in a vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0021">When the electromagnetic wave emission port extends along a circumferential direction of the processing container, plasma intensity in the circumferential direction becomes uniform. However, since the electromagnetic waves travel toward the center, the electromagnetic waves are superimposed and plasma intensity increases at the center. Therefore, it is desired to reduce intensity of the electromagnetic waves at the center.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0022">In an exemplary embodiment, a groove for electromagnetic wave reflection is formed on a lower surface of an outer peripheral portion of the upper electrode. When the groove is formed on the lower surface of the outer peripheral portion, electromagnetic waves not only travel in the horizontal direction but also travel into the groove, and are reflected at a deep portion of the groove. In this case, a ratio at which the electromagnetic waves are absorbed increases immediately below the groove, and the plasma intensity in the outer peripheral portion increases. Thus, the plasma intensity at the center decreases due to energy consumption in the outer peripheral portion. Therefore, uniformity of the plasma intensity in a radial direction of the processing container increases.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0023">In an exemplary embodiment, the groove includes an inside inner peripheral surface, an outside inner peripheral surface facing the inside inner peripheral surface, and a bottom surface located in the deep portion of the groove and connecting the inside inner peripheral surface and the outside inner peripheral surface. The electromagnetic waves that have traveled into the groove are reflected by the inside inner peripheral surface and the bottom surface.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0024">In an exemplary embodiment, the outside inner peripheral surface is flush with an inner peripheral surface of a side wall of the processing container. When the outside inner peripheral surface and the inner peripheral surface have a step therebetween rather than being flush with each other, electric fields due to the electromagnetic waves are concentrated to the stepped portion. Electric field concentration may cause an unintended discharge or an increase of plasma intensity. When the outside inner peripheral surface and the inner peripheral surface are flush with each other, it is possible to suppress such a phenomenon.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0025">In an exemplary embodiment, a corner portion is formed between the inside inner peripheral surface of the groove and a lower open end surface of the groove, and the corner portion has a roundness in a vertical cross section along the radial direction of the processing container. When the electromagnetic waves propagate toward the center of the processing container, it is likely that the corner portion of the groove inhibits smooth traveling of the electromagnetic waves. When the corner portion has a roundness (rounded shape), it is possible to improve the in-plane uniformity of plasma intensity by suppressing the inhibition of traveling of electromagnetic waves by the corner portion.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0026">In an exemplary embodiment, the groove is disposed above a region outward of a workpiece placement region in the lower electrode. That is, since the plasma intensity tends to be high immediately below the groove, it is possible to improve the uniformity of the plasma intensity on the workpiece by setting the position of the groove away from the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0027">In an exemplary embodiment, it is desirable that a depth L and a width D of the groove satisfy 0.3&#x2264;L/D&#x2264;1.0. When this condition is satisfied, the in-plane uniformity of plasma intensity is increased.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0028">In an exemplary embodiment, it is desirable that the depth L and the width D of the groove satisfy 0.4&#x2264;L/D&#x2264;0.9. When this condition is satisfied, the in-plane uniformity of plasma intensity is further increased.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0029">In an exemplary embodiment, the plasma processing apparatus includes a gas introduction port on an inner surface of the groove. The processing gas can be introduced even into a place where the groove exists, and a concentration distribution and convection of the processing gas in the processing container can be controlled. Therefore, since these parameters can be controlled, it is possible to control a distribution of plasma more precisely.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0030">In an exemplary embodiment, the plasma processing apparatus further includes a dielectric ring including a cylindrical upper dielectric and a ring-shaped lower dielectric continuous to a lower portion of the upper dielectric, and the electromagnetic wave emission port is configured by an inner surface of the ring-shaped lower dielectric. The electromagnetic waves emitted from the dielectric ring have high uniformity in the circumferential direction, and the uniformity of plasma intensity in the circumferential direction increases. The electromagnetic waves introduced from the upper dielectric travels in the ring-shaped lower dielectric toward the inner surface (inner tip surface) thereof. In the process of traveling in the lower dielectric, directions of electric fields due to the electromagnetic waves are aligned.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031">In an exemplary embodiment, a dimension obtained by subtracting a radial width of the upper dielectric of the dielectric ring from a radial width of the lower dielectric of the dielectric ring is 5 mm to 30 mm. That is, when the dimension is 5 mm or more, the directions of the electric fields due to the electromagnetic waves are aligned. When the dimension exceeds 30 mm, the directions of the electric fields are aligned, but the intensity of electromagnetic waves is attenuated or the size of the apparatus is enlarged.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032">In an exemplary embodiment, a corner portion is formed between an outer surface and a lower surface of the lower dielectric of the dielectric ring, and the corner portion has a roundness in a vertical cross section along the radial direction of the processing container. In the case where the corner portion has a roundness (rounded shape), when the electromagnetic waves move from the upper dielectric to the lower dielectric, the electromagnetic waves can travel more smoothly than in the case where there is no roundness.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033">In an exemplary embodiment, a lower surface of the upper electrode and a top surface of the lower dielectric of the dielectric ring are at the same height. That is, although the electromagnetic waves are emitted from below the top surface of the lower dielectric of the dielectric ring, since the lower surface of the upper electrode and the top surface of the lower dielectric are at the same height, there is no stepped portion due to a difference in height therebetween. Thus, it is possible to suppress an unintended discharge or an increase in plasma intensity.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034">In an exemplary embodiment, a plasma processing method is provided. The plasma processing method includes a process of disposing a workpiece on the lower electrode of any one of the above-described plasma processing apparatuses, a process of supplying a processing gas from the upper electrode into the processing container, and a process of introducing electromagnetic waves from the electromagnetic wave emission port into the processing container.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0035">According to this method, it is possible to increase the in-plane uniformity of plasma by using the above-described plasma processing apparatuses, and thus it is possible to execute plasma processing with high in-plane uniformity on the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0036">Hereinafter, various exemplary embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. In addition, the same reference numerals are designated to the same or corresponding parts in each drawing, and duplicate description will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view illustrating a vertical cross-sectional configuration of a plasma processing apparatus according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0038">A plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> includes a processing container <b>1</b> having an upper opening, a lid <b>1</b>L that seals the upper opening of the processing container <b>1</b>, a stage <b>2</b> (lower electrode, stage) disposed in the processing container <b>1</b>, and a plasma generation source located above the stage <b>2</b>. The plasma generation source includes an upper electrode <b>5</b> disposed to face the stage <b>2</b> and a dielectric ring <b>7</b> having an electromagnetic wave emission port (radio-frequency wave emission port). Electromagnetic waves RF are emitted from a side end surface of a lower portion of the dielectric ring <b>7</b> toward a center of the processing container <b>1</b>. The dielectric ring <b>7</b> is an electromagnetic wave (radio-frequency wave) introducer, and a step (lip) having an annular top surface is formed in an upper portion of an inner wall surface of the processing container <b>1</b>. The dielectric ring <b>7</b> is engaged with this step so that the dielectric ring <b>7</b> is disposed on and supported by the top surface of the step. The dielectric ring <b>7</b> is fit along an entire circumference of the processing container <b>1</b>. The electromagnetic wave emission port defined on an inner tip surface of the dielectric ring <b>7</b> is formed over the entire circumference of the processing container <b>1</b> in a circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0039">A workpiece (substrate <b>3</b>) is disposed on the stage <b>2</b>. The substrate <b>3</b> is not particularly limited as long as it is subjected to plasma processing, and examples thereof include a semiconductor substrate, a dielectric substrate such as glass or alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), a metallic substrate, or the like.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0040">A gas inside the processing container <b>1</b> can be exhausted to the outside by an exhaust device <b>20</b> via a gas exhaust port <b>19</b>. A processing gas is supplied from a gas source <b>18</b> into the processing container <b>1</b> via a supply pipe <b>17</b>. Specifically, the upper electrode <b>5</b> has a shower structure including a processing gas diffusion part (internal space <b>16</b>), and the supply pipe <b>17</b> penetrates the lid <b>1</b>L, extends across a waveguide <b>9</b>, and is connected to an interior of the internal space <b>16</b>. The processing gas introduced into the internal space <b>16</b> is supplied to the interior of the processing container <b>1</b> via a plurality of processing gas outlets (gas holes <b>14</b>) formed in a lower region of the upper electrode <b>5</b>. The upper electrode <b>5</b> of this example has a shower plate structure made of metal, and includes the internal space <b>16</b> into which the processing gas is introduced and the gas holes <b>14</b> which make the internal space <b>16</b> and an internal space of the processing container <b>1</b> communicate with each other. The upper electrode <b>5</b> includes an upper metallic member <b>5</b>A having a recess on a lower surface thereof and a lower metallic member <b>5</b>B having the gas holes <b>14</b>, and the internal space <b>16</b> is formed in the recess disposed between these metallic members.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0041">The waveguide <b>9</b> is formed among the upper electrode <b>5</b>, a lower surface of the lid <b>1</b>L, and an inner surface of the processing container <b>1</b>. Electromagnetic waves (e.g., electromagnetic waves such as VHF waves and UHF waves having a frequency higher than frequencies of short-waves), which are input from a first radio-frequency power supply <b>11</b> to a space above the upper electrode <b>5</b> via a first radio-frequency matcher <b>10</b> and an antenna <b>8</b>, radially travel in the horizontal direction through the waveguide <b>9</b>. When reaching the inner surface of the processing container <b>1</b>, the electromagnetic waves travel downward, pass through the interior of the dielectric ring <b>7</b> to be emitted from the inner tip surface of the lower portion of the dielectric ring <b>7</b>, and travel horizontally toward a central axis of the processing container <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0042">When the processing gas is introduced into the processing container <b>1</b> and the electromagnetic waves are introduced into the processing container <b>1</b> in a state in which the interior of the processing container <b>1</b> is depressurized by the exhaust device <b>20</b> to a pressure at which plasma can be generated, plasma is generated below the upper electrode <b>5</b>. A plasma region <b>4</b> is located directly below the upper electrode <b>5</b>. In addition, one end of the first radio-frequency power supply <b>11</b> is connected to the first radio-frequency matcher <b>10</b>, and the other end of the first radio-frequency power supply <b>11</b> is connected to the ground. In addition, as the antenna <b>8</b>, any antenna may be used as long as it can transmit electromagnetic waves such as VHF waves, and as an electromagnetic wave transmission component, a coaxial cable may be used in addition to the waveguide. In addition, in this example, the stage <b>2</b> is electrically connected to the ground, but it is also possible to apply radio-frequency waves or the like to the stage <b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0043">In the processing container <b>1</b>, it is assumed that the central axis extending in a vertical direction is a Z axis, an axis perpendicular to the Z axis is an X axis, and an axis perpendicular to both the Z axis and the X axis is a Y axis. In this case, an XY plane constitutes a horizontal plane. A central axis of the dielectric ring <b>7</b> coincides with the vertical central axis (the Z axis) of the processing container <b>1</b>.

The inner tip surface <b>7</b>B<b>3</b> is provided at a height position between a height position (a position in the Z-axis direction) of the upper electrode <b>5</b> and a height position (a position in the Z-axis direction) of the lower electrode, and is open toward the center of the processing container <b>1</b>. Electromagnetic waves RF are emitted from the electromagnetic wave emission port, and travel toward the center of the processing container <b>1</b>. By absorbing the energy of the electromagnetic waves RF, the processing gas in the processing container <b>1</b> is plasmarized. Since the electromagnetic waves RF propagate in the horizontal direction, it is possible to suppress generation of a higher-order mode compared with a case of propagating in the vertical direction, so that the plasma intensity in the horizontal plane (particularly in the circumferential direction) is likely to be more uniform.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0049">The electromagnetic wave emission port (the tip surface <b>7</b>B<b>3</b>) extends along the circumferential direction of the processing container <b>1</b>, and the plasma intensity in the circumferential direction becomes uniform. Since the electromagnetic waves RF travel toward the center of the processing container <b>1</b>, the electromagnetic waves are superimposed and the plasma intensity increases at the center. Therefore, it is desired to reduce intensity of electromagnetic waves in the center.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0050">The groove <b>6</b> for electromagnetic wave reflection is formed on the lower surface of the outer peripheral portion of the upper electrode <b>5</b>. When the groove <b>6</b> is formed on the lower surface of the outer peripheral portion, the electromagnetic waves RF not only travel in the horizontal direction but also travel into the groove <b>6</b>, and are reflected at the deep portion of the groove <b>6</b>. In this case, the ratio at which the electromagnetic waves are absorbed increases immediately below the groove <b>6</b>. Thus, the plasma intensity in the outer peripheral portion increases, and the plasma intensity at the center decreases due to energy consumption in the outer peripheral portion. Therefore, the uniformity of the plasma intensity in the radial direction of the processing container <b>1</b> increases.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0051">The groove <b>6</b> includes an inside inner peripheral surface <b>6</b>A, an outside inner peripheral surface <b>6</b>B facing the inside inner peripheral surface <b>6</b>A, and a bottom surface <b>6</b>C located in the deep portion of the groove <b>6</b> and connecting the inside inner peripheral surface <b>6</b>A and the outside inner peripheral surface <b>6</b>B.

When the outside inner peripheral surface <b>6</b>B and the inner peripheral surface <b>1</b>A have a step therebetween rather than being flush with each other, there is a problem in that electric fields due to electromagnetic waves are concentrated to the stepped portion. Simply providing a groove creates an edge (a position where electric fields are concentrated). Electric field concentration may cause an unintended discharge or an increase of plasma intensity. When the outside inner peripheral surface and the inner peripheral surface are flush with each other, it is possible to suppress such a problem.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0053">In addition, since the plasma intensity in the groove <b>6</b> becomes high, it is desirable that the groove <b>6</b> is located far from the substrate in the horizontal direction (radial direction). This makes it possible to suppress diffusion of plasma toward the center of the processing container <b>1</b>. By providing the groove <b>6</b> in the outside of the substrate placement region, it is possible to broaden a gas hole forming region outward.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0054">A first corner portion R<b>1</b> is formed between the inside inner peripheral surface <b>6</b>A of the groove <b>6</b> and a lower opening end surface <b>52</b> of the groove <b>6</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the first corner portion R<b>1</b> has a roundness in the vertical cross section along the radial direction of the processing container <b>1</b>. When the electromagnetic waves RF propagate toward the center of the processing container <b>1</b>, it is likely that the first corner portion R<b>1</b> of the groove <b>6</b> inhibits smooth travel of the electromagnetic waves RF. When the first corner portion R<b>1</b> has a roundness (rounded shape), it is possible to suppress the inhibition of traveling of electromagnetic waves by the first corner portion R<b>1</b> and improve the in-plane uniformity of plasma intensity. A radius of curvature of the first corner portion R<b>1</b> in the vertical cross section is 50% or less of a width D and a depth L of the groove <b>6</b>. When the width D of the groove <b>6</b> is 10 mm, the radius of curvature is 5 mm or less. However, when the radius of curvature is too small, there is no effect, and when the radius of curvature is too large, electromagnetic wave energy absorbed by the processing gas in the peripheral portion becomes small. Therefore, from the viewpoints of suppressing the inhibition of traveling of electromagnetic waves and absorbing energy, the radius of curvature of the first corner portion R<b>1</b> in the vertical cross section is desirably 1 mm to 5 mm, and more specifically 1 mm to 3 mm. In this example, a diameter of the upper electrode <b>5</b> is 320 mm to 360 mm, the diameter of the substrate as a workpiece is 300 mm, and an inner diameter of the processing container <b>1</b> is 350 mm to 380 mm.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0055">The dielectric ring <b>7</b> includes a cylindrical upper dielectric <b>7</b>A and a ring-shaped lower dielectric <b>7</b>B continuous to a lower portion of the upper dielectric <b>7</b>A.

The electromagnetic wave emission port is configured with the inner surface (the tip surface <b>7</b>B<b>3</b>) of the ring-shaped lower dielectric <b>7</b>B. The electromagnetic waves RF emitted from the dielectric ring <b>7</b> have high uniformity in the circumferential direction, and thus the uniformity of the plasma intensity in the circumferential direction becomes high. The electromagnetic waves RF introduced from the upper dielectric <b>7</b>A travel in the ring-shaped lower dielectric <b>7</b>B toward the inner surface thereof. In the process of traveling in the lower dielectric <b>7</b>B, directions of electric fields due to the electromagnetic waves RF are aligned.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0056">A width WB obtained by subtracting a radial width WA of the upper dielectric <b>7</b>A from a radial width (WB+WA) of the lower dielectric <b>7</b>B of the dielectric ring <b>7</b> is 5 mm to 30 mm. That is, when the width WB is 5 mm or more, the directions of electric fields due to electromagnetic waves RF are aligned. When the width WB exceeds 30 mm, the directions of electric fields are aligned, but the intensity of electromagnetic waves is attenuated or the apparatus is enlarged</p><p id="p-0057" num="0057">Electromagnetic waves RF are introduced from a top surface <b>7</b>A<b>1</b> of the upper dielectric <b>7</b>A of the dielectric ring <b>7</b> and travel downward.

The second corner portion R<b>2</b> has a roundness in the vertical cross section along the radial direction of the processing container <b>1</b>. In the case in which the second corner portion R<b>2</b> has a roundness (rounded shape), when the electromagnetic waves RF move from the upper dielectric <b>7</b>A to the lower dielectric <b>7</b>B, the electromagnetic waves can travel more smoothly compared to the case where there is no roundness. When the roundness is too large, a path of the electromagnetic waves RF becomes narrow so that it becomes difficult for the electromagnetic waves to propagate. From the viewpoint of smooth traveling of the electromagnetic waves, a radius of curvature of the second corner portion R<b>2</b> in the vertical cross section is desirably 0.5 mm to 3 mm, and more specifically 1 mm to 2 mm.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0058">A height of the lower opening end surface <b>52</b> of the groove <b>6</b> and the top surface <b>7</b>B<b>1</b> of the lower dielectric <b>7</b>B of the dielectric ring <b>7</b> are the same (positions in the Z-axis direction are the same). That is, the electromagnetic waves RF are emitted from below the top surface <b>7</b>B<b>1</b> of the lower dielectric <b>7</b>B of the dielectric ring <b>7</b>, but the lower opening end surface <b>52</b> (the lower surface of the upper electrode) of the groove <b>6</b> and the top surface <b>7</b>B<b>1</b> of the lower dielectric <b>7</b>B have the same height.

A planar shape of this through-hole is polygonal or circular, but it may also be formed in an arcuate shape.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0085">A position where the auxiliary gas hole <b>140</b> is formed is set such that the shortest distance from the inner surface of the side wall of the upper metallic member <b>5</b>A is a distance WC. The distance WC is, for example, 0 mm to 30 mm. The processing gas is introduced into and diffused in the internal space <b>16</b>. At this time, when there is a gas flow along the inner surface of the upper metallic member <b>5</b>A, a resistance to introduction of the processing gas into the auxiliary gas hole <b>140</b> decreases as the distance WC decreases. Therefore, in such a case, in order to efficiently introduce the processing gas into the auxiliary gas hole <b>140</b>, the distance WC may be set to 0 mm. Since it is good to separate the position of the groove <b>6</b> constituting the recess from a substrate to be processed, the position of the auxiliary gas hole <b>140</b>, which is located outward of the groove <b>6</b>, affects a dimension of the processing container in the radial direction. When the distance WC is set to 0 mm, it is possible to reduce the size of the apparatus in the radial direction. In other words, for example, when the auxiliary gas hole <b>140</b> having an arcuate planar shape is used, the inner surface of the side wall of the upper metallic member <b>5</b>A and an outside inner surface of the auxiliary gas hole <b>140</b> are flush with each other.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a view illustrating a vertical cross-sectional configuration around a dielectric ring of a plasma processing apparatus according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0087">The plasma processing apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> has a configuration in which the auxiliary gas hole <b>140</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is provided outward of the groove <b>6</b> in the plasma processing apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, and the other configurations are the same as those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In this embodiment, an example in which the separation distance WC of the auxiliary gas hole <b>140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is set to 0 mm is illustrated, but it is also possible to set the distance WC to be within the same range as in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0088">Since the dimension of the upper dielectric <b>7</b>A in the dielectric ring <b>7</b> is longer than that in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and the auxiliary gas hole <b>140</b> is provided outward of the groove <b>6</b>, a length of the auxiliary gas hole <b>140</b> in the Z-axis direction is longer than that in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.

A frequency of the second radio-frequency power supply <b>13</b> may be different from that of the first radio-frequency power supply <b>11</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. With this configuration, since two frequencies can be used for plasma generation, types of controlling the electric fields in the internal space of the processing container are increased so that the in-plane distribution of plasma intensity can be controlled more precisely.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0092">The frequency of the second radio-frequency power supply <b>13</b> may be set to be lower than the frequency of the first radio-frequency power supply <b>11</b> (e.g., 2 MHz). This may function as an ion assist structure that draws ions in the plasma to a side of the substrate. This configuration is applicable to the above-described plasma processing apparatuses.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0093">A plasma processing method of the present disclosure includes a process of disposing a workpiece on the stage <b>2</b> (the lower electrode) in any one of the above-described plasma processing apparatuses, and a process of supplying a processing gas from the upper electrode <b>5</b> into the processing container <b>1</b>. The method further includes a process of introducing electromagnetic waves into the processing container <b>1</b> from the electromagnetic wave emission port (the inner tip surface of the lower portion of the dielectric ring <b>7</b>). According to this plasma processing method, since the in-plane uniformity of plasma can be improved by using the above-described plasma processing apparatuses, it is possible to execute plasma processing with high in-plane uniformity on the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0094">As an example of the plasma processing method, a pressure in the processing container is set to 0.1 Torr (13.33 Pa), and a pressure in the waveguide is set to 760 Torr (1013 hPa). A frequency of the first radio-frequency power supply <b>11</b> is set to 220 MHz, an output of the first radio-frequency power supply <b>11</b> is set to 1000 W, a distance between the substrate <b>3</b> and the upper electrode <b>5</b> is set to 60 mm, the depth L of the groove <b>6</b> is set to 6 mm, and the width D of the groove is set to 8 mm. As the plasma processing, an etching process and a deposition process are known. As etching gases of a SiO<sub>2 </sub>film or a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>film to be processed, CF, CF<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, CO, SiF<sub>6</sub>, SiCF, and the like are known. As a gas used for the deposition process such as plasma CVD, in the case of forming a Si-containing film, a silane-based gas (SiH<sub>4</sub>, Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) or the like may be used. When forming a film of a Si-containing compound (e.g., a silicon nitride), a gas including a raw material (e.g., nitrogen) of the compound may be further used.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0095">Although a frequency of the VHF band is illustrated as an example in the above-described embodiments, another frequency may be used as the frequency of the radio-frequency power supply. A frequency of the short wave (HF) band is 3 MHz to 30 MHz, and a wavelength thereof is 100 m to 10 m. A frequency of the VHF band is 30 MHz to 300 MHz, and a wavelength thereof is 10 m to 1 m. A frequency of the UHF band, which is included in the microwave band, is 300 MHz to 3 GHz and a wavelength thereof is 1 m to 10 cm. Radio-frequency waves in the VHF band tend to propagate on a surface of an electrode, especially, in a waveguide. Surface waves propagate from a peripheral edge portion of the lower surface of the upper electrode <b>5</b> toward a central portion. In the case of such a frequency band, it is effective to form the groove <b>6</b> in order to improve the uniformity of plasma intensity in the radial direction.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0096">That is, when a frequency becomes high, a wavelength becomes short. Thus, it is likely that antinodes and nodes of electric fields corresponding to the wavelength are generated along the radial direction of the processing container and the electric field distribution becomes non-uniform. In particular, plasma density in the center portion of the upper electrode <b>5</b> becomes higher than plasma density in the peripheral portion. In the central portion, a resistivity of plasma becomes low, so that a current tends to concentrate and non-uniformity of the electric field distribution tends to be further strengthened.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0097">On the other hand, by forming the groove <b>6</b> (a recess) on the upper electrode surface in the vicinity of the electromagnetic wave introduction port in the dielectric ring <b>7</b>, the effect of reflecting the electromagnetic waves and a labyrinth effect are produced. Thus, the electric fields of VHF waves introduced from the dielectric ring <b>7</b> are suppressed from being transmitted to the surface of the upper electrode <b>5</b>. Therefore, it is possible to selectively increase the plasma density in the peripheral portion of the processing container. As a result, it is possible to reduce biasing of the electric field distribution on the substrate <b>3</b> and to perform uniform plasma processing over the entire substrate <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0098">A plasma processing apparatus is an apparatus capable of performing a good reaction at a relatively low temperature. The above-described plasma processing apparatuses may be used for various types of plasma processing apparatuses such as a parallel plate type plasma processing apparatus. The plasma processing includes processes such as etching, sputtering, and deposition such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and the apparatuses according to the embodiments may be used for any process. When a gap between the upper electrode and the lower electrode is narrow, capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) is generated. On the other hand, when this gap is wide, plasma is generated in an upper space of the processing container (a chamber). It is known that the minimum value of the gap of a plasma processing apparatus is 9 mm to 13 mm. In addition, it may be considered that uniformity is improved by providing a dielectric on the lower surface of the upper electrode <b>5</b> to change a wavelength, but in this case, a distance between the electrodes changes. The above-described plasma processing apparatuses are particularly effective in a configuration in which surface wave plasma is generated.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0099">In recent years, with the miniaturization of design rules, high-density plasma processing is expected. The above-described plasma generation mechanism using radio frequency waves in the VHF band or the UHF band are useful for high-density plasma processing. The plasma processing apparatuses according to the embodiments have advantages in that the in-plane uniformity of plasma intensity can be enhanced, the outside diameter of the upper electrode <b>5</b> can be increased, and the plasma generation region and the introduction range of the processing gas can be increased.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0100">Although various exemplary embodiments have been described above, various omissions, substitutions, and changes may be made without being limited to the above-described exemplary embodiments.
