They are formulated with a phospholipid bilayer envelop that is a cell-like boundary. This enables liposomes and other nanoparticles a functional scaffold that allows in vivo integration similar to the eukaryotic cell structure.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Tumor Treating Fields, or TTFields, are low intensity (e.g., 1-3 V/cm) alternating electric fields within the intermediate frequency range (e.g., 100-500 kHz) that inhibit cancer cell growth. This non-invasive treatment targets solid tumors and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,565,205, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TTFields are FDA approved for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), and may be delivered, for example, via the Optune&#x2122; system. Optune&#x2122; includes a field generator and two pairs of transducer arrays (i.e., electrode arrays) that are placed on a patient's shaved head. One pair of electrodes is positioned to the left and right of the tumor, and the other pair of electrodes is positioned anterior and posterior to the tumor. In the preclinical setting, TTFields can be applied in vitro using, for example, the Inovitro&#x2122; TTFields lab bench system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">TTFields therapy is an approved mono-treatment for recurrent glioblastoma, and an approved combination therapy with chemotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma and unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma patients. These electric fields are induced non-invasively by transducer arrays (i.e., arrays of electrodes) placed directly on the patient's scalp. TTFields also appear to be beneficial for treating tumors in other parts of the body.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Alternating electrical fields influence dipole moment and thus can disrupt biological membranes. Therefore, administering lipid capsules while applying alternating electrical fields would disrupt phospholipid structure more efficiently at the tumor site where alternating electrical fields are applied leading to targeted treatment of lipid capsules.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disclosed are methods and compositions for using alternating electric fields to increase permeability of lipid capsules allowing for the release of a therapeutic from inside the lipid capsule.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Disclosed are methods of delivering a therapeutic to a target site of a subject comprising administering a lipid capsule to a target site of a subject, wherein the lipid capsule comprises a therapeutic agent; and applying an alternating electric field, at a frequency for a period of time, to the target site of the subject, wherein the alternating electric field releases the therapeutic from lipid capsule at the target site of the subject.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Disclosed are methods of increasing target site specific release of a therapeutic agent in a subject comprising administering a lipid capsule to a target site of a subject, wherein the lipid capsule comprises a therapeutic agent; and applying an alternating electric field, at a frequency for a period of time, to the target site of the subject, wherein the alternating electric field releases the therapeutic agent from the lipid capsule at the target site of the subject, thereby increasing the target site specific release of the therapeutic agent.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Disclosed are methods of treating comprise administering a lipid capsule to a target site of a subject in need thereof, wherein the lipid capsule comprises a therapeutic agent; and applying an alternating electric field, at a frequency for a period of time, to the target site of the subject in need thereof, wherein the alternating electric field releases the therapeutic agent from the lipid capsule at the target site of the subject in need thereof.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Disclosed are methods of killing a cell comprising administering a lipid capsule to a target site, wherein the lipid capsule comprises a therapeutic agent; and applying an alternating electric field for a period of time, to the target site, wherein the alternating electric field releases the therapeutic agent from the v at the target site, wherein the target site comprises a cell, wherein the therapeutic kills the cell.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Disclosed are drug delivery systems comprising a lipid capsule comprising a therapeutic agent; and a device capable of administering an alternating electric field.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additional advantages of the disclosed method and compositions will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be understood from the description, or may be learned by practice of the disclosed method and compositions.

It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention which will be limited only by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. In some aspects, for example, reference to &#x201c;a lipid capsule&#x201d; includes a plurality of such lipid capsules, reference to &#x201c;the lipid capsule&#x201d; is a reference to one or more lipid capsules and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As used herein, a &#x201c;target site&#x201d; is a specific site or location within or present on a subject or patient. For example, a &#x201c;target site&#x201d; can refer to, but is not limited to a cell (e.g. a cancer cell), population of cells, organ, tissue, or a tumor. In some aspects, the phrase &#x201c;target cell&#x201d; can be used to refer to target site, wherein the target site is or comprises a cell. In some aspects, organs that can be target sites include, but are not limited to, lung, brain, pancreas, abdominal organs (e.g. stomach, intestine), ovary, breast, uterus, prostate, bladder, liver, colon, or kidney. In some aspects, a target site can be a fibrotic tissue or lymph node. In some aspects, a cell or population of cells that can be a target site include, but are not limited to, lung cells, brain cells, pancreatic cells, abdominal cells, ovarian cells, liver cells, colon cells, or kidney cells. In some aspects, a &#x201c;target site&#x201d; can be a tumor target site. In some aspects, a &#x201c;target site&#x201d; can be a virus-infected cell. In some aspects, a &#x201c;target cell&#x201d; can be a cancer. In some aspects, a &#x201c;target cell&#x201d; can be a virus-infected cell.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A &#x201c;tumor target site&#x201d; is a site or location within or present on a subject or patient that comprises or is adjacent to one or more cancer cells, previously comprised one or more tumor cells, or is suspected of comprising one or more tumor cells. For example, a tumor target site can refer to a site or location within or present on a subject or patient that is prone to metastases. Additionally, a target site or tumor target site can refer to a site or location of a resection of a primary tumor within or present on a subject or patient. Additionally, a target site or tumor target site can refer to a site or location adjacent to a resection of a primary tumor within or present on a subject or patient.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, an &#x201c;alternating electric field&#x201d; or &#x201c;alternating electric fields&#x201d; refers to a very-low-intensity, directional, intermediate-frequency alternating electrical fields delivered to a subject, a sample obtained from a subject or to a specific location within a subject or patient (e.g. a target site such as a cell). In some aspects, the alternating electrical fields can be in a single direction or multiple directional. In some aspects, alternating electric fields can be delivered through two pairs of transducer arrays that generate perpendicular fields within the target site. For example, for the Optune&#x2122; system (an alternating electric fields delivery system) one pair of electrodes is located to the left and right (LR) of the target site, and the other pair of electrodes is located anterior and posterior (AP) to the target site. Cycling the field between these two directions (i.e., LR and AP) ensures that a maximal range of cell orientations is targeted.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, an &#x201c;alternating electric field&#x201d; applied to a tumor target site can be referred to as a &#x201c;tumor treating fields&#x201d; or &#x201c;TTFields.&#x201d; TTFields have been established as an anti-mitotic cancer treatment modality because they interfere with proper micro-tubule assembly during metaphase and eventually destroy the cells during telophase, cytokinesis, or subsequent interphase. TTFields target solid tumors and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,565,205, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for its teaching of TTFields</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In-vivo and in-vitro studies show that the efficacy of TTFields therapy increases as the intensity of the electrical field increases. Therefore, optimizing array placement on a subject to increase the intensity in the target site or target cell is standard practice for the Optune system. Array placement optimization may be performed by &#x201c;rule of thumb&#x201d; (e.g., placing the arrays on the subject as close to the target site or target cell as possible), measurements describing the geometry of the patient's body, target site dimensions, and/or target site or cell location. Measurements used as input may be derived from imaging data. Imaging data is intended to include any type of visual data, such as for example, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image data, x-ray computed tomography (x-ray CT) data, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, positron emission tomography (PET) data, data that can be captured by an optical instrument (e.g., a photographic camera, a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, an infrared camera, etc.), and the like. In certain implementations, image data may include 3D data obtained from or generated by a 3D scanner (e.g., point cloud data). Optimization can rely on an understanding of how the electrical field distributes within the target site or target cell as a function of the positions of the array and, in some aspects, take account for variations in the electrical property distributions within the heads of different patients.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; refers to the target of administration, e.g. an animal. Thus, the subject of the disclosed methods can be a vertebrate, such as a mammal. For example, the subject can be a human. The term does not denote a particular age or sex. A subject can be used interchangeably with &#x201c;individual&#x201d; or &#x201c;patient.&#x201d; For example, the subject of administration or exposure to can mean the recipient of the alternating electrical fields.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">By &#x201c;treat&#x201d; is meant to administer or apply a therapeutic, such as alternating electric fields and a vector, to a subject, such as a human or other mammal (for example, an animal model), that has an infection (e.g. viral) or disease (e.g. cancer) or has an increased susceptibility for developing an infection or disease, in order to prevent or delay a worsening of the effects of the disease or infection, or to partially or fully reverse the effects of the infection or disease. For example, treating a subject having cancer can comprise delivering a therapeutic to a cell in the subject.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">By &#x201c;prevent&#x201d; is meant to minimize or decrease the chance that a subject develops an infection or disease.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;administering&#x201d; and &#x201c;administration&#x201d; refer to any method of providing a therapeutic, such as an antiviral agent or anti-cancer therapeutic, to a target site or subject. Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to: oral administration, transdermal administration, administration by inhalation, nasal administration, topical administration, intravaginal administration, ophthalmic administration, intraaural administration, intracerebral administration, rectal administration, sublingual administration, buccal administration, and parenteral administration, including injectable such as intravenous administration, intra-arterial administration, intramuscular administration, and subcutaneous administration. Administration can be continuous or intermittent. In various aspects, a preparation can be administered therapeutically; that is, administered to treat an existing disease or condition. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered prophylactically; that is, administered for prevention of a disease or condition. In an aspect, the skilled person can determine an efficacious dose, an efficacious schedule, or an efficacious route of administration so as to treat a subject. In some aspects, administering comprises exposing or applying. In some aspects, exposing a target site or subject to alternating electrical fields or applying alternating electrical fields to a target site or subject means administering alternating electrical fields to the target site or subject.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; is an amount of a composition (e.g. lipid capsule comprising a therapeutic agent), that provides a therapeutic benefit to an individual or subject. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of a lipid capsule comprising a therapeutic agent is an amount that treats, alleviates, ameliorates, relieves, alleviates symptoms of, prevents, delays onset of, inhibits progression of, reduces severity of, and/or reduces incidence of a disease or infection. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of a lipid capsule comprising a therapeutic agent will result in an improvement to, or prevents or slows the worsening of, one or more indicators or symptoms of an infection or disease, such as those described herein.

For example, the lipid bilayer can comprise phospholipids.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some aspects, lipid capsules comprise dipole moment bearing molecules. The presence of the dipole moment bearing molecules allow for dipole moments, which occur when there is a separation of charge. Dipole moments can occur between two ions in an ionic bond or between atoms in a covalent bond; dipole moments can arise from differences in electronegativity. The larger the difference in electronegativity, the larger the dipole moment. Phospholipids are the building blocks of most biocompatible drug delivery systems. Phospholipids are usually structured in a bilayer since they have a hydrophilic &#x201c;head&#x201d; and a hydrophobic &#x201c;tail&#x201d;. This structure resembles a eukaryotic cell membrane. The dipole moment and cellular structure with a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic outer surface is affected by alternating electrical fields and causes an increased permeability of the membrane.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some aspects, the lipid capsule comprises an outer surface, wherein the outer surface comprises a lipid layer.

Solid lipid nanoparticle can be produced on large industrial scale by high pressure homogenization. The solid matrix of solid lipid nanoparticle can protect the active ingredient which is incorporated into it and protects from chemical degradation which ultimately increases the drug release profile. The different formulations of solid lipid nanoparticle have developed for various application routes (parenteral, oral, dermal, ocular, pulmonary, and rectal). Solid lipid nanoparticles are especially useful in ocular drug delivery as they can enhance the corneal absorption of drugs and improve the ocular bioavailability of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. Solid lipid nanoparticles are composed of 0.1% (w/w) to 30% (w/w) solid lipid dispersed in an aqueous medium and if necessary stabilized with preferably 0.5% (w/w) to 5% (w/w) surfactant.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Examples of lipid capsules that can be used in the compositions and methods described herein as well as how they can be made can include, but are not limited to the lipid capsules described in U.S. Pat.
