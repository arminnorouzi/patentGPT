In some embodiments, the insulator is configured to enhance ease and/or enjoyment of sliding a beverage container in and out of the insulator. For example, in some embodiments, an aperture disposed on a base of the beverage container may generate a whistling sound as the beverage container is inserted in and/or pulled out of the insulator.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="99.99mm" wi="120.99mm" file="US20230002141A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="142.66mm" wi="123.02mm" file="US20230002141A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="132.33mm" wi="117.52mm" file="US20230002141A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="137.84mm" wi="142.07mm" file="US20230002141A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="131.57mm" wi="146.05mm" file="US20230002141A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="126.58mm" wi="144.19mm" file="US20230002141A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="185.00mm" wi="132.42mm" file="US20230002141A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="166.96mm" wi="140.55mm" file="US20230002141A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="157.65mm" wi="145.03mm" file="US20230002141A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="187.71mm" wi="146.56mm" file="US20230002141A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="179.07mm" wi="117.69mm" file="US20230002141A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="178.73mm" wi="138.43mm" file="US20230002141A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/217,930 on filed Jul. 2, 2021, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is intended that the above-referenced application may be applicable to the concepts and embodiments disclosed herein, even if such concepts and embodiments are disclosed in the referenced applications with different limitations and configurations and described using different examples and terminology.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure generally relates to insulating housing, insulating materials, and insulating containers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some situations, insulating a container housing cold or hot liquid may be desired. For example, a canned beverage loses a substantial amount of its thermal properties minutes after removing the can from its place of storage and when being consumed. Thus, the conventional strategy is to insulate the beverage using a koozie. However, conventional koozies are opaque, obscuring any artwork and/or branding on the beverage container housed in the koozie.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additional problems with conventional koozies result from the low-quality material the koozie is made of and/or the koozie not being fully sealed/surrounded around the entirety of the canned beverage, thereby preventing maximum desired insulation. For example, many koozies are made from a cheap foam-like material and contain holes/gaps in order to be foldable. Further, these koozies are easily damaged or destroyed. Thus, there is a need for improved beverage container insulators that can reliably and repeatably enhance, rather than detract, from the drinking experience.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This brief overview is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This brief overview is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter. Nor is this brief overview intended to be used to limit the claimed subject matter's scope.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Provided herein are various embodiments of a beverage container insulator. One example embodiment of a beverage container insulator may comprise an open cavity for receiving a beverage container therein, a transparent sidewall, and a base. The transparent sidewall may have a tapered container receiving edge opposite to a tapered base receiving edge. The base may have an edge configured to connect to the base receiving edge of the sidewall. The base may have an aperture formed therein, in communication with the open cavity and configured to create a whistling sound upon a change in fluid pressure passing through the aperture.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the insulator further comprises one or more ribs formed on an inner surface of the sidewall and configured to facilitate sliding of the beverage container within the open cavity. The one or more ribs may comprise first and second ribs, extending vertically along the inner surface of the sidewall and opposite to one another.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, at least some portion of the sidewall is composed of a non-yellowing additive. In some embodiments, at least some portion of the sidewall is composed of a discoloration resistant additive. In some embodiments, the container receiving edge defines an opening diameter that is larger than a base diameter defined by the base receiving edge.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the sidewall is substantially cylindrical. In some embodiments, the base is substantially circular.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, at least one of the sidewall and the base comprises a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE).

As should be understood, any embodiment may incorporate only one or a plurality of the above-disclosed aspects of the disclosure and may further incorporate only one or a plurality of the above-disclosed features. Furthermore, any embodiment discussed and identified as being &#x201c;preferred&#x201d; is considered to be part of a best mode contemplated for carrying out the embodiments of the present disclosure. Other embodiments also may be discussed for additional illustrative purposes in providing a full and enabling disclosure. Moreover, many embodiments, such as adaptations, variations, modifications, and equivalent arrangements, will be implicitly disclosed by the embodiments described herein and fall within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Accordingly, while embodiments are described herein in detail in relation to one or more embodiments, it is to be understood that this disclosure is illustrative and exemplary of the present disclosure and are made merely for the purposes of providing a full and enabling disclosure. The detailed disclosure herein of one or more embodiments is not intended, nor is to be construed, to limit the scope of patent protection afforded in any claim of a patent issuing here from, which scope is to be defined by the claims and the equivalents thereof. It is not intended that the scope of patent protection be defined by reading into any claim a limitation found herein that does not explicitly appear in the claim itself.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, for example, any sequence(s) and/or temporal order of steps of various processes or methods that are described herein are illustrative and not restrictive. Accordingly, it should be understood that, although steps of various processes or methods may be shown and described as being in a sequence or temporal order, the steps of any such processes or methods are not limited to being carried out in any particular sequence or order, absent an indication otherwise. Indeed, the steps in such processes or methods generally may be carried out in various different sequences and orders while still falling within the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the scope of patent protection is to be defined by the issued claim(s) rather than the description set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally, it is important to note that each term used herein refers to that which an ordinary artisan would understand such term to mean based on the contextual use of such term herein. To the extent that the meaning of a term used herein&#x2014;as understood by the ordinary artisan based on the contextual use of such term-differs in any way from any particular dictionary definition of such term, it is intended that the meaning of the term as understood by the ordinary artisan should prevail.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Regarding applicability of 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 112, &#xb6;6, no claim element is intended to be read in accordance with this statutory provision unless the explicit phrase &#x201c;means for&#x201d; or &#x201c;step for&#x201d; is actually used in such claim element, whereupon this statutory provision is intended to apply in the interpretation of such claim element.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or similar elements. While many embodiments of the disclosure may be described, modifications, adaptations, and other implementations are possible. For example, substitutions, additions, or modifications may be made to the elements illustrated in the drawings, and the methods described herein may be modified by substituting, reordering, or adding stages to the disclosed methods. Accordingly, the following detailed description does not limit the disclosure. Instead, the proper scope of the disclosure is defined by the appended claims. The present disclosure contains headers. It should be understood that these headers are used as references and are not to be construed as limiting upon the subjected matter disclosed under the header.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present disclosure can be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the disclosure and the Examples included therein.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Before the present articles, systems, devices, and/or methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that they are not limited to specific manufacturing methods unless otherwise specified, or to particular materials unless otherwise specified, as such can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not intended to be limiting. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, example methods and materials are now described.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Moreover, it is to be understood that unless otherwise expressly stated, it is in no way intended that any method set forth herein be construed as requiring that its steps be performed in a specific order. Accordingly, where a method claim does not actually recite an order to be followed by its steps or it is not otherwise specifically stated in the claims or descriptions that the steps are to be limited to a specific order, it is no way intended that an order be inferred, in any respect. This holds for any possible non-express basis for interpretation, including: matters of logic with respect to arrangement of steps or operational flow; plain meaning derived from grammatical organization or punctuation; and the number or type of aspects described in the specification. Any and all publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference to disclose and describe the methods and/or materials in connection with which the publications are cited.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not intended to be limiting. As used in the specification and in the claims, the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; can include the aspects &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting essentially of.&#x201d; Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. In this specification and in the claims which follow, reference will be made to a number of terms which shall be defined herein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;an assembly&#x201d; includes two or more assemblies. Each generally denotes &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; but does not exclude a plurality unless the contextual use dictates otherwise. When used herein to join a list of items, &#x201c;or&#x201d; denotes &#x201c;at least one of the items,&#x201d; but does not exclude a plurality of items of the list. Finally, when used herein to join a list of items, &#x201c;and&#x201d; denotes &#x201c;all of the items of the list.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Ranges can be expressed herein as from one particular value, and/or to another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another aspect includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent &#x2018;about,&#x2019; it will be understood that the particular value forms another aspect. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as &#x201c;about&#x201d; that particular value in addition to the value itself. For example, if the value &#x201c;10&#x201d; is disclosed, then &#x201c;about 10&#x201d; is also disclosed. It is also understood that each unit between two particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15 are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;about&#x201d; and &#x201c;at or about&#x201d; mean that the amount or value in question can be the value designated some other value approximately or about the same. It is generally understood, as used herein, that it is the nominal value indicated &#xb1;10% variation unless otherwise indicated or inferred. The term is intended to convey that similar values promote equivalent results or effects recited in the claims.

For example, the insulator may be composed of a transparent material that enables the consumer to see the label and type of beverage being consumed. In some embodiments, the insulator optically enhances images and/or text on the beverage container housed therein. For example, a sidewall of the insulator may act as a lens, magnifying the beverage container. The insulator may be sufficiently firm to ensure durability over multiple uses, and/or sufficiently pliable to enable users to deform the insulator and enjoy a &#x201c;cushy&#x201d; feeling while holding the insulator. A top, receiving edge of the insulator may be tapered, further facilitating handling of the insulator. In some embodiments, the insulator is configured to enhance ease and/or enjoyment of sliding a beverage container in and out of the insulator. For example, in some embodiments, an aperture disposed on a base of the beverage container may generate a whistling sound as the beverage container is inserted in and/or pulled out of the insulator. In some embodiments, ribs formed along an inner sidewall of the insulator may facilitate sliding the beverage container in and out of the insulator.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">To accomplish these and other objectives, the insulator may be manufactured using a variety of materials, e.g., Thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), Thermoplastic urethane (TPU), silicone, or the like. In some embodiments, the insulator is manufactured from a combination of materials. Where TPU is used, the TPU material may have discoloration resistant properties. In other embodiments, non-yellowing or other discoloration resistant additives may be included in the insulator to ensure transparency over time. In some embodiments, an inner surface of the insulator may include a lubricant to facilitate sliding of a beverage container in and out of the insulator, e.g., liquid silicone. At least some portion of the insulator (e.g., a bottom outside perimeter, an exterior side surface, etc.) may be configured to allow for the printing and/or adherence of messages and/or logos by third parties.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Details with regards to each component of the invention is provided below.

In some embodiments, the housing <b>100</b> may comprise a base <b>105</b> and a sidewall <b>110</b> extending axially upwards from the base portion <b>105</b>. Inner surfaces of the base <b>105</b> and the sidewall <b>110</b> may define an open cavity <b>135</b> for receiving a beverage container therein.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0054">a.

In some embodiments, the sidewall <b>110</b> may act as a lens to magnify one or more components of the beverage container <b>1000</b> housed therein.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0056">The sidewall <b>110</b> may be any shape suitable for gripping within a consumer's hand. In the illustrated embodiment, the sidewall <b>110</b> is substantially cylindrically-shaped. In some embodiments, to further facilitate the consumer's tactile experience, at least one edge of the hollow cylinder defined by the sidewall <b>110</b> is tapered. For example, a container receiving edge <b>125</b>, which defines an open rim of the housing <b>110</b> for inserting and removing a beverage container, may be tapered. In addition or alternatively, a base receiving edge <b>115</b> opposite to the container receiving edge <b>125</b> may be tapered. Where both the container receiving edge <b>125</b> and the base receiving edge <b>115</b> are tapered, as in the illustrated embodiment, the insulator <b>100</b> is substantially devoid of any sharp edges to ensure the consumer's comfort while handling the insulator <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0057">The sidewall <b>110</b> may have one or more features thereon configured to assist with sliding the beverage container <b>1000</b> in and out of the cavity <b>135</b>. For example, in some embodiments, a first diameter defined by the receiving edge <b>125</b> may be larger than a second diameter formed by the base receiving edge <b>115</b>. A difference between the first and second diameters may be in a range of about 0.1 to 1 mm.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0058">In some embodiments, the sidewall <b>110</b> may be sufficiently pliable such that opposing portions of an inner sidewall surface <b>111</b> come into contact with one another when a consumer squeezes the housing <b>100</b> in their hand. This &#x201c;cushy&#x201d; feeling may enhance the consumer's tactile experience while holding the insulator <b>100</b>, and/or may facilitate storage of the insulator <b>100</b> when not in use.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0059">Dimensions of the sidewall <b>111</b> may vary according to a size of the beverage container to be housed therein and/or to meet insulation requirements. For example, the sidewall <b>111</b> may be sufficiently wide to ensure sufficient insulation and/or comfort while gripping the housing <b>100</b>. By way of non-limiting example, a thickness of the sidewall <b>111</b> may be in a range of about 0.2 to 1 inch. A height of the sidewall <b>111</b>, measured along a longitudinal axis of the housing <b>100</b>, may be in a range of about 3 to 10 inches. In some embodiments, the height of the sidewall corresponds to a standard sized beer can, e.g., a 12 ounce beer can, a 16 ounce beer can, etc.<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0060">b.

The aperture <b>140</b> may be used as a means to disfavor suction and/or a sealing ability of the beverage container while received and/or housed in the housing <b>100</b>. The aperture <b>140</b> may, in some instances, allow for an audible sound to be created during the receiving and/or removal of a liquid holding container into and/or from the housing <b>100</b>. The audible sound may occur via varying air and/or fluid pressure and/or air and/or fluid being inserted and/or expelled from the space between the liquid holding container and the housing <b>100</b>.
