In some embodiments the presence of such particles may cause the surface of layer <b>30</b> to exhibit texture, in layer <b>30</b> as made. In other embodiments, such particles may cause texture to form e.g. upon organic polymeric material being removed from the surface of layer <b>30</b> (e.g. by reactive ion etching) while the inorganic particles remain in place, as noted earlier herein. In a variation of such approaches, an inorganic material may be deposited onto a major surface of layer <b>30</b> e.g. by plasma deposition, concurrent with an organic material removal (e.g. reactive ion etching) process, to achieve similar affects. Such arrangements are discussed in U.S. patent Ser.

For example, some textures (depending e.g. on the dimensions of the various structures relative to the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation) may enhance the passive cooling effects achieved by reflective layer <b>10</b> and by cooling film <b>1</b> as a whole. Furthermore, in instances in which cooling film <b>1</b> is applied e.g. to an exterior surface of a vehicle, the texturing may achieve drag reduction. That is, the presence of micro and/or nano structures may result in a lowered coefficient of friction between the surface <b>31</b> and the air through which the vehicle is moving, which can result in cost and/or fuel savings. In some embodiments an antistatic agent or agents may also be incorporated into the antisoiling layer to reduce unwanted attraction of dust, dirt, and debris. Ionic antistatic agents (e.g., under the trade designation 3M IONIC LIQUID ANTI-STAT FC-4400 or 3M IONIC LIQUID ANTI-STAT FC-5000 available from 3M Company) may be incorporated into e.g. PVDF fluoropolymer layers to provide static dissipation.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0131">As noted, in some embodiments a tie layer <b>15</b> may be provided e.g. to enhance the bonding of a metal layer <b>10</b> to an antisoiling layer <b>30</b>.

Also as noted earlier, in some embodiments a layer <b>20</b> of adhesive, e.g. pressure-sensitive adhesive, may be used to affix a reflective metal foil or sheet <b>10</b> to antisoiling layer <b>30</b> in forming cooling film <b>1</b>, in the general manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. Such an adhesive layer may comprise any adhesive (e.g., thermosetting adhesive, hot melt adhesive, and/or pressure-sensitive adhesive). In some convenient embodiments, such an adhesive layer may be a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer. In some embodiments, the adhesive may be resistant to ultraviolet radiation damage (either inherently, or due to the presence of an added UV-stabilizer). Exemplary adhesives which are typically resistant to ultraviolet radiation damage include silicone adhesives and acrylic adhesives containing UV-stabilizing/absorbing/blocking additive(s). In some embodiments, any such adhesive layer may comprise thermally-conductive particles to aid in heat transfer. Exemplary thermally-conductive particles include aluminum oxide particles, alumina nanoparticles, hexagonal boron nitride particles and agglomerates (e.g., available as 3M BORON DINITRIDE from 3M Company), graphene particles, graphene oxide particles, metal particles, and combinations thereof. An adhesive layer <b>40</b> that is to be used to bond cooling film <b>1</b> to a substrate <b>50</b> may be supplied bearing a release liner on its inward surface (that is, the surface that will be bonded to the substrate after removal of the release liner). A release liner may comprise, for example, a polyolefin film, a fluoropolymer film, a coated PET film, or a siliconized film or paper. (Of course, if cooling film <b>1</b> is supplied already bonded to a substrate, no such release liner may be needed other than for processing in the factory.)</p><p id="p-0136" num="0133">If an adhesive layer is to rely on a pressure sensitive adhesive (&#x201c;PSA&#x201d;), the pressure sensitive adhesive may be of any suitable composition. PSAs are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art to possess properties including the following: (1) aggressive and permanent tack, (2) adherence with no more than finger pressure, (3) sufficient ability to hold onto an adherend, and (4) sufficient cohesive strength to be cleanly removable from the adherend. Materials that have been found to function well as PSAs are polymers designed and formulated to exhibit the requisite viscoelastic properties resulting in a desired balance of tack, peel adhesion, and shear holding power.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0134">One method useful for identifying pressure sensitive adhesives is the Dahlquist criterion.

UV-blocking additives will now be further discussed in general.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0150">Any such additive that, when present in a layer and whether acting alone or in concert with some other additive, acts to block (e.g., mitigate or reduce) the effect of UV radiation on that layer and/or on a UV-susceptible layer positioned inward thereof, will be referred to herein as a UV-blocking additive. (As noted, such terminology encompasses additives that may be commonly referred to as e.g. UV-absorbing, UV-scattering, and UV-stabilizing.)</p><p id="p-0154" num="0151">In some embodiments, a UV-blocking additive may have properties (e.g. wavelength-specific extinction coefficient, absorbance and/or/transmittance, etc.) that allow the additive to convert impinging UV radiation to heat which is then dissipated. (Such additives are often referred to as UV-absorbers.) In some embodiments, such a layer may include additives that act synergistically with a UV-absorber to enhance the performance of the UV-absorber. Such additives include many materials that are known as light-stabilizers or UV-stabilizers (e.g., hindered-amine light stabilizers or HALS). Various additives, of various categories, are mentioned in detail herein.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0152">As noted above, UV-blockers as disclosed herein encompass those compounds known as UV absorbers (UVAs) and those compounds known as UV-stabilizers, in particular Hindered Amine Light Stabilizers (HALS) that can, for example, intervene in the prevention of photo-oxidation degradation of various polymers. Exemplary UVAs include benzophenones, benzotriazoles, and benzotriazines. Commercially available UVAs also include those available as TINUVIN 1577 and TINUVIN 1600 from BASF Corporation, Florham Park, N.J. Another exemplary UV absorber is available, for example, in a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) UVA master batch from Sukano Polymers Corporation, Duncan, S.C., under the trade designation &#x201c;TA11-10 MB03.&#x201d; Exemplary HALS compounds include those available as CHIMMASORB 944 and TINUVIN 123 from BASF Corporation. Another exemplary HALS is available, for example, from BASF Corp., under the trade designation &#x201c;TINUVIN 944.&#x201d; As noted, in some instances a HALS may synergistically enhance the performance of a UVA.

As noted, UV-blockers that may be particularly suitable for being incorporated into a fluoropolymer layer include e.g. the materials described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,670,300 (Olson et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 10,125,251 (Olson). Other UV-blocking additives may be included in the fluoropolymer layers. For example, small particle non-pigmentary zinc oxide and titanium oxide can be used. Nanoscale particles of zinc oxide, calcium carbonate, and barium sulfate may scatter UV-light (and may be somewhat reflective) while being transparent to visible and near infrared light. Small zinc oxide and barium sulfate particles in the size range of 10-100 nanometers can scatter or reflect UV-radiation are available, for example, from Kobo Products Inc., South Plainfield, N.J.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0153">In some embodiments, a UV-absorbing additive may be a red shifted UV absorber (RUVA) that, for example, absorbs at least 70% (in some embodiments, at least 80%, or even at least 90%) of the UV light in the wavelength region from 180 nm to 400 nm. A RUVA may have enhanced spectral coverage in the long-wave UV region (i.e., 300 nm to 400 nm), enabling it to block long-wavelength UV light.

Absorption in the aforementioned atmospheric window may be particularly effective in facilitating cooling at night by radiating or emitting infrared light in the previously-mentioned atmospheric window (noting that according to Kirchoff's Law, an item that exhibits high absorption in a particular wavelength range will also exhibit high emissivity in that wavelength range). Energy may also be radiated or emitted during the day to some degree.
