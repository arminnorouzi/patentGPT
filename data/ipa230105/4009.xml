Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a wearable display device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Previously, a head mounted display (HMD) is known as a wearable display device that is detachably worn by a user on a head and directly projects an image displayed on an image display unit onto the eyes of the user. The HMD is used in a wide variety of applications, for example, as a display device for remote assistance of an industrial device, a medical device, etc., in addition to viewing content video such as a DVD or a video.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, in a case where an instruction is received from a support person at a remote place, a worker wears an HMD including a camera, and images an external scene including a target subject with the camera. When the external scene imaged by the camera is displayed on a monitor, etc., on the support person side, assistance from a remote place is performed in which an appropriate instruction is provided from the support person to the worker by voice or video.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a case where the worker performs actual work, when the image display unit is disposed in front of the eye, a field of view of the worker is blocked and efficiency of the work is reduced. Therefore, it is desirable to move the image display unit to a position away from the eyes of the worker. For example, JP-A-2016-212320 discloses an HMD that can be moved from a position corresponding to the eyes of a worker to a position outside the field of view by flipping up an image display unit while the HMD is worn.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the HMD disclosed in JP-A-2016-212320, the camera is provided at the image display unit, and thus when the image display unit is flipped up, the camera moves together with the image display unit. At this time, since the range of the external scene imaged by the camera changes before and after the image display unit is flipped up, the subject of the work is deviated from the imaging range of the camera. Therefore, there is a problem that the external scene imaged after the image display unit is flipped up is not intended by a support person at a remote place.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve the problem described above, according to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a wearable display device including a mounting unit, an image display unit that displays an image, a frame that supports the image display unit, an imaging unit that is supported by the frame and that captures an external scene, a coupling unit that connects the frame and the mounting unit in a manner that a position of the image display unit with respect to the mounting unit changes from one side to another side in a first direction, and a driving unit that changes an angle of the imaging unit to tilt the imaging unit toward the one side in the first direction when the position of the image display unit is changed from the one side to the other side in the first direction.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a diagram illustrating a usage state of an HMD of a first exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a front view illustrating a configuration of a main part of the HMD.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an electrical configuration of the HMD.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a change in a position of an imaging unit before and after flip-up.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a control method related to an inclination of the imaging unit.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a usage state of an HMD of a second exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a change in a position of the imaging unit before and after flip-up.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration in which the image display unit faces diagonally upward during the flip-up.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a usage state of an HMD of a third exemplary embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Note that, in the drawings used for the following descriptions, characteristic portions are expanded for convenience to make characteristics easily comprehensible in some cases, thus dimension ratios among respective constituent elements or the like are not necessarily the same as actual dimension ratios.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Exemplary Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A wearable display device according to the present exemplary embodiment is an example of a head mounted display used by being worn on a head.

The mounting unit <b>101</b> of the present exemplary embodiment has a helmet shape covering the entire head HD of the worker M, but the shape of the mounting unit <b>101</b> is not limited thereto. For example, it can be a hair band shape worn on the head HD of the worker M. In this case, the hair band shape is configured by a mounting base portion provided on the +X side of the head HD of the worker M and a belt portion linked to the mounting base portion.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The image display unit <b>102</b> displays images corresponding to both eyes EY of the worker M. The image displayed at the image display unit <b>102</b> is, for example, an image related to a work transmitted from a support person (hereinafter, simply referred to as an operator) at a remote place. The worker M can perform smooth operation by being assisted by the operator with reference to the image displayed at the image display unit <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Note that the image display unit <b>102</b> may be a see-through type (transmission type), or may be non-transmission type.

The driving unit <b>106</b> rotates a shaft portion of the imaging unit <b>104</b> supported by the frame <b>103</b> to change an orientation of the imaging unit <b>104</b> with respect to the image display unit <b>102</b> supported by the frame <b>103</b>. In the present exemplary embodiment, the imaging unit <b>104</b> is pivotable in the vertical direction Z about a rotational axis along the left-right direction Y.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The coupling unit <b>105</b> is a member that couples the frame <b>103</b> and the mounting unit <b>101</b> such that the position of the image display unit <b>102</b> with respect to the mounting unit <b>101</b> in the vertical direction Z is changeable. The coupling unit <b>105</b> rotates about a rotational axis extending in the left-right direction Y orthogonal to the vertical direction Z, and thus changes the position of the image display unit <b>102</b> with respect to the mounting unit <b>101</b> in the vertical direction Z. In the present exemplary embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the coupling units <b>105</b> are provided on both sides of the frame <b>103</b> in the left-right direction Y.

Hereinafter, a state in which the image display unit <b>102</b> is moved from the first position P<b>1</b> to the second position P<b>2</b> by being flipped up is referred to as &#x201c;flip-up&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, when the worker M lifts the frame <b>103</b> diagonally upward, the first linkage portion <b>105</b><i>a </i>rotates to the one side (upper side) about the first rotational shaft O<b>1</b>, so that the coupling unit <b>105</b> moves upward. At this time, the frame <b>103</b> linked to the second linkage portion <b>105</b><i>b </i>of the coupling unit <b>105</b> is rotated downward about the second rotational shaft O<b>2</b>. Then, the image display unit <b>102</b> is brought into a flip-up state by moving up until the coupling unit <b>105</b> becomes parallel to the front-rear direction X.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the HMD <b>100</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment, in a state in which the image display unit <b>102</b> is flip-up, a fixing mechanism is employed that fixes the positions of the mounting unit <b>101</b> and the first linkage portion <b>105</b><i>a </i>and the positions of the frame <b>103</b> and the second linkage portion <b>105</b><i>b</i>. In this manner, when the image display unit <b>102</b> is flip-up, the image display unit <b>102</b> is stably supported by the fixing mechanism. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress the position of the image display unit <b>102</b> from being shifted, and the work of the worker M is not disturbed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an electrical configuration of the HMD <b>100</b> of the present exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the HMD <b>100</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment further includes a controller (control unit) <b>110</b> that controls operation of each configuration, and a position detection unit <b>107</b>.

The controller <b>110</b> of the present exemplary embodiment functions as a control unit for controlling the drive of the entire HMD <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the present exemplary embodiment, the controller <b>110</b> controls the inclination of the imaging unit <b>104</b> by driving the driving unit <b>106</b> based on the position of the image display unit <b>102</b> with respect to the mounting unit <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The position detection unit <b>107</b> is a sensor that detects a position of the image display unit <b>102</b> with respect to the mounting unit <b>101</b>. In a case of the present exemplary embodiment, the position detection unit <b>107</b> is provided, for example, at a position facing the eyebrows of the worker M in the frame <b>103</b>. The position detection unit <b>107</b> includes, for example, a photo sensor. The position detection unit <b>107</b> detects the state before the flip-up by receiving the reflected light from the worker M, and detects the state after the flip-up by not receiving the reflected light from the worker M. In this manner, the position detection unit <b>107</b> can detect a change in the position of the image display unit <b>102</b> before and after the flip-up. Note that a gyro sensor or a magnetic sensor may be used as the position detection unit <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The imaging unit <b>104</b> images the external scene including a subject to work by the worker M. The imaging unit <b>104</b> of the present exemplary embodiment has a focus function for adjusting a focus to the subject of work. In the present exemplary embodiment, the imaging unit <b>104</b> can acquire a distance from the imaging unit <b>104</b> to the subject to work by the worker M by using the focus function. The imaging unit <b>104</b> transmits, to the controller <b>110</b>, data related to the distance to the target subject along with the image of the imaged external scene.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The controller <b>110</b> transmits an image of the external scene transmitted from the imaging unit <b>104</b> to a host device (not illustrated), for example, by radio.

Here, the angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> corresponds to the change amount in the orientation of the imaging unit <b>104</b> after the flip-up (the change amount in the inclination diagonally upward). Note that, although the angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is appropriately set based on the design value of the coupling structure between the coupling unit and the mounting unit, it is generally desirable to set the angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> to the range of 0&#xb0; to 45&#xb0;.
