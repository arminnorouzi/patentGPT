FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a triazine ring-containing polymer and a film forming composition containing the same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">In recent years, there have been demands for highly functional polymer material, in developing electronic devices such as liquid crystal display, organic electroluminescence (EL) element (organic EL display and organic EL lighting), touch panel, optical semiconductor (LED) element, solid-state image sensor, organic thin-film solar cell, dye-sensitized solar cell, and organic thin-film transistor (TFT).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Specific properties required therefor include 1) heat resistance, 2) transparency, 3) high refractive index, 4) high solubility, 5) low volume shrinkage, 6) hot-humid resistance, and 7) high film hardness.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">In this regard, the present applicant has already found that a polymer that contains a repeating unit having a triazine ring and an aromatic ring demonstrates a high refractive index; that such polymer can achieve, solely by itself, high heat resistance, high transparency, high refractive index, high solubility, and low volume shrinkage; and that the polymer is therefore suitable for a film-forming composition when manufacturing the electronic devices (Patent Literature 1).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">A planarization layer or a light scattering layer, for example, of the organic EL lighting has been formed usually by coating, with use of a composition prepared by dissolving a high refractive index material in an organic solvent, occasionally prohibiting use of a high polarity solvent on some sort of transparent electroconductive film.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Another problem can arise when coating a film-forming composition that contains a high refractive index polymer with use of a coater, occasionally followed by line cleaning of the device with use a low-polarity solvent, the line would be clogged if the polymer is less soluble to such solvent. Furthermore, when exposing the film to the solvent during manufacture of the electronic device, the formed film would get cracks under some condition, calling for further improvement in the durability.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Patent Literature 1: WO 2010/128661</p><heading

aforementioned circumstances, and an object of which is to provide a triazine ring-containing polymer capable of forming a film that has high refractive index and excels in transparency and solvent resistance (crack resistance), and is highly soluble in various organic solvents such as low-polarity solvent, hydrophobic solvent, and low-boiling point solvent; and a film-forming composition containing the same.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0009">After thorough investigations aimed at achieving the object, the present inventors have
