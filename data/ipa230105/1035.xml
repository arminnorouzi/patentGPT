The loading coil <b>233</b> is capable of generating the magnetic field by current supplied by the power supply <b>231</b>. The control circuit <b>232</b> is used to adjust the parameters (e.g., current magnitude, direction or AC frequency, etc.) of the current supplied by the power supply <b>231</b>, thereby controlling the magnitude of the magnetic field generated by the loading coil <b>233</b>. In this embodiment, the power supply <b>231</b> can be a wireless power supply, a USB power supply, or a conventional household AC power supply, but is not limited hereto. As long as the current can be introduced to the loading coil <b>233</b> through the control circuit <b>232</b>, any type of power supply is acceptable.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The electromagnetically heated scented candle <b>3</b> is disposed on the top surface <b>211</b> of the casing <b>21</b>, and includes a container <b>31</b> and a scented candle body <b>32</b>. The container <b>31</b> includes a bottom wall <b>311</b> contactable with the top surface <b>211</b> of the casing <b>21</b>, and a surrounding wall <b>312</b> extending upwardly from a periphery of the bottom wall <b>311</b>. The bottom wall <b>311</b> and the surrounding wall <b>312</b> cooperatively define a receiving space <b>313</b>. The scented candle body <b>32</b> is wickless and is received in the receiving space <b>313</b>. The bottom wall <b>311</b> has a thickness equal to or different from that of the surrounding wall <b>312</b>. To facilitate heat conduction, at least the bottom wall <b>311</b> or the container <b>13</b> can be made of a material with good thermal conductivity. In this embodiment, the bottom wall <b>311</b> is made of a metal material, but not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The magnetically conductive heating member <b>4</b> is disposed between the top surface <b>211</b> of the casing <b>21</b> and the bottom wall <b>311</b> of the container <b>31</b>. The magnetically conductive heating member <b>4</b> generates heat energy after interacting with the magnetic field of the electromagnetic unit <b>23</b> for heating the scented candle body <b>32</b>. In this embodiment, the magnetically conductive member <b>4</b> is exemplified as a magnetic spacer. The magnetically conductive member <b>4</b> may be made of a stainless steel or ferrite magnetic material. A surface area of the magnetically conductive member <b>4</b> is substantially same as a surface area of the bottom wall <b>311</b> of the container <b>31</b> of the electromagnetically heated scented candle <b>3</b>. However, in actual practice, the surface area of the magnetically conductive member <b>4</b> may be greater or smaller than the surface area of the bottom wall <b>311</b> of the container <b>31</b>. As long as the bottom wall <b>311</b> can be uniformly heated, there is no particular limitation to the size of the surface area of the magnetically conductive member <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To use the scented candle device <b>200</b>, the magnetically conductive member <b>4</b> is first disposed on the top surface <b>211</b> of the casing <b>21</b>, after which the electromagnetically heated scented candle <b>3</b> is placed on top thereof, so that the magnetically conductive member <b>4</b> is directly in contact with the bottom wall <b>311</b> of the container <b>31</b> of the electromagnetically heated scented candle <b>3</b>. Next, the power supply <b>231</b> is activated, and the current supplied by the power supply <b>231</b> is introduced to the loading coil <b>233</b> through the control circuit <b>232</b>, so that the loading coil <b>233</b> can generate an alternating magnetic field, and an eddy current is generated by the electromagnetically conductive member <b>4</b> disposed adjacent to the loading coil <b>233</b> and the alternating magnetic field due to electromagnetic induction. Based on the impedance of the electromagnetically conductive member <b>4</b> itself, a heating effect of current occurs to generate heat.

Further, in comparison with the conventional scented candle that requires the open flame to lit it so that it is unevenly heated, because the electromagnetically conductive member <b>4</b> directly contacts the bottom wall <b>311</b> of the container <b>31</b> of the electromagnetically heated scented candle <b>3</b>, the heat energy generated by the electromagnetically conductive member <b>4</b> can be evenly distributed to the bottom wall <b>311</b> and transferred to the scented candle body <b>32</b>, so that the scented candle body <b>32</b> can be evenly heated, and the fragrance thereof can be uniformly diffused into the environment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a scented candle device <b>200</b>&#x2032; according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure.

A surface area of the bottom surface <b>3111</b> may be equal to or different from that of the magnetically conductive heating member <b>4</b>. It should be noted that the magnetically conductive heating member <b>4</b> can be fixed to or removably connected to the bottom surface <b>3111</b> through different methods, such as bonding, embedding, snapping, etc. Since the detailed structures and implementations of these joining methods are well known to those in the relevant technical field, a detailed description thereof is omitted herein for the sake of brevity.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this embodiment, the electromagnetically heated scented candle <b>3</b> is disposed on the top surface <b>211</b> of the casing <b>21</b> of the electromagnetic base <b>2</b> through the magnetically conductive heating member <b>4</b> that is connected to the bottom wall <b>311</b> of the container <b>31</b>.
