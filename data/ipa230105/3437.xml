The vacuum adiabatic body may reduce heat transfer by convection and conduction, and hence is applied to heating apparatuses and refrigerating apparatuses. In a typical adiabatic method applied to a refrigerator, although it is differently applied in refrigeration and freezing, a foam urethane adiabatic wall having a thickness of about 30 cm or more is generally provided. However, the internal volume of the refrigerator may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to increase the internal volume of a refrigerator, there is an attempt to apply a vacuum adiabatic body to the refrigerator.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">First, Korean Patent No. 10-0343719 (Cited Document 1) of the present applicant has been disclosed. According to Reference Document 1, there is disclosed a method in which a vacuum adiabatic panel is prepared and then built in walls of a refrigerator, and the exterior of the vacuum adiabatic panel is finished with a separate molding such as Styrofoam. According to the method, additional foaming is not required, and the adiabatic performance of the refrigerator is improved. However, fabrication cost is increased, and a fabrication method is complicated. As another example, a technique of providing walls using a vacuum adiabatic material and additionally providing adiabatic walls using a foam filling material has been disclosed in Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2015-0012712 (Cited Document 2). According to Reference Document 2, fabrication cost is increased, and a fabrication method is complicated.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As further another example, there is an attempt to fabricate all walls of a refrigerator using a vacuum adiabatic body that is a single product. For example, a technique of providing an adiabatic structure of a refrigerator to be in a vacuum state has been disclosed in U.S. Patent Laid-Open Publication No. US 2004/0226956 A1 (Cited Document 3). However, it is difficult to obtain a practical adiabatic effect by providing a wall of the refrigerator with a sufficient vacuum. It may be difficult to prevent a heat transfer phenomenon at a contact portion between an outer case and an inner case having different temperatures, to maintain a stable vacuum state, and to prevent deformation of a case due to a negative pressure of the vacuum state. Due to these limitations, the technology disclosed in Reference Document 3 is limited to a cryogenic refrigerator, and does not provide a level of technology applicable to general households.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present applicant had filed Patent Application No. 10-2015-0109727 in consideration of the above-described limitations. In the above document, a refrigerator including a vacuum adiabatic body is proposed. Particularly, a resin material that is adequate for a material for forming a supporting unit of the vacuum adiabatic body is proposed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Even in this document, there is a limitation that the shape of the supporting unit is different from that of the design, it is difficult to manufacture and handle the supporting unit, the yield of the product is low, the assembling work is difficult, and an amount of resin used is large to increase in outgassing.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments provide a vacuum adiabatic body in which an amount of outgassing within a vacuum space part is reduced.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments also provide a vacuum adiabatic body in which heat transfer is minimized through a supporting unit.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments also provide a vacuum adiabatic body in which an internal configuration of a vacuum space part is optimized to improve convenience in manufacturing.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, a vacuum adiabatic body includes a supporting unit configured to maintain a vacuum space part. The supporting unit includes a support plate supported on an inner surface of one of a first plate member and a second plate member and a bar extending from the support plate, the bar point-contacting an inner surface of the other of the first plate member and the second plate member. The other end of the plate member-side bar has a cross-section less than that of one end of the support plate-side bar. Thus, a heat transfer amount may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Since the inside of the bar is empty, an occurrence of outgassing and thermal conductivity may be further reduced.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, a refrigerator includes a main body configured to provide an internal space in which goods or items are stored and a door provided to open and close the main body from an external space. At least one of the door or the main body includes a vacuum adiabatic body. The vacuum adiabatic body includes a supporting unit configured to maintain a vacuum space part within the vacuum adiabatic body. The supporting unit includes a support plate supported on an inner surface of the second plate member and a bar extending from the support plate, the bar directly contacting the first plate member. Thus, thermal conductivity may be reduced to further reduce outgassing.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment, a vacuum adiabatic body includes a supporting unit configured to maintain a vacuum space. The supporting unit includes a support plate supported on an inner surface of one of the first plate member and the second plate member and a bar extending from the support plate, the bar contacting an inner surface of the other of the first plate member and the second plate member. Thus, an amount of resin used in the supporting unit may be further reduced to reduce costs, reducing outgassing, reducing a weight, reducing a heat transfer amount, simplifying a structure, and improving convenience of assembly.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the embodiments, since the amount of the resin used in the vacuum space part is reduced, the amount of outgassing inside the vacuum space part may be reduced, and the service life of the product may be prolonged even when used for a long period of time.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the embodiments, the contact points of the supporting unit for transferring heat to the inner and outer plate members may be reduced to improve the sectional structure, thereby minimizing the thermal conductivity through the supporting unit and improving the heat adiabatic function of the vacuum adiabatic body.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the embodiments, the radiation resistance sheets may be coupled to each other and are supported by the supporting unit together with the coupling to facilitate the integration of the structures in the vacuum space part and reduce the labor of the operator.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of

The vacuum adiabatic body and the refrigerator of the embodiment do not exclude that another adiabatic means is further provided to at least one side of the vacuum adiabatic body. Therefore, an adiabatic means using foaming or the like may be further provided to another side of the vacuum adiabatic body.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The heat resistance unit may include a conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> or <b>63</b> that resists conduction of heat transferred along a wall of a third space <b>50</b> and may further include a side frame coupled to the conductive resistance sheet.

The radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b> and the porous material will be clarified by the following description.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> are views illustrating various embodiments of an internal configuration of the vacuum space part or third space <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the vacuum space part <b>50</b> may have a pressure different from that of each of the first and second spaces, preferably, a vacuum state, thereby reducing an adiabatic loss. The vacuum space part <b>50</b> may be provided at a temperature between the temperature of the first space and the temperature of the second space. Since the vacuum space part <b>50</b> is provided as a space in the vacuum state, the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> receive a force contracting in a direction in which they approach each other due to a force corresponding to a pressure difference between the first and second spaces. Therefore, the vacuum space part <b>50</b> may be deformed in a direction in which it is reduced. In this case, the adiabatic loss may be caused due to an increase in amount of heat radiation, caused by the contraction of the vacuum space part <b>50</b>, and an increase in amount of thermal or heat conduction, caused by contact between the plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The supporting unit or support <b>30</b> may be provided to reduce deformation of the vacuum space part <b>50</b>. The supporting unit <b>30</b> includes a bar <b>31</b>. The bar <b>31</b> may extend in a substantially vertical direction with respect to the plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> to support a distance between the first plate member <b>10</b> and the second plate member <b>20</b>. A support plate <b>35</b> may be additionally provided on at least any one end of the bar <b>31</b>. The support plate <b>35</b> may connect at least two or more bars <b>31</b> to each other to extend in a horizontal direction with respect to the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. The support plate <b>35</b> may be provided in a plate shape or may be provided in a lattice shape so that an area of the support plate contacting the first or second plate member <b>10</b> or <b>20</b> decreases, thereby reducing heat transfer. The bars <b>31</b> and the support plate <b>35</b> are fixed to each other at at least one portion, to be inserted together between the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. The support plate <b>35</b> contacts at least one of the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, thereby preventing deformation of the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. In addition, based on the extending direction of the bars <b>31</b>, a total sectional area of the support plate <b>35</b> is provided to be greater than that of the bars <b>31</b>, so that heat transferred through the bars <b>31</b> may be diffused through the support plate <b>35</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A material of the supporting unit <b>30</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The supporting unit <b>30</b> may have a high compressive strength so as to endure the vacuum pressure, a low outgassing rate and a low water absorption rate so as to maintain the vacuum state, a low thermal conductivity so as to reduce the thermal or heat conduction between the plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. Also, the supporting unit <b>30</b> may have a secure compressive strength at a high temperature so as to endure a high-temperature exhaust process, have an excellent machinability so as to be subjected to molding, and have a low cost for molding. Here, the time required to perform the exhaust process takes about a few days. Hence, the time is reduced, thereby considerably improving fabrication cost and productivity. Therefore, the compressive strength is to be secured at the high temperature because an exhaust speed is increased as a temperature at which the exhaust process is performed becomes higher. The inventor has performed various examinations under the above-described conditions.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">First, ceramic or glass has a low outgassing rate and a low water absorption rate, but its machinability is remarkably lowered. Hence, ceramic and glass may not be used as the material of the supporting unit <b>30</b>. Resin may be considered as the material of the supporting unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating results obtained by examining resins.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the present inventor has examined various resins, and most of the resins may not be used because their outgassing rates and water absorption rates are remarkably high. Accordingly, the present inventor has examined resins that approximately satisfy conditions of the outgassing rate and the water absorption rate. As a result, polyethylene (PE) may not be used due to its high outgassing rate and its low compressive strength. Polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) may not be used due to its remarkably high price. Polyether ether ketone PEEK may not be used due to its high outgassing rate. A resin selected from the group consisting of polycarbonate (PC), glass fiber PC, low outgassing PC, polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), and liquid crystal polymer (LCP) may be used as the material of the supporting unit <b>30</b>. However, an outgassing rate of PC is 0.19, which is at a low level. Hence, as the time required to perform baking in which exhaustion is performed by applying heat is increased to a certain level, PC may be used as the material of the supporting unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The present inventor has found an optimal material by performing various studies on resins expected to be used inside the vacuum space part <b>50</b>. Hereinafter, results of the performed studies will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a view illustrating results obtained by performing an experiment on vacuum maintenance performances of the resins.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, there is illustrated a graph showing results obtained by fabricating the supporting unit <b>30</b> using the respective resins and then testing vacuum maintenance performances of the resins. First, a supporting unit <b>30</b> fabricated using a selected material was cleaned using ethanol, left at a low pressure for 48 hours, exposed to the air for 2.5 hours, and then subjected to an exhaust process at 90&#xb0; C. for about 50 hours in a state where the supporting unit <b>30</b> was put in the vacuum adiabatic body, thereby measuring a vacuum maintenance performance of the supporting unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">An initial exhaust performance of LCP is best, but its vacuum maintenance performance is bad. This may be caused by sensitivity of the LCP to temperature. Also, it is expected through characteristics of the graph that, when a final allowable pressure is 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>Torr, its vacuum performance will be maintained for a time of about 0.5 years. Therefore, the LCP may not be used as the material of the supporting unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Regarding glass fiber PC (G/F PC), its exhaust speed is fast, but its vacuum maintenance performance is low. It is determined that this will be influenced by an additive. Also, it is expected through the characteristics of the graph that the glass fiber PC will maintain its vacuum performance under the same conditions for a time of about 8.2 years. Therefore, PC (G/F PC) may not be used as the material of the supporting unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">It is expected that, in the case of the low outgassing PC (O/G PC), its vacuum maintenance performance is excellent, and its vacuum performance will be maintained under the same conditions for a time of about 34 years, as compared with the above-described two materials. However, it may be seen that the initial exhaust performance of the low outgassing PC is low, and therefore, the fabrication efficiency of the low outgassing PC is lowered.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It may be seen that, in the case of the PPS, its vacuum maintenance performance is remarkably excellent, and its exhaust performance is also excellent. Based on the vacuum maintenance performance, PPS may be used as the material of the supporting unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref> illustrate results obtained by analyzing components of gases discharged from the PPS and the low outgassing PC, in which the horizontal axis represents mass numbers of gases and the vertical axis represents concentrations of gases. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates a result obtained by analyzing a gas discharged from the low outgassing PC. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, it may be seen that hydrogen or H<sub>2 </sub>series (I), water or H<sub>2</sub>O series (II), dinitrogen/carbon monoxide/carbon dioxide/oxygen or N<sub>2</sub>/CO/CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2 </sub>series (III), and hydrocarbon series (IV) are equally discharged. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates a result obtained by analyzing a gas discharged from the PPS. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, it may be seen that the H<sub>2 </sub>series (I), H<sub>2</sub>O series (II), and N<sub>2</sub>/CO/CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2 </sub>series (III) are discharged to a weak extent. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> is a result obtained by analyzing a gas discharged from stainless steel. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, it may be seen that a similar gas to the PPS is discharged from the stainless steel. Consequently, it may be seen that the PPS discharges a similar gas to the stainless steel.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As the analyzed result, it may be re-confirmed that the PPS is excellent as the material of the supporting unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates results obtained by measuring maximum deformation temperatures at which resins are damaged by atmospheric pressure in high-temperature exhaustion. At this time, the bars <b>31</b> were provided at a diameter of 2 mm at a distance of 30 mm. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, it may be seen that a rupture occurs at 60&#xb0; C. in the case of the PE, a rupture occurs at 90&#xb0; C. in the case of the low outgassing PC, and a rupture occurs at 125&#xb0; C. in the case of the PPS.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As the analyzed result, it may be seen that the PPS may be used as the resin used inside the vacuum space part <b>50</b>. However, the low outgassing PC may be used in terms of fabrication cost.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b> to reduce heat radiation between the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> through the vacuum space part <b>50</b> will be described. The first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may be made of a stainless material capable of preventing corrosion and providing a sufficient strength. The stainless material has a relatively high emissivity of 0.16, and hence a large amount of radiation heat may be transferred. In addition, the supporting unit <b>30</b> made of the resin has a lower emissivity than the plate members, and is not entirely provided to inner surfaces of the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. Hence, the supporting unit <b>30</b> does not have great influence on radiation heat. Therefore, the radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b> may be provided in a plate shape over a majority of the area of the vacuum space part <b>50</b> so as to concentrate on reduction of radiation heat transferred between the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. A product having a low emissivity may be used as the material of the radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b>. In an embodiment, an aluminum foil having an emissivity of 0.02 may be used as the radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b>. Also, since the transfer of radiation heat may not be sufficiently blocked using one radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b>, at least two radiation resistance sheets <b>32</b> may be provided at a certain distance so as not to contact each other. Also, at least one radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b> may be provided in a state in which it contacts the inner surface of the first or second plate member <b>10</b> or <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the distance between the plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> is maintained by the supporting unit <b>30</b>, and a porous material <b>33</b> may be filled in the vacuum space part <b>50</b>. The porous material <b>33</b> may have a higher emissivity than the stainless material of the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. However, since the porous material <b>33</b> is filled in the vacuum space part <b>50</b>, the porous material <b>33</b> has a high efficiency for resisting the radiation heat transfer.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the present embodiment, the vacuum adiabatic body may be manufactured without the radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> the supporting unit <b>30</b> to maintain the vacuum space part <b>50</b> may not be provided. A porous material <b>333</b> may be provided to be surrounded by a film <b>34</b> instead of the supporting unit <b>30</b>. Here, the porous material <b>33</b> may be provided in a state of being compressed so that the gap of the vacuum space part <b>50</b> is maintained. The film <b>34</b> made of, for example, a PE material provided in a state in which a hole is punched in the film <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the present embodiment, the vacuum adiabatic body may be manufactured without the supporting unit <b>30</b>.

Structures of the conductive resistance sheets <b>60</b> or <b>63</b> are briefly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, but will be understood in detail with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">First, a conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> proposed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> may be applied to the main body-side vacuum adiabatic body. Specifically, the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may be sealed so as to vacuumize the interior of the vacuum adiabatic body. In this case, since the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> have different temperatures from each other, heat transfer may occur between the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. A conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> is provided to prevent thermal or heat conduction between two different kinds of plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> may be provided with sealing or welding parts <b>61</b> at which both ends of the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> are sealed to define at least one portion of the wall for the third space or vacuum space part <b>50</b> and maintain the vacuum state. The conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> may be provided as a thin foil in unit of micrometer so as to reduce the amount of heat conducted along the wall for the vacuum space part <b>50</b>. The sealing parts <b>61</b> may be provided as welding parts, and the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> and the plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may be fused to each other. In order to cause a fusing action between the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> and the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> and the first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may be made of the same material (e.g., a stainless material). The sealing parts <b>61</b> are not limited to the welding parts, and may be provided through a process such as cocking. The conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> may be provided in a curved shape. Thus, a thermal conduction distance of the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> is provided longer than the linear distance of each plate member <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, so that the amount of thermal conduction may be further reduced.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">A change in temperature occurs along the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b>. Therefore, in order to block heat transfer to the exterior of the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b>, a shielding part or cover <b>62</b> may be provided at the exterior of the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> such that an adiabatic action occurs. In other words, in the refrigerator <b>1</b>, the second plate member <b>20</b> has a high temperature and the first plate member <b>10</b> has a low temperature. In addition, thermal conduction from high temperature to low temperature occurs in the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b>, and hence the temperature of the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> is suddenly changed. Therefore, when the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> is opened to the exterior thereof, heat transfer through the opened place may seriously occur. In order to reduce heat loss, the shielding part <b>62</b> is provided at the exterior of the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b>. For example, when the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> is exposed to any one of the low-temperature space and the high-temperature space, the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> may not serve as a conductive resistor at the exposed portion.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The shielding part <b>62</b> may be provided as a porous material contacting an outer surface of the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b>. The shielding part <b>62</b> may be provided as an adiabatic structure, e.g., a separate gasket, which is placed at the exterior of the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b>. The shielding part <b>62</b> may be provided as a portion of the vacuum adiabatic body, which is provided at a position facing a corresponding conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> when the main body-side vacuum adiabatic body is closed with respect to the door-side vacuum adiabatic body. In order to reduce heat loss even when the main body <b>2</b> and the door <b>3</b> are opened, the shielding part <b>62</b> may be provided as a porous material or a separate adiabatic structure.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">A conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> proposed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> may be applied to the door-side vacuum adiabatic body.

A part or seal to seal between the door <b>3</b> and the main body <b>2</b>, an exhaust port necessary for an exhaust process, a getter port for vacuum maintenance, and the like may be placed on the side frame <b>70</b>. This is because the mounting of parts is convenient in the main body-side vacuum adiabatic body, but the mounting positions of parts are limited in the door-side vacuum adiabatic body.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the door-side vacuum adiabatic body, it is difficult to place the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> at a front end portion of the vacuum space part <b>50</b>, i.e., a corner side portion of the vacuum space part <b>50</b>. This is because, unlike the main body <b>2</b>, a corner edge portion of the door <b>3</b> is exposed to the exterior. In more detail, if the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> is placed at the front end portion of the vacuum space part <b>50</b>, the corner edge portion of the door <b>3</b> is exposed to the exterior, and hence there is a disadvantage in that a separate adiabatic part should be configured so as to heat-insulate the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A conductive resistance sheet <b>63</b> proposed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> may be installed in the pipeline <b>64</b> passing through the vacuum space part <b>50</b>.
