Also knife blades can be damaged or worn out. Different knife blades may be useful for different tasks. For example, generally different blades would be used for carving wood and fileting fish. Knife handles are generally much thicker than the knife blades. Accordingly, someone with limited space, like a backpacker, may choose to carry a knife with replaceable blades.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Knives with replaceable blades exist in various forms. However, most knives with replaceable blades suffer in the areas of cleanliness, safety, and ease of use. Many knives with replaceable blades require the user to press on the blade in a direction that places the point or edge of the blade on the hand of the user. This can easily lead to injury. Many knives with replaceable blades also have elements of the handle parallel to the edge portion of the blade with gaps between the blade and the handle elements. This can make tasks like fileting a fish difficult and leave a mess because the parallel elements of the handle will catch on the fish and pieces of fish can get stuck between the blade and elements of the handle causing a mess that can quickly stink. Many knives with replaceable blades also require tools or complex steps to replace the blades.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One or more embodiments are provided below for a knife/device with a handle and replaceable blade. The device may include a handle and a blade. The handle may include a grip, a pivot pin, and a latch. The pivot pin may be fixed to the grip and has a first shape in a first plane. The latch may be fixed to the grip. The blade may include an edged portion, a connection portion, and a tang. The connection portion may be between the tang and the edged portion. The connection portion may define an opening with a second shape which compliments the first shape such that the pivot pin is capable of entering into or exiting out of the opening of the connection portion if the pivot pin has a first orientation relative to the connection portion and the pivot pin is not capable of exiting out of the opening of the connection portion if the pivot pin has a second orientation relative to the connection portion. The latch may be configured to secure the tang of the blade when the pivot pin has the second orientation relative to the connection portion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The device may provide significant advantages over the devices known in the art. The device is simple to use and does not require any tools to replace the blade. The blade can be removed by pressing the latch to move the latch from a securing location and rotating the blade around the pivot pin away from the securing location to a removal orientation (first orientation). The pivot pin may be removed from the opening in the connection portion when the blade is in the removal orientation. A new blade may then be attached by placing the pivot pin into the opening on the new blade in the removal orientation then rotating the blade on the pivot pin to the section orientation and securing the new blade with the latch. In both the removal of the old blade and the placement of the new blade, one hand of the user's may be on the handle operating the latch and the other hand of the user may be placed on the spine (back) of the blade which (except in the case where the blade has two edges) means that the user's hands are never in danger of being cut by the blade. This is a significant improvement in safety over currently available knives that require the user to move and press the removable blade in a direction aligned with the point of the blade putting the user's hand in significant danger of being stabbed. As another advantage, because the knife does not require any elements of the handle to be aligned alongside the edged portion of the blade, there is considerably less risk of getting dirt/grime/gunk between the blade and the handle and provides for a significant improvement in cleanliness.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other advantageous features as well as other aspects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail below with reference to the following drawings.

It is to be understood that the disclosure of the invention in this specification includes all possible combinations of such particular features. For example, where a particular feature is disclosed in the context of a particular aspect or embodiment of the invention, or a particular claim, that feature can also be used, to the extent possible, in combination with and/or in the context of other particular aspects and embodiments of the invention, and in the invention generally.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and grammatical equivalents thereof are used herein to mean that other components, ingredients, steps, among others, are optionally present. For example, an article &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; (or &#x201c;which comprises&#x201d;) components A, B, and C can consist of (i.e., contain only) components A, B, and C, or can contain not only components A, B, and C but also contain one or more other components.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Where reference is made herein to a method comprising two or more defined steps, the defined steps can be carried out in any order or simultaneously (except where the context excludes that possibility), and the method can include one or more other steps which are carried out before any of the defined steps, between two of the defined steps, or after all the defined steps (except where the context excludes that possibility).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;at least&#x201d; followed by a number is used herein to denote the start of a range beginning with that number (which may be a range having an upper limit or no upper limit, depending on the variable being defined). For example, &#x201c;at least 1&#x201d; means 1 or more than 1. The term &#x201c;at most&#x201d; followed by a number is used herein to denote the end of a range ending with that number (which may be a range having 1 or 0 as its lower limit, or a range having no lower limit, depending upon the variable being defined). For example, &#x201c;at most 4&#x201d; means 4 or less than 4, and &#x201c;at most 40%&#x201d; means 40% or less than 40%. When, in this specification, a range is given as &#x201c;(a first number) to (a second number)&#x201d; or &#x201c;(a first number)-(a second number),&#x201d; this means a range whose lower limit is the first number and whose upper limit is the second number.

The blade <b>100</b> may be manufactured by cutting and grinding a sheet of metal. The blade <b>100</b> may include an edged portion <b>110</b>, a connection portion <b>120</b>, and a tang <b>130</b>. The connection portion <b>120</b> may define an opening <b>125</b> and may be between the edged portion <b>110</b> and the tang <b>130</b>. The tang may have a smaller width (first distance in the up-down direction from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) compared to the edged portion <b>110</b> (except at the tip) and the connection portion <b>120</b>. The tang <b>130</b> may include a notch <b>140</b> at an end of the tang furthest from the edged portion <b>110</b>. The notch <b>140</b> may be a square cut out. As will be described below, the notch <b>140</b> may allow the tang <b>130</b> to be secured onto the handle <b>200</b> without having any portion of the tang <b>130</b> sticking out from the handle <b>200</b>. The end of the tang <b>130</b> may have a slanted side opposite the notch <b>140</b>. As will be discussed in further detail below, the slant of the slanted side of the tang may assist the tang <b>130</b> in engaging with the handle <b>200</b> to secure the tang <b>130</b> to the handle <b>200</b> when the blade <b>100</b> has the second orientation relative to the handle <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The edged portion may have a length of about 1.5-11 inches (depending on the intended usage of the blade). The width and shape of the edged portion <b>110</b> may depend on the intended purpose of the blade. The edged portion <b>110</b> may have a spine and an edge. In some embodiments, the edged portion <b>110</b> may have an edge on two sides.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The connection portion may have a width similar to the widest portion of the edged portion <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the width of the connection portion <b>120</b> may be greater or smaller than the widest portion of the edged portion <b>110</b>. The connection portion <b>120</b> may not include an edge. The connection portion <b>120</b> may define an opening <b>125</b>. The opening may have a round cutout and a hole connecting the round cutout to an exterior of the blade in a first plane, the first plane being the plane the edged portion <b>110</b> and connection portion <b>120</b> primarily extend (have the longest features). The first plane being the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The width of the hole in the first plane may be smaller than the width of a radius of the round cutout of the opening in the first plane. The hole of the opening <b>125</b> may have parallel sides extending in the same direction as the direction from the spine to the edge of the edged portion <b>110</b>. Restated, the opening <b>125</b> may have a hole connecting the opening <b>125</b> to an exterior of the blade <b>100</b> in the same direction as the direction from the spine to the edge of the edged portion. The tang <b>130</b> and connecting portion <b>140</b> together may have a similar length as the handle <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The handle <b>200</b> may include a grip <b>210</b>, a pivot pin <b>220</b>, rivets <b>230</b>, latch pin <b>240</b>, latch <b>250</b>, and spring <b>260</b>. The grip <b>210</b> may include two shells joined by the rivets <b>230</b>. The pivot pin <b>220</b> may be at or near a first end of the handle and the latch <b>250</b> may be at or near a second end of the handle <b>200</b> (at the butt of the knife <b>1000</b>). The grip <b>210</b> may be made of wood, composite, plastic, metal, or other durable material suitable for gripping with the hand and withstanding the forces of using a knife to cut various objects.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The pivot pin <b>220</b> may pass through the grip <b>210</b> and/or be pinched between shells of the grip <b>210</b> such that the pivot pin <b>220</b> does not rotate relative to the grip <b>210</b>. The pivot pin <b>220</b> may include metal or other durable materials suitable for securing a blade. The pivot pin <b>220</b> may have a shape which allows the pivot pin <b>220</b> to enter into and exit from the opening <b>125</b> in the connection portion <b>120</b> when the blade <b>100</b> has the first orientation (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and does not allow the pivot pin <b>220</b> to enter into or leave the opening <b>125</b> in the connection portion when the blade <b>100</b> is in another position such as the second orientation (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Because the opening has a round cutout with a diameter larger than the hole to the exterior of the opening, a shape in the first plane (plane shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) with different lengths in one dimension than a second dimension may be used for the pivot pin. For example, a rectangle (with one dimension smaller than the width of the hole and one dimension larger than the width of the hole), an oval (with similar requirements to the rectangle), a football shape, an (non-equilateral) triangle, or even a concave shape such as a four-pointed star (with points of the star matching the corners of the above described rectangle) may be used. However, it may be advantageous to have a curved surface that matches the radius of the round cut out in the opening <b>125</b> on two opposite sides (first and second sides) and flat sides on the other two sides (third and fourth sides) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. The first orientation may be an orientation of the blade <b>100</b> where the hole of the opening <b>125</b> is aligned about perpendicular to the third side and the fourth side of the pivot pin <b>220</b>. The second orientation may be an orientation of the blade <b>100</b> where the hole of the opening <b>125</b> is not aligned about perpendicular to the third side and the fourth side of the pivot pin <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is advantageous to have a close fit between the pivot pin and the round cutout of the opening <b>125</b> to reduce movement of the blade <b>100</b> relative to the handle and reduce the chance of the latch <b>250</b> inadvertently coming off the tang <b>130</b>. Sharp corners grinding on the interior of the round cut out of the opening <b>125</b> are more easily worn down by rotating within the opening <b>125</b> than a curved surface that matches the curvature of the round cutout. Accordingly, the curved surface on two opposite sides (with a distance between the curved surfaces at least larger than the width of the hole (first distance) in the opening <b>125</b>) and flat surfaces on the other two opposite sides (with a distance between the two flat surfaces being a second distance which is less than the first distance) may be preferred.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The latch pin <b>240</b> may pass through the shells of the grip <b>210</b> and also through the latch <b>250</b>. The latch <b>250</b> may be fixed to the grip <b>210</b> via the latch pin <b>240</b>. The latch <b>250</b> may be able to rotate around the latch pin <b>240</b>. The latch <b>250</b> may extend away from the latch pin <b>240</b> in two opposite directions to a first end and a second end. The first end may have a latch extension <b>252</b> which is shaped to interact with the notch <b>140</b> in the tang <b>130</b> of the blade to secure the blade <b>100</b> via the notch <b>140</b> in the tang <b>130</b> when the latch is in a securing position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) with the spring <b>260</b> pressing the latch extension <b>252</b> into the notch <b>140</b> in the tang <b>130</b> of the blade <b>100</b>. The spring <b>260</b> may be between the latch <b>150</b> and the grip <b>210</b>. The spring <b>260</b> may be a metal spring or another material with a restoring force that may be used to press on an object. The spring <b>260</b> may press on the second end (the end opposite of latch extension <b>252</b>) of the latch <b>250</b> to push the latch <b>250</b> into the securing position and maintain the latch <b>250</b> in the securing position. When the spring is compressed by the user's finger (or otherwise compressed) the latch <b>250</b> may be rotated into a non-securing position where the latch extension <b>252</b> is not in the notch <b>140</b>. The securing position may be an example of a third orientation. The non-securing position may be an example of a fourth orientation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The rivets <b>230</b>, latch pin <b>240</b>, and latch <b>250</b> may include metal or other durable material suitable for securing various elements of the knife <b>1000</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The blade <b>100</b> can be removed by pressing the latch <b>250</b> to move the latch extension <b>252</b> from a securing location (e.g. from the third orientation to the fourth orientation) and rotating the blade <b>100</b> around the pivot pin <b>220</b> away from the securing location to a removal orientation (e.g., from the second orientation to the first orientation). The pivot pin <b>220</b> may be removed from the opening <b>125</b> through the hole in the opening <b>125</b> when the blade <b>100</b> is in the removal orientation (first orientation). A new blade <b>100</b> may then be attached by placing the pivot pin <b>220</b> into the opening <b>125</b> on the new blade in the removal orientation then rotating the blade <b>100</b> on the pivot pin <b>220</b> to the second orientation and securing the new blade <b>100</b> with the latch <b>250</b>. The opening <b>125</b> may have a second shape which compliments the first shape of the pivot pin <b>220</b> such that the pivot pin is capable of entering into or exiting out of the opening <b>125</b> of the connection portion <b>120</b> if the pivot pin <b>220</b> has a first orientation relative to the connection portion <b>120</b> and the pivot pin <b>120</b> is not capable of exiting out of the opening <b>125</b> of the connection portion <b>120</b> if the pivot pin <b>220</b> has the second orientation relative to the connection portion <b>120</b>. Restated, the first shape may be capable of rotating within the second shape in the first plane such that the blade <b>100</b> is capable of rotating relative to the handle <b>200</b> while the pivot pin <b>220</b> is in the opening <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The blade <b>100</b> may be selectively, rotatably, attachable to the handle <b>200</b> via the pivot pin <b>220</b>. The latch <b>250</b> may be configured to secure the tang <b>130</b> of the blade <b>100</b> to prevent the blade <b>100</b> from rotating relative to the handle <b>100</b>. The pivot pin <b>220</b> may be capable of selectively attaching by entering into the opening <b>125</b> of the connection portion <b>120</b> if the pivot pin <b>220</b> has the first orientation relative to the connection portion <b>120</b> and the pivot pin <b>220</b> may not be capable of exiting out of the opening <b>125</b> if the pivot pin <b>220</b> rotates within the opening <b>125</b> to a second orientation relative to the connection portion <b>120</b>. The blade <b>100</b> may be rotatably attachable in that the blade <b>100</b> may be attached to the handle <b>200</b> and be able to rotate relative to the handle <b>200</b> when attached. The blade <b>100</b> may be selectively attachable and detachable from the handle because the blade <b>100</b> can be moved to a position where the blade <b>100</b> can be attached and detached or can be moved to a position where the blade <b>100</b> cannot be attached or detached. Accordingly, by selecting the position of the blade <b>100</b>, the ability to be attachable is selected, thus the blade <b>100</b> is selectively attachable and detachable from the handle <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the tang <b>130</b> of the blade <b>100</b> may fit into the grip <b>210</b> of the handle such that the tang <b>130</b> does not stick out enough to be seen from a side view of the knife <b>1000</b>. This feature may increase comfort for a user's hand. Further, the tang <b>130</b> extending the length of the handle under where a user would secure the knife <b>1000</b> with the user's hand may improve safety because the user's hand may further add to the security of the blade by pressing the tang <b>130</b> into the grip <b>210</b> and not allowing the blade <b>100</b> to rotate relative to the handle <b>200</b>. Having tang <b>130</b> extend straight from the spine of the edged portion also increases security by having the natural rotational force around the pivot pin <b>220</b> when cutting with the edge of the edged portion <b>110</b> causing the tang <b>130</b> to be pressed into the grip <b>210</b>. Even if the blade <b>100</b> includes two edges and cutting is performed with the edge on the same side of the blade <b>100</b> as the tang <b>130</b> the user's hand gripping the blade to the grip <b>210</b> may provide additional security and safety beyond that of the latch <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the grip <b>210</b> may include an indent <b>212</b> on either side of the latch <b>250</b> to more easily allow a user's finger to press the latch <b>250</b> to move the latch <b>250</b> from the third orientation to the fourth orientation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Many different embodiments of the inventive concepts have been shown. A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the features from different embodiments may be combined or replaced with other features from different embodiments.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Advantageously, the device is simple to use and does not require any tools to replace the blade <b>100</b>. In both the removal of the old blade <b>100</b> and the placement of the new blade <b>100</b>, one hand of the user's may be on the handle operating the latch <b>250</b> and the other hand of the user may be placed on the spine of the blade <b>100</b> which (except in the case where the blade <b>100</b> has two edges) means that the user's hands are never in danger of being cut by the edge of the edged portion <b>110</b>. This is a significant improvement in safety over currently available knives that require the user to move and press the removable blade in a direction aligned with the point of the blade, putting the user's hand in significant danger of being stabbed. As another advantage, because the knife does not require any elements of the handle to be aligned alongside the edged portion <b>210</b> of the blade, there is considerably less risk of getting dirt/grime/gunk between the blade and the handle and provides for a significant improvement in cleanliness. Also, the extension of the tang <b>130</b> along the handle gives extra safety and security when using the knife <b>1000</b> from the user's hand pressing the tang <b>130</b> into the handle <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The corresponding structures, materials, acts, and equivalents of all means or step plus function elements in the claims below are intended to include any structure, material, or act for performing the function in combination with other claimed elements as specifically claimed.
