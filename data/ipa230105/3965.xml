With higher shooting requirements of users on mobile terminals such as mobile phones, combination of functions of long range shooting with a long focal length and wide-angle shooting with a short focal length has become a standard configuration of mobile terminals that are currently popular with the users. However, mobile terminals that meet shooting requirements of different focal lengths need camera modules with an optical zooming function.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To implement the optical zooming function of the camera modules, actuating motors need to cover an increasingly large movement stroke. In a related technology, a camera module in a mobile terminal includes a plurality of lenses disposed in parallel and spaced from each other and an actuating device configured to drive the lenses to move. The actuating device includes a stepper motor and a screw thread that is installed on a ball screw on the plurality of lenses. The stepper motor is connected to the ball screw through the ball screw that acts as an attachment plate. During operation, the stepper motor drives the ball screw to rotate, to drive the plurality of lenses to move in an extension direction of the ball screw, so as to implement the optical zooming of the module.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, costs of the stepper motor configured to drive the lens to move are high, and requirements on machining accuracy of the ball screw is high, therefore there is a challenge for manufacturing the entire camera module.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of this application provide an actuating device, a camera module, and an electronic device, to reduce manufacturing costs and manufacturing difficulty of the camera module and the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An embodiment of this application provides an actuating device, configured to drive a lens of a camera module to move in a specified direction.

Long range shooting with a long focal length performed by, for example, a periscope camera module, and wide-angle shooting with a short focal length, performed by, for example, a conventional CCM module can be complementary to each other. Therefore, their combination has become a standard configuration of a mobile terminal that is currently popular with the user. The camera module that meets shooting requirements of different focal lengths is an optical zoom camera module.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a structure of a mobile terminal according to this application. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional view along a line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

An actuator in the actuating device is configured to include an actuating magnetic component, a coil, and a power supply apparatus. The power supply apparatus is electrically connected to the coil, and the coil is disposed in a magnetic field of the actuating magnetic component. When a current is supplied to the coil, the coil moves relative to the actuating magnetic component on a path parallel to a specified direction under an action of the magnetic field.

In the actuating device in this application, a movement stroke of the motor carrier is related to the length of the actuating magnetic component.

For example, the coil <b>2224</b> of the actuator <b>222</b> is connected to the base <b>223</b>, one end of the third magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>b </i>penetrates the coil <b>2224</b>, and the third actuating magnetic component <b>2221</b> is disposed on the first magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the actuating magnetic component <b>2221</b> and the motor carrier <b>221</b> are respectively located on two sides of the first magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>a</i>. The actuating magnetic component <b>2221</b> is disposed, for example, on a side wall facing outward of the first magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>a</i>. The actuating magnetic component <b>2221</b> is opposite to the third magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>b</i>. The first magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>a </i>is connected to the motor carrier <b>221</b>. In this embodiment of this application, the motor carrier <b>221</b> is connected to the actuating magnetic component <b>2221</b> by using the first magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0230" num="0233">In this embodiment of this application, the coil <b>2224</b> is fixed. After the coil <b>2224</b> is energized, the actuating magnetic component <b>2221</b>, the first magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>a</i>, and the third magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>b </i>move together, and drive the motor carrier <b>221</b> to move. Therefore, the base <b>223</b> is provided with an avoidance passage <b>2231</b><i>a </i>for the magnetic shielding component <b>2222</b> to move.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0234">Consistent with the actuator <b>222</b> in Embodiment 1 or Embodiment 2, the Ampere force parallel to the first magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>a </i>is generated after an end that is of the energized coil <b>2224</b> and that is close to the actuating magnetic component <b>2221</b> is exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field. Because the coil <b>2224</b> is fastened to the base <b>223</b>, according to the principle of action and reaction forces, the magnetic shielding component <b>2222</b> passes through the coil <b>2224</b> to reciprocate, to drive the motor carrier <b>221</b> connected to the first magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>a </i>to move along a path parallel to the extension direction of the first magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>a</i>. In this case, long range zooming of the lens <b>21</b> fastened to the motor carrier <b>221</b> is further implemented.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0235">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. When the motor carrier <b>221</b> includes the two opposite carriers <b>2211</b>, the coil <b>2224</b> configured to drive an actuator <b>222</b> of each carrier <b>2211</b> is connected to a corresponding sub-base <b>2231</b>. For example, one end that is of the coil <b>2224</b> and that is away from the actuating magnetic component <b>2221</b> may be connected to the sub-base <b>2231</b>, so that the coil <b>2224</b> is fixed. In addition, the avoidance passage <b>2231</b><i>a </i>is provided on the sub-base <b>2231</b>. The avoidance passage <b>2231</b><i>a </i>extends in the direction of the first magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>a</i>, so that the magnetic shielding component <b>2222</b> passes through the coil <b>2224</b> and moves in the avoidance passage <b>2231</b><i>a </i>under the action of the ampere force, to drive each carrier <b>2211</b>.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0236">Because the coil <b>2224</b> is fastened to the sub-base <b>2231</b> and does not move with the motor carrier <b>221</b>, the power supply apparatus <b>2223</b> that supplies power to the coil <b>2224</b> is connected to the sub-base <b>2231</b>, to provide a stable current to the coil <b>2224</b> on the sub-base <b>2231</b>.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0237">In addition, the power supply apparatus <b>2223</b> is connected to the sub-base <b>2231</b> of the base <b>223</b>, to simplify a structure of each carrier <b>2211</b>.

Specifically, to detect a movement position of each carrier <b>2211</b> on the motor carrier <b>221</b>, a magnetic sensing component <b>2242</b> may be installed on each carrier <b>2211</b>. For example, an inwardly directed installation slot may be provided at a bottom of the carrier <b>2211</b>. The magnetic sensing component <b>2242</b> is received in the installation slot. This improves stability of the magnetic sensing component <b>2242</b> on the carrier <b>2211</b>, and reduces space in a vertical direction occupied by the magnetic sensing component <b>2242</b> in the actuating device <b>22</b>, ensuring a more compact structure of the actuating device <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0239">In addition, a Hall element <b>2241</b> corresponding to the magnetic sensing component <b>2242</b> is installed on the sub-base <b>2231</b>. In a process in which the carrier <b>2211</b> moves along the first guide rail <b>225</b> under driving of the magnetic shielding component <b>2222</b>, the Hall element <b>2241</b> always detects the magnetic field strength generated by the magnetic sensing component <b>2242</b>, and feeds back a value of the magnetic field strength to the processor. The processor calculates a distance between the Hall element <b>2241</b> and the magnetic sensing component <b>2242</b>, to calculate a specific position of the carrier <b>2211</b>. The Hall element <b>2241</b> sends a signal to the processor when the Hall element <b>2241</b> detects that the magnetic field strength of the magnetic sensing component <b>2242</b> reaches a preset threshold. The processor controls, based on the signal, the power supply apparatus <b>2223</b> to stop supplying power to the coil <b>2224</b>, to stop driving the carrier <b>2211</b>, so as to implement closed-loop control of the motor carrier <b>221</b>.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0240">In addition, the Hall element <b>2241</b> is installed on the sub-base <b>2231</b> on the base <b>223</b>, so that the power supply apparatus <b>2223</b> fastened to the sub-base <b>2231</b> stably supplies power to the Hall element <b>2241</b>. In addition, both the Hall element <b>2241</b> and the power supply apparatus <b>2223</b> are disposed on the base <b>223</b>, so that an installation structure of the motor carrier <b>221</b> is further simplified, and a structure of the entire actuating device <b>22</b> is more reasonable and compact.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0241">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. When there are a plurality of motor carriers <b>221</b> in the actuating device <b>22</b> in this embodiment, a plurality of carriers <b>2211</b> on a same side are all driven by one actuator <b>222</b>.

In this case, when the magnetic shielding component <b>2222</b> of the actuator <b>222</b> passes through the coil <b>2224</b> and moves in the avoidance passage <b>2231</b><i>a</i>, the magnetic shielding component <b>2222</b> of the actuator <b>222</b> can simultaneously drive the plurality of carriers <b>2211</b> on the same side, to implement synchronous drive of the lenses <b>21</b> on the plurality of motor carriers <b>221</b>.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0242">Each carrier <b>2211</b> and the first magnetic shielding portion <b>2222</b><i>a </i>can be connected in a plurality of manners.
