A base station configures a set of BWPs for the UE, and then instructs the UE to dynamically switch the BWPs through downlink control information. The UE needs certain time to complete a switching from an original BWP to a target BWP, so the base station needs to reserve sufficient BWP switching time when performing the time-domain resource allocation; otherwise, the BWP switching of the UE will fail. However, in the related scheme, since a switching dedicated indication row needs to be set in a time-domain resource allocation table to specify a target time slot deviation to the UE after the switching occurs, one or more switching dedicated indication rows always exist in the time-domain resource allocation table regardless of whether the switching occurs. However, the number of rows in the time-domain resource allocation table is limited, after the switching dedicated indication row is set, a number of available rows capable of carrying indication information of other transmissions is reduced, thereby limiting the transmission of the indication information of other transmissions to a certain extent.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The time-domain resource allocation and determination method and apparatus, base station, terminal and storage medium provided by embodiments of the present disclosure mainly solve that: in the scheme proposed at the present stage, the base station sets a switching dedicated indication row in a time-domain resource allocation table of a BWP to specify a target time slot deviation under a condition of switching the bandwidth part resource, which requires a large number of rows in the time-domain resource allocation table, limits transmission of indication information of other transmissions, and is not conducive to optimizing resource configuration.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a time-domain resource determination method.

In the scheme provided in the embodiments of the present disclosure, when a bandwidth part resource for performing a data transmission with a terminal needs to be switched, a base station may determine a target bandwidth part resource used by a transmission after switching, and then send transmission indication information including a target bandwidth part resource index identifier to the terminal. After receiving the transmission indication information, the terminal may determine a number of switching time slots required for current bandwidth part resource switching according to the target bandwidth part resource and the original bandwidth part resource, thereby determining a target time slot deviation according to the number of switching time slots and the basic time slot deviation dedicated by the base station. Because in the scheme provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure, when the bandwidth part resource is switched, the terminal may determine the number of switching time slots based on the information provided by the base station and determine the target time slot deviation combined with the basic time slot deviation indicated by the base station, which does not need to rely on the switching-dedicated indication row in the time-domain resource allocation table. Therefore, according to the scheme provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure, which does not need to use one or more rows in the time-domain resource allocation table as the switching-dedicated indication row, thereby greatly reducing the occupation of the time-domain resource allocation table by the bandwidth part resource switching, saving the space in the time-domain resource allocation table, and providing more opportunities for the transmission of other transmission information, which is conducive to realizing the resource optimization allocation. Meanwhile, through the scheme of indicating the target time slot deviation by the switching-dedicated indication row in the time-domain resource allocation table, when the bandwidth part resource switching is not performed, which also needs to reserve the switching-dedicated indication row in the time-domain resource allocation table, and brings about a great waste of resources. Therefore, compared with the scheme proposed at this stage, the scheme provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure improves the resource utilization rate.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">Other features of this application and corresponding beneficial effects are described in the latter part of the specification.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an interaction between a base station and a terminal in a time-domain resource allocation process according to an embodiment one of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0047" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of a blind detection of a terminal according to the embodiment one of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of a terminal determining a number of switching time slots according to a target bandwidth part resource and an original bandwidth part resource according to the embodiment one of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart of a time-domain resource allocation method according to an embodiment two of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart of a time-domain resource determination method according to the embodiment two of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a structure of a time-domain resource allocation apparatus according to an embodiment three of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a structure of a time-domain resource determination apparatus according to an embodiment four of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of another structure of the time-domain resource determination apparatus according to the embodiment four of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a hardware structure of a base station according to an embodiment five of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a hardware structure of a terminal according to an embodiment five of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0059">The present disclosure will be described in detail in connection with the embodiments and the accompanying drawings, from which the purpose, technical schemes and advantages of the present disclosure will be more apparent. It is to be understood that the embodiments described herein are intended to explain and not to limit the present application.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment One</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0060">With the development of the wireless communication technology and the increasing user requirements for communications, in order to meet requirements for the higher, faster and newer communication, the 5G technology has already become the trend of the future network development. Compared with the traditional long term evolution (LTE) technology, the 5G technology has made corresponding improvements in many aspects. For example, in order to reduce energy consumption of a UE in the communication process, the UE in the 5G is allowed to select a corresponding BWP according to the type of data that needs to be transmitted, which is conducive to avoiding unnecessary energy waste caused by all transmissions of the UE using a same bandwidth in the traditional LTE technology.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">Before the UE performs a transmission, the base station will configure a set of BWPs for the UE, and the set of BWPs include BWPs used for uplink and BWPs used for downlink. Generally, the base station will configure four downlink BWPs and four uplink BWPs. For different BWPs, a subcarrier spacing (SCS), a bandwidth, and a frequency-domain position may be independently configured, that is, different BWPs may have different configuration parameters. The base station may indicate the UE to dynamically switch the BWP used by the transmission through downlink control information (DCI), so that the UE may switch to an appropriate BWP according to different transmission requirements, thereby reducing energy consumption during the transmission. BWP switching refers to a transformation from a currently used BWP (for ease of introduction, it will be hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;original BWP&#x201d;) to a new BWP (for ease of introduction, it will be hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;target BWP&#x201d;). It should be noted that the UE does not perform data sending or reception during a process from determining to perform the BWP switching according to the received DCI to switching to the target BWP. Only after the BWP switching completes, the UE may continue to perform the data transmission on the target BWP.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062">It should be understood that a certain amount of time is required for the BWP switching, if the base station cannot guarantee the sufficient switching time for the UE when performing the time-domain resource allocation, which will lead to a failure of the BWP switching of the UE. In order to ensure the sufficient switching time of the UE, the scheme proposed in the present stage is that the base station sets a &#x201c;switching-dedicated indication row&#x201d; exclusively used for the BWP switching in the time-domain resource allocation table of the BWP, and the base station indicates a target time slot deviation after the corresponding switching in the switching-dedicated indication row. It should be understood that the target time slot deviation is calculated by the base station to ensure the UE having the sufficient switching time.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0063">Taking the example that the base station configures four downlink BWPs for the UE, the time-domain resource allocation table of each BWP should include three switching-dedicated indication rows, which respectively correspond to scenarios of switching from other three BWPs to the BWP. For example, when the four downlink BWPs are A, B, C, and D, three switching-dedicated indication rows are set in the time-domain resource allocation table of A, which respectively indicate the target time slot deviation corresponding to a switching scenario from B to A, the target time slot deviation corresponding to a switching scenario from C to A, and the target time slot deviation corresponding to a switching scenario from D to A. Three switching-dedicated indication rows are also set in the time-domain resource allocation table of B, which respectively indicate the target time slot deviation corresponding to a switching scenario from A to B, the target time slot deviation corresponding to a switching scenario from C to B, and the target time slot deviation corresponding to a switching scenario from D to B. Similarly, it is similar in the time-domain resource allocation tables of C and D. Therefore, if the base station needs to indicate the UE to switch the BWP, used for the communication between the base station and the UE, from D to B, the base station will send the DCI information to the UE through the original BWP, that is D, and the base station will indicate the UE to switch to the target BWP, that is B. Meanwhile, the DCI information issued to the UE also carries a time-domain resource allocation indication field for specifying to the terminal to determine the target time slot deviation according to which row in the time-domain resource allocation table, so that the UE may determine a position of a corresponding target time-domain resource after switching from D to B by inquiring the time-domain resource allocation table.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0064">It should be understood that a number of rows in the time-domain resource allocation table is limited and cannot be extended indefinitely. The number of rows in the time-domain resource allocation table may be related to a number of bits in the DCI information which are occupied by the time-domain resource allocation indication field, where the number of rows is usually 2<sup>n</sup>, and n is the number of bits occupied by the time-domain resource allocation indication field in the DCI information. For example, when n is 2, the time-domain resource allocation table may have 4 rows, and when n is 3, the time-domain resource allocation table may have 8 rows. Therefore, if a switching-dedicated indication row corresponding to each switching scenario is set in the time-domain resource allocation table, the time-domain resource allocation table may only use remaining rows to carry information of other transmission: continuing to take the example that the base station configures four downlink BWPs for the UE, in a case where the time-domain resource allocation table includes 4 rows, the base station may only use the remaining one row to carry the information of other transmissions; in a case where the time-domain resource allocation table includes 8 rows, the base station may use the remaining five rows to carry indication information of other transmissions . . . which severely limits transmission of the other indication information. Even, when the time-domain resource allocation indication field in the DCI information occupies only 1 bit, since the time-domain resource allocation table has only two rows, all necessary switching-dedicated indication rows cannot be covered in the time-domain resource allocation table.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0065">In the above-mentioned time-domain resource allocation scheme, which needs to set the switching-dedicated indication row by occupying the time-domain resource allocation table, thereby causing serious limitations to the transmission of other indication information. This embodiment provides a time-domain resource allocation method and a time-domain resource determination method, where the time-domain resource allocation method may be executed by a base station side, and the time-domain resource determination method may be executed by a terminal side. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of an interaction of a time-domain resource allocation process implemented by the base station executing the time-domain resource allocation method and by the terminal executing the time-domain resource determination method.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0066">In S<b>102</b>, the base station determines a target bandwidth part resource used by a transmission after switching.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0067">In a process of the data transmission between the base station and the terminal, the type of data transmitted between the base station and the terminal may change continuously, some data may require a relatively large bandwidth resource, and other data may have a low requirement on the bandwidth resource. Therefore, in order to reduce power consumption caused by transceiving data on the terminal side and to reasonably utilize the bandwidth resource, the base station may reasonably select one or more bandwidth part resources among all bandwidth part resources configured for the terminal according to the type of data currently to be transmitted. When a bandwidth part resource reselected by the base station is different from a currently used bandwidth part resource, &#x201c;bandwidth part resource switching&#x201d; needs to be performed, so the bandwidth part resource switching actually refers to a process of switching from a currently used &#x201c;original bandwidth part resource&#x201d; to a new &#x201c;target bandwidth part resource&#x201d;. The &#x201c;bandwidth part resource&#x201d; in this embodiment actually refers to a continuous resource blocks (RBs) resource, and is also referred to as a BWP resource.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0068">When the base station determines to switch the bandwidth part resource used between the base station and the terminal, the base station will obtain an index identifier of the target bandwidth part resource. For example, a downlink data transmission is to be performed between the base station and the terminal, but at this time, the base station finds that a currently used bandwidth part resource A is unsuitable and a bandwidth part resource C needs to be used, and then the base station determines that C is to be served as the target bandwidth part resource, thereby the obtained index identifier of the target bandwidth part resource is &#x201c;c&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0069">In S<b>104</b>, the base station sends transmission indication information containing both of an index identifier of the target bandwidth part resource and time-domain resource allocation indication information to the terminal.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0070">After determining the target bandwidth part resource, the base station sends transmission indication information to the terminal, the transmission indication information carries the index identifier of the target bandwidth part resource. In this embodiment, the base station sends the transmission indication information to the terminal by using the original bandwidth part resource, so in some examples, the base station will send the transmission indication information by using the bandwidth part resource A. In some examples of this embodiment, the transmission indication information may include, but is not limited to, downlink control information (DCI).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0071">Meanwhile, the transmission indication information sent by the base station may further include time-domain resource allocation indication information used for specifying a basic time slot deviation to the terminal, the basic time slot deviation is used for calculating a target time slot deviation on the terminal side after calculating a number of switching time slots required for the bandwidth part resource switching. The base station may use a time-domain resource allocation indication field in the transmission indication information (such as, the DCI) as the time-domain resource allocation indication information, and the time-domain resource allocation indication field specifies the basic time slot deviation to the terminal by cooperating with the time-domain resource allocation table. After the base station configures the time-domain resource allocation table, the terminal may obtain this time-domain resource allocation table, and in the time-domain resource allocation table, at least two basic time slot deviations may be configured. In order to let the terminal know to select which one from the at least two basic time slot deviations, the base station will carry the time-domain resource allocation indication field in the DCI information, and the time-domain resource allocation indication field may enable the terminal to select one basic time slot deviation specified by the base station from the time-domain resource allocation table. For example, 16 rows are included in the time-domain resource allocation table, each of these 16 rows is a configured basic time slot deviation, and unique identifiers of the 16 rows are numbers &#x201c;0&#x201d;, &#x201c;1&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;15&#x201d;, respectively. In the transmission indication information sent by the base station to the terminal, if a value corresponding to the time-domain resource allocation indication field is &#x201c;2&#x201d;, which represents that the basic time slot deviation specified by the base station for the terminal is the one uniquely identified as &#x201c;2&#x201d; in the time-domain resource allocation table.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0072">It should be understood that the time-domain resource allocation table is not fixed because it is configured by the base station, therefore, the terminal obtains different time-domain resource allocation tables when configuration of the time-domain resource allocation table by the base station is different. It should be understood that the base station and the terminal always use the current time-domain resource allocation table, that is, the newly configured time-domain resource allocation table to determine the basic time slot deviation.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0073">It should be noted that the basic time slot deviation is a time-domain resource position configured by a radio resource control (RRC) layer of the base station and unrelated to a switching duration of the bandwidth part resource switching. The basic time slot deviation may not only be used for determining the target time slot deviation during the bandwidth part resource switching, but also be used for determining the target time slot deviation when the bandwidth part resource switching is not required. For example, in a process of continuously using a certain bandwidth part resource for performing the data transmission between the base station and the terminal, when the base station allocates the time-domain resource to the terminal, which is also performed through the time-domain resource allocation table. In this case, a basic time slot deviation in the time-domain resource allocation table specified by the base station is actually the target time slot deviation. Therefore, the basic time slot deviation does not need to ensure the terminal having the sufficient switching time. When configuring the basic time slot deviation, the base station does not need to care about whether the bandwidth part resource switching exists, and only needs to configure the basic time slot deviation according to the general time-domain resource configuration scheme. So, compared with the target time slot deviation exclusively used in a bandwidth part resource switching scenario and configured by the base station in the switching-dedicated indication row in the scheme discussed at this stage, the step in which the base station configures the basic time slot deviation in this embodiment is simpler, without considering the time limitation caused by the bandwidth part resource switching.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0074">In the time-domain resource allocation table, the basic time slot deviation includes an uplink basic time slot deviation or a downlink basic time slot deviation, where the uplink basic time slot deviation corresponds to K2 in the time-domain resource allocation table, and the downlink basic time slot deviation corresponds to K0 in the time-domain resource allocation table. If the base station currently needs to send data to the terminal, and the terminal needs to receive the data, the basic time slot deviation specified by the base station for the terminal in the time-domain resource allocation table should be the downlink basic time slot deviation for the downlink, that is K0; if the base station currently needs to receive data sent by the terminal, a basic time slot deviation specified by the base station using the time-domain resource allocation table for the terminal should be the uplink basic time slot deviation for the uplink, that is, K2.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0075">In addition, the time-domain resource allocation table in this embodiment is still set in a unit of a bandwidth part resource, that is, each bandwidth part resource has a corresponding time-domain resource allocation table.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0076">In S<b>106</b>, when determining to perform the bandwidth part resource switching according to the transmission indication information, the terminal determines the target bandwidth part resource used by the transmission after the current bandwidth part resource switching according to the index identifier.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0077">The terminal may receive the transmission indication information sent by the base station; according to the index identifier carried in the transmission indication information, the terminal may determine whether the bandwidth part resource switching is currently required. For example, the terminal will perform a &#x201c;blind detection&#x201d; on the original bandwidth part resource, and it is assumed that an index identifier of the original bandwidth part resource is &#x201c;a&#x201d;. Through the blind detection, the terminal may receive the transmission indication information sent by the base station through the original bandwidth part resource A, and the transmission indication information carries the index identifier of the target bandwidth part resource. By comparing whether the index identifier of the original bandwidth part resource is consistent with the index identifier carried in the transmission indication information, the terminal may determine whether the bandwidth part resource switching is currently required. If the two identifiers are consistent, the bandwidth part resource switching is not required. However, if the two identifiers are inconsistent in the comparison result, the terminal determines that the base station has indicated the terminal to switch to another bandwidth part resource for performing the data transmission with the base station. In this case, the terminal may further determine which one is the target bandwidth part resource indicated by the base station. For example, in the foregoing example, since the index identifier carried by the base station in the transmission indication information is &#x201c;c&#x201d;, &#x201c;c&#x201d; is inconsistent with the index identifier &#x201c;a&#x201d; of the original bandwidth part resource A targeted by the blind detection, so the terminal may know that the base station indicates the terminal to switch the bandwidth part resource, and the target bandwidth part resource used after switching is C having the index identifier &#x201c;c&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0078">A process of receiving the transmission indication information by the terminal through the blind detection is briefly introduced as follows.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0079">Mapping types of shared channels for either the uplink or the downlink are generally divided into two types: a mapping type one (also known as mapping type A) and a mapping type two (also known as mapping type B). In the current standard 38.331, in order to more flexibly configure demodulation reference signal (DMRS) configuration corresponding to the two mapping types, the high layer of the base station uses independent DMRS configuration for the mapping type A and the mapping type B. In other words, DMRS configuration parameters of the mapping type A and DMRS configuration parameters of the mapping type B may be the same or different.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0080">For the downlink, a DMRS type in the DMRS configuration parameters (may be &#x201c;DL-DMRS-config-type&#x201d; in the DMRS configuration parameters) and a DMRS maximum length (may be &#x201c;DL-DMRS-max-len&#x201d; in the DMRS configuration parameters) may affect a size of an antenna port field in the transmission indication information sent by the base station to the terminal, and then affect a size of the transmission indication information.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0081">For the uplink, the DMRS type in the DMRS configuration parameters (may be &#x201c;UL-DMRS-config-type&#x201d; in the DMRS configuration parameters), the DMRS maximum length (may be &#x201c;UL-DMRS-max-len&#x201d; in the DMRS configuration parameters), and a physical uplink shared channel-transform precoder (PUSCH-tp) enable value may affect the size of the antenna port field in the transmission indication information sent by the base station to the terminal, and then affect the size of the transmission indication information.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0082">There is no doubt that before receiving the transmission indication information sent by the base station, the terminal does not know whether the base station uses the mapping type A to send the transmission indication information or the mapping type B to send the transmission indication information. Therefore, the terminal cannot determine the size of the antenna port field in the transmission indication information, and thus cannot determine the size of the transmission indication information. In this case, if a size value of the blind detection is smaller than a size of the transmission indication information sent by the base station when the terminal performs the blink detection, the terminal will fail in the blind detection. After the blind detection fails, the terminal needs to perform the blind detection again in the same time slot, which increases the complexity of the blind detection. This embodiment provides two manners:</p><p id="p-0080" num="0083">in a manner one: regardless of the DMRS configuration parameters corresponding to the two mapping types, the terminal performs the blind detection on the transmission indication information according to a case where the size of the antenna port field in the transmission indication information has a maximum value.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0084">Table 1 shows, for a downlink shared channel, a corresponding relationship between the DMRS configuration parameters and the antenna port field:</p><p id="p-0082" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>DL-DMRS-</entry><entry>DL-DMRS-</entry><entry>Size of the antenna</entry></row><row><entry>config-type</entry><entry>max-len</entry><entry>port field</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry>1</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>5</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>5</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>6</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0083" num="0085">According to table 1, for the downlink, a maximum size of the antenna port field is 6.

The transmission indication information here is the DCI information for description: the DCI information includes a time-domain resource allocation field, and the time-domain resource allocation field is used for specifying a certain row in the time-domain resource allocation table, that is, for specifying one from two basic time slot deviations in the time-domain resource allocation table. Then, the terminal sums the basic time slot deviation and the number of switching time slots to determine the target time slot deviation corresponding to the current bandwidth part resource switching.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0117">It should be understood that the terminal determines the target time slot deviation to determine a time slot position for performing the data transmission with the base station, and therefore, not only the terminal needs to determine the target time slot deviation, but the base station also needs to know this target time slot deviation. In order to enable the base station and the terminal to perform a normal data transmission at the target time-domain resource position corresponding to the target time slot deviation, the target time slot deviation determined by the base station and the target time slot deviation determined by the terminal should be consistent. Therefore, the base station side should also calculate the target time slot deviation in the same manner as the terminal side, which requires that the base station and the terminal use a same criteria for determining the switching scenario to which the current bandwidth part resource switching belongs, and the base station and the terminal store a same mapping relationship between switching scenarios and switching durations (for example, the base station also stores table 3). In addition, the base station needs to know the capability of the terminal and the like.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0118">After determining the target time slot deviation, the terminal and the base station may perform the data transmission at the target time-domain resource position corresponding to the target time slot deviation. It should be understood that the target time slot deviation may include an uplink target time slot deviation and/or a downlink target time slot deviation. It is assumed that the target time slot deviation determined by the terminal is the downlink target time slot deviation, the terminal may receive data sent by the base station at the corresponding target time-domain resource position; and if the target time slot deviation determined by the terminal is the uplink target time slot deviation, the terminal may send data to the base station at the corresponding target time-domain resource position.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0119">In the time-domain resource allocation method and the time-domain resource determination method provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure, the base station does not need to set a switching-dedicated indication row in the time-domain resource allocation table exclusively for the bandwidth part resource switching. Since the terminal may determine the number of switching time slots required for the current switching according to the original bandwidth part resource and the target bandwidth part resource, and further calculate the target time slot deviation, thereby avoiding a dedicated indication row to be set in the time-domain resource allocation table, thus affecting the transmission of other transmission indication information by the time-domain resource allocation table. It also avoids a situation in the related scheme that in the scenario of not requiring the bandwidth part resource switching, the space of the time-domain resource allocation table is wasted, since the switching-dedicated indication row needs to be set in the time-domain resource allocation table all the time. It is conducive to optimizing the resource transmission, and improving the resource utilization rate.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0120">Furthermore, when the base station configures the time-domain resource allocation table, it does not need to care about whether the configured transmission time slot satisfies the switching duration of the terminal performing the bandwidth part resource switching, therefore the configuration is simpler.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment Two</heading><p id="p-0121" num="0121">This embodiment will continue to introduce the time-domain resource allocation method and the time-domain resource determination method provided in the foregoing embodiments in conjunction with examples, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>:</p><p id="p-0122" num="0122">In S<b>402</b>, the base station determines a target BWP when the base station needs to perform BWP switching on a BWP for performing the data transmission with the terminal.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0123">For the purpose of satisfying the requirement of the data transmission with the terminal, the base station may control the terminal to perform the bandwidth part resource switching at some time, for example, before time t<b>1</b>, downlink data between the base station and the terminal has no high requirements on the bandwidth, but at time t<b>1</b>, the base station needs to send a large amount of video data to the terminal, and therefore, in order to ensure the experience of video viewing of a user at the terminal side, the base station needs to control the terminal to switch to a bandwidth part resource having a larger bandwidth to perform the data transmission. In this case, the base station may select one bandwidth part resource satisfying the transmission requirement as the target bandwidth part resource from bandwidth part resources which are pre-configured for the terminal.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0124">In S<b>404</b>, the base station sends DCI information to the terminal through an original BWP to indicate the BWP switching.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0125">After determining the target BWP, the base station may send the DCI indication information to the terminal, the DCI indication information may at least indicate following aspects: firstly, the DCI information may enable the terminal to determine that the bandwidth part resource switching needs to be currently performed; and the DCI information may also inform which target BWP needs to be switched to. In this embodiment, the DCI information may also indicate a basic time slot deviation to the terminal. In some examples, the base station may notify the terminal that the bandwidth part resource switching needs to be performed through a BWP indication field in the DCI information. For example, the base station carries an index identifier of the target BWP in the BWP indication field of the DCI information, after receiving the DCI information, the terminal may determine whether the bandwidth part resource switching needs to be performed by comparing whether an index identifier in the BWP indication field of the DCI information is consistent with an index identifier of the currently used BWP. If the two index identifiers are consistent, it represents that the bandwidth part resource switching does not need to be performed, and if the two index identifiers are inconsistent, it represents that the bandwidth part resource switching needs to be performed, and meanwhile, the terminal may further determine which one is the target BWP after switching.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0126">In embodiment one, specifying the basic time slot deviation to the terminal through the time-domain resource allocation table and the time-domain resource allocation indication field has been described in details, which is not described herein again.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0127">Since the terminal only performs the blind detection on the currently used BWP before the terminal knows that the bandwidth part resource switching needs to be performed, in order to ensure that the terminal may receive the DCI information sent by the base station, in this embodiment, the base station will transmit the DCI information through the original BWP.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0128">After the base station sends the DCI information as the transmission indication information to the terminal, the base station may calculate a target time-domain resource position for performing the data transmission on the target BWP with the terminal, that is, a value of the target time slot deviation, and a process of the base station calculating the target time slot deviation is basically the same as a process of the terminal calculating the target time slot deviation.

The index identifier is used for the terminal to determine the target bandwidth part resource, the number of switching time slots required for the bandwidth part resource switching is determined according to the target bandwidth part resource and an original bandwidth part resource used before the bandwidth part resource switching, the target time slot deviation for performing the data transmission by using the target bandwidth part resource is determined according to the number of switching time slots and the basic time slot deviation, and the basic time slot deviation is determined through the time-domain resource allocation indication information.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0159">In a process of the data transmission between the base station and the terminal, the type of data transmitted between the base station and the terminal may change continuously, some data may require a relatively large bandwidth resource, and other data may have a low requirement on the bandwidth resource, so that, in order to reduce power consumption caused by transceiving data at the terminal side and to reasonably utilize the bandwidth resource, the switching determination unit <b>602</b> of the time-domain resource allocation apparatus <b>60</b> may reasonably select one or more bandwidth part resources among all bandwidth part resources configured for the terminal according to the type of data currently to be transmitted. When a bandwidth part resource reselected by the base station is different from a currently used bandwidth part resource, &#x201c;bandwidth part resource switching&#x201d; needs to be performed, so the so-called &#x201c;bandwidth part resource switching&#x201d; actually refers to a process of switching from a currently used &#x201c;original bandwidth part resource&#x201d; to a new &#x201c;target bandwidth part resource&#x201d;. The &#x201c;bandwidth part resource&#x201d; in this embodiment actually refers to a continuous RBs resource, and is also referred to as a BWP resource.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0160">When the switching determination unit <b>602</b> determines to perform the switching of the bandwidth part resource used between the base station and the terminal, the base station will obtain an index identifier of the target bandwidth part resource. For example, a downlink data transmission is to be performed between the base station and the terminal, but at this time, the switching determination unit <b>602</b> knows that a currently used bandwidth part resource A is unsuitable and a bandwidth part resource C needs to be used, and then the switching determination unit <b>602</b> determines that C is to be served as the target bandwidth part resource, thereby obtaining the index identifier of the target bandwidth part resource as &#x201c;c&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0161">After the switching determination unit <b>602</b> determines the target bandwidth part resource, the indication transmission unit <b>604</b> sends transmission indication information to the terminal, where the transmission indication information carries the index identifier of the target bandwidth part resource. In this embodiment, the indication transmission unit <b>604</b> sends the transmission indication information to the terminal by using the original bandwidth part resource, so in some examples, the indication transmission unit <b>604</b> will send the transmission indication information by using the bandwidth part resource A. In some examples of this embodiment, the transmission indication information may include, but is not limited to, downlink control information (DCI).</p><p id="p-0166" num="0162">Meanwhile, the transmission indication information sent by the indication transmission unit <b>604</b> includes time-domain resource allocation indication information used for specifying a basic time slot deviation to the terminal, the basic time slot deviation is used for calculating a target time slot deviation after the terminal side calculates a number of switching time slots required for the bandwidth part resource switching. The indication transmission unit <b>604</b> may use a time-domain resource allocation indication field in the transmission indication information (such as, the DCI information) as the time-domain resource allocation indication information, and the time-domain resource allocation indication field specifies the basic time slot deviation to the terminal by cooperating with the time-domain resource allocation table. After the base station configures the time-domain resource allocation table, the terminal may obtain the time-domain resource allocation table, and in the time-domain resource allocation table, at least two basic time slot deviations may be configured; in order to let the terminal know which one is selected from the at least two basic time slot deviations, the base station will carry the time-domain resource allocation indication field in the DCI information, and the time-domain resource allocation indication field may enable the terminal to select one basic time slot deviation specified by the base station from the time-domain resource allocation table. For example, 16 rows are included in the time-domain resource allocation table, each of the 16 rows is a configured basic time slot deviation, and unique identifiers of the 16 rows are numbers &#x201c;0&#x201d;, &#x201c;1&#x201d; . . . and &#x201c;15&#x201d;, respectively. In the transmission indication information sent by the indication transmission unit <b>604</b> to the terminal, if a value corresponding to the time-domain resource allocation indication field is &#x201c;2&#x201d;, it represents that the basic time slot deviation specified by the indication transmission unit <b>604</b> for the terminal is the one uniquely identified as &#x201c;2&#x201d; in the time-domain resource allocation table.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0163">It should be understood that the time-domain resource allocation table is not fixed because it is configured by the base station, therefore, the terminal obtains different time-domain resource allocation tables when configuration of the time-domain resource allocation table by the base station is different. It should be understood that the indication transmission unit <b>604</b> and the terminal always use the current time-domain resource allocation table, that is, the newly configured time-domain resource allocation table to determine the basic time slot deviation.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0164">It should be noted that the basic time slot deviation is a time-domain resource position configured by a radio resource control (RRC) layer of the base station and unrelated to a switching duration of the bandwidth part resource switching. The basic time slot deviation may not only be used for determining the target time slot deviation during the bandwidth part resource switching, but also be used for determining the target time slot deviation when the bandwidth part resource switching is not required. For example, in a process of continuously using a certain bandwidth part resource for performing the data transmission between the base station and the terminal, when the indication transmission unit <b>604</b> allocates the time-domain resource to the terminal, which is also performed through the time-domain resource allocation table. In this case, a certain basic time slot deviation in the time-domain resource allocation table specified by the indication transmission unit <b>604</b> is actually the target time slot deviation. Therefore, the basic time slot deviation does not need to ensure that the terminal has sufficient switching time. When configuring the basic time slot deviation, the base station does not need to care about whether the bandwidth part resource switching exists, and only needs to configure the basic time slot deviation according to the usual time-domain resource configuration scheme. Therefore, compared with the target time slot deviation exclusively used in a bandwidth part resource switching scenario and configured by the base station in the switching-dedicated indication row in the scheme discussed at this stage, the step in which the base station configures the basic time slot deviation in this embodiment is simpler, without considering the time limitation caused by the bandwidth part resource switching.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0165">In the time-domain resource allocation table, the basic time slot deviation includes an uplink basic time slot deviation and/or a downlink basic time slot deviation, where the uplink basic time slot deviation corresponds to K2 in the time-domain resource allocation table, and the downlink basic time slot deviation corresponds to K0 in the time-domain resource allocation table. If the base station currently needs to send data to the terminal, and the terminal needs to receive the data, the basic time slot deviation specified for the terminal from the time-domain resource allocation table by the transmission indication information sent by the indication transmission unit <b>604</b> should be the downlink basic time slot deviation for the downlink, that is K0; if the current base station needs to receive data sent by the terminal, the basic time slot deviation specified by the indication transmission unit <b>604</b> using the time-domain resource allocation indication information and the time-domain resource allocation table for the terminal should be the uplink basic time slot deviation for the uplink, that is, K2.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0166">In addition, the time-domain resource allocation table in this embodiment is still set in a unit of a bandwidth part resource, that is, each bandwidth part resource has a corresponding time-domain resource allocation table.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0167">It should be understood that, when the time-domain resource allocation apparatus is deployed on the base station, a function of the switching determination unit may be implemented through a processor of the base station, and a function of the indication transmission unit <b>604</b> may be implemented through the processor of the base station and a communication device together.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0168">The time-domain resource allocation apparatus provided in this embodiment may send transmission indication information including the index identifier of the target bandwidth part resource through the original bandwidth part resource used before switching to the terminal, so that the terminal determines the target bandwidth part resource according to the index identifier in the transmission indication information, then determines, according to the target bandwidth part resource and the original bandwidth part resource, a number of switching time slots required for the current bandwidth part resource switching, and determines the target slot offset according to the calculated number of switching time slots and the basic time slot deviation specified by the time-domain resource allocation indication information. Therefore, the related scheme that a switching-dedicated indication row exclusively for indicating the bandwidth part resource switching is configured in the time-domain resource allocation table is abandoned, which is conducive to saving the space of the time-domain resource allocation table, thus the time-domain resource allocation table may carry more indication information of other transmissions. In addition, the base station does not need to indicate the target time slot deviation satisfying the requirement of the switching duration in the time-domain resource allocation table, so that the flexibility of the base station allocating the time-domain resource is improved.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Embodiment Four</heading><p id="p-0173" num="0169">This embodiment provides a time-domain resource determination apparatus.
