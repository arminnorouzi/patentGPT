Overview of Imaging Device According to Present Disclosure)</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">First, an overview of a first embodiment according to the present disclosure will be described. As described above, techniques of identifying persons through biometric authentication using human physical features have recently been widespread. In particular, fingerprint authentication for personal identification through comparison between the captured fingerprint and the stored personal data has been employed in many devices and widely commercialized.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">However, since the fingerprint authentication as described above uses the captured uneven pattern on the finger surface for identification, there is a possibility that the forged uneven pattern if made by using a material, such as silicone, is overlooked. It is thus difficult to ensure adequate security of devices that identify persons through general fingerprint authentication.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">An imaging device according to the present disclosure has been conceived by focusing on the above-described point. The imaging device can capture the dermatoglyphic pattern on the skin surface and the vein pattern under the skin simultaneously or with a time lag.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Therefore, the imaging device according to the present disclosure uses light in two different wavelength bands to capture the dermatoglyphic pattern and the vein pattern. More specifically, the imaging device according to the present disclosure has a function of radiating light in a first wavelength band from 400 to 580 nm for use in dermatoglyphic pattern authentication, and light in a second wavelength band of 650 nm or more mainly including near-infrared rays for use in vein authentication. In addition, the imaging device according to the present disclosure has a function of acquiring signals individually from the light in two different wavelength bands reflected off an authentication target object.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The above-described functions of the imaging device according to the present disclosure enable biometric authentication using both dermatoglyphic pattern authentication and vein authentication, which eliminates the possibility of overlooking forged fingerprints to realize secure biometric authentication. Furthermore, the housing of an imaging device can be downsized due to imaging based on the light reflected from the authentication target object. In the following description of the embodiments, the structural features of the imaging device according to the present disclosure and the advantage effects of the features will be described in detail.</p><heading id="h-0034" level="1">2. First Embodiment</heading><heading id="h-0035" level="2">(2.1. Structure of Imaging Device <b>10</b> According to First Embodiment)</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, a first embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view for describing an overview of biometric authentication using an imaging device <b>10</b> according to this embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an authentication target object AO and an imaging device <b>10</b> according to this embodiment. Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the case where the authentication target object AO is a human finger. In other words, the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a case where the imaging device <b>10</b> according to this embodiment captures the fingerprint pattern on the finger surface and the vein pattern of the fingertip.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, the authentication target object AO according to this embodiment is not limited to the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The authentication target object according to this embodiment may be, for example, the palm. In the case where the authentication target object is the palm, the imaging device <b>10</b> according to this embodiment can capture the palmprint pattern on the palm surface and the vein pattern of the palm. Thus, the dermatoglyphic pattern according to this embodiment may contain various patterns on the skin surface, such as fingerprints and palmprints.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the imaging device <b>10</b> according to this embodiment includes a light source <b>110</b> and an imaging element <b>120</b>. In addition, the light source <b>110</b> according to this embodiment includes a light emitting unit <b>111</b>. Here, the light emitting unit <b>111</b> has a function of radiating the light in the first wavelength band and the light in the second wavelength band. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates how the light emitting unit <b>111</b> radiates the light r<b>1</b> in the first wavelength band and the light r<b>2</b> in the second wavelength band.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Here, the light r<b>1</b> in the first wavelength band may be light from 400 to 580 nm for use in dermatoglyphic pattern authentication. For example, as described in Non-Patent Literature 1, it is generally known that the scattering coefficient of the skin surface and the molar absorptivity of the melanin pigment depend on the wavelength of light. Specifically, the scattering coefficient and the molar absorptivity tend to be lower at longer wavelengths. For this, light having a longer wavelength is less subject to scattering or absorption and thus penetrates the skin. In other words, in the case where long wavelength light is used to capture the dermatoglyphic pattern, the light that has penetrated the skin reflects off the tissues under the skin and becomes background light during imaging, which may cause resolution deterioration. For this reason, short wavelength light is effectively used to capture the dermatoglyphic pattern.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">On the basis of the foregoing description, a dermatoglyphic pattern with high resolution can be obtained by using light from 400 to 580 nm mainly including blue to green visible light for imaging in this embodiment. Note that ultraviolet rays can be used from the viewpoint of resolution, but ultraviolet rays may damage the skin. For this reason, the effect on the skin can be reduced by mainly using blue to green visible light in this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, the light r<b>2</b> in the second wavelength band may be light of 650 nm or more mainly including near-infrared rays for use in vein authentication. In general, veins are blood vessels present at a depth of &#x2dc;2 mm from the skin surface. It is thus difficult for short wavelength light to penetrate the skin due to the effect of diffusion and absorption described above. In this embodiment, the vein pattern can be captured by using light of 650 nm or more mainly including near-infrared rays.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view for describing capturing of the vein pattern according to this embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a conceptual diagram of the internal configuration of the authentication target object AO and the light source <b>110</b> according to this embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the light r<b>2</b> in the second wavelength band radiated from the light source <b>110</b> enters the authentication target object AO and reflects off the veins V.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, description will be continued. As described above, the light emitting unit <b>111</b> according to this embodiment can radiate the light r<b>1</b> in the first wavelength band effective for capturing the dermatoglyphic pattern and the light r<b>2</b> in the second wavelength band effective for capturing the vein pattern. In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the light r<b>1</b> in the first wavelength band reflects off the skin surface of the authentication target object AO, and the light r<b>2</b> in the second wavelength band reflects under the skin of the authentication target object AO.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the light r<b>1</b> in the first wavelength band and the light r<b>2</b> in the second wavelength band radiated from the light emitting unit <b>111</b> are indicated by straight arrows, and the light beams reflected off the authentication target object AO are indicated by dotted arrows.
