The containers may be leased by pooling services (referred herein as &#x2018;pooler&#x2019;) for movement from growers to retailers. Each crate may be transferred to a retailer account when the crate hits receiving dock of the retailer. In such situations, the retailer may need to accurately track count of the crates being transferred to the retailer account. Such crates returning from stores, are stacked and then de-hired. The de-hiring is a process of returning crates to pooler washing center. The retailer may be responsible for paying the rental fee from the day crates are transferred to the retailer account to the day of the crates are de-hired. For this reason, at the receiving dock, a manual quality checker may determine the count of crates received in each pallet and sums up the total crates received for a shipment or a truck. Later, the manual quality checker may report total count of the crates to a central reconciliation manager at each warehouse. This manual count is prone to human errors and often consumes labor costs and delays in calculating the number of crates on retailer account, leading to overbilling etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In conventional systems, bar codes are used to identify specific locations of the load. In a typical example of such a system, the operator uses a hand-held bar code scanner to read the bar code on the loads and, in some cases, on the stock locations. Although such a system is an improvement over purely manual processes, it may be difficult to completely implement, due to the need for direct line of sight, close proximity, and proper alignment between the scanner and barcodes. It also requires the operator to participate in the load-identification process. Hence, a radio frequency identifier (RFID) based tracking system was introduced. The RFID tags containing information associated with the identities of inventory items to be tracked are attached to the inventory items. An RFID interrogator is used to detect the presence of an RFID tag and read the identification information from the tag.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Alternatively, camera-based surveillance systems were also used to track and identify the load received at the receiving dock.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, previous approaches did not offer an efficient or ideal approach for reaching highest efficiency and accuracy level in calculation of number of the containers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Hence, there is a need for an improved system and method to count and monitor containers at a warehouse dock to address the aforementioned issue(s).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts, in a simple manner, which is further described in the detailed description of the invention.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;warehouse dock&#x201d; refers to an area of a building where goods are loaded and unloaded. The containers <b>104</b> include returnable plastic containers (RPCs), returnable plastic crates, crates, boxes, pallets, and the like. The containers are plastic reusable crates (PRC) for carrying groceries, food particles and the like, and mainly used for display on the shelf, delivering or transporting purposes. In the present context, the pallet itself may be considered as a container and counted using this invention. The pallet may be a structural platform or the structural platform with the stack of crates which allows easy handling.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another embodiment of the invention, containers may be wooden pallets on which the plastic containers are stacked and moved. These pallets are also rented and their count is also updated in retailer and pooler systems for calculating days on hire.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, each of the containers <b>104</b> is tagged with a RFID tag <b>106</b>. In such an embodiment, the RFID tag <b>106</b> may be a passive UHF Gen2 RFID. At time of unloading at the warehouse dock, the plurality of containers <b>104</b> are mounted over a pallet for ease of moving from one location to another. The system <b>100</b> includes one or more image capturing devices <b>112</b> and a plurality of radio frequency identification (RFID) readers <b>110</b> communicatively coupled to a computing system <b>116</b> communicatively coupled to each other via a one or more wireless network <b>114</b> to exchange data representative of functional information.

In an embodiment, the one or more image capturing devices <b>112</b> includes camera, video recorder, and the like. In such an embodiment, the cameras are affixed to one or more side walls, or on top of the rolling dock doors or ceiling of a warehouse dock or in any combination in order to have visibility of the area designated to received pallets. In exemplary embodiment, the camera may include a fish-eye camera, 360&#xb0; camera, panoramic camera, infrared IR camera, LIDAR, and the like. The one or more image capturing devices <b>112</b> are configured to capture real time one or more images of the plurality of containers located at the warehouse dock.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an embodiment, the plurality of radio frequency identification (RFID) readers <b>110</b> (collectively referred to as RFID module) is affixed to the warehouse dock. The plurality of RFID readers <b>110</b> is configured to read identification data of the RFID tag affixed to each of the plurality of containers <b>104</b> in real time. The identification data of the RFID tag <b>106</b> may include identifiable information corresponding to each of the containers <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the RFID tag <b>106</b> may store information comprising identification number, previous container delivery details, condition parameters such as temperature excursions, best use by date and the user data. Therefore, the system is able to identify and count containers <b>104</b> based on RFID tag's <b>106</b> reads and also identify specific pallet carrying the specific containers.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In above stated exemplary embodiment, RFID readers <b>110</b> affixed to the surrounding walls, ceilings or rolling doors of the warehouse dock, retrieves data from the RFID tags after receiving communication through RFID antennas. Simultaneously, in real time both the plurality of image capturing devices <b>112</b> as well as plurality of RFID readers <b>110</b> functions together.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment, the RFID readers <b>110</b> may range from 3 to 8 read points for reading RFID tags <b>106</b> on each side of the portal.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an embodiment, the computing system <b>116</b> includes a container count collection module <b>118</b> configured to initiate counting of the plurality of containers <b>104</b>. The counting is initiated upon getting a first RFID read from one of the plurality of RFID readers <b>110</b>. Further to this, the system <b>116</b> wakes up the container count collection module <b>118</b> gathering counts from image capturing devices <b>112</b>, and capturing of the one or more images of the plurality of containers <b>104</b> present at the warehouse dock starts. In an embodiment, the image capturing devices <b>112</b> are always running and processing the images, however the count is be considered only when RFID counts are also observed, otherwise their output may not be registered in the count collection module. It is understood that the plurality of RFID readers <b>110</b> also simultaneously starts reading the RFID tags <b>106</b> of the plurality of containers <b>104</b> and sends the identification data of the RFID tags <b>106</b> to the computing system <b>116</b> via the one or more network <b>114</b>. The one or more captured images of the plurality of containers <b>104</b> are also sent to the computing system <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment, the computing system <b>116</b> is configured to generate a first count based on received identification data of each RFID tag <b>106</b> of the plurality of containers <b>104</b> in an instant. The first count is representative of total containers <b>104</b> present at the warehouse dock within a singulation time in which a pallet of containers is observed for counting.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another embodiment, the computing system <b>116</b> is configured to generate a second count of the plurality of containers <b>104</b> based on the one or more images of the plurality of containers using an image recognition technique. The second count is also a representative of total containers <b>104</b> present at the warehouse dock within a singulation time in which a pallet of containers is observed for counting.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The container count collection module <b>118</b> is also configured to receive the first count of the plurality of containers <b>104</b> based on the identification data of each RFID tag <b>106</b>, and the second count of the plurality of containers <b>104</b> based on the one or more images of the plurality of containers.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an embodiment, the computing system <b>116</b> includes a container count selection module <b>120</b> configured to select either the first count or the second count as the actual count of containers for a pallet, based on a plurality of predefined parameters. The plurality of predefined parameters includes a stacking arrangement of the plurality of containers, a type of the plurality of containers, time of RFID reads, a type of one or more items contained in the plurality of containers, a view position of the returnable object with respect to the one or more image capturing devices, presence of a top cover over the plurality of containers, distance of the plurality of containers from each of the plurality of RFID readers <b>110</b> or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The plurality of predefined parameters includes the factors which may compromise the efficacy and accuracy of reading of the RFID tags <b>106</b> and detection of crates in the pallet from the captured images. For example, the RFID read-rates may become low due to water content of produce kept in the crate, distance from the RFID tags <b>106</b> since the RFID readers <b>110</b> cannot read the RFID tags <b>106</b> that are buried deep in the pallet full of produce. Further, the stacking arrangement of the pallets in multi-column pallets, where number of columns is more than 2 columns, the RFID reader <b>110</b> cannot read the inner columns Moreover, in a scenario where the time of RFID reads appears to be faster than the minimum singulation time, then it is presumed that the count of the RFID tags is wrong. Therefore, upon detection of the aforementioned one or more parameters that may affect RFID read-rates, the container count selection module selects the second count for further assessment.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For this approach to work, the computing system <b>116</b> first identifies the type of pallet such as 2-column, 3-column, small pallet, double stacked, and the like. If the computing system <b>116</b> identifies the pallet to be a 3-column pallet, then container count selection module <b>120</b> takes the second count and disregards the first count, as that will be wrong.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Similarly, the parameters such as the view position of the returnable object with respect to the one or more image capturing devices, the presence of a top cover over the plurality of containers may create a situation where the pallets are occluded from the view of the camera. Therefore, upon detection of the aforementioned one or more, the container count selection module selects the second count for further assessment. For instance, if computing system <b>116</b>, based on the analysis of the captured one or more images, determines that the pallet is covered with a top cover, then it will take the count from the plurality of RFID readers <b>110</b>, as camera will not be able to count crates accurately due to obfuscation by the top cover.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an embodiment, the computing system <b>116</b> also includes a container count comparison module <b>122</b> configured to compare a selected one of the first count and the second count with a pre-stored count of the plurality of containers at the warehouse dock. In an embodiment, the pre-stored count includes a historical data, a user input, and a count obtained based on a type of movables object used for moving the plurality of containers and the plurality of pallets. The historical data refers to data associated with previous counts, corrections made by a user in the count, details of situation which lead to the corrections. The user input refers to any input provided by the user monitoring counting operations, where input includes approval over the count, rejection of the count, and corrections made in the count of the plurality of containers or the plurality of pallets. The type of movables object used for moving the plurality of containers and the plurality of pallets refers to forklift, trolley, truck, and the like.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The system <b>100</b> stores a preset number of containers or pallets that may be carried or moved using each of the forklift, trolley, truck, and the like. For example, the truck may carry 50 pallets, where each of the pallet may hold 10 containers. Therefore, the preset number of the containers for truck would be 500. Hence, if one truck has unloaded, then it is expected to receive 500 containers. Similarly, if the forklift is expected to carry 5 pallets in one go, then for every entry/exit of the forklift 50 containers are expected.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an embodiment, the pre-stored count of the plurality of containers is fed in the system beforehand by a driver or an admin operating the warehouse or through an application programming interface (API). Therefore, the system is aware of expected number of crates either being received or moving out of the warehouse. Therefore, the pre-stored count is used as a reference number for assessing the accuracy of count (either first or second) selected by the container count selection module <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">After comparing, the container count comparison module <b>122</b> updates a final count of the plurality of containers unloaded at the warehouse dock or taken out of the warehouse</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The final count is transmitted to an admin or manager in charge of the warehouse, where the admin or manager is enabled to review and update the final count if it is incorrect. Further to this, the system <b>100</b> sends data of the final count to pooler systems and to retailer systems and optionally sends it to the accounting system for crates that calculates the days for which hiring fees may be due.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a further embodiment the system <b>100</b>, the container count comparison module <b>122</b> is further configured to compare a selected one of a total of the first counts, a total of second counts, and a total of fusion counts with the pre-stored count of the plurality of pallets at the warehouse dock to identify a final count of the plurality of pallets. The total of the first counts refers to all computed first counts of the plurality of containers received or moved out of the warehouse dock in a given duration based on the RFID reads. The total of second count refers to all computed second counts of the plurality of containers received or moved out of the warehouse dock in a given duration based on one or more captured images from the image capturing device <b>112</b>. The total of fusion counts refers to the total running count of the containers (selected first or second count). Therefore, the system <b>100</b> computes the total number of pallets and corresponding containers received/taken out per truck in an instance.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In such an embodiment, the container count comparison module <b>122</b> is also configured to receive the input of the user regarding accuracy of the computed count. In case of any discrepancy, the user is enabled to provide correction in the computed count.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In such an embodiment, the container count comparison module <b>122</b> is also configured to update the final count of the plurality of pallets into a communicatively coupled retailer system or a pooler system. The system <b>100</b> generates a bill for numbers of days for which count of containers is hired. The number of days is counted based on the date of entry and exit of the container from the warehouse.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an illustration of implementation of an image recognition technique for generating a second count of the plurality of containers based on the one or more images of the plurality of containers <b>104</b> present in a pallet <b>202</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In an embodiment, the images recognition technique includes a computer vision technique, where a machine learning based model is trained by using the plurality of images of the containers <b>104</b> and pallets <b>202</b> in various conditions. The pallet <b>202</b> shows a plurality of containers <b>104</b> stacked in eight columns with three rows in each column. stacked up over the pallet and the height of each pallet. The system <b>100</b> identifies dimension of at least one of the containers <b>104</b> and the pallet <b>202</b>, thereby segments the image into various identifiable segments <b>206</b> representative of a single container. In an embodiment, the second count is generated based on the numbers of rows of container in the pallet and the height of the front mask of the pallet.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, the system <b>100</b> is also configured to identify a number of containers <b>104</b> pulled out or removed or absent in the stack <b>204</b>.

The working status comprises offline, online, not-working, and non-responsive. Upon detection of the offline, the not-working, and the non-responsive status, flag is raised and an alert is sent to a concerned person for corrective measure.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The system of claim <b>1</b>, wherein the container count collection module is further configured to detect false positives in the first count and the second count by comparing the read of the RFID tag with a result of the image recognition technique within a dynamic singulation time for observation of a pallet consisting of the plurality of containers. The term &#x201c;singulation&#x201d; as used herein refers to a method by which an RFID reader identifies a tag with a specific serial number from a number of tags in its field within a specific time. This is necessary because if multiple tags from multiple pallets respond simultaneously to a query, individual pallet cannot be counted.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The false positives may occur due to presence of objects such as cardboard boxes that may seem like plastic crates <b>104</b> (returnable assets). The container count collection module compares the RFID reads with image processing results. If RFID reads are not there and only camera results are there within a dynamic singulation time for the observation of the pallet, it is inferred that the pallet under observation is not tagged plastic crate, but a corrugated box or the cardboard box.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further the false positives may occur due stray RFID reads from adjoining docks. The container count collection module compares the RFID reads with Camera results within the dynamically calculated singulation time.

The second count and saved one or more representative images and inputs made for corrections are used to train to the AI model to enhance accuracy. The Confidence score is calculated based on two factors (a) weights based on neural networking matching the image with existing segments, or (b) masks in camera image processing algorithm and statistical matching with prior observations of camera and RFID count patterns and resulting actual count value.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of a computing system <b>300</b> configured to receive a first count of the plurality of containers based on the identification data of each RFID tag, and a second count of the plurality of containers, select one of the first count and the second count, and update a final count of the plurality of containers in memory in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.
