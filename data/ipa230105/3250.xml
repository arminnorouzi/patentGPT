The main body is provided with a notch extending from a ball body accommodating opening to a fastener accommodating opening. The notch of the main body can be expanded to a predetermined angle, so that the fastener and the ball body are sequentially and respectively placed into the fastener accommodating portion and the ball body accommodating portion, and then both sides of the notch are forced to be close to each other. The notch can be constrained by locking a fixing assembly tight and thus the ball body is non-rotatable, while the fixing assembly can also be loosened and thus the ball body is rotatable. In the present invention, by using plastic material, the heavy weight problem can be solved; and further by providing a notch, the ball body can prevent from falling off due to the unexpected detachment, thereby avoiding the damage to the equipment installed on the ball head.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The technical solution adopted by the present invention to solve the technical problems is as follows. The present invention provides a ball head including a main body, a ball body, and a fastener. The main body is made of an elastic material and integrally formed by a molding manner to be a single piece. The main body has a ball body accommodating portion and a fastener accommodating portion, which are adjacent to each other in an up-and-down direction. The ball body accommodating portion is formed with a ball body accommodating opening extending upward to an external space, and the ball body accommodating opening has a diameter smaller than that of the ball body accommodating portion. The fastener accommodating portion is formed with a fastener accommodating opening extending downward to the external space, and the fastener accommodating opening has a diameter smaller than that of the fastener accommodating portion. The main body is provided with a notch at a side surface thereof extending from the ball body accommodating opening to the fastener accommodating opening. The ball body accommodating portion and the fastener accommodating portion are communicated with the external space through the notch. A fixing assembly is disposed at both sides of the notch at a position close to the ball body accommodating opening. The ball body is provided with a threaded rod extending outward therefrom. A platform is disposed on the threaded rod and provided with a platform nut at a center of the platform. The threaded rod and the platform nut are coupled with each other and rotatable with respect to each other, so as to adjust a position of the platform relative to the threaded rod. In assembling, the notch of the main body can be expanded to a predetermined angle, so that the fastener is placed into the fastener accommodating portion from top to bottom, the ball body is placed into the ball body accommodating portion from top to bottom from the ball body accommodating opening, and the threaded rod penetrates outward through the ball body accommodating opening, and then due to the elasticity of the main body, after the ball body is placed into the ball body accommodating portion, the both sides of the notch of the main body are forced to be close to each other. The notch can be further contracted by locking the fixing assembly tight, such that the ball body accommodating portion clamps the ball body and thus the ball body is non-rotatable. The notch can also be expanded by loosening the fixing assembly, such that the ball body accommodating portion releases the ball body and thus the ball body is rotatable.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the main body is provided with a threaded rod accommodating opening opposite to the notch, and the threaded rod accommodating opening extends from the ball body accommodating opening to a proper position on the main body.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the fastener is a nut coupled with a first object through the fastener accommodating opening.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the fastener is a screw coupled with a second object through the fastener accommodating opening.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention has the beneficial effects that the weight of the ball head can be reduced, the ball body of the ball head can be prevented from falling off, and the ball head can be coupled with other objects through a fastening screw or nut, thereby increasing the portable convenience, the using safety, and the diversity of using the ball head.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art by reading the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, with reference to the attached drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective schematic view of a ball head according to a first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded perspective schematic view of the ball head of the first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a perspective schematic view of a main body according to the first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a perspective schematic view of the main body of the first embodiment of the present invention, which shows a notch of the main body is expanded to a predetermined angle;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a perspective schematic view showing the assembling of a fastener according to the first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a perspective schematic view showing the assembling of a ball body according to the first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a perspective schematic view showing a state after the assembling of the ball body according to the first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> is a perspective schematic view showing the assembling of a fixing assembly according to the first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a perspective schematic view of the ball head of the first embodiment of the present invention viewed from another view angle;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a perspective schematic view showing a threaded rod is rotated into a threaded rod accommodating opening according to the first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective schematic view showing a state before the ball head of the first embodiment of the present invention is assembled with a first object; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective schematic view showing a state before a ball head according to a second embodiment of the present invention with a second object.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the invention, and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref> illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.
