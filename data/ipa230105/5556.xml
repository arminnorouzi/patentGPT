Examples of storage devices and memory modules are described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In general, a host system can utilize a memory sub-system that includes one or more components, such as memory devices that store data. The host system can provide data to be stored at the memory sub-system and can request data to be retrieved from the memory sub-system.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An integrated circuit memory cell (e.g., a flash memory cell) can be programmed to store data by the way of its state at a threshold voltage. For example, if the memory cell is configured/programmed in a state that allows a substantial current to pass the memory cell at the threshold voltage, the memory cell is storing a bit of one; and otherwise, the memory cell is storing a bit of zero. Further, a memory cell can store multiple bits of data by being configured/programmed differently at multiple threshold voltages. For example, the memory cell can store multiple bits of data by having a combination of states at the multiple threshold voltages; and different combinations of the states of the memory cell at the threshold voltages can be interpreted to represent different states of bits of data that is stored in the memory cell.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, after the states of integrated circuit memory cells are configured/programmed using write operations to store data in the memory cells, the optimized threshold voltage for reading the memory cells can shift due to a number of factors, such as charge loss, read disturb, cross-temperature effect (e.g., write and read at different operating temperatures), etc., especially when a memory cell is programmed to store multiple bits of data.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Data can be encoded with redundant information to facilitate error detection and recovery. When data encoded with redundant information is stored in a memory sub-system, the memory sub-system can detect errors in raw, encoded data retrieved from the memory sub-system and/or recover the original, non-encoded data that is used to generate encoded data for storing in the memory sub-system. The recovery operation can be successful (or have a high probability of success) when the raw, encoded data retrieved from the memory sub-system contains less than a threshold amount of errors, or the bit error rate in the encoded data is lower than a threshold. For example, error detection and data recovery can be performed using techniques such as error correction code (ECC), low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, etc.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the encoded data retrieved from the memory cells of the memory sub-system has too many errors for successful decoding, the memory sub-system may retry the execution of the read command with adjusted parameters for reading the memory cells. However, it is inefficient to search for a set of parameters through multiple read retry with multiple rounds of calibration, reading, decoding failure, and retry, until the encoded data retrieved from the memory cells can be decoded into error free data. For example, blind searching for the optimized read voltages is inefficient. For example, one or more commands being injected between retry reads can lead to long latency for recovering data from errors.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Conventional calibration circuitry has been used to self-calibrate a memory region in applying read level signals to account for shift of threshold voltages of memory cells within the memory region. During the calibration, the calibration circuitry is configured to apply different test signals to the memory region to count the numbers of memory cells that output a specified data state for the test signals. Based on the counts, the calibration circuitry determines a read level offset value as a response to a calibration command.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">At least some aspects of the present disclosure address the above and other deficiencies by performing test reading a group of memory cells in a voltage range to compute a voltage optimized, within the voltage range, to read the group of memory cells and determining whether the obtained/computed read voltage, optimized within the voltage range, is approximately in a correct voltage range globally.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, in response to a command from a controller of a memory sub-system, a memory device can automatically calibrate a voltage for reading a group of memory cells based on signal and noise characteristics measured for memory cells. The signal and noise characteristics measured for memory cells can be based on a bit count of memory cells in the group having a predetermined status when a test voltage is applied to read the memory cells. Different test voltages that are separated from one another by a predetermined voltage interval or gap can have different bit counts. The difference between bit counts of two adjacent test voltages provides the count difference for the voltage interval or gap between the adjacent test voltages. An optimized read voltage can be found at a voltage where the distribution of the count differences over voltage reaches a minimum.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">When one of the count differences is smaller than its two adjacent neighbors, a minimum can be determined to be in the voltage interval or gap of the smallest count difference. An improved location of the optimized read voltage within the gap can be computed based on a ratio of adjacent neighbors, as further discussed below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">When no count difference is between two higher adjacent neighbors, the optimized read voltage can be identified as in a voltage interval or gap corresponding to a count difference that is smaller than two of the next two count differences. An improved location of the optimized read voltage within the gap can be computed based on a ratio of bit counts at the test voltages of the two ends of the gap, as further discussed below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some instances, the optimized read voltage of a group of memory cells may have changed significantly such that an initial estimation of the optimized read voltage is too far away from the actual optimized read voltage. Since the test voltages for calibrating/optimizing the read voltage are configured within a narrow voltage range based on the initial estimation of the optimized read voltage, the actual optimized read voltage can be outside of the narrow range of test voltages used to measure the signal and noise characteristics and identify an estimate of the optimized read voltage (e.g., using the techniques of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>). As a result, the optimized read voltage estimated using the techniques of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> can be located in the incorrect test voltage range configured to measure the signal and noise characteristics. In a wider possible voltage, the narrow test voltage range may be at a wrong location globally.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Whether the optimized read voltage estimated using the techniques of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> is approximately in a correct voltage range globally can be checked based on a statistical distribution of the threshold voltages of the group of memory cells.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, a statistical distribution of the threshold voltage of a memory cell can indicate that, in a group of memory cells, the memory cells having threshold voltages higher than the actual optimized read voltage for the group should be within a percentage range of the memory cells in the group. Thus, when reading the group of memory cells using an optimized read voltage estimated using the techniques of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the memory device can count the number of memory cells in the group that have threshold voltages above the estimated optimized read voltage. If the ratio between the count of such memory cells and the population of memory cells in the group is outside of a predetermined percentage range known for the actual optimized read voltage, the estimated optimized read voltage can be considered to be in a wrong voltage range (e.g., the errors in the estimated locations of the optimized read voltages are larger than the ranges of test voltages used to determine the estimated locations). In such a situation, the memory device and/or the memory sub-system can adjust the test voltage range to search for an improved optimized read voltage.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, memory cells can be programmed a page at a time; and a page of data can be stored in a group of cells on a same wordline. The group of cells can be identified by a particular wordline and a particular sub-block in one example; and in another example, the group can include all of the memory cells of a particular wordline. When the memory cells are programmed to store multiple bits per memory cell, different bits of a memory cell can be part of different pages. For example, when a memory cell is programmed to store four bits (e.g., in a QLC mode), a first bit can be part of a first page (e.g., referred to as lower page); a second bit can be part of a second page (e.g., referred to as upper page); a third bit can be part of a third page (e.g., referred to as extra page); and a fourth bit can be part of a fourth page (e.g., referred to as top page). Each page (e.g., lower page, upper page, extra page, top page) includes the set of corresponding bits in memory cells in the group.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">After determining a set of optimized read voltages for reading the four pages (e.g., lower page, upper page, extra page, top page) from a group of memory cells in a QLC mode, the memory device can count, for each of the pages, the memory cells having threshold voltages that are higher than the highest one of the optimized read voltages used to read the corresponding page. The ratio of the cell count over the entire population of memory cells in the corresponding page can be compared to a predetermined range. If the ratio is outside of the predetermined range, at least some of the optimized read voltages are in the incorrectly positioned test voltage ranges for their calibration.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, the count of memory cells in a top page having threshold voltages higher than the highest optimized read voltages used in read the top page should be between 1/32 to 3/32 of the memory cells in the top page. If the count is outside of the range for a set of read voltages optimized/calibrated using the techniques of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, some of the test voltage ranges do not contain the actual optimized read voltages; and the optimized/calibrated read voltages calculated based on the test voltage ranges are determined to be in the wrong voltage ranges.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Similarly, the ratio of cell count of an extra page can be compared to the range of 3/32 to 5/32; the ratio of cell count of an upper page can be compared to the range of 7/32 to 9/32; and the ratio of cell count of a lower page can be compared to the range of 15/32 to 17/32.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">If an optimized/calibrated read voltage is found to be based on a wrong test voltage range, the memory device can adjust the test voltage range to calibrate the read voltage.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">After an optimized read voltage is calculated (e.g., using techniques illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref>), the memory device can use the optimized read voltage to read memory cells and obtain hard bit data, and optionally boost modulating the applied read voltage(s) to adjacent voltages to further read the memory cells for soft bit data.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Preferably, the operations of reading the hard bit data and reading the soft bit data are scheduled together during the execution of the read command to minimize the time required to obtain the soft bit data and/or to avoid delay that can be caused by processing a separate read command, or by intervening operations on the memory cells.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Optionally, the signal and noise characteristics measured for memory cells are further used to evaluate the quality of the hard bit data retrieved using the calibrated read voltage(s). The evaluation can be performed at least in part concurrently with the reading of the hard bit data. Based on the evaluated quality of the hard bit data, the memory device may selectively read and/or transmit the soft bit data.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The hard bit data retrieved from a group of memory cells using the calibrated/optimized read voltage can be decoded using an error detection and data recovery technique, such as error correction code (ECC), low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, etc. When the error rate in the hard bit data is high, the soft bit data, retrieved from the memory cell using read voltages with predetermined offsets from the calibrated/optimized read voltage, can be used to assist the decoding of the hard bit data. When the soft bit data is used, the error recovery capability is improved in decoding the hard bit data.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Optionally, a controller of a memory sub-system can initially send a command to a memory device to read hard bit data with calibrated read voltage; and in response to a failure in the decoding of the hard bit data, the controller can further send a command to the memory device to read the corresponding soft bit data. Such an implementation is efficient when the likelihood of a failure in decoding the hard bit data without soft bit data is lower than a threshold. However, when the likelihood is above the threshold, the overhead of sending the separate command becomes disadvantageous.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the likelihood of using soft bit data is above a threshold, it is advantageous to transmit a single command to the memory device to cause the memory device to read the soft bit data and the hard bit data together. Further, the memory device can use the signal and noise characteristics of the memory cells to predict whether the soft bit data is likely to be used by the controller. If the likelihood of using of the soft bit data is lower than a threshold, the memory device can skip reading the soft bit data.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, during the calibration operation, the memory device can measure the signal and noise characteristics of the memory cells and use the measurements to calculate an optimized/calibrated read voltage for reading the memory cells. Once the optimized/calibrated read voltage is obtained, the memory device reads the memory cells to obtain the hard bit data. Subsequently, the memory device adjusts the already applied optimized/calibrated read voltage (e.g., through boosted modulation) to a predetermined offset (e.g., 50 mV) below the optimized/calibrated read voltage to retrieve a set of data, and further adjusts the currently applied voltage (e.g., through boosted modulation) to the predetermined offset above the optimized/calibrated read voltage to retrieve another set of data. The logic operation of XOR (exclusive or) of the two sets of data at the both sides of the offset (e.g., 50 mV) from the optimized/calibrated read voltage provides the indication of whether the memory cells provide the same reading at the offset locations around the optimized/calibrated read voltage. The result of the XOR operation can be used as soft bit data for decoding the hard bit data read using the optimized/calibrated read voltage. In some implementations, a larger offset (e.g., 90 mV) can be used to read another set of soft bit data that indicates whether the memory cells provide the same reading at the locations according to the larger offset (e.g., 90 mV) around the optimized/calibrated read voltage.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, in response to a read command from a controller of the memory sub-system, a memory device of the memory sub-system performs an operation to calibrate a read voltage of memory cells. The calibration is performed by measuring signal and noise characteristics through reading the memory cells at a number of voltage levels that are near an estimated location of the optimized read voltage. An optimized read voltage can be calculated based on statistical data of the results generated from reading the memory cells at the voltage levels. For example, the statistical data can include and/or can be based on counts measured by calibration circuitry at the voltage levels. Optionally, such signal and noise characteristics can be measured for sub-regions in parallel to reduce the total time for measuring the signal and noise characteristics. The statistical data of the results generated from reading the memory cells at the voltage levels can be used to predict whether the decoding of the hard bit data retrieved using the optimized read voltage is likely to require the use of soft bit data for successful decoding. Thus, the transmission of the soft bit data can be performed selectively based on the prediction.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, a predictive model can be generated through machine learning to estimate or evaluate the quality of data that can be retrieved from a set of memory cells using the calibrated/optimized read voltage(s).
