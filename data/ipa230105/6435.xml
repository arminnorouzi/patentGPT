description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a protective relay, and more particularly, to a protective relay that detects whether a transformation unit and a circuit connected to the transformation unit are disconnected in the circuit connected to the transformation unit.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, a transformation unit refers to a device that converts a voltage or current input from a power system into a smaller level of voltage or current, and is used to measure or relay the voltage and current of the power system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such a transformation unit may be divided into an instrument potential transformer (PT) that converts a voltage signal or an instrument current transformer (CT) that converts a current signal. Here, the instrument potential transformer (PT) may be divided into a general potential transformer using an iron core and a potential transformer using a voltage dividing method using a capacitor, a resistor, and the like. Furthermore, the instrument current transformer (CT) may be divided into a general current transformer using an iron core and a current transformer using a Rogowski coil using air as a core.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">First, in a potential transformer or current transformer using an iron core, the iron core may stably provide a path that is a passage for a magnetic flux. Therefore, a signal having a better waveform may be output compared to an input signal. Accordingly, a phase of the input signal and a phase of the output signal may be in phase, and the input signal and the output signal are electrically insulated from each other, and thus there is an advantage in that insulation performance between multiple input signals, that is, insulation performance between phases, is excellent.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, the transformation unit may be disconnected due to an input voltage or current, a defect in an internal circuit constituting the transformation unit, or an external stress such as high temperature or vibration. In this way, when a disconnection occurs due to the transformation unit, a malfunction may occur in a relay element such as a low voltage relay, a ground fault relay, a low current relay, and a low power relay. In addition, such a disconnection of the transformation unit may cause a malfunction in a device that measures and converts an input voltage or an input current, or an output voltage or an output current, such as an inverter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, the protective relay determines whether the transformation unit is disconnected in order to prevent the occurrence of such a malfunction. Furthermore, the determination of whether the transformation unit of the protective relay is disconnected can be made based on a result of detecting a magnitude of a voltage or current or a phase or vector sum input through the transformation unit.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, there is a problem in that such a voltage, a current, a phase or vector sum, and the like, input through the transformation unit is measured to be the same in a state where no voltage signal or current signal is applied from the transformation unit (for example, a state where no voltage signal or current signal is applied during a normal operation of the transformation unit) and a case where a circuit is disconnected due to the transformation unit. Alternatively, when a circuit disconnection due to the transformation unit occurs, it may become a high impedance (negative) state in which a current or voltage signal input from the transformation unit cannot be identified, and in this case, there is a problem in that it is difficult to distinguish whether a detected signal is a signal detected by the high impedance state, that is, the disconnection state or a signal actually detected from the transformation unit.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, when a short-circuit current or an in-rush current generated during the start-up of the transformation unit flows in, a magnitude of a voltage detected through the transformation unit is temporarily changed due to large energy generated by the short-circuit current or the in-rush current. However, a typical method using a voltage, current, or phase or vector sum has a problem in that it is difficult to distinguish between a change in current or voltage signal due to the inflow of the short-circuit current or the in-rush current and a change in current or voltage signal due to a circuit disconnection due to the transformation unit, and accordingly, when the short-circuit current or the in-rush current is generated, it is determined as a disconnection even though the circuit is normally connected.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An aspect of the present disclosure is to solve the foregoing and other problems, and to provide a protective relay and a

disclosure is to provide a protective relay capable of accurately distinguishing between a state in which a voltage signal or a current signal is not applied from the transformation unit and a state in which a circuit is disconnected due to the transformation unit, and a method of detecting a disconnection in the protective relay.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, still another aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a protective relay capable of distinguishing whether a change of a signal detected from the transformation unit is due to a short-circuit current or an in-rush current of a motor, a potential transformer or the like when the change of the signal detected from the transformation unit occurs due to the short-circuit current or the in-rush current, and a method
