It has become a trend to design the antenna structure to be a low-profile structure and package the antenna structure in a circuit board. However, because a thickness of the circuit board is relatively small, when the antenna structure is packaged in the circuit board with the relatively small thickness, a thickness of the antenna structure needs to be made quite small. It is common sense that a smaller thickness (that is, a smaller profile) of the antenna structure indicates a narrower bandwidth. Therefore, how to expand a bandwidth of the antenna structure with a low profile becomes an urgent problem to be resolved.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a low-profile antenna structure in a conventional technology. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the antenna structure includes a signal reference ground <b>01</b>, a radiation patch <b>02</b>, and a feed probe <b>03</b>. The radiation patch <b>02</b> and the signal reference ground <b>01</b> are stacked and spaced apart. An air cavity <b>04</b> is formed between the radiation patch <b>02</b> and the signal reference ground <b>01</b>. One end of the feed probe <b>03</b> is a signal input end, and the other end extends into the air cavity <b>04</b>. A part of the feed probe <b>03</b> that extends into the air cavity <b>04</b> can feed the radiation patch <b>02</b> in a coupled feeding manner. The air cavity <b>04</b> is filled with air, and the air has a dielectric constant approaching 1, which is smaller than that of other filling mediums. Therefore, the bandwidth can be expanded to a certain extent. However, it is rather difficult to arrange the air cavity in the circuit board. Further, it is tested by experiments that under a condition that a relative bandwidth is greater than 20% in the antenna structure, the thickness of the antenna structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is 0.11 times a wavelength. Because the thickness of the circuit board generally does not exceed 0.07 times the wavelength, the antenna structure cannot be packaged in a circuit board.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of this application provide an antenna structure, a circuit board with an antenna structure, and a communications device, to lower a profile of the antenna structure while meeting a bandwidth of the antenna structure, so that the antenna structure can be packaged in a circuit board in the communications device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve the foregoing objective, the following technical solutions are used in embodiments of this application.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, some embodiments of this application provide an antenna structure. The antenna structure includes a signal reference ground, a first radiation patch, a second radiation patch, and at least one feed probe. The first radiation patch and the signal reference ground are stacked and spaced apart. The second radiation patch is located on a side that is of the first radiation patch and that is away from the signal reference ground, and the second radiation patch and the first radiation patch are stacked and spaced apart. The at least one feed probe is located between the first radiation patch and the signal reference ground. Each feed probe includes a first end and a second end that are opposite to each other. The first end is a signal input end, and a projection position of the first end on a plane on which the signal reference ground is located is outside a projection area of the first radiation patch on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located. A projection position of the second end on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located is inside the projection area of the first radiation patch on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located, and the second end is electrically connected to the signal reference ground. A part that is of each feed probe and that is face-to-face with the first radiation patch is capable of feeding the first radiation patch and the second radiation patch in a coupled feeding manner.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The antenna structure provided in embodiments of this application includes the signal reference ground, the first radiation patch, the second radiation patch, and the at least one feed probe. The first radiation patch and the signal reference ground are stacked and spaced apart. The second radiation patch is located on the side that is of the first radiation patch and that is away from the signal reference ground, and the second radiation patch and the first radiation patch are stacked and spaced apart. The at least one feed probe is located between the first radiation patch and the signal reference ground. Each feed probe includes the first end and the second end that are opposite to each other. The projection position of the first end on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located is outside the projection area of the first radiation patch on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located. The projection position of the second end on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located is inside the projection area of the first radiation patch on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located. The part that is of each feed probe and that is face-to-face with the first radiation patch is capable of feeding the first radiation patch and the second radiation patch in a coupled feeding manner. Therefore, when one feed probe performs feeding, the two radiation patches (namely, the first radiation patch and the second radiation patch) are passed, generating two resonances. Further, because the second end of the feed probe is electrically connected to the signal reference ground, impedance matching performance between the two resonances can be improved, thereby increasing an impedance bandwidth. In other words, a profile of the antenna structure can be lowered while a same relative bandwidth is met, so that the antenna structure can be packaged in a circuit board in the communications device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optionally, a length of the part that is of each feed probe and that is face-to-face with the first radiation patch is 0.4 to 0.6 times a wavelength. When the length of the part that is of the feed probe and that is face-to-face with the first radiation patch falls within this range, the antenna structure has a relatively large bandwidth and a relatively low profile.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Optionally, the projection area of the first radiation patch on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located is a first projection area; a projection area of the second radiation patch on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located is a second projection area; and a center of the first projection area coincides with a center of the second projection area. As a result, a distance between an edge of the first projection area and an edge of the second projection area is relatively short, and a length of a part that is of the feed probe and that is used to feed the first radiation patch is approximately equal to a length of a part that is of the feed probe and that is used to feed the second radiation patch.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Optionally, the at least one feed probe includes two feed probes. A projection area, on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located, of a part that is of one of the two feed probes and that is face-to-face with the first radiation patch is a third projection area. The third projection area is perpendicular to a first axis that passes through the center of the first projection area and that is on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located, and the third projection area is axially symmetrical with respect to the first axis. A projection area, on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located, of a part that is of the other one of the two feed probes and that is face-to-face with the first radiation patch is a fourth projection area. The fourth projection area is perpendicular to a second axis that passes through the center of the first projection area and that is on the plane on which the signal reference ground is located, and the fourth projection area is axially symmetrical with respect to the second axis. The first axis is perpendicular to the second axis. In this way, dual polarization of the antenna structure may be implemented by using the two feed probes, so that the antenna structure can simultaneously transmit or receive two signals, thereby increasing transmitting and receiving capacities of the antenna structure, ensuring relatively high isolation between two polarization directions, and avoiding cross interference.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Optionally, both the first radiation patch and the second radiation patch are in the shape of a square. In this way, when the antenna structures form an array, cross interference between two adjacent antenna structures is relatively weak.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a second aspect, some embodiments of this application provide a circuit board with an antenna structure, where the circuit board with an antenna structure includes a circuit board and at least one antenna structure disposed on the circuit board, and the antenna structure is the antenna structure according to any one of the foregoing technical solutions.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The antenna structure in the circuit board with an antenna structure provided in embodiments of this application is the same as an antenna structure provided in the embodiment of the antenna structure according to any one of the foregoing technical solutions. Therefore, the two antenna structures can resolve a same technical problem and achieve a same expected effect.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Optionally, the antenna structure is fabricated on a surface of the circuit board.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Optionally, the circuit board includes a first dielectric layer, a second dielectric layer, and a third dielectric layer that are sequentially stacked. A signal reference ground is a metal layer disposed on a surface that is of the first dielectric layer and that is away from the second dielectric layer. At least one feed probe is a metal layer disposed on a surface that is of the first dielectric layer and that faces the second dielectric layer, or the at least one feed probe is a metal layer disposed on a surface that is of the second dielectric layer and that faces the first dielectric layer. A first radiation patch is a metal layer disposed on a surface that is of the second dielectric layer and that is away from the first dielectric layer. A second radiation patch is a metal layer disposed on a surface that is of the third dielectric layer and that is away from the second dielectric layer. In this way, the antenna structure is packaged in the circuit board by using the existing dielectric layers in the circuit board, and the antenna structure does not need to occupy an external space of the circuit board. This facilitates a miniaturized design for a communications device. In addition, because surface precision of the dielectric layer is relatively high, using the dielectric layer as a bearing medium helps improve size precision of each structure in the antenna structure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, the first dielectric layer, the second dielectric layer, and the third dielectric layer are press-fitted by using a thermo compression process.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Optionally, the at least one feed probe is a metal layer disposed on a surface that is of the first dielectric layer and that faces the second dielectric layer, a metallized via hole is provided at a location of the first dielectric plate layer corresponding to a second end of each feed probe, the metallized via hole penetrates the first dielectric layer, and the second end of the feed probe is electrically connected to the signal reference ground through the metallized via hole. Providing the metallized via hole on the dielectric layer has relatively high precision, low costs, and is easy to implement.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Optionally, the at least one antenna structure includes a plurality of antenna structures, and an array of the plurality of antenna structures is disposed on the circuit board. In this way, a relatively large antenna gain can be obtained by using the array of the antenna structures.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a third aspect, some embodiments of this application provide a communications device.

It has become a trend to design the antenna structure to be a low-profile structure and package the antenna structure in a circuit board. However, because a thickness of the circuit board is relatively small, when the antenna structure is packaged in the circuit board with a relatively small thickness, a profile of the antenna structure needs to be made quite small. However, a smaller profile of the antenna structure indicates a narrower bandwidth. Therefore, how to expand a bandwidth of the antenna structure with a low profile while lowering the profile of the antenna structure becomes an urgent problem to be resolved.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">To resolve the foregoing problem, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is provided, which is a schematic diagram of a structure of a communications device according to some embodiments of this application.
