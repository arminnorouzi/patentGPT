Gene editing can be used to correct for genetic mutations that lead to human disease. For example, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can direct site-specific gene disruption. The Cas9 endonuclease introduces double stranded breaks at sites specified by a single guide RNA (sgRNA), and gene disruption occurs by the introduction of indels that cause frame-shift mutations or by the removal of large segments of the gene. While gene editing platforms (including the CRISPR/Cas9) hold great promise, effective and/or efficient delivery of gene editing factors to cells in vivo or ex vivo remains challenging.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Further, gene therapy holds potential promise for treating both acquired and inherited blinding disorders as most of the identified disease to date is associated with retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. See Bainbridge et al., 2006. Modulating specific gene targets simply by turning off or turning on its function has become a standard tool to enhance stem cell differentiation or to reprogram induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells. See Jia et al., 2010; Nauta et al., 2013. Routinely approached gene therapy utilizes viral vectors to deliver pDNA. This approach, however, is limited by several factors. To overcome these challenges and to follow an alternative safer approach, significant attempts have been made to formulate and develop biodegradable non-viral vehicles agents to facilitate delivery of the gene of interest to the target sites. Such approaches, however, have been limited by poor transfection efficacy.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In aspects, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a composition comprising a poly(beta-amino ester) (PBAE) of formula (I) or formula (II):</p><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="124.12mm" wi="119.13mm" file="US20230002790A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">and at least one DNA or RNA molecule comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a gene-editing protein or therapeutic protein;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">wherein:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">n and m are each independently an integer from 1 to 10,000;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">each R is independently a diacrylate monomer of the following structure:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="36.66mm" wi="62.65mm" file="US20230002790A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">wherein R<sub>o </sub>comprises a linear or branched C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>30 </sub>alkylene chain, which may further comprise one or more heteroatoms or one or more carbocyclic, heterocyclic, or aromatic groups and X<sub>1 </sub>and X<sub>2 </sub>are each independently a linear or branched C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>30 </sub>alkylene chain;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">each R* is a triacrylate, quanternary, or hexafunctional acrylate monomer selected from the group consisting of:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="145.88mm" wi="75.44mm" file="US20230002790A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0015" num="0011">wherein each R&#x2032; is independently a trivalent group; each R&#x2033; is independently a side chain monomer comprising a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine; and each R&#x2033; is independently an end group monomer comprising a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0012">In other aspects, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the composition of formula (I) or formula (II) in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Indeed, many modifications and other embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter set forth herein will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which the presently disclosed subject matter pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated Figures. Therefore, it is to be understood that the presently disclosed subject matter is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">I. Poly(&#x3b2;-Amino Ester) Nanoparticles for the Non-Viral Delivery of Plasmid DNA for Gene Editing and Retinal Gene Therapy</heading><p id="p-0122" num="0118">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides biodegradable particles for delivering nucleic acids to cells, including nucleic acids encoding gene-editing factors or a therapeutic protein. In particular embodiments, the particles comprise poly(beta-amino ester) (PBAE) polymers that self-assemble with nucleic acid, including DNA or RNA. The PBAE particles are biodegradable, e.g., they degrade in water or an aqueous solution. In certain embodiments the degradation is pH-dependent.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0119">In some embodiments, the particles comprise linear or branched PBAE polymers having a backbone constructed from diacrylate monomers, and, optionally in combination with triacrylate monomers, to provide polymers with variable branching. The polymers can be prepared by condensing side chain monomers comprising secondary amines or primary amines with acrylate ester monomers, e.g, diacrylate and triacrylate monomers. For example, in some embodiments, the PBAE comprises a backbone of a diacrylate, e.g., bisphenol A glycerolate (1 glycerol/phenol) diacrylate (BGDA), and a triacrylate, e.g., trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0120">In some embodiments, the polymers comprise tertiary amines in their backbone and/or in some embodiments, the polymers comprise side chains and/or end groups comprising primary, secondary, and/or tertiary amines to complex with a nucleic acid. In some embodiments, the secondary or tertiary amines comprise bivalent amine-containing heterocyclic groups. In some embodiments, the side chain monomers comprise a primary amine, but may also comprise secondary and tertiary amines. In some embodiments, the end group terminates with a primary amine and a hydroxyl, with an internally placed secondary amine.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0121">The particles may be complexed with plasmid DNA encoding the gene-editing endonuclease, and in some embodiments, a gRNA, a plasmid DNA encoding a gRNA, and/or replacement DNA template. In some embodiments, the particles are complexed with a polypeptide (e.g., a gene-editing endonuclease). In such embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides biodegradable nanoparticles to direct efficient site-target disruption, mutation, deletion, or repair of a nucleic acid (e.g., a DNA and/or an RNA). Thus, the presently disclosed subject matter provides an efficient gene therapy platform, involving either ex vivo or in vivo gene and/or transcript editing.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">A. Compositions Comprising Poly(beta-amino esters) (PBAEs) of Formula (I) and Formula (II)</heading><p id="p-0126" num="0122">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides compositions, including particles, comprising multicomponent degradable cationic polymers for gene delivery to cells. The presently disclosed polymers have the property of biphasic degradation and modifications to the polymer structure can result in a change in the release of therapeutic agents, e.g., a DNA plasmid. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed polymers include a minority structure, e.g., an endcapping group, which differs from the majority structure comprising most of the polymer backbone. In other embodiments, the bioreducible oligomers form block copolymers with hydrolytically degradable oligomers. In yet other embodiments, the end group/minority structure comprises an amino acid or chain of amino acids, while the backbone degrades hydrolytically and/or is bioreducible.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0123">Small changes in the monomer ratio used during polymerization, in combination with modifications to the chemical structure of the end-capping groups used post-polymerization, can affect the efficacy of delivery of a gene to a cell. Further, changes in the chemical structure of the polymer, either in the backbone of the polymer or end-capping groups, or both, can change the efficacy of gene delivery to a cell. In some embodiments, small changes to the molecular weight of the polymer or changes to the endcapping groups of the polymer, while leaving the main chain, i.e., backbone, of the polymer the same, can enhance or decrease the overall delivery of the gene to a cell. Further, the &#x201c;R&#x201d; groups that comprise the backbone or main chain of the polymer can be selected to degrade via different biodegradation mechanisms within the same polymer molecule. Such mechanisms include, but are not limited to, hydrolytic, bioreducible, enzymatic, and/or other modes of degradation.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0124">The properties of the presently disclosed multicomponent degradable cationic polymers can be tuned to impart one or more of the following characteristics to the composition: independent control of cell-specific uptake and/or intracellular delivery of a particle; independent control of endosomal buffering and endosomal escape; independent control of DNA release; triggered release of an active agent; modification of a particle surface charge; increased diffusion through a cytoplasm of a cell; increased active transport through a cytoplasm of a cell; increased nuclear import within a cell; increased transcription of an associated DNA within a cell; increased translation of an associated DNA within a cell; and/or increased persistence of an associated therapeutic agent within a cell.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0125">If a hydrophilic peptide/protein is to be encapsulated, a hydrophilic polymer is chosen as the multicomponent material. If a hydrophobic peptide/protein is to be encapsulated than a hydrophobic polymer is chosen. The polymer backbone, side chain, and/or terminal group can be modified to increase the hydrophobic or hydrophilic character of the polymer. The peptide/protein to be encapsulated can be first dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as DMSO or PBS. Then, it is combined with the polymer in, for example, sodium acetate (NaAc). This solution is then diluted with either sodium acetate, OptiMem, DMEM, PBS, or water depending on the particle size desired. The solution in vortexed to mix and then left to incubate for a period of time for particle assembly to take place. The particles can self-assemble with nucleic acid, including plasmid DNA, to form nanoparticles that can be in the range of 50 nm to 500 nm in size. The particles provide for efficient transfection of cells with plasmid DNA, either in vivo or ex vivo.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0126">Representative multicomponent degradable cationic polymers are disclosed in the following U.S. patents and U.S. patent application publications, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety: U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20180177881 for Multicomponent Degradable Cationic Polymers, to Green et al., published Jun. 28, 2018; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20150250881 for Multicomponent Degradable Cationic Polymers, to Green et al., published Sep. 10, 2015; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20120128782 for Multicomponent Degradable Cationic Polymers, to Green et al., published May 24, 2012; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20180112038 for Poly(beta-amino ester)-co-polyethylene glycol (PEG-PBAE-PEG) Polymers for Gene and Drug Delivery, to Green et al., published Apr. 26, 2018; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20180028455 for Peptide/Particle Delivery Systems, to Green et al., published Feb. 1, 2018; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20160374949 for Peptide/Particle Delivery Systems, to Green et al., published Dec. 29, 2016; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20120114759 for Peptide/Particle Delivery Systems, to Green et al., published Dec. 29, 2016; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20160122390 for A Biomimetic Peptide and Biodegradable Delivery Platform for the Treatment of Angiogenesis- and Lymphangiogenesis-Dependent Diseases, to Popel, et al, published May 5, 2016; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20150273071 for Bioreducible Poly (Beta-Amino Ester)s for siRNA Delivery, to Green et al., published Oct. 1, 2015; U.S. Pat.

Tumor-associated antigens include unique tumor antigens expressed exclusively by the tumor from which they are derived, shared tumor antigens expressed in many tumors but not in normal adult tissues, and tissue-specific antigens expressed also by the normal tissue from which the tumor arose. Tumor-associated antigens can be, for example, embryonic antigens, antigens with abnormal post-translational modifications, differentiation antigens, products of mutated oncogenes or tumor suppressors, fusion proteins, or oncoviral proteins. Tumor-associated antigens also include altered glycolipid and glycoprotein antigens, such as neuraminic acid-containing glycosphingolipids (e.g., GM2 and GD2, expressed in melanomas and some brain tumors); blood group antigens, particularly T and sialylated Tn antigens, which can be aberrantly expressed in carcinomas; and mucins, such as CA-125 and CA-19-9 (expressed on ovarian carcinomas) or the underglycosylated MUC-1 (expressed on breast and pancreatic carcinomas). Use of ligand that binds to a tumor-associated antigen or epitope thereof, allows delivery of a nucleic acid expressing a gene-editing protein to a cancer cell; in the cancer cell, the gene-editing protein may delete or inactivate a gene responsible for the cancer cell's proliferation, for example.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0178">Ligands can be chemically conjugated to a particle using any available process. Functional groups for ligand binding include COOH, NH<sub>2</sub>, SH, maleimide, pyridyl disulfide and acrylate. See, e.g., Hermanson, BIOCONJUGATE TECHNIQUES, Academic Press, New York, 1996. Activating functional groups include alkyl and acyl halides, amines, sulfhydryls, aldehydes, unsaturated bonds, hydrazides, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, ketones, azide, alkyne-derivatives, anhydrides, epoxides, carbonates, aminoxy, furan-derivatives and other groups known to activate for chemical bonding. In some embodiments, a ligand can be bound to the particle through the use of a small molecule-coupling reagent. Non-limiting examples of coupling reagents include carbodiimides, maleimides, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, bischloroethylamines, and functional aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde, anhydrides and the like. In other embodiments, a ligand is coupled to a particle through affinity binding such as a biotin-streptavidin linkage or coupling. For example, streptavidin can be bound to a particle by covalent or non-covalent attachment, and a biotinylated ligand can be synthesized using methods that are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0179">In embodiments, ligands are conjugated to a particle through use of cross-linkers containing n-hydro-succinimido (NHS) esters which react with amines on proteins. Alternatively, the cross-linkers are employed that contain active halogens that react with amine-, sulfhydryl-, or histidine-containing proteins, or cross-linkers containing epoxides that react with amines or sulfhydryl groups, or between maleimide groups and sulfhydryl groups. In embodiments, ligands and protein complexes are conjugated, e.g., functionalized, to the particles using EDC/NHS (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide) chemistry, which conjugates carboxyl groups of protein ligands to PLGA. In some embodiments, ligands can be engineered with site-specific functional groups (example, such as a free cysteine), to provide consistent, site-directed, attachment to particles. Site directed attachment can be to functional groups of the selected polymers, including amines. In these embodiments, functional domains of ligands can be directed toward the environment and away from the particle surface. These embodiments further provide a controlled orientation more suitable for off-the-shelf pharmaceutical products.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0180">The resulting nanoparticles are non-cytotoxic and are biodegradable with a half-life between 1 and 7 h in aqueous conditions.

In some embodiments, the composition and cell are contacted in vivo. In other embodiments, the composition and cell are contacted ex vivo.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0186">Accordingly, the presently disclosed particles provide for efficient transfection of cells with nucleic acid, for example, nucleic acid encoding gene editing factors to provide effective gene editing either in vivo or ex vivo. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the particles carry DNA or mRNA encoding a gene editing protein (a gene-editing endonuclease).

In some embodiments, the cell is a stem cell, such as an embryonic stem cell or adult stem cell. In some embodiments, the cell is a hematopoietic stem cell. In some embodiments, including for in vivo nucleic acid delivery, the cell (e.g., target cell) is a cancer cell, malignant cell, or diseases cell.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0189">In some embodiments, the particles are delivered directly to an organism, such as mammalian subject, to thereby direct gene editing in vivo. For gene editing in vivo, particles can be formulated for a variety of modes of administration, including systemic and topical or localized administration.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0190">Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated for administered to patients by any appropriate routes, including intravenous administration, intra-arterial administration, subcutaneous administration, intradermal administration, intralymphatic administration, and intra-tumoral administration.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0191">In some embodiments, the composition is lyophilized, and reconstituted prior to administration.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0192">In various embodiments, the nanoparticles carry a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA or RNA (e.g., mRNA)) encoding a gene editing protein (a gene-editing endonuclease). For example, in some embodiments, the nanoparticles carry plasmid DNA encoding a gene editing protein and, in some embodiments, a guide RNA (e.g., gRNA). Guide RNA may be encoded on a plasmid or provided in RNA form. In some embodiments, the nanoparticles further provide a nucleic acid (e.g., a template) that is a functional gene or portion thereof for recombination or insertion into a genome (e.g., to provide a &#x201c;knock-in&#x201d;). Factors for gene editing can be provided on a single plasmid, or in some embodiments, are encoded on distinct plasmids.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0193">In some embodiments, the nanoparticles comprise a ribonucleoprotein. That is, in some embodiments, nanoparticles comprise a polypeptide (e.g., a gene-editing endonuclease (e.g., a CRISPR protein (e.g., a Cas9 or Cas9-like protein))) and a gRNA.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0194">A gene-editing endonuclease creates a nick or a double-strand break in a target DNA molecule, which inactivates a gene or results in expression (from the gene) of an inactive, reduced-activity, or dominant-negative form of a protein. In some embodiments, the gene-editing protein repairs one or more mutations in a gene or deletes a gene segment, which can be guided by a gRNA with the CRISPR/Cas9 system.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0195">The present technology provides particles comprising nucleic acids that encode gene-editing proteins. The gene-editing protein may be one or more of a Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated nuclease, Cre recombinase, Flp recombinase, a meganuclease, a Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN), a Zinc-Finger Nuclease (ZFN), or a natural or engineered variant, family-member, orthologue, fragment or fusion construct thereof.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0196">In embodiments, the gene-editing protein relates to CRISPR. CRISPR is described, at least in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,697,359 and 9,637,739, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In embodiments of the present technology, a particle as provided herein comprises a nucleic acid encoding a CRISPR-associated nuclease, e.g., the Cas9 endonuclease. While various CRISPR/Cas systems have been used extensively for genome editing in cells of various types and species, recombinant and engineered nucleic acid-binding proteins, such as Cas9 and Cas9-like proteins, find use (e.g., in vitro) in the present technology. The Cas9 protein was discovered as a component of the bacterial adaptive immune system (see, e.g., Barrangou et al. (2007) &#x201c;CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes&#x201d; Science 315: 1709-1712, incorporated herein by reference). Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonuclease that targets and digests foreign DNA in bacteria using RNA:DNA base-pairing between a guide RNA (gRNA) and foreign DNA to provide sequence specificity. Recently, Cas9/gRNA complexes (e.g., a Cas9/gRNA RNP) have found use in genome editing (see, e.g., Doudna et al. (2014) &#x201c;The new frontier of genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9&#x201d; Science 346: 6213, incorporated herein by reference).</p><p id="p-0221" num="0197">In some embodiments, different CRISPR proteins (e.g., Cas9 proteins (e.g., Cas9 proteins from various species and modified versions thereof)) may be advantageous to use in the various provided methods in order to capitalize on various characteristics of the different CRISPR proteins (e.g., for different PAM sequence preferences; for no PAM sequence requirement; for increased or decreased binding activity; for an increased or decreased level of cellular toxicity; for increase or decrease efficiency of in vitro RNP formation; for increase or decrease ability for introduction into cells (e.g., living cells, e.g., living primary cells), etc.). CRISPR proteins from various species may require different PAM sequences in the target DNA. Thus, for a particular CRISPR protein of choice, the PAM sequence requirement may be different than the 5&#x2032;-XGG-3&#x2032; sequence described above. In some embodiments, the protein is an xCas protein having an expanded PAM compatibility (e.g., a Cas9 variant that recognizes a broad range of PAM sequences including NG, GAA and GAT), e.g., as described in Hu et al. (2018) &#x201c;Evolved Cas9 variants with broad PAM compatibility and high DNA specificity&#x201d; Nature 556: 57-63, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0198">In some embodiments, the technology comprises use of other RNA-guided gene-editing nucleases (e.g., Cpf1 and modified versions thereof, Cas13 and modified versions thereof). For example, in some embodiments, use of other RNA-guided nucleases (e.g., Cpf1 and modified versions thereof) provides advantages&#x2014;e.g., in some embodiments, the characteristics of the different nucleases are appropriate for methods as described herein (e.g., other RNA-guided nucleases have preferences for different PAM sequence preferences; other RNA-guided nucleases operate using single crRNAs other than cr/tracrRNA complexes; other RNA-guided nucleases operate with shorter guide RNAs, etc.) In some embodiments, the technology comprises use of a Cpf1 protein, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,790,490, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0199">Many Cas9 orthologs from a wide variety of species have been identified and the proteins share only a few identical amino acids. All identified Cas9 orthologs have the same or similar domain architecture comprising a central HNH endonuclease domain and a split RuvC/RNaseH domain. Cas9 proteins share 4 motifs with a conserved architecture. Motifs 1, 2, and 4 are RuvC like motifs and motif 3 is an HNH motif. In some embodiments, a suitable polypeptide (e.g., a Cas9) comprises an amino acid sequence having 4 motifs, each of motifs 1-4 having at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 99% or 100% amino acid sequence identity to the motifs 1&#x2dc;4 of a known Cas9 and/or Csn1 amino acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0200">A number of bacteria express Cas9 protein variants. The Cas9 from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>is presently the most commonly used; some of the other Cas9 proteins have high levels of sequence identity with the <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 and use the same guide RNAs. Others are more diverse, use different gRNAs, and recognize different PAM sequences as well (the 2-5 nucleotide sequence specified by the protein which is adjacent to the sequence specified by the RNA). Chylinski et al. classified Cas9 proteins from a large group of bacteria (RNA Biology 10:5, 1-12; 2013, incorporated herein by reference), and a large number of Cas9 proteins are listed in supplementary <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and supplementary table 1 thereof, which are incorporated by reference herein.

Acids Res. (2014) 42 (4): 2577-2590, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0210">Thus, in some embodiments, the Cas9 polypeptide is a naturally-occurring polypeptide. In some embodiments, the Cas9 polypeptide is not a naturally-occurring polypeptide (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide, a naturally-occurring polypeptide that is modified, e.g., by one or more amino acid substitutions produced by an engineered nucleic acid comprising one or more nucleotide substitutions, deletions, insertions).</p><p id="p-0237" num="0211">In some embodiments, the technology relates to a protein that is a CRISPR protein derivative. In some embodiments, the protein is a Type II Cas9 protein. In some embodiments, the Cas9 has been engineered to partially remove the nuclease domain (e.g., a &#x201c;dead Cas9&#x201d; or a &#x201c;Cas9 nickase&#x201d;; see, e.g., Nature Methods 11: 399-402 (2014), incorporated herein by reference). In some embodiments, the RNP protein is a protein from a CRISPR system other than the <i>S. pyogenes </i>system, e.g., a Type V Cpf1, C2c1, C2c2, C2c3 protein and derivatives thereof.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0212">In some embodiments, the polypeptide is a chimeric or fusion polypeptide, e.g., a polypeptide that comprises two or more functional domains. For example, in some embodiments, a chimeric polypeptide interacts with (e.g., binds to) an RNA to form an RNP (described above). The RNA guides the polypeptide to a target sequence within target nucleic acid. Thus, in some embodiments a chimeric polypeptide binds target nucleic acid.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0213">In some embodiments, the technology comprises use of an RNA-targeting protein (e.g., Cas13 and/or a modified Cas13), which works according to a similar mechanism as Cas9. In addition to targeting genomic DNA, Cas9 and other CRISPR related proteins (e.g., Cas13) also target RNAs directed by gRNAs (see, e.g., Abudayyeh et al. (2017) &#x201c;RNA targeting with CRISPR-Cas13&#x201d; Nature 550: 280, incorporated herein by reference). Thus, in some embodiments, gRNAs complex with Cas9 or other RNA-guided nucleases (e.g., a class 2 type VI RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas effector (e.g., Cas13), a Cpf1, etc.) to modify (e.g., edit) an RNA (e.g., RNA transcripts and non-coding RNAs). Accordingly, in some embodiments, the technology relates to modifying (e.g., editing) a target RNA using guide RNAs in complex with a CRISPR protein (e.g., an RNA-targeting affinity-tagged Cas13).</p><p id="p-0240" num="0214">In embodiments, the particle further comprises nucleic acid(s) encoding or comprising one or both of crRNA and/or tracrRNA. crRNA contains the guide RNA that locates a specific region of a target DNA along with a region that binds to tracrRNA; together these form an active complex. In embodiments, the crRNA and tracrRNA are combined into a single-guide RNA (sgRNA).</p><p id="p-0241" num="0215">Accordingly, in some embodiments, the technology relates to CRISPR protein/RNA RNP complexes comprising two RNA molecules: (1) a CRISPR RNA (crRNA), possessing a nucleotide sequence complementary to a target nucleotide sequence; and (2) a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA). In this mode, the CRISPR protein (e.g., Cas9) functions as an RNA-guided nuclease that uses both the crRNA and tracrRNA to recognize and cleave a target sequence. Recently, a single chimeric guide RNA (sgRNA) mimicking the structure of the annealed crRNA/tracrRNA has become more widely used than crRNA/tracrRNA because the gRNA approach provides a simplified system with only two components (e.g., the CRISPR protein and the sgRNA). Thus, sequence-specific binding of the RNP to a nucleic acid can be guided by a dual-RNA complex (e.g., a &#x201c;dgRNA&#x201d;), e.g., comprising a crRNA and a tracrRNA in two separate RNAs or by a chimeric single-guide RNA (e.g., a &#x201c;sgRNA&#x201d;) comprising a crRNA and a tracrRNA in a single RNA. (see, e.g., Jinek et al. (2012) &#x201c;A Programmable Dual-RNA-Guided DNA Endonuclease in Adaptive Bacterial Immunity&#x201d; Science 337:816-821, incorporated herein by reference).</p><p id="p-0242" num="0216">As used herein, the targeting region of a crRNA (2-RNA dgRNA system) or a sgRNA (single guide system) is referred to as the &#x201c;guide RNA&#x201d; (gRNA). In some embodiments, the gRNA comprises, consists of, or essentially consists of 10 to 50 bases, e.g., 15 to 40 bases, e.g., 15 to 30 bases, e.g., 15 to 25 bases (e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 bases). Methods are known in the art for determining the length of the gRNA that provides the most efficient target recognition for a CRISPR protein. See, e.g., Lee et al. (2016) &#x201c;The <i>Neisseria meningitidis </i>CRISPR-Cas9 System Enables Specific Genome Editing in Mammalian Cells&#x201d; Molecular Therapy 24: 645 (2016), incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0217">Accordingly, in some embodiments, the gRNA is a short synthetic RNA comprising a &#x201c;scaffold sequence&#x201d; (protein-binding segment) for binding to a CRISPR protein (e.g., a modified CRISPR protein) and a user-defined &#x201c;DNA-targeting sequence&#x201d; (nucleic acid-targeting segment) that is approximately 20-nucleotides long and is complementary to the target site of the target nucleic acid.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0218">In some embodiments, nucleic acid targeting specificity is determined by two factors: 1) a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) sequence matching the gRNA targeting sequence and a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) directly downstream of the target sequence. Some RNP complexes (e.g., CRISPR protein/gRNA (e.g., Cas9/gRNA or modified Cas9/gRNA)) recognize a DNA sequence comprising a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence and an adjacent sequence comprising approximately 20 bases complementary to the gRNA. Canonical PAM sequences are NGG or NAG for Cas9 from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>and NNNNGATT for the Cas9 from <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>. In some embodiments, the technology comprises use of a Cas9 having an expanded PAM recognition (e.g., an xCas9 protein; see, e.g., Hu et al. (2018) &#x201c;Evolved Cas9 variants with broad PAM compatibility and high DNA specificity&#x201d; Nature 556: 57, incorporated herein by reference). Following recognition of a target site in a target nucleic acid by hybridization of the gRNA to the target sequence, the CRISPR protein (e.g., Cas9) cleaves the nucleic acid sequence via an intrinsic nuclease activity. For genome editing and other purposes, the CRISPR/Cas system from <i>S. pyogenes </i>has been used most often. Using this system, one can target a given target nucleic acid (e.g., for editing or other manipulation) by designing a gRNA comprising a nucleotide sequence complementary to a DNA sequence (e.g., a DNA sequence comprising approximately 20 nucleotides) that is 5&#x2032;-adjacent to the PAM. Methods are known in the art for determining a PAM sequence that provides efficient target recognition for a Cas9 (and thus for a modified Cas9). See, e.g., Zhang et al.

The effects of multiple agents may, but need not be, additive or synergistic. The agents may be administered multiple times.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0285">In some embodiments, when administered in combination, the two or more agents can have a synergistic effect. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;synergy,&#x201d; &#x201c;synergistic,&#x201d; &#x201c;synergistically&#x201d; and derivations thereof, such as in a &#x201c;synergistic effect&#x201d; or a &#x201c;synergistic combination&#x201d; or a &#x201c;synergistic composition&#x201d; refer to circumstances under which the biological activity of a combination of a composition of formula (I) and at least one additional therapeutic agent is greater than the sum of the biological activities of the respective agents when administered individually.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0286">Synergy can be expressed in terms of a &#x201c;Synergy Index (SI),&#x201d; which generally can be determined by the method described by F. C. Kull et al., Applied Microbiology 9, 538 (1961), from the ratio determined by:</p><p id="p-0315" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Q</i><sub>a</sub><i>/Q</i><sub>A</sub><i>+Q</i><sub>b</sub><i>/Q</i><sub>B</sub>=Synergy Index (SI)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0316" num="0000">wherein:</p><p id="p-0317" num="0287">Q<sub>A </sub>is the concentration of a component A, acting alone, which produced an end point in relation to component A;</p><p id="p-0318" num="0288">Q<sub>a </sub>is the concentration of component A, in a mixture, which produced an end point;</p><p id="p-0319" num="0289">Q<sub>B </sub>is the concentration of a component B, acting alone, which produced an end point in relation to component B; and</p><p id="p-0320" num="0290">Q<sub>b </sub>is the concentration of component B, in a mixture, which produced an end point.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0291">Generally, when the sum of Q<sub>a</sub>/Q<sub>A </sub>and Q<sub>b</sub>/Q<sub>B </sub>is greater than one, antagonism is indicated.

Definitions</heading><p id="p-0322" num="0292">Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this presently described subject matter belongs.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0293">As used herein, the term &#x201c;CRISPR activity&#x201d; refers to an activity associated with a CRISPR system. Examples of such activities are sequence-specific binding, double-stranded nuclease activity, nickase activity, transcriptional activation, transcriptional repression, nucleic acid methylation, nucleic acid demethylation, and recombinase.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0294">Furthermore, as used herein, the term &#x201c;CRISPR system&#x201d; refers to a collection of CRISPR proteins and nucleic acid that, when combined (e.g., to form a RNP (e.g., a CRISPR complex)), result in at least CRISPR-associated activity (e.g., the target locus specific, double-stranded cleavage of double-stranded DNA). For instance, in some embodiments, &#x201c;CRISPR system&#x201d; refers collectively to transcripts and other elements involved in the expression of and/or directing the activity of CRISPR-associated (&#x201c;Cas&#x201d;) genes, including sequences encoding a Cas gene, dCas gene, Cas nickase, Cas homolog, Cpf1 gene, Cas13, and/or modified versions of any of the foregoing; a tracr (trans-activating CRISPR) sequence (e.g., tracrRNA or an active partial tracrRNA); a cr (CRISPR) sequence (e.g., crRNA or an active partial crRNA); and/or other sequences and transcripts from a CRISPR locus. In some embodiments of the technology, the terms &#x201c;guide sequence&#x201d; and &#x201c;guide RNA&#x201d; (gRNA) are used interchangeably. In some embodiments, one or more elements of a CRISPR system is/are derived from a type I, type II, or type III CRISPR system. In some embodiments, one or more elements of a CRISPR system is/are derived from a particular organism comprising an endogenous CRISPR system, such as <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. In general, a CRISPR system is characterized by elements that promote the formation of a CRISPR RNP complex (e.g., in vitro or in vivo) and direct it to the site of a target sequence (e.g., in a cell (e.g., after introduction of the RNP) and/or in vitro).</p><p id="p-0325" num="0295">As used herein, the term &#x201c;CRISPR complex&#x201d; refers to the CRISPR proteins and nucleic acid (e.g., RNA) that associate with each other to form an aggregate (e.g., an RNP) that has functional activity. An example of a CRISPR complex is a wild-type Cas9 (sometimes referred to as Csn1) protein or Cas9-like protein that is bound to a guide RNA specific for a target locus.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0296">As used herein, the term &#x201c;CRISPR protein&#x201d; refers to a protein comprising a nucleic acid (e.g., RNA (e.g., gRNA)) binding domain and an effector (e.g., nuclease) domain (e.g., Cas9 (e.g., <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>Cas9) and modified versions thereof). The nucleic acid binding domains interact with a first nucleic acid molecule either having a region capable of hybridizing to a desired target nucleic acid (e.g., a guide RNA) or that associates with a second nucleic acid having a region capable of hybridizing to the desired target nucleic acid (e.g., a crRNA). In some embodiments, a CRISPR protein comprises a nuclease domain (e.g., DNase or RNase domain), one or more additional DNA binding domains, a helicase domain, a protein-protein interaction domain, a dimerization domain, an affinity tag, as well as one or more other domains. In some embodiments, &#x201c;CRISPR protein&#x201d; refers to a plurality of proteins that form a complex that binds the first nucleic acid molecule referred to above. Thus, one CRISPR protein may bind to, for example, a guide RNA and another protein may have endonuclease activity. These are all considered to be CRISPR proteins because they function as part of a complex that performs the same functions as a single protein such as Cas9. In some embodiments, CRISPR proteins comprise nuclear localization signals (NLS) that allow them to be transported to the nucleus.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0297">As used herein, a &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; or a &#x201c;nucleic acid sequence&#x201d; refers to a polymer or oligomer of pyrimidine and/or purine bases, preferably cytosine, thymine, and uracil, and adenine and guanine, respectively (See Albert L. Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry, at 793-800 (Worth Pub. 1982), incorporated herein by reference). The present technology contemplates any deoxyribonucleotide, ribonucleotide, or peptide nucleic acid component, and any chemical variants thereof, such as methylated, hydroxymethylated, or glycosylated forms of these bases, and the like. The polymers or oligomers may be heterogenous or homogenous in composition, and may be isolated from naturally occurring sources or may be artificially or synthetically produced. In addition, the nucleic acids may be DNA or RNA, or a mixture thereof, and may exist permanently or transitionally in single-stranded or double-stranded form, including homoduplex, heteroduplex, and hybrid states. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid or nucleic acid sequence comprises other kinds of nucleic acid structures such as, for instance, a DNA/RNA helix, peptide nucleic acid (PNA), morpholino nucleic acid (see, e.g., Braasch and Corey, Biochemistry, 2002, 41(14), 4503-4510, incorporated herein by reference) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,034,506, incorporated herein by reference), locked nucleic acid (LNA; see Wahlestedt et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 2000, 97, 5633-5638, incorporated herein by reference), cyclohexenyl nucleic acids (see Wang, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2000, 122, 8595-8602, incorporated herein by reference), and/or a ribozyme. Hence, the term &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; or &#x201c;nucleic acid sequence&#x201d; may also encompass a chain comprising non-natural nucleotides, modified nucleotides, and/or non-nucleotide building blocks that can exhibit the same function as natural nucleotides (e.g., &#x201c;nucleotide analogs&#x201d;); further, the term &#x201c;nucleic acid sequence&#x201d; as used herein refers to an oligonucleotide, nucleotide or polynucleotide, and fragments or portions thereof, and to DNA or RNA of genomic or synthetic origin, which may be single or double-stranded, and represent the sense or antisense strand.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0298">Furthermore, the terms &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d;, &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d;, &#x201c;nucleotide sequence&#x201d;, and &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; are used interchangeably. They refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, or analogs thereof. Polynucleotides may have any three dimensional structure and may perform any function, known or unknown. The following are non-limiting examples of polynucleotides: coding or non-coding regions of a gene or gene fragment, loci (locus) defined from linkage analysis, exons, introns, messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, short interfering RNA (siRNA), short-hairpin RNA (shRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), ribozymes, cDNA, recombinant polynucleotides, branched polynucleotides, plasmids, vectors, isolated DNA of any sequence, isolated RNA of any sequence, nucleic acid probes, and primers. The term also encompasses nucleic-acid-like structures with synthetic backbones, see, e.g., Eckstein, 1991; Baserga et al., 1992; Milligan, 1993; WO 97/03211; WO 96/39154; Mata, 1997; Strauss-Soukup, 1997; and Samstag, 1996, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. A polynucleotide may comprise one or more modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and nucleotide analogs. If present, modifications to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after polymerization, such as by conjugation with a labeling component.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0299">The term &#x201c;nucleotide analog&#x201d; as used herein refers to modified or non-naturally occurring nucleotides including but not limited to analogs that have altered stacking interactions such as 7-deaza purines (e.g., 7-deaza-dATP and 7-deaza-dGTP); base analogs with alternative hydrogen bonding configurations (e.g., such as Iso-C and Iso-G and other non-standard base pairs described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,983, herein incorporated by reference); non-hydrogen bonding analogs (e.g., non-polar, aromatic nucleoside analogs such as 2,4-difluorotoluene, described by B. A. Schweitzer and E. T. Kool, J. Org. Chem., 1994, 59, 7238-7242, B. A. Schweitzer and E. T. Kool, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1995, 117, 1863-1872; each of which is herein incorporated by reference); &#x201c;universal&#x201d; bases such as 5-nitroindole and 3-nitropyrrole; and universal purines and pyrimidines (such as &#x201c;K&#x201d; and &#x201c;P&#x201d; nucleotides, respectively; P. Kong, et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1989, 17, 10373-10383, P. Kong et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1992, 20, 5149-5152, each of which is incorporated herein by reference).</p><p id="p-0330" num="0300">Nucleotide analogs include nucleotides having modification on the sugar moiety, such as dideoxy nucleotides and 2&#x2032;-O-methyl nucleotides. Nucleotide analogs include modified forms of deoxyribonucleotides as well as ribonucleotides.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0301">As used herein, the term &#x201c;peptide nucleic acid&#x201d; means a DNA mimic that incorporates a peptide-like polyamide backbone.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0302">As used herein, the term &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; refers to the percentage of nucleotides or nucleotide analogs in a nucleic acid sequence that is identical with the corresponding nucleotides in a reference sequence after aligning the two sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent identity. Hence, in case a nucleic acid according to the technology is longer than a reference sequence, additional nucleotides in the nucleic acid, that do not align with the reference sequence, are not taken into account for determining sequence identity. Methods and computer programs for alignment are well known in the art, including BLAST, Align 2, and FASTA.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0303">The term &#x201c;homology&#x201d; and &#x201c;homologous&#x201d; refers to a degree of identity. There may be partial homology or complete homology. A partially homologous sequence is one that is less than 100% identical to another sequence.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0304">The term &#x201c;sequence variation&#x201d; as used herein refers to a difference or multiple differences in nucleic acid sequence between two nucleic acids. For example, a wild-type structural gene and a mutant form of this wild-type structural gene may vary in sequence by the presence of one or more single base substitutions or by deletions and/or insertions of one or more nucleotides. These two forms of the structural gene are said to vary in sequence from one another. A second mutant form of the structural gene may exist. This second mutant form is said to vary in sequence from both the wild-type gene and the first mutant form of the gene.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0305">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;complementary&#x201d; or &#x201c;complementarity&#x201d; are used in reference to polynucleotides (e.g., a sequence of nucleotides such as an oligonucleotide or a target nucleic acid) related by the base-pairing rules. For example, for the sequence &#x201c;5&#x2032;-A-G-T-3&#x2032;&#x201d; is complementary to the sequence &#x201c;3&#x2032;-T-C-A-5&#x2032;.&#x201d; Complementarity may be &#x201c;partial,&#x201d; in which only some of the nucleic acid bases are matched according to the base pairing rules. Or, there may be &#x201c;complete&#x201d; or &#x201c;total&#x201d; complementarity between the nucleic acids. The degree of complementarity between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of hybridization between nucleic acid strands. This is of particular importance in amplification reactions, as well as detection methods that depend upon binding between nucleic acids. Either term may also be used in reference to individual nucleotides, especially within the context of polynucleotides. For example, a particular nucleotide within an oligonucleotide may be noted for its complementarity, or lack thereof, to a nucleotide within another nucleic acid strand, in contrast or comparison to the complementarity between the rest of the oligonucleotide and the nucleic acid strand.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0306">In some contexts, the term &#x201c;complementarity&#x201d; and related terms (e.g., &#x201c;complementary&#x201d;, &#x201c;complement&#x201d;) refers to the nucleotides of a nucleic acid sequence that can bind to another nucleic acid sequence through hydrogen bonds, e.g., nucleotides that are capable of base pairing, e.g., by Watson-Crick base pairing or other base pairing. Nucleotides that can form base pairs, e.g., nucleotides that are complementary to one another, are the pairs: cytosine and guanine, thymine and adenine, adenine and uracil, and guanine and uracil. The percentage complementarity need not be calculated over the entire length of a nucleic acid sequence. The percentage of complementarity may be limited to a specific region of which the nucleic acid sequences that are base-paired, e.g., starting from a first base-paired nucleotide and ending at a last base-paired nucleotide. The complement of a nucleic acid sequence as used herein refers to an oligonucleotide which, when aligned with the nucleic acid sequence such that the 5&#x2032; end of one sequence is paired with the 3&#x2032; end of the other, is in &#x201c;antiparallel association.&#x201d; Certain bases not commonly found in natural nucleic acids may be included in the nucleic acids of the present invention and include, for example, inosine and 7-deazaguanine. Complementarity need not be perfect; stable duplexes may contain mismatched base pairs or unmatched bases. Those skilled in the art of nucleic acid technology can determine duplex stability empirically considering a number of variables including, for example, the length of the oligonucleotide, base composition and sequence of the oligonucleotide, ionic strength and incidence of mismatched base pairs.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0307">It is understood in the art that the sequence of a polynucleotide need not be 100% complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to be &#x201c;hybridizable&#x201d; or &#x201c;specifically hybridizable&#x201d; to the target nucleic acid. Moreover, a polynucleotide may hybridize over one or more segments such that intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization event (e.g., a loop structure or hairpin structure). A polynucleotide can comprise at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, or 100% sequence complementarity to a target region within the target nucleic acid sequence to which they are targeted. For example, a nucleic acid in which 18 of 20 nucleotides of the nucleic acid are complementary to a target region, and would therefore specifically hybridize, would represent 90 percent complementarity. In this example, the remaining non-complementary nucleotides may be clustered or interspersed with complementary nucleotides and need not be contiguous to each other or to complementary nucleotides. Percent complementarity between particular segments of nucleic acid sequences within nucleic acids can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403-410; Zhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649-656, each of which is incorporated herein by reference) or by using the Gap program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, Madison Wis.), using default settings, which uses the algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Adv. Appl. Math., 1981, 2, 482-489, incorporated herein by reference).</p><p id="p-0338" num="0308">Thus, in some embodiments, &#x201c;complementary&#x201d; refers to a first nucleobase sequence that is at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to the complement of a second nucleobase sequence over a region of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, or more nucleobases, or that the two sequences hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions. &#x201c;Fully complementary&#x201d; means each nucleobase of a first nucleic acid is capable of pairing with each nucleobase at a corresponding position in a second nucleic acid. For example, in certain embodiments, an oligonucleotide wherein each nucleobase has complementarity to a nucleic acid has a nucleobase sequence that is identical to the complement of the nucleic acid over a region of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, or more nucleobases.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0309">As used herein, the term &#x201c;mismatch&#x201d; means a nucleobase of a first nucleic acid that is not capable of pairing with a nucleobase at a corresponding position of a second nucleic acid.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0310">As used herein, the term &#x201c;hybridization&#x201d; is used in reference to the pairing of complementary nucleic acids. Hybridization and the strength of hybridization (i.e., the strength of the association between the nucleic acids) is influenced by such factors as the degree of complementary between the nucleic acids, stringency of the conditions involved, and the Tm of the formed hybrid. &#x201c;Hybridization&#x201d; methods involve the annealing of one nucleic acid to another, complementary nucleic acid, e.g., a nucleic acid having a complementary nucleotide sequence. The ability of two polymers of nucleic acid containing complementary sequences to find each other and &#x201c;anneal&#x201d; or &#x201c;hybridize&#x201d; through base pairing interaction is a well-recognized phenomenon. The initial observations of the &#x201c;hybridization&#x201d; process by Marmur and Lane, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 46:453 (1960) and Doty et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 46:461 (1960), each of which is incorporated herein by reference, have been followed by the refinement of this process into an essential tool of modern biology. For example, hybridization and washing conditions are now well known and exemplified in Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor (1989), particularly Chapter 11 and Table 11.1 therein; and Sambrook, J. and Russell, W., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Third Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor (2001), each of which is incorporated herein by reference. The conditions of temperature and ionic strength determine the &#x201c;stringency&#x201d; of the hybridization.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0311">As used herein, a &#x201c;double-stranded nucleic acid&#x201d; may be a portion of a nucleic acid, a region of a longer nucleic acid, or an entire nucleic acid. A &#x201c;double-stranded nucleic acid&#x201d; may be, e.g., without limitation, a double-stranded DNA, a double-stranded RNA, a double-stranded DNA/RNA hybrid, etc. A single-stranded nucleic acid having secondary structure (e.g., base-paired secondary structure) and/or higher order structure (e.g., a stem-loop structure) comprises a &#x201c;double-stranded nucleic acid&#x201d;. For example, triplex structures are considered to be &#x201c;double-stranded&#x201d;. In some embodiments, any base-paired nucleic acid is a &#x201c;double-stranded nucleic acid&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0312">As used herein, the term &#x201c;genomic locus&#x201d; or &#x201c;locus&#x201d; (plural &#x201c;loci&#x201d;) is the specific location of a gene or nucleic acid (e.g., DNA or RNA) sequence on a chromosome.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0313">The term &#x201c;gene&#x201d; refers to a DNA sequence that comprises control and coding sequences necessary for the production of an RNA having a non-coding function (e.g., a ribosomal or transfer RNA), a polypeptide, or a precursor. The RNA or polypeptide can be encoded by a full length coding sequence or by any portion of the coding sequence so long as the desired activity or function is retained. Thus, a &#x201c;gene&#x201d; refers to a DNA or RNA, or portion thereof, that encodes a polypeptide or an RNA chain that has functional role to play in an organism. For the purpose of this technology it may be considered that genes include regions that regulate the production of the gene product, whether or not such regulatory sequences are adjacent to coding and/or transcribed sequences. Accordingly, a gene includes, but is not necessarily limited to, promoter sequences, terminators, translational regulatory sequences such as ribosome binding sites and internal ribosome entry sites, enhancers, silencers, insulators, boundary elements, replication origins, matrix attachment sites, and locus control regions.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0314">The term &#x201c;wild-type&#x201d; refers to a gene or a gene product that has the characteristics of that gene or gene product when isolated from a naturally occurring source. A wild-type gene is that which is most frequently observed in a population and is thus arbitrarily designated the &#x201c;normal&#x201d; or &#x201c;wild-type&#x201d; form of the gene. In contrast, the term &#x201c;modified,&#x201d; &#x201c;mutant,&#x201d; or &#x201c;polymorphic&#x201d; refers to a gene or gene product that displays modifications in sequence and or functional properties (i.e., altered characteristics) when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product. It is noted that naturally-occurring mutants can be isolated; these are identified by the fact that they have altered characteristics when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0315">As used herein, the term &#x201c;knockout&#x201d; is a genetic modification resulting from the disruption of the genetic information encoded in a chromosomal locus.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0316">As used herein, the term &#x201c;knockin&#x201d; is a genetic modification resulting from the replacement of the genetic information encoded in a chromosomal locus with a different nucleic acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0317">As used herein, the term &#x201c;knockout organism&#x201d; is an organism in which a significant proportion of the organism's cells harbor a knockout.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0318">As used herein, the term &#x201c;knockin organism&#x201d; is an organism in which a significant proportion of the organism's cells harbor a knockin.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0319">As used herein, the term &#x201c;functional derivative&#x201d; of a polypeptide is a compound having a qualitative biological property in common with said polypeptide. &#x201c;Functional derivatives&#x201d; include, but are not limited to, fragments of polypeptide and derivatives of a polypeptide and its fragments, provided that they have a biological activity in common with a corresponding polypeptide. The term &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; encompasses both amino acid sequence variants of polypeptide, covalent modifications, and fusions thereof.

In some embodiments, a nuclease-deficient protein is described as a &#x201c;dead&#x201d; protein and may be designated a &#x201c;d&#x201d; appended to the protein name (e.g., a dCas9).</p><p id="p-0353" num="0323">The term &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; as used herein is defined as a molecule comprising two or more deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, preferably at least 5 nucleotides, more preferably at least about 10 to 15 nucleotides and more preferably at least about 15 to 50 nucleotides (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 or more nucleotides).

The oligonucleotide may be generated in any manner, including chemical synthesis, DNA replication, reverse transcription, PCR, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0324">Because mononucleotides are reacted to make oligonucleotides in a manner such that the 5&#x2032; phosphate of one mononucleotide pentose ring is attached to the 3&#x2032; oxygen of its neighbor in one direction via a phosphodiester linkage, an end of an oligonucleotide is referred to as the &#x201c;5&#x2032; end&#x201d; if its 5&#x2032; phosphate is not linked to the 3&#x2032; oxygen of a mononucleotide pentose ring and as the &#x201c;3&#x2032; end&#x201d; if its 3&#x2032; oxygen is not linked to a 5&#x2032; phosphate of a subsequent mononucleotide pentose ring. As used herein, a nucleic acid sequence, even if internal to a larger oligonucleotide, also may be said to have 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends. A first region along a nucleic acid strand is said to be upstream of another region if the 3&#x2032; end of the first region is before the 5&#x2032; end of the second region when moving along a strand of nucleic acid in a 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; direction.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0325">When two different, non-overlapping oligonucleotides anneal to different regions of the same linear complementary nucleic acid sequence, and the 3&#x2032; end of one oligonucleotide points towards the 5&#x2032; end of the other, the former may be called the &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; oligonucleotide and the latter the &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; oligonucleotide. Similarly, when two overlapping oligonucleotides are hybridized to the same linear complementary nucleic acid sequence, with the first oligonucleotide positioned such that its 5&#x2032; end is upstream of the 5&#x2032; end of the second oligonucleotide, and the 3&#x2032; end of the first oligonucleotide is upstream of the 3&#x2032; end of the second oligonucleotide, the first oligonucleotide may be called the &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; oligonucleotide and the second oligonucleotide may be called the &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; oligonucleotide.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0326">The terms &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein, and refer to a polymeric form of amino acids of any length, which can include coded and non-coded amino acids, chemically or biochemically modified or derivatized amino acids, and polypeptides having modified peptide backbones.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0327">As used herein, the term &#x201c;ribonucleoprotein&#x201d;, abbreviated &#x201c;RNP&#x201d; refers to a multimolecular complex comprising a polypeptide (e.g., a CRISPR protein or a protein having CRISPR activity or an activity similar to a CRISPR protein (e.g., a Cas9, Cpf1, or other Cas9-like protein, a Cas9 homolog, Cas13, and/or any modified version of any of the foregoing)) and a ribonucleic acid (e.g., a gRNA (e.g., sgRNA, a dgRNA)). In some embodiments, the polypeptide and ribonucleic acid are bound by a non-covalent interaction.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0328">The term &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; refers to the interchangeability in proteins of amino acid residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains consists of glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains consists of serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide containing side chains consisting of asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains consists of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains consists of lysine, arginine, and histidine; a group of amino acids having acidic side chains consists of glutamate and aspartate; and a group of amino acids having sulfur containing side chains consists of cysteine and methionine. Exemplary conservative amino acid substitution groups are: valine-leucine/isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, and asparagine-glutamine.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0329">As used herein, the term &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; means that a particular nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) is the product of various combinations of cloning, restriction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and/or ligation steps resulting in a construct having a structural coding or non-coding sequence distinguishable from endogenous nucleic acids found in natural systems. DNA sequences encoding polypeptides can be assembled from cDNA fragments or from a series of synthetic oligonucleotides, to provide a synthetic nucleic acid which is capable of being expressed from a recombinant transcriptional unit contained in a cell or in a cell-free transcription and translation system. Genomic DNA comprising the relevant sequences can also be used in the formation of a recombinant gene or transcriptional unit. Sequences of non-translated DNA may be present 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; from the open reading frame, where such sequences do not interfere with manipulation or expression of the coding regions, and may indeed act to modulate production of a desired product by various mechanisms). Alternatively, DNA sequences encoding RNA (e.g., DNA-targeting RNA) that is not translated may also be considered recombinant Thus, e.g., the term &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; nucleic acid refers to one which is not naturally occurring, e.g., is made by the artificial combination of two otherwise separated segments of sequence through human intervention. This artificial combination is often accomplished by either chemical synthesis means, or by the artificial manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids, e.g., by genetic engineering techniques. Such is usually done to replace a codon with a codon encoding the same amino acid, a conservative amino acid, or a non-conservative amino acid. Alternatively, it is performed to join together nucleic acid segments of desired functions to generate a desired combination of functions. This artificial combination is often accomplished by either chemical synthesis means, or by the artificial manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids, e.g., by genetic engineering techniques. When a recombinant polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide, the sequence of the encoded polypeptide can be naturally occurring (&#x201c;wild type&#x201d;) or can be a variant (e.g., a mutant) of the naturally occurring sequence. Thus, the term &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; polypeptide does not necessarily refer to a polypeptide whose sequence does not naturally occur. Instead, a &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; polypeptide is encoded by a recombinant DNA sequence, but the sequence of the polypeptide can be naturally occurring (&#x201c;wild type&#x201d;) or non-naturally occurring (e.g., a variant, a mutant, etc.). Thus, a &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; polypeptide is the result of human intervention, but may be a naturally occurring amino acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0330">A &#x201c;vector&#x201d; or &#x201c;expression vector&#x201d; is a replicon, such as plasmid, phage, virus, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), or cosmid, to which another DNA segment, e.g., an &#x201c;insert&#x201d;, may be attached so as to bring about the replication of the attached segment in a cell.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0331">A cell has been &#x201c;genetically modified&#x201d; or &#x201c;transformed&#x201d; or &#x201c;transfected&#x201d; by exogenous DNA, e.g. a recombinant expression vector, when such DNA has been introduced inside the cell (e.g., according to the technology provided herein). In some embodiments, the presence of the exogenous DNA results in permanent or transient genetic change. The transforming DNA may or may not be integrated (covalently linked) into the genome of the cell. In prokaryotes, yeast, and mammalian cells for example, the transforming DNA may be maintained on an episomal element such as a plasmid. With respect to eukaryotic cells, a stably transformed cell is one in which the transforming DNA has become integrated into a chromosome so that it is inherited by daughter cells through chromosome replication. This stability is demonstrated by the ability of the eukaryotic cell to establish cell lines or clones that comprise a population of daughter cells containing the transforming DNA. A &#x201c;clone&#x201d; is a population of cells derived from a single cell or common ancestor by mitosis. A &#x201c;cell line&#x201d; is a clone of a primary cell that is capable of stable growth in vitro for many generations.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0332">Suitable methods of genetic modification (also referred to as &#x201c;transformation&#x201d;) include e.g., viral or bacteriophage infection, transfection, conjugation, protoplast fusion, lipofection, electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, polyethyleneimine (PEI)-mediated transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, liposome-mediated transfection, particle gun technology, calcium phosphate precipitation, direct micro injection, and/or nanoparticle-mediated nucleic acid delivery (e.g., according to the biodegradable polymer nanoparticle technology described herein; see also, e.g., Panyam and Labhasetwar (2012), Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 64 (supplement): 61-71, incorporated herein by reference). The choice of method of genetic modification is generally dependent on the type of cell being transformed and the circumstances under which the transformation is taking place (e.g., in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo).

A segment can also mean a segment or section or portion or region of a complex such that a segment may comprise regions of more than one molecule. For example, in some embodiments the protein-binding segment (described below) of a nucleic acid-targeting RNA is one RNA molecule and the protein-binding segment therefore comprises a region of that RNA molecule. In other cases, the protein-binding segment (described below) of a nucleic acid-targeting RNA comprises two separate molecules that are hybridized along a region of complementarity. As an illustrative, non-limiting example, a protein-binding segment of a nucleic acid-targeting RNA that comprises two separate molecules can comprise (i) base pairs 40-75 of a first RNA molecule that is 100 base pairs in length; and (ii) base pairs 10-25 of a second RNA molecule that is 50 base pairs in length.

W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd ed. John Wiley &#x26; Sons (1999). It may be advantageous, where different protecting groups are employed, that each (different) protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions allow differential removal of such protecting groups. For example, protective groups can be removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolysis. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and tert-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, without limitation, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as tert-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0445">Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0446">Allyl blocking groups are useful in the presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a palladium(O)-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0447">Typical blocking/protecting groups include, but are not limited to the following moieties:</p><p id="p-0482" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00113" num="00113"><img id="EMI-C00113" he="466.26mm" wi="33.95mm" file="US20230002790A1-20230105-C00113.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0483" num="0448">Following long-standing patent law convention, the terms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; refer to &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; when used in this application, including the claims.

The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful genome editing tool that can direct site-specific gene disruption. The Cas9 endonuclease introduces double stranded breaks at sites specified by a single guide RNA (sgRNA), and gene disruption occurs by the introduction of indels that cause frame-shift mutations (gene knockout) or by the removal of large segments of the gene (gene deletion). The Cas9-sgRNA complex recognizes a target site in genomic DNA, then Cas9 cuts genomic DNA. The CRISPR/Cas9 system holds great potential as a gene therapy platform. Safe and effective delivery, however, remains a challenge.</p><p id="p-0489" num="0454">Poly(&#x3b2;-amino ester)s (PBAEs) are a class of biodegradable, cationic polymers that self-assemble into nanoparticles upon complexation with nucleic acids. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the presently disclosed matter provides PBAE nanoparticles for co-delivering plasmid DNA encoding Cas9 and sgRNA to a cell to mediate gene knockout and deletion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts the formation of PBAE-DNA nanoparticles. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a representative PBAE polymer, designated as 446.</p><p id="p-0490" num="0455">1.2 Methods. To assess gene knockout efficiency, PBAE nanoparticles were used to deliver two plasmids encoding the Cas9 protein and an anti-eGFP sgRNA, respectively, to HEK-293T cells constitutively expressing a destabilized form of eGFP. Knockout of eGFP was assessed by flow cytometry and confirmed by Surveyor&#xae; nuclease assay and Sanger sequencing. To assess gene deletion efficacy, a HEK-293T cell line constitutively expressing a red-enhanced nanolantern (ReNL) reporter gene downstream of a transcription stop cassette consisting of two SV40 terminator sequences was generated. PBAE nanoparticles were used to deliver plasmids encoding Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting the stop cassette. Gene deletion was assessed by the quantification of ReNL expression, which occurred after successful deletion of the stop cassette.</p><p id="p-0491" num="0456">1.3 Results. The presently disclosed nanoparticle system achieved a high level of eGFP knockout (&#x3e;70% as assessed by the geometric mean of fluorescence) three days post-transfection and sustained this level of gene silencing for the entirety of the experiment (over 3 weeks post-transfection). Interestingly, CRISPR-mediated knockout resulted in a population of cells that were completely eGFP-negative. This binary turning-off-of gene expression is in stark contrast to the downregulation of gene expression achieved through the delivery of short-interfering RNA (siRNA), which resulted in lowered gene expression on a population basis and only had a temporary effect.</p><p id="p-0492" num="0457">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A-E</figref>, the presently disclosed subject matter, in some embodiments, demonstrates that PBAE nanoparticles enable gene knockout through small indels after NHEJ and produce a sustained, binary effect compared to siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Importantly, PBAE nanoparticle-mediated gene knockout results in permanent and binary gene silencing.</p><p id="p-0493" num="0458">The presently disclosed PBAE nanoparticles also achieved successful gene deletion. The top sgRNA sequence resulted in the deletion of a 600 bp DNA segment, which turned on detectable ReNL expression in 45% of treated cells. PCR amplicons of the edited region confirmed that ReNL expression required the deletion of the entire stop cassette. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-D</figref>. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, co-delivery of two sgRNAs flanking a gene segment enables gene deletion and gain-of-function ReNL expression in a novel reporter system in vitro. This system allows for identification of effective CRISPR editing both in vitro and in vivo with bioluminescence imaging of ReNL.</p><p id="p-0494" num="0459">Gene-knockout efficiency was assessed using HEK-293T cells which constitutively express a destabilized form of eGFP (See, &#x201c;Unedited&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).

The presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates that PBAE nanoparticles co-delivering plasmids encoding Cas9 and sgRNA, respectively, can achieve a high degree of gene knockout and deletion. The system is versatile, as sgRNAs targeting any gene (or another genomic sequence) can be designed and incorporated into nanoparticles for gene knockout. Further, the presently disclosed subject matter showed that the PBAE nanoparticles can achieve the more challenging genome editing procedure of gene deletion, which is important in inducing a loss of function in non-coding genes. The presently disclosed PBAE nanoparticles represent a promising tool for gene therapy applications and useful approach as a reporter system for CRISPR editing in vitro and in vivo.</p><p id="p-0499" num="0464">Additionally, in some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates CRISPR editing in vivo. For example, murine melanoma (B16-F10) and glioblastoma (GL261) cells were induced to express an iRFP-STOP-ReNL reporter system. Successful editing of these cells in vivo could be visualized using ReNL bioluminescence. Dual delivery of separate Cas9 and sgRNA plasmids to B16-F10 and GL261 cells yielded low gene deletion (&#x3c;5% ReNL fluorescence by flow cytometry). In yet other embodiments, cloning Cas9 and sgRNA into single vector can boost efficiency. As provided herein below, a large combinatorial library of novel hyper-branched PBAE nanoparticle formulations also have been screened and can exhibit higher transfection efficacy compared to canonical PBAEs.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 2</heading><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Hyperbranched Polyesters with Amphiphilic and pH Sensitive Properties for Effective Nucleic Acid Delivery</heading><p id="p-0500" num="0465"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> illustrate synthesis of a BGDA-series of hyperbranched PBAE polymers for nanoparticle assembly.

The branching monomer TMPTA gives rise to polymers with the highest tertiary amine density while BGDA monomers give rise to polymers with a lower tertiary amine density.</p><p id="p-0536" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00008" num="00008"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Monomer mole ratios for synthesis of BGDA PBAE series.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Planned Triacrylate</entry><entry>Diacrylate</entry><entry>Triacrylate</entry><entry>Amine</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mole Fraction (%)</entry><entry>Ratio</entry><entry>Ratio</entry><entry>Ratio</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>0</entry><entry>1.1</entry><entry>0.00</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>10</entry><entry>0.99</entry><entry>0.07</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>20</entry><entry>0.88</entry><entry>0.15</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>40</entry><entry>0.66</entry><entry>0.29</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>50</entry><entry>0.55</entry><entry>0.37</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>60</entry><entry>0.44</entry><entry>0.44</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>80</entry><entry>0.22</entry><entry>0.59</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>90</entry><entry>0.11</entry><entry>0.66</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>100</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>0.73</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0537" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 4</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry><sup>1</sup>H NMR integrations for BGDA series</entry></row><row><entry>normalized to acrylate peaks (3H)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Planned</entry><entry>BGDA Phenyl</entry><entry>B8 methyl</entry><entry>S4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Triacrylate</entry><entry>7.11 &#x26;

Efficient gene delivery into hard-to-transfect cells is still a challenge despite significant progress in the development of various gene delivery tools. Non-viral and synthetic polymeric nanoparticles offer an array of advantages for gene delivery over the viral vectors and high in demand as they are safe to use, easy to synthesize and highly cell type specific. The presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates the use of a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform to screen for biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) that can transfect human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells with high efficiency and low toxicity. The presently disclosed NPs can deliver plasmid DNA (pDNA) to RPE monolayers more efficiently compared to the commercially available transfection reagents without interfering the global gene expression profile of RPE cells. The presently disclosed subject matter establishes an HTS platform and identifies synthetic polymers that can be used for high efficacy non-viral gene delivery to human RPE monolayers, enabling gene loss- and gain-of-function studies of cell signaling and developmental pathways. This platform can be used to identify the optimum polymer, weight-to-weight ratio of polymer to DNA, and the dose of NP for various retinal cell types.</p><p id="p-0567" num="0525">5.2 Introduction. Gene therapy holds potential promise for treating both acquired and inherited blinding disorders as most of the identified disease to date is associated with RPE. See Bainbridge et al., 2006. Modulating specific gene targets simply by turning off or turning on its function has become a standard tool to enhance stem cell differentiation or to reprogram induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells. See Jia et al., 2010; Nauta et al., 2013. Routinely approached gene therapy utilizes viral vectors to deliver pDNA considering their potential for high-efficiency gene delivery. However, to its flip side, this approach is limited by several different factors such as (a) potential for insertional mutagenesis, see Baum et al., 2006, (b) prone to degradation in the cytosol by nucleases, see Sasaki and Kinjo, 2010, or can accommodate only a specific size of pDNA to deliver. See Bitner et al., 2011; den Hollander et al., 2008; and Liu et al., 2007.</p><p id="p-0568" num="0526">To overcome these challenges and to follow an alternative safer approach, significant attempts have been made to formulate and develop biodegradable non-viral vehicles agents to facilitate delivery of the gene of interest to the target sites. As the charge distribution on both the plasmid DNA and the cellular membrane is profoundly negative, cationic polymers often demonstrate efficient intracellular delivery by merely condensing the cargo (pDNA) by strong electrostatic interaction and form NPs. See Mastrobattista and Hennink, 2011. Since this strategy is episomal, it is usually considered as the safest way of delivering genes into the subcellular targets. See Lundstrom, 2003.</p><p id="p-0569" num="0527">To this end, a range of different cationic polymers have been formulated and studied over the years for efficient non-viral gene delivery strategies. See Boylan et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2013; de la Fuente M et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2004; Read et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2009. Regardless of the advantages that cationic polymers demonstrate over the viral mode of gene delivery, it's application is limited by a significant factor, i.e., poor transfection efficacy. See Pack et al., 2005. Poly(b-amino ester)s (PBAEs), a class of synthetic, cationic polymers, recently found to be useful as non-viral gene delivery agents. PBAEs are preferred polymers as they are easy to synthesize and demonstrate an efficient binding with its DNA counterpart. PBAEs are also hydrolytically degradable under physiological conditions and hence exhibit minimal cytotoxicity upon cellular administration. PBAEs have been shown to be successful in transfecting human adult and embryonic stem cells, see Yang et al., 2009, and mouse RPE cells in vitro and in vivo. See Sunshine et al., 2012. Besides, previous work also has suggested PBAEs to have cell-type specificity based on their chemical structures. See Shmueli et al., 2012; Sunshine et al., 2009. Hence PBAEs makes an ideal carrier to undertake this study given their structural tenability and simple synthesis scheme. The RPE cells are composed of a monolayer of pigmented and bipolar epithelial cells at the back side of the retina. Any compromise in the cellular environment of RPE cells leads to many hereditary and acquired diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). See Strauss, 2005. As RPE also dispensable for photoreceptor turnover and maintenance and as both PR and RPE dominate the retinal cell population, RPE cells could be the targets of therapy in many ocular diseases. Moreover, as in many ocular diseases lead to overall genetic imbalance, see Kawa et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2012, gene therapy is vital in restoring the gene expression in the compromised retina. Attempt to deliver a gene either into primary RPE cells or RPE cell lines is not new in the field. However, despite adopting several different non-viral strategies to deliver DNA either by polymeric or by liposomal vectors, the success rate is very low.

Without wishing to be bound to any one particular theory, it is thought that cationic PBAE-pDNA NP complex can be delivered to the RPE monolayer efficiency by tuning the hydrophilicity and end group chemistry. Accordingly, a library of four PBAE base polymers with different backbone and end-group chemistry was synthesized. The ability of PBAE to bind to its DNA counterpart was examined by electrophoresis assay. To explore the effects of different PBAE chemical structures on delivery efficiency, 25-day old RPE monolayers were transfected with 140 different combinations of PBAEs using a pDNA encoding mCherry reporter gene under the CAG promoter.

Once the linear PBAE synthesis was completed, all the subsequent steps including end-capping reaction, preparation of source plate with end-capped polymers, stable NP formation with the desired pDNA, automated dispensing for transfection, and the HCA image capturing processes were carried out in a 384 well format for all the combination of NPs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>). A range of different base polymers end-capped with a variety of different amino-terminal structures was combined to prepare a combinatorial library of 144 different PBAE NP formulations. The polymer nomenclature &#x201c;N1-N2-XN&#x201d; in the whole library, denotes base polymer number (N)-side chain number (N)-end cap amino terminal type (X) and number (N) respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0574" num="0532">5.3.2 High Throughput Automated NP Transfection to RPE Monolayer</p><p id="p-0575" num="0533">To access the transfection efficacy of the PBAE/pCAGG-mCherry nanoparticles in matured RPE monolayers (Day 25 post seeding), a high throughput screening assay was conducted with all 144 different combinations of nanoparticles as explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>. This allowed a direct visualization of transfection efficacy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>A</figref>) and viability rate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>B</figref>) on a HCA platform where images were collected and data analyzed using a specific algorithm suitable to measure either transfection efficacy or viability rate. Cells transfected with the polymer without any end-capping reaction were included as controls. Heat map suggests that transfection efficacy differs significantly depending upon the side-chain end-capping chemistry of the PBAE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>A</figref>). A few leading PBAE structures 5-3-A12, 5-3-F3 and 5-3-F4 resulted in 42%, 37% and, 34% positively transfected cells respectively. Interestingly, these specific polymers also demonstrated a significantly higher cell survival rate (90%, 97% and, 98% respectively; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>B</figref>). However, cell survival property of these top polymers was not directly proportional to their ability to transfect RPE monolayers, as some other PBAEs demonstrated extremely low transfection efficacy irrespective of their high cell survival property. Different PBAEs pairs with the same end-capping molecules show substantially different transfection efficiency, suggesting that the transfection efficiency also is dependent upon additional parameters, such as the degree of hydrophilicity and overall NP stability (e.g., the transfection efficacy of 3-5-A12 is 3.8% while it is 42% for 5-3-A12). In addition, while the PBAE 5-3-A12 demonstrated highest transfection efficiency (42%) and higher survival rate (90%) to the monolayered RPE cells at day 25, the same polymer yielded a lower transfection rate (33%) and lower survival rate (30%) in differentiating RPE cells at the early phase of differentiation on day 3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>).

Zeta potential also was measured. All parameters were measured at different weight-to-weight (w/w) ratio. The particle size demonstrated a fairly broad distribution ranging from 49 nm to 191 nm by DLS method, and from 115 nm to 149 nm by NTA method (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b>A, <b>44</b>B</figref>). In corroboration with a previous report, the presently disclosed subject matter suggests that nanoparticles with a smaller size result in increased transfection rate, see Gan et al., 2005, as during the transfection optimization process, higher transfection rates were observed at a lower w/w ratio compared to a higher w/w ratio. Regardless, the transfection efficiency was always higher with the 5-3-A12 nanoparticle at any w/w ratio compared to other lead nanoparticles. Given the comparable transfection efficiency of the 5-3-A12 nanoparticle with different particle size, our results suggest that transfection efficiency of the 5-3-A12 nanoparticle is not solely dominated by particle size. Different than the particle size, 5-3-A12 nanoparticle demonstrated fairly similar surface charge distribution at any given size, which ranges from +25 mV to +30 mV as measured by zeta potential (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b>C</figref>). Gel electrophoresis study demonstrated a complete PBAE/pCAGG-mCherry nanoparticle complex formation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b>D</figref>). To further consolidate the biophysical results observed, a transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis was conducted. TEM imaging confirmed stable PBAE/pCAGGmCherry nanoparticle formation through the self-assembly process, with nanoparticle size consistent with the DLS and NTA results (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b>E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0578" num="0536">5.3.4 Validation of 5-3-A12 Nanoparticle Transfection Efficacy</p><p id="p-0579" num="0537">To further examine and validate the ability of the lead PBAE/pCAGG-mCherry nanoparticles to transfect RPE monolayers, 25-day old RPE monolayers were transfected separately in an 8-well chambered cover glass using already optimized transfection condition. RPE monolayers were also transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 and DNA-In for to test (and compare) the transfection efficacy as a control. Transfection efficiency up to 42% was observed with the lead nanoparticle (5-3-A12), which were 26% higher than that of DNA-In and 41% higher than Lipofectamine-3000, as well as comparable transfection efficiency of all the other polymers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b>A-B</figref>). Interestingly, although 5-3-A12 achieved the highest transfection in human RPE monolayers, it was the most inefficient polymer for mouse photoreceptor and human Retinal Ganglion Cells (data not shown) suggesting for its cell type specificity and suitable only for human RPE monolayers. To ensure that the differences in transfection efficiency were not caused by potential toxicity from polymeric nanoparticles, the effects of PBAE/pCAGG-mCherry nanoparticles on cell viability under the optimized transfection doses also were examined. The results indicated that most PBAE/pCAGG-mCherry nanoparticles formulations did not negatively affect cell viability compared to untreated cells alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b>C</figref>). The only exception was one of the commercial reagents DNA-In, which showed slightly lower cell viability (approximately 80%). Previous work reported a higher dose of PBAE required for the plasmid DNA delivery with weight ratios up to 50:1 to reach optimal transfection efficiency in cancer cells, which may also cause increased cell death. See Sunshine et al., 2009. However, in this study, substantially less PBAE was required (3:1) to form stable nanoparticles with top PBAEs due to the smaller size. Also, because of the cell type specificity, we observed minimal cell death with RPE monolayers. This offers an additional advantage of using PBAE for pDNA delivery given the minimal toxicity effects with different cells. The mean fluorescent intensity also was quantified, which is a measure of total protein production. In this regard, RPE monolayers transfected in any form (via PBAEs or via commercial reagents) demonstrated a substantially similar level of mCherry intensity, despite their comparable level of percentage of cells being transfected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b>D</figref>). Transfection efficiency describes the percentage of cells that have been transfected, regardless of the difference in the level of protein production among individual cells. In contrast, mean fluorescence intensity takes into account of the difference in protein production by individual cells, and normalize that by the total number of cells. Therefore, mean fluorescence intensity is a better prediction of the level of protein production post-transfection. Also, the total number of cells also were counted over time during the differentiation process and the relative cell count and transfection efficacy of lipofectamine and DNA-In on RPE monolayers at different DNA doses were measured. Even though the cell number over time and the overall post-transfection viability rate was acceptable, the transfection efficacy was weak compared to 5-3-A12 PBAE at any given DNA dose.</p><p id="p-0580" num="0538">5.3.5 Multiple Gene Delivery with 5-3-A12 Nanoparticle into RPE Monolayers</p><p id="p-0581" num="0539">Since multiple gene deliveries using nanoparticle is quite challenging and none of the previous studies report using PBAE nanoparticle for multiple gene deliveries, the transfection efficacy of 5-3-A12 polymers for the delivery of more than one gene into RPE monolayers was evaluated. To this end, two separate pDNA constructs encoding two different reporter genes (mCherry and nuclear GFP) under same promoter (CAGG) were used and a co-transfection assay was optimized. Comparative data for cells that received either one or both of the reporter genes in a co-transfected cell population were generated 48 hours posttransfection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b>A</figref>). Two different strategies for transfection were adopted; either both the constructs were transfected at the same time (Co-transfected) or at the different times (serially transfected). Post-transfection data was analyzed for transfection efficacy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b>B</figref>), cell body area (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b>C</figref>), and cell body shape (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b>D</figref>) for each condition. The data suggest that under co-transfection condition, about 50% of the cell population received NP containing mCherry pDNA and about 25% of the cell population received NP containing nuc-GFP pDNA and remaining 25% cells obtained both the plasmids. In contrary, serially transfected condition favored more to NP containing mCherry pDNA, where more than 97% cell population received NP containing mCherry pDNA. While the preference of receiving one plasmid over another was significantly different in both the transfection conditions, as expected, no apparent change either in cell body shape or cell body size was observed in either circumstance. These results suggest that 5-3-A12 polymers do not interfere with intrinsic cellular pathways that trigger cellular/nuclear morphology and encourages for non-viral gene delivery applications.</p><p id="p-0582" num="0540">5.4. Discussion</p><p id="p-0583" num="0541">The most successful in vitro plasmid DNA gene delivery studies were established on RPE-derived cell lines, which are easier to transfect than primary RPE monolayers. Vercauteren et al., 2011. In this study, hiPSc-derived RPE cells were used, as they are considered to be much more similar to primary RPE than RPE cell lines, Klimanskaya et al., 2004, to investigate the utility of using a biodegradable and non-viral gene delivery approach for transient protein expression in primary RPE monolayers. To this end, a high-throughput platform was established to screen NPs created from a wide variety of polymers for their ability to deliver a gene into the human stem cell-derived RPE monolayers. Using this system, synthetic polymers were identified that can be used for high efficacy non-viral gene delivery to human RPE monolayers, enabling gene loss- and gain-of-function studies of cell signaling and developmental pathways. Since the self-assembly process of polymers high very complex, Molla and Levkin, 2016, it is very important to combine appropriate physical, chemical and biological properties to produce efficient polymers for gene delivery. Thus, high-throughput parallel generation and screening of large libraries of such nano-carriers is a very efficient and powerful way to identify efficacious and non-toxic gene delivery vectors. Despite the great interest in hiPSC RPE cells as sources for cell therapy and in vitro disease modeling, no studies of gene delivery of these cells using PBAE nanoparticles have been reported. The presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates that, as is the case for RPE cells, hiPSC-RPE cells are very difficult to transfect with plasmid DNA complexed with any commercial transfection reagent (lipofectamine or DNA-In). The highest efficiency of transfection with plasmid DNA using DNA-In was achieved on RPE monolayers with an efficiency of about 10%, and this was even lower (less than 5%) with lipofectamine 3000.</p><p id="p-0584" num="0542">In addition, in the presently disclosed high-throughput screening assay, while most of the PBAE demonstrated a decent range of transfection (&#x2dc;10% to &#x2dc;50%) on the sub-confluent RPE population (day 3 after seeding), most of them fail to transfect confluent RPE monolayer population (day 25 after seeding) when the cells reached a polygonal morphology. In contrast, top hits from the screening (5-3-A12, 5-3-F3 and 5-3-F4) could able to deliver the pDNA efficiently into both sub-confluent, and post-confluent monolayer (polygonal) RPE cells. While the reason for this discrepancy is not clear, it is thought that it is a phase dependent cell-type-specific event where the preferences of the interaction of the cationic polymer changes with the cell membrane structural change over time. Further optimization studies with different transfection agents, ratios of modified PBAEs, and pDNA/PBAE ratios are needed to understand this. Regardless, our results suggest that 5-3-A12 PBAE nanoparticle met all the criteria of a successful non-viral gene therapy agent being readily internalized into the cell, escaped endocytic degradation and successfully delivered the pDNA into the nucleus to be expressed. Even though specific characterization of the uptake of PBAE NPs in vitro was not undertaken; however confocal imaging data with ZO-1 labeling indicated that exclusively RPE monolayers with polygonal shape take up the particles. In the co-transfection assay, while the preference for getting transfected either with pmCherry or pNucGFP was subtle, the results from serially transfected RPE monolayer suggest that already transfected cells are less receptive or more rigid for re-uptake of new nanoparticles. This conclusion is based on the fact that in serially transfected cells the mCherry transfected cell population outnumbered dramatically to that of GFP transfected cell population when the cells were transfected with mCherry construct first. However, regardless of the type of transfection, PBAE nanoparticle has no impact on either cell body shape or size as evident from our co-transfection assay. This observation also suggests that, although PBAE nanoparticles can deliver multiple genes into RPE monolayers, they are often hampered by poor reproducibility and low co-transfection efficiency especially when cells are transfected serially. The results also suggest that the PBAE nanoparticle 5-3-A12 can preferentially deliver pDNA into human RPE monolayers with relatively low cytotoxicity. Even though the mechanism-of-action (MoA) is not known at this time, results from the current work provides important insights and holds promises for translational application of the biodegradable PBAE nanoparticles especially for RPE dysfunction. Since the overall surface charge distribution is an important deciding factor on cellular cytotoxicity, see Frohlich, 2012; Tomita et al., 2011, two different theories that results in low cytotoxicity effect of 5-3-A12 nanoparticle are possible. (1) its overall charge distribution on the surface (ranges from +25 mV to +30 mV) at any given w/w/ratio, which helps in interacting with the negatively charged components at the cell surface and destabilizes the cell membrane more efficiently than any other polymers used during primary screening; and (2) the electrostatic interaction between 5-3-A12 and pDNA introduces sufficient number of available amine group in 5-3-A12 that could results in increased zeta potential value.</p><p id="p-0585" num="0543">The presently disclosed subject matter validates the expression pattern of known RPE markers from both mCherry+ and mCherry&#x2212; cell population by low throughput (96-well) format using a qRT PCR assay. This purpose was to evaluate the possible PBAE interference with any known intrinsic RPE gene pathway. No change in the gene expression pattern was expected after transfection as the pDNA used expresses exogenous reporter genes without any known function on RPE markers. However, a differential gene expression pattern from the sample collected from transfected wells (regardless of their transfection status) was observed compared to sample collected from the un-transfected wells.</p><p id="p-0586" num="0544">5.5.

By screening a total of 140 synthesized PBAEs with varying chemical structures, lead PBAE structures were identified that resulted in markedly increased pDNA delivery efficiency both in vitro. The presently disclosed results suggest that PBAE can effectively complex pDNA into nanoparticles, and protect the pDNA from being degraded by environmental nucleases and eventually deliver effectively to RPE monolayers. Without wishing to be bound to any one particular theory, the presently disclosed results support a hypothesis that PBAE mediated pDNA delivery efficiency can be modulated by tuning PBAE end group chemistry. Using human iPSc-RPE monolayers as model cell types, a few PBAE polymers were identified that allow efficient pDNA delivery at levels that are comparable or even surpassing commercial reagents like Lipofectamine 3000 and DNA-In. Unlike lipofectamine 3000 and DNA-In, which are non-degradable, the biodegradable nature of PBAE-based nanoparticles facilitates in vitro applications and clinical translation. Together, the presently disclosed results highlight the promise of PBAE-based nanoparticles as novel nonviral gene carriers for pDNA delivery into hard-to-transfect cell RPE monolayers.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Example 6</heading><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Differentially Branched Ester Amine Quadpolymers with Amphiphilic and pH-Sensitive Properties for Efficient Plasmid DNA Delivery</heading><p id="p-0612" num="0570">6.1. Overview. Development of highly effective nonviral gene delivery vectors for transfection of diverse cell populations remains a challenge despite utilization of both rational and combinatorial driven approaches to nanoparticle engineering. In this work, multifunctional polyesters are synthesized with well-defined branching structures via A2+B2/B3+C1 Michael addition reactions from small molecule acrylate and amine monomers and then end-capped with amine-containing small molecules to assess the influence of polymer branching structure on transfection. These Branched poly(Ester Amine) Quadpolymers (BEAQs) are highly effective for delivery of plasmid DNA to retinal pigment epithelial cells and demonstrate multiple improvements over previously reported leading linear poly(beta-amino ester)s, particularly for volume-limited applications where improved efficiency is required. BEAQs with moderate degrees of branching are demonstrated to be optimal for delivery under high serum conditions and low nanoparticle doses further relevant for therapeutic gene delivery applications. Defined structural properties of each polymer in the series, including tertiary amine content, correlated with cellular transfection efficacy and viability. Trends that can be applied to the rational design of future generations of biodegradable polymers are elucidated.<br/>6.2. Background. Safe and effective gene delivery to specific cell populations has the potential to revolutionize medicine by enabling gene expression to be turned on or off precisely with the delivery of DNA or RNA. While viral vectors, particularly adenoassociated virus (AAV), have shown gains in the therapeutic delivery of DNA in some diseases, clinical level production of AAV remains an enormous challenge, 1,2 nucleic acid carrying capacity is limited, and patient pre-existing immunity can limit eligible patient populations.3,4 In contrast, nonviral nanoparticle based gene delivery methods have the potential to be both less expensive to produce, less immunogenic, and enable greater nucleic acid cargo capacity than AAV. However, nonviral gene delivery systems have suffered from low delivery efficacy to many cell types due to both systemic and intracellular delivery inefficiencies, which prevent translation to the clinic.5 While nonviral vectors have been demonstrated capable for effective delivery in vivo, there remains a need to develop enhanced nanoparticles that are more efficient, particularly for applications in which the administration route limits the dose.</p><p id="p-0613" num="0571">Polyesters are a class of polymers that have been utilized for nonviral gene delivery with high efficacy both in vitro and in vivo to a variety of cell types.6-9 Synthesis of poly(beta-amino ester)s (PBAEs) in particular via Michael addition reactions is relatively easy to achieve, and vast libraries of linear polymers have been synthesized to explore the solution space of possible polymer structures for purposes of gene delivery. 10-12 Until recently, however, only linear PBAEs have been explored for their ability to deliver nucleic acids to mammalian cells, despite the demonstration that branching polymers are often more effective than their linear counterparts for delivery of plasmid DNA in a variety of polymer systems such as polyethylenimine (PEI)13 and poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA).14,15 Recent advances in the use of triacrylate monomers to synthesize branched polymers by Michael addition reaction have yielded polymers highly effective for delivery of nucleic acids to a variety of cell types, including cancer cells,14,15 skin cells, 16 neural cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. 17 Much of this prior work in the synthesis of branched PBAEs has either failed to assess the efficacy of branched polymers against linear polymers across the entire range of possible w/w ratios or has only utilized linear polymer structures of insufficiently high molecular weight and cationicity to achieve effective gene delivery. 16, 19</p><p id="p-0614" num="0572">Polyesters with beta-amino groups are rapidly biodegradable and finely tunable for properties such as hydrophobicity, molecular weight, and cationic charge by selection of constituent monomers. These features enable certain structures to be highly effective for gene delivery but often require large empirical screens to identify effective structures. The biodegradability of PBAEs in aqueous solution is uncharacteristically short for polyesters with typical bond half-lives of 4-6 h for the backbone ester bonds, 18 enabling the polymers to degrade to nontoxic, hydrophilic oligomers within 24 h. Hydrophobicity can be modulated for transfection of different cell types, 19 and molecular weight can be modulated by tuning the overall vinyl to amine ratio. 11,20 Linear acrylate-terminated PBAE polymers can also be end-capped with a variety of small molecule primary amines that increase the cationic charge of the polymer by adding secondary as well as primary amines to the polymer.21</p><p id="p-0615" num="0573">Whereas with polyethylenimine (PEI) branching structure changes the cationic character of the polymer (linear polymers contain mostly secondary amines, while branched polymers contain a tertiary amine at each branch point and a primary amine at each new terminal group), branching in a PBAE synthesis scheme does not dramatically change tertiary amines present in polymer structures of the same molecular weight. However, for PBAEs, branching structure can increase the density of end-capping functional groups, and these molecules have been shown previously to greatly enhance the transfection efficacy of linear polymers. 18,21 Branching in other polymeric systems has been further hypothesized to enhance the &#x201c;needle effect&#x201d; of endosomal escape mediated by polymer swelling, which could help explain this increase in efficacy.22-24</p><p id="p-0616" num="0574">Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of a new polymer series, Branched poly(Ester Amine) Quadpolymers (BEAQs). They are composed of four constituent monomers in ratios that influence the cationic character and hydrophobicity of the polymer species in a predictable manner. This work builds on the successes of poly(ester amine) materials such as linear PBAEs,12 poly(amine-co-ester) (PACE) terpolymers,25 and poly(alkylene maleate mercaptamines) (PAMA)s26 that have demonstrated the utility of amines to bind nucleic acids, ester linkages to facilitate nucleic acid release and reduce toxicity as well as the ability to modulate cation density and hydrophobicity. We utilized A2+B2/B3 Michael addition reactions to synthesize primarily acrylate terminated polymers with well-defined degrees of branching that were then end-capped with a C monomer to explore the influence of branching structure on transfection efficacy and nanoparticle properties. This further enabled us to incorporate fine control of small amine-containing molecule end-groups for engineering of polymer and nanoparticle surface properties and hypothesized cell-specific delivery. 18, 27-2.9 Thus, the four components of the quadpolymers control degradability, hydrophobicity, branching, and cationicity, which have large effects on delivery efficacy and cytotoxicity.30 We assessed each polymer quantitatively for plasmid DNA binding under various conditions to demonstrate that increased DNA binding is attributable to increased cationicity resulting from multiple end-caps as well as branching structure. Branching was further shown to improve DNA binding and transfection efficacy under conditions that normally destabilize polyplex nanoparticles.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="2">6.3. Experimental Section</heading><p id="p-0617" num="0575">6.3.1. Materials. Trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA/B8, CAS 15625895), bisphenol A glycerolate (1 glycerol/phenol) diacrylate (BGDA/B7, CAS 4687-94-9), and 2-(3-Aminopropylamino)ethanol (E6, CAS 4461-39-6) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. 4-Amino-1-butanol (S4, CAS 13325-10-05) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Acrylate monomers were stored with desiccant at 4&#xb0; C., while amine monomers were stored with desiccant at room temperature. Plasmid peGFP-N1 (Addgene 2491) was used for transfection efficacy screens. Cy5-amine (23000) was purchased from Lumiprobe (Hallandale Beach, Fla.), dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;L, and stored at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. in small aliquots. Plasmid DNA (eGFP-N1) was labeled as previously described using NHSPsoralen with the fluorophore Cy5-amine at a density of approximately 1 fluorophore/50 base pairs DNA.31<br/>6.3.2. Polymer Synthesis. BEAQs were synthesized according to the ratios in Table 6-S1 at an overall vinyl/amine ratio of 2.2:1 and monomer concentration of 200 mg/mL in anhydrous DMF. The diacrylate monomer (B7) was first weighed out to a 20 mL scintillation vial, after which triacrylate monomer (B8) was added. Anhydrous DMF was added to the vial and monomers were fully vortexed into solution and heated to 90&#xb0; C. before adding primary amine monomer S4. Monomer purity was accounted for in synthesis calculations based on the vendor characterization of each lot. Monomer B7 was assumed to be 90% pure in the absence of any reported purity information. Monomer solutions were then stirred at 90&#xb0; C. for 24 h, after which polymers were removed from the oven and mixed with a solution of monomer E6 (2-&#x3b2;-aminopropylamino)ethanol) in anhydrous DMF (final concentration 0.2 M) in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. End-capped polymer solutions were then precipitated twice in diethyl ether (10&#xd7; volume followed by 5&#xd7; volume) and dried under vacuum for 3 days. Polymers were finally redissolved in anhydrous DMSO at 100 mg/mL and stored at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. in small volume aliquots. Polymers were named according to the triacrylate mole fraction; thus B8-50% corresponds to the 50% triacrylate mole fraction polymer formed between the diacrylate (B7), triacrylate (B8), amino (S4), and diamino (E6) monomers with the triacrylate (B8) monomer accounting for 50% of the vinyl moieties in the initial monomer mixture.<br/>6.3.3 Polymer Characterization. Acrylate terminated polymers were sampled from reaction vials prior to endcapping reactions and precipitated twice in 10&#xd7; volumes of diethyl ether to recover neat polymer. Acrylate terminated polymers were then dried under vacuum for 2 h and analyzed via 1H NMR in CDCl<sub>3 </sub>(Bruker 500 MHz) to confirm the presence of acrylate peaks and quantify degree of branching. End-capped polymer likewise was characterized via 1H NMR in CDCl<sub>3 </sub>to confirm complete reaction of end-cap monomer with acrylate terminated polymers. End-capped polymer was also characterized via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a Waters system with autosampler, styragel column, and refractive index detector to determine MN, MW, and standards. GPC measurements were performed as previously described with minor changes of flow rate (0.5 mL/min) and increase in sample run time to 75 min per sample. 32<br/>6.3.4 Polymer Buffering Capacity. End-capped polymer buffering capacity as a function of polymer structure was assessed by titrating 10 mg (100 &#x3bc;L at 100 mg/mL) of polymer dissolved in 10 mL of acidified, 100 mM NaCl from pH 3.0 to pH 11. For titrations, pH was determined using a SevenEasy pH Meter (Mettler Toledo) with pH assessed after stepwise addition of 100 mM sodium hydroxide.</p><p id="p-0618" num="0576">We have demonstrated previously that 25 kDa branched polyethylenimine possesses a buffering capacity of 6.2 mmol H+/g of polymer in the pH range of 7.4 to 5.

Green, Uptake and transfection with polymeric nanoparticles are dependent on polymer end-group structure, but largely independent of nanoparticle physical and chemical properties, Mol. Pharm. 9(11) (2012) 3375-83. This is the equivalent of 6.2 nmol H+ per mg of polyethylenimine, meaning that polyethylenimine would have 6.2 nmol H+ buffering capacity per &#x3bc;g of DNA at a 1 w/w ratio. At the higher than usual optimal w/w ratios of 3 and 4 w/w for HEK293T and ARPE-19 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>), PEI would have an optimal buffering capacity of either 24.8 or 37.2 nmol H+/&#x3bc;g DNA depending on cell type. 6.3.5.

DNA Binding Assays. Yo-Pro-1 iodide binding assays were run similarly to previously published results,33 where DNA and Yo-Pro-1 iodide (Thermo Fisher) were both diluted to a concentration of 1 &#x3bc;M (3.1 &#x3bc;g/mL plasmid) in either 25 mM NaAc, pH 5.0 or 150 mM PBS, pH 7.4 then mixed with polymer to give a 100 &#x3bc;L well volume in opaque black well plates. Green channel fluorescence was then measured using a plate reader after 30 min of incubation (Biotek Synergy 2). Gel electrophoresis binding experiments were run as previously described9 with nanoparticles prepared in either 25 mM NaAc buffer, pH 5.0 or 150 mM PBS, pH 7.4, diluted with 30% glycerol for loading into a 1% agarose gel. 6.3.7 Nanoparticle Characterization. Three samples were independently prepared for each nanoparticle formulation at the same concentrations as outlined in the transfection methods section. Nanoparticle hydrodynamic diameters in 25 mM NaAc, pH 5.0 were then determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) in disposable microcuvettes using a Malvern Zetasizer NanoZS (Malvern Instruments, Marlvern, UK) with a detection angle of 173&#xb0;. Samples were then diluted in 150 mM PBS at a dilution factor of 6 and measured again to determine nanoparticle hydrodynamic diameter in neutral, isotonic buffer followed by determination of zeta potential by electrophoretic light scattering in disposable zeta cuvettes at 25&#xb0; C. using the same Malvern Zetasizer NanoZS. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired using a Philips CM120 (Philips Research, Briarcliffs-Manor, New York) on 400 square mesh carbon coated TEM grids. Samples were prepared at a DNA concentration of 0.045 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;L and polymer 40 w/w ratio in 25 mM NaAc, pH 5.0 after which 30 &#x3bc;L were allowed to coat TEM grids for 20 min. Grids were then dipped briefly in ultrapure water to remove excess dried salt, wicked dry, and allowed to fully dry under vacuum before imaging.<br/>6.3.8. Cell Culture. HEK293T and ARPE-19 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, Va.) and cultured in high glucose DMEM or DMEM/F12, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For noted 96-well plate transfection efficacy experiments, cells were plated in CytoOne 96-well tissue culture plates (USA Scientific, Ocala, Fla.) 24 h prior to transfection with 12,000 cells/well in 100 &#x3bc;L complete media. For noted 384-well plate transfection experiments, cells were plated at 2,500 cells/well in 25 &#x3bc;L of complete media in 384-well tissue culture plates (Santa Cruz, sc-206081) 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were confirmed periodically to be <i>mycoplasma </i>negative via MycoAlert test (Lonza).<br/>6.3.9. Transfection and Cell Uptake. For 96-well plate transfections, nanoparticles were formed by dissolving synthesized polymers and eGFP-N1 plasmid DNA in 25 mM sodium acetate (NaAc) pH 5.0 then mixing in a 1:1 volume ratio. Nanoparticles were incubated at room temperature for 5 min, then 20 &#x3bc;L of the nanoparticle solution were added to each well of cells containing 100 &#x3bc;L of complete media and allowed to incubate for 2 h, at which point the media was replaced. Transfection efficacy was assessed for percent-transfected cells and geometric mean expression approximately 48 h following transfection using flow cytometry with a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer with HyperCyt autosampler and gated in 2D against untreated cells in FlowJo (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>). Cell viability was assessed using MTS Celltiter 96 Aqueous One (Promega, Madison, Wis.) cell proliferation assay approximately 24 h following transfection. For 384-well plate transfection of low doses of nanoparticles, synthesized polymers in DMSO were dissolved in 25 mM NaAc buffer to a concentration of 7.5 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;L then mixed with DNA dissolved in 25 mM NaAc buffer in a 384 polypropylene nanoparticle source plate. Nanoparticles were then dispensed to plates of cells at low volumes using an Echo 550 liquid handler. After 2 days to allow for reporter expression, plates were scanned and analyzed using Cellomics Arrayscan VTI with live cell imaging module following staining with Hoechst 33342. Flow cytometry based cell uptake studies were performed in 96-well plates using 20% Cy5 labeled DNA as previously described.32 To remove associated nanoparticles that were extracellular membrane associated but had not undergone endocytosis, cells were washed once with 50 &#x3bc;g/mL heparin sulfate in 150 mM PBS following trypsinization and transfer to round-bottom 96-well plates.32.<br/>6.3.10. Confocal Microscopy. Cells were plated on Nunc Lab-Tek 8 chambered borosilicate coverglass well plates (155411; Thermo Fisher) at 50,000 cells/well (ARPE-19) or 25,000 cells/well (HEK293T) 2 days prior to transfection in 250 &#x3bc;L of phenol red free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Nanoparticles were prepared as described above 20 or 40 w/w ratios using Cy5 labeled plasmid DNA and eGFP-N1 plasmid DNA at an 0.8/0.2 mass ratio, then added to cells at a total dose of 1500 ng DNA/well and incubated for 2 h. For imaging, cells were stained for 30 mM with Hoechst 33342 at a 1:5,000 dilution (H3570; Thermo Fisher) for nuclei visualization and with Cell Navigator Lysosome Staining dye with pKa 4.6 at a 1:2,500 dilution (AAT Bioquest, 22658) in phenol red free DMEM. Cells were then washed twice with phenol red free DMEM and imaged at 37&#xb0; C. in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 780 microscope with Zen Blue software and 63&#xd7; oil immersion lens. Specific laser channels used were 405 nm diode, 488 nm argon, 561 nm solid-state, and 639 nm diode lasers. Laser intensity and detector gain settings were maintained across all image acquisitions. All Zstacks were acquired for entire cell volume over scan area of 140 &#x3bc;m at Nyquist limit resolution.<br/>6.3.11. Data Analysis and Figures. FlowJo was used for flow cytometry analysis, and Cellomics HCS Studio (Thermo Fisher) was used for image acquisition based transfection analysis. Polymer structures were characterized in ChemDraw (PerkinElmer, Boston, Mass.) and Marvin (ChemAxon, Cambridge, Mass.) to determine log P and log D values. Calculation of normalized 50% serum transfection efficacy was performed by dividing the percent transfection or geometric mean transfection efficacy achieved in 50% serum media by the same nanoparticle (B8% and w/w ratio) formulation percent transfection or geometric mean transfection efficacy achieved in 10% serum. Confocal microscopy colocalization of plasmid DNA with lysosomes was assessed as intensity weighted colocalization in Zen Blue, then normalized by individual image area of plasmid DNA per image for statistical quantification.<br/>6.3.12.

In the synthesis scheme of A2+B2/B3+C, A2 corresponds to the primary amine monomer (S4) that can react twice, B2 corresponds to the diacrylate monomer (termed B7) that can react twice, B3 corresponds to the triacrylate monomer (termed B8) that can react three times, and C refers to the end-cap monomer, which reacts once due to its presence in excess. We confirmed that each polymer was primarily acrylate terminated after 24 h of synthesis via 1H NMR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>) by the presence of acrylate peaks between 5.5 and 6.5 ppm.

Further, by synthesizing the polymers in each series at the same purity accounted overall vinyl to amine ratio, the number-average (MN) molecular weights within each series of polymers were all very close to 4 kDa as shown by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Table 6-1).</p><p id="p-0623" num="0000">6.4.1.2. End-cap Modification of Polymers. PBAEs have been &#x201c;end-capped&#x201d; with small molecule monomers possessing secondary and tertiary amines that increase the overall polymer amine density, resulting in linear polymers with tertiary amines along the polymer backbone and greater amine density at just the two ends of the linear polymers.12,21,34,35 Most of the small molecule end-caps shown previously to increase transfection efficacy with linear PBAE structures21 increase the cationicity of the polymer at both pH 5 and 7 due to the fact that endcapping with primary amine monomers adds at minimum of two secondary amines to linear PBAEs. Here, we utilized monomer 2-&#x3b2;-aminopropylamino)ethanol (termed E6) for end-capping purposes, as it has been shown to be effective as an end-capping group with linear polymers and noncytotoxic to multiple cell lines.33,35 In contrast to previously reported branched polymer schemes, including branched PBAE schemes, this end-capping molecule exclusively increases the secondary amine content of the polymer. All BEAQs were confirmed to be completely end-capped by 1H NMR and the number-average of end-cap moieties per polymer molecule as estimated from NMR spectra ranged from two for the linear polymer to seven for the 90% triacrylate mole fraction polymer (Table 6-1). Notably, end-cap molecular mass fraction contribution in these polymers reaches near 30% for the high triacrylate mole fraction polymers, whereas linear PBAEs have an end-cap monomer mass fraction of approximately 5%, which reduces further for higher molecular weight linear polymers (Table 6-1). Polydispersity in moderately branched BEAQs was minimized by synthesizing at a dilute concentration, while high polydispersity of hyperbranched BEAQs with triacrylate mole fraction &#x3e;60% is consistent with other hyperbranched polymer synthesis schemes. 36<br/>6.4.1.3. Polymer Series Hydrophobicity. The chemical properties of each polymer in the series with known Mn and monomer composition were predicted in silico to assess the influence of branching with TMPTA on polymer hydrophobicity. Hydrophobicity was assessed as predicted partition coefficient (log P) and ionization influenced distribution coefficient (log D) at neutral and acidic pH values (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>), demonstrating that branching increases BEAQ hydrophilicity for the monomers utilized here and that pH sensitive ionization plays an important role in polymer solubility. Branching was hypothesized to reduce both polymer log P and log D values as a greater number of E6 monomer endcap moieties in branched structures increased the prevalence of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups and charged secondary amines; polymers with a high degree of branching were further subject to reduction in hydrophobicity due to the fact that the mass fraction of the diacrylate monomer B7, which contains a bisphenol group, was likewise reduced. We confirmed this predicted reduction in hydrophobicity experimentally via an absorbance based assay, to show that BEAQs with at least 40% triacrylate mole fraction were over twice as soluble as the linear B8-0% polymer under both low pH and physiological pH conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>).<br/>6.4.1.4. Polymer Series Buffering Capacity. Titration of the polymers demonstrated buffering capacity in the physiological pH range for hypothesized endosomal escape properties (5 to 7.4), as BEAQs with greater triacrylate mole fraction possessed a larger buffering capacity in this range (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). Effective pKa in the pH range from 5 to 8 was calculated as the pH at the maximum normalized buffering capacity of the derivative of the titration curves defined as &#x394;(&#x2014;OH)/&#x394;(pH) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>). Effective pKa was demonstrated to increase moderately with increased branching from approximately 6.0 to 6.75 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>). These results are due to the combined effects of additional tertiary amine density in the polymer backbone and the presence of additional secondary amines in end-groups as the branching increases.18 Tertiary amine density calculated relative to the base polymer structures (Table 6-S4) shows that diacrylate B7+S4 polymer repeat units have much lower tertiary amine density than triacrylate B8+S4&#xd7;2 repeat units, and physical spacing of the tertiary amines in high diacrylate B7 content polymers is greater than that for high triacrylate B8 content polymers. However following end-capping with monomer E6, tertiary amine density is similar among all synthesized polymers, while secondary amine density increased substantially with triacrylate mole fraction from 0.851 to 4.194 mmol per gram polymer for B8-0% and B8-90%, respectively (Table 6-S5).<br/>6.4.1.5. Polymer Series DNA Binding. Assessment of BEAQ/DNA binding strength interactions via Yo-Pro-1 iodide competition binding assays further demonstrated the influence of branching in polymer structure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D, <b>8</b>F</figref>). At pH 5, linear and branched polymers were equally effective at binding plasmid DNA, while in isotonic, neutral buffer at pH 7.4, branched polymers statistically outperformed linear polymers for DNA binding (Table 6-S6). To assess if increases in DNA binding strength of the BEAQs were attributable primarily to branched structure or changes in amine content, we calculated Yo-Pro-1 iodide quenching as a function of secondary, tertiary, and total amine content per base-pair DNA from known structural characteristics of each polymer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). DNA binding normalized to tertiary amine content effectively condensed the binding assay results at pH 5, while normalization of DNA binding in neutral, isotonic buffer to secondary amine content most effectively condensed the results to fit one curve (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>G</figref>). Gel electrophoresis DNA retention assays were similarly in agreement with these results, demonstrating that branching improved DNA binding particularly in neutral, isotonic buffer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>). These results indicate that BEAQ backbone tertiary amines play an important role in polymer complexation with DNA at low pH, but secondary amines in BEAQ end-cap structures are primarily responsible for binding plasmid DNA following dilution into neutral solutions. Further analysis of the difference between binding at low pH and neutral pH do, however, reveal that the increase in end-cap density of branched polymers was not exclusively responsible for increased binding at neutral pH. Scaling the difference in binding efficacy as a function of total amines per base pair DNA revealed that branched polymers were more effective at maintaining DNA binding in a manner that is attributable to structural changes instead of increases in amine content (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>H</figref>).<br/>6.4.2. Nanoparticle Properties. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements of polymer/DNA polyplex nanoparticles to assess hydrodynamic diameter demonstrated effective independence of nanoparticle properties with regards to branching. DLS measurements of polymeric nanoparticles formed in 25 mM NaAc, pH 5.0 at a 40 w/w ratio to DNA showed that all polymers formed nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 50-100 nm that maintained a diameter of approximately 100 nm following a 6-fold dilution into 150 mM PBS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>. All nanoparticle formulations showed similar zeta potential values of approximately +15 mV (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>). Select formulations were analyzed via TEM, which showed dried nanoparticle diameters between 30 and 60 nm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>). Notably, the linear 0% triacrylate mole fraction (B8-0%) particles were the smallest when assessed by TEM at 32&#xb1;3 nm, compared to a mean of 54&#xb1;6 nm for B8-50% nanoparticles, which may be attributable to slightly stronger intermolecular polymer interactions driven by increased hydrophobic effect for the less branched polymers with higher B7 fraction/lower triacrylate monomer B8 fraction.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="2">6.4.3. Cellular Transfection.</heading><p id="p-0624" num="0579">6.4.3.1. Nanoparticle Uptake Was Not Influenced by Branching Structure. We hypothesized that the increased number of end-cap moieties per polymer molecule would result in increased cellular uptake, as end-capping linear PBAEs has been demonstrated to improve cellular uptake compared to acrylate terminated and side-chain monomer terminated linear PBAEs.21 Further, end-cap structures have been shown to convey cell type specificity,21,27 as well as partially contribute buffering capacity of PBAEs in the physiologically relevant pH range.18 To assess whether the increased number of end-cap moieties per polymer molecule for BEAQs would yield greater cell uptake relative to linear PBAEs, we assessed cellular uptake by flow cytometry of nanoparticles formed with Cy5 labeled plasmid DNA in HEK293T and ARPE-19 cells at moderate fluorophore labeling density. All polymers were generally effective for mediating cellular uptake of plasmid DNA, with above 95% of cells testing as positive for DNA uptake gated against the untreated cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). These branched polymers showed no significant improvement in cellular uptake at equivalent w/w ratios to the linear polymer. Thus, an increased number of 2-&#x3b2;-aminopropylamino) ethanol end-cap moieties per polymer molecule did not mediate higher cellular uptake as hypothesized.<br/>6.4.3.2. BEAQ Nanoparticles Mediate High Transfection Efficacy. To assess the ability of BEAQs to effectively deliver plasmid DNA to both easier-to-transfect and difficult-to-transfect cell types, HEK293T cells and ARPE-19 retinal pigment epithelial cells were chosen for transfection studies with the reporter gene eGFP-N1. In these two cell lines, the BEAQs nanoparticles achieved up to 99% and 77% transfection efficacy, respectively, in complete medium as assessed by flow cytometry, which is greater than any reported transfection efficacy using nonviral methods in either cell line to the best of our knowledge (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). Among commercial reagents we fully tested and optimized, including 25 kDa branched polyethlyenimine (BPEI), 4 kDa linear polyethylenimine (LPEI), JetPRIME, and Lipofectamine 2000 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>). JetPRIME gave the highest level of transfection in ARPE-19 cells at approximately 40% transfection with tolerable viability. Linear PEI gave slightly higher transfection but at the cost of substantial cytotoxicity. The maximum level of transfection achieved in ARPE-19 cells with the reported BEAQ polymers is likewise higher than our previously optimized top linear PBAE 557 formulation, which we found transfected only 40-45% of these cells with keeping cytotoxicity &#x3c;30%.37 This formulation was previously shown to lead to transfection in vivo following subretinal injection in mice, making it likely for these BEAQ nanoparticles to function in a similar manner in vivo.37<br/>6.4.3.3. Moderate Branching in BEAQs Improves Stability in Physiological Serum Conditions. Effective delivery under physiological serum conditions remains a challenge for cationic nanoparticle based gene delivery, due to the shielding and aggregation effects of serum proteins. To assess nanoparticle performance under these conditions, the BEAQs were evaluated for transfection in HEK293T and ARPE-19 cells incubated in 50% serum medium during a 2 h nanoparticle incubation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>). Under these challenging transfection conditions, which more closely model an in vivo systemic administration, BEAQs demonstrated remarkably statistically improved transfection efficacy compared to their linear counterparts, which was particularly pronounced at low w/w ratios in both cell lines (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>). The optimal BEAQ-50 branched polymer was capable of transfecting 98% and 65% of HEK293T and ARPE-19 cells under 50% serum conditions. After normalizing transfection efficacy results in 50% serum to matched results in 10% serum conditions, BEAQ nanoparticles reported here maintain 80% and 70% geometric mean expression in HEK293T cells and ARPE-19 cells with no reduction in percentage of cells transfected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref>).<br/>6.4.3.4. Moderate Branching Improves Transfection at Low Plasmid Doses. Transfection at low nanoparticle doses likewise better mimics conditions encountered in vivo following administration and dilution into biological fluids. At very low nanoparticle doses, plasmid concentrations between 16 and 256 pM (0.25-4 pg/cell) in 384-well plates, moderately branched triacrylate mole fraction BEAQs showed statistically higher transfection compared to the optimized corresponding linear PBAE in both cell lines (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). Overall with statistical assessment at all w/w ratios tested, B8-40% and B8-50% performed the best in both cell lines. Optimal w/w ratio was notably shifted for low DNA dose transfections, such that 60 w/w BEAQ nanoparticles showed better transfection than 20 w/w particles at very low doses (&#x2264;5 ng/well). Cell viability was not strongly affected under any of the conditions.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="2">6.4.4. Branching Reduces Degree of Lysosomal Accumulation Following Uptake.</heading><p id="p-0625" num="0580">Transfection of HEK293T and ARPE-19 cells with Cy5-labeled plasmid DNA followed by assessment of lysosome colocalization with confocal microscopy at 4 and 24 h following nanoparticle treatment demonstrated that less internalized DNA was colocalized with lysosomes when delivered by B8-50% BEAQs compared to the linear B8-0% polymer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref>). For accurate quantification of lysosomal colocalization throughout the entire cell volume, Z-stacks were acquired at both time-points, and nanoparticle area per slice was used to scale the respective contribution to calculated z-stack lysosome correlation coefficient (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b></figref>). Representative uncropped maximum intensity projection images of acquired Z-stacks for each condition show a high level of Cy5-DNA uptake with limited lysosome colocalization for all conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b></figref>). All nanoparticle formulations tested demonstrated a statistically significant increase in lysosome colocalization between 4 and 24 h following nanoparticle treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b>C</figref>); however, the degree of change in lysosome accumulation was lower with the B8-50% BEAQ nanoparticles, specifically for the higher 40 w/w ratio tested, which yielded less than 20% of internalized DNA as detectable in lysosomes at 24 h in either cell type. The degree of lysosome colocalization for the linear B8-0% polymer at 24 h (0.4) was still far below the colocalization we previously measured for PLL (0.78) and BPEI (0.7), despite the ability of BPEI to much more effectively buffer protons on a per-unit basis.39 This result supports the notion that amphiphilic polyesters mediate lysosomal in a different manner than polyethylenimine, as their degree of lysosomal avoidance is not proportional to their buffering capacity. At 24 h following nanoparticle treatment, cells expressing eGFP from the 20% unlabeled fraction of plasmid DNA were visible for all conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>62</b></figref>). Cy5-labeled plasmid DNA was also detectable in the nucleus of some cells that typically were also strongly expressing eGFP at the 24 h time point (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>). Analysis of single slices from Z-stacks did, however, reveal that most plasmid DNA internalized had not localized to the nucleus at 24 h post-treatment, even when it avoided lysosomal degradation.<br/>6.4.5. Trends in Transfection from Differentially Branched BEAQs. We analyzed transfection efficacy of each polymer over the multiple w/w ratios tested as functions of polymer concentration and known specific buffering capacity as well as secondary, tertiary, and total amine content. To account for overall population expression and effects of polymers on viability, we scaled geometric mean expression values by viability and normalized to the maximum geometric mean expression value of each polymer structure to give viability normalized expression. Viability normalized expression was then plotted against each variable of interest (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>). All BEAQs demonstrated clear biphasic trends in normalized geometric mean expression. Upon fitting a single quadratic curve to the data from all polymers, tertiary amine density as a function of tertiary amines per base pair DNA was revealed to be the most important chemical property for predicting optimal w/w ratio for transfection efficacy. Particularly, a single curve quadratic fit for all polymer data across all structures for HEK293T and ARPE-19 cells gave R2 values of 0.761 and 0.615, respectively. Polyethylenimine did not exhibit the same biphasic trends between amine content and geometric mean expression as BEAQs but did demonstrate optimal amine content of approximately 30 secondary amines, which may be attributable to the greater cytotoxicity encountered with using PEI that limits utilization of high w/w ratios (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>). Interestingly, highly branched 25 kDa BPEI had a much higher optimal total amines per bp DNA similar to the synthesized BEAQs, which may be attributable to the level of interaction between amines in linear polymers compared to branched polymers. Spatial accessibility of amines in polymer structures and steric hindrance in branched polymers may necessitate greater overall amine content.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="2">6.5. Discussion</heading><p id="p-0626" num="0581">Branching has been demonstrated to yield enhanced transfection in many cationic polymer systems and studied in PBAEs through the use of monomers with trifunctional amine monomers40 or trifunctional triacrylate monomers for generation of branched polymers.17 Here, we sought to explore the exact nature by which branching can improve transfection efficacy of these polymers through a fair comparison of fully effective linear PBAEs to equivalent branched species. For this purpose, we synthesized a series of polymers with well-defined degrees of branching that was quantified via NMR and GPC. These BEAQs are notable in part due to the manner in which end-capping with the chosen E6 monomer affected amine density, particularly through adding secondary amines to the polymer structure. We hypothesized that the branching structure and high end-cap moiety mass fraction in BEAQs would show improved DNA binding at neutral pH and would be more effective for delivery at lower w/w ratios as compared to linear PBAEs due to their increased secondary amine cationicity. BEAQs were shown via computational and experimental methods to be more water-soluble due to the increased prevalence of hydrophilic end-cap moieties and more effective at buffering in the physiological pH range. We further calculated the effective pKa value of each polymer to demonstrate that branching influenced the pH point of maximal buffering capacity. Given the long-standing hypothesis that titration capability of polycations in the pH 5-7.4 range is responsible for &#x201c;proton sponge hypothesis&#x201d; driven endosomal escape,39,41-44 direct variation of the buffering capacity and effective pKa allowed evaluation of the importance of buffering in gene delivery with these polymers. Through quantitative competition DNA binding assays we demonstrated that branching improved DNA binding as a function of both increased secondary amine content via additional end-cap monomers as well as branching structure by normalized binding efficacy to specific amine content of each polymer. Importantly, BEAQs were much more effective at binding nucleic acids compared to the linear polymer following dilution into neutral, isotonic buffer. Using the two well characterized cell lines human embryonic kidney HEK293T and human retinal pigment epithelium ARPE-19, these polymers demonstrated extremely high transfection efficacy (up to 99% and 77%, respectively) with no notable cytotoxicity at utilized doses. BEAQs did not demonstrate greater nanoparticle uptake compared to the linear polymer but did improve transfection efficacy and reduce the necessary w/w ratio, effectively improving polymer efficiency of transfection at a given polymer mass. As the highly branched B8-80% and B8-90% polymers possessed the greatest buffering capacity and the most relevant effective pKa values (nearer to pH 7) but the lowest transfection efficacy, our results further indicate that buffering capability and endosomal escape is likely not the rate-limiting step to mediating successful transfection in this polymer system. These results reinforce findings from other groups in alternative polymer systems that polymer buffering capacity between pH 4-7.4 is a necessary, but not on its own a sufficient property for transfection. 45 Under more challenging transfection conditions of extremely low nanoparticle doses or under physiological serum conditions, moderately branched BEAQs were statistically shown to outperform the equivalent linear PBAE and possess extremely high transfection efficacy for the reported conditions. At ultralow plasmid DNA doses, the efficiency of plasmid DNA delivery was rather remarkable compared to previously reported optimal nanoparticles, including PBAE terpolymers that include alkyl side chains for improved colloidal stability that were shown to require roughly 3&#xd7; the DNA dose used here to transfect HeLa cells with similar efficacy.46 Further, in physiological serum conditions these BEAQ nanoparticles demonstrated an impressive degree of transfection compared to what has been reported in the literature. Fluorinated PAMAM dendrimers were reported to have their transfection efficacy reduced to 30% of what it was in 10% serum when the nanoparticles were added to cells in 50% serum.47 In contrast, BEAQ nanoparticles maintained &#x3e;70% geometric mean expression under matched conditions to 10% serum transfections. Other nonviral transfection reagents have similarly been reported to facilitate transfection under physiological serum conditions, but often yield only 30-40% of the mean expression level of the same particles in 10% serum.48 That being said, even at this relatively high level of efficacy of nonviral transfection, much room is left for improvement in nonviral vector efficiency as compared to viral vectors that have evolved for over a billion years for efficient transduction. At the low doses tested of 5-10 ng plasmid DNA/well, there were approximately 200 000-400 000 plasmids available for every cell in the well.</p><p id="p-0627" num="0582">Plasmids per cell were calculated as follows. In 384 well transfection experiments at low nanoparticle doses, moderately branched BEAQs yielded 82% transfection efficacy in HEK293T cells at a dose of 5 ng/well and 42% transfection efficacy in ARPE-19 cells at a dose of 10 ng/well. Cells were seeded at a density of 2500 cells per well and assumed to divide once to yield 5000 cells per well on the day of transfection. The eGFP-N1 plasmid has a size of 4733 bp and molecular weight of approximately 3124 kDa, meaning there were 9.64&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>plasmids/well and 192,800 plasmids per cell available at a 5 ng dose.</p><p id="p-0628" num="0583">Based on recent estimates of approximately 10 plasmids per polyplex nanoparticle.31,49 there could still be over 20,000 nanoparticles added per cell at this dose, which is a high multiplicity of infection (MOI). With an estimated number of 5000 plasmids from polyplex nanoparticles being internalized per cell under higher dose transfection conditions and an estimated &#x2155; of those plasmids reaching the nuclear envelope, uptake of nanoparticles appears to be a significant hurdle to effective transfection in vitro.32 In comparison to efficient viruses, the low nanoparticle doses tested here are far above the order of magnitude MOI used for adenovirus (1-1000) and various lentiviruses (1-200) to yield similar levels of expression.50,51 In contrast, naturally occurring AAVs are often used at a much higher MOI of up to 100 000 to achieve similarly detectable reporter gene based levels of transfection in hard-to-transduce cell lines.52,53 Spark Therapeutics recently completed a successful phase III clinical trial using subretinal delivery of AAV for the first FDA approved gene therapy, voretigene neparvovec-rzyl, demonstrating the clinical potential of nonintegrating gene therapy.54 Given the similar level of MOI for BEAQ and AAV and coupled with challenges in scaling production of AAV for clinical utilization1,2 and the limitations of AAV cargo capacity, nonviral delivery of episomal plasmid DNA with this BEAQ system may be a viable strategy for clinical delivery of DNA to RPE cells.</p><p id="p-0629" num="0584">Escape from endosomes and avoidance of lysosomal degradation remains a significant hurdle to nanomaterials aiming to achieve cytosolic delivery. Estimates of endosomal escape of lipid nanoparticles for siRNA has revealed that less than 2% of cargo internalized to endosomes typically reaches the cytosol,55,56 which has been improved by some recent lipid nanoparticle formulations yielding up to 15% escape in HeLa cells.57 Polyplex nanoparticles similarly suffer from low endosomal escape efficacy, with the classic materials such as polyethylenimine and polylysine almost exclusively remaining in acidified vesicles and undergoing lysosomal degradation despite the ability of the former material in particular to buffer hydrogen ions.41 Transport to acidic lysosomes occurs rapidly following internalization, with nanoparticles typically reaching a lysosomal compartment within 1 h following internalization. 58 In contrast to these findings for most other polymeric materials, we demonstrated that BEAQs largely avoid lysosomal degradation with &#x3c;20% of labeled plasmid DNA being detectable in acidified vesicles at 24 h post-treatment compared to 40-50% DNA delivered with the linear polymer detected in acidified vesicles. These results are promising in that they demonstrate that branching may improve the ability of these polymers to achieve endosomal escape, which remains a primary hurdle to effective gene delivery. Finally, we demonstrated how polymer structure, as a function of hydrophobicity and cationicity, related directly to optimal polymer/DNA mass ratio and to transfection efficacy as these variables have been shown repeatedly to be crucial to yielding robust transfection in other polymer systems. To identify structure&#x2014;function relationships between these polymers and transfection efficacy, we analyzed viability and geometric mean expression as a function of individual polymer properties including buffering capacity, secondary, tertiary, and total amine content per bp plasmid DNA. This is the first reported analysis of this type reported to our knowledge and yielded insights into the features of polycations that make them effective for transfection. In particular, we demonstrated that the optimal number of tertiary amines per bp plasmid DNA was near constant across the entire range of branching, while optimal numbers of secondary amines increased with degree of branching. With further knowledge of precise desired polymer structures, solid phase synthesis of alternating copolymers is an option that has been utilized in the synthesis of precisely defined polymers for gene delivery.59 Degradation rate of polymers could also play a role in the differences in transfection, as differences in constituent monomers can affect the specific degradation rate. The total possible solution space for BEAQs that may be highly effective for gene delivery is vast, as there are many diacrylate, side-chain amino, and end-capping amino monomers available that have been shown to yield linear polymers effective for transfection of diverse cell types. Synthesis of BEAQs via the guidelines outlined here and in previous publications14 will enable the rapid prototyping of diverse polymers that may yield further gains to efficient nucleic acid delivery as well as insights into polymeric structure/function relationships. The presented method for generating BEAQs can likewise be easily expanded to include utilization of branching monomers with other triacrylate monomer use as well as quaternary or greater functionality such as pentaerythritol tetraacrylate or dipentaerythritol penta-/hexa-acrylate to further increase structural diversity.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="2">6.6. Summary</heading><p id="p-0630" num="0585">Branched poly(Ester Amine) Quadpolymers (BEAQs) were successfully synthesized and characterized and were demonstrated to have multiple enhancements over leading nonviral gene delivery materials including optimized linear PBAEs, BPEI, JetPRIME, and Lipofectamine 2000. BEAQs with a moderate degree of branching were shown to more tightly bind plasmid DNA, maintain DNA binding following dilution in neutral, isotonic buffer, and possess higher solubility in aqueous media compared to linear analogs. Branched polymers formed from diacrylate (B7) and triacrylate (B8) monomers were highly effective for plasmid DNA delivery, and moderately branched BEAQs best maintained efficacy at physiologically relevant high serum concentrations. Analysis of chemical structure highlighted the importance of the ability to buffer pH at approximately 20 nmol H+/&#x3bc;g DNA as well as the key parameter of tertiary amine content at approximately 40 tertiary amines per base pair of DNA. Through differential control of polymer branching, BEAQs were found to be efficient for nonviral gene delivery to difficult-to-transfect human cells. BEAQs are promising as therapeutic gene delivery vehicles, and these findings have implications for the design, identification, and optimization of next-generation polymeric materials for nucleic acid delivery.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="1">6.7 REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0631" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0586">(1) Kotin, R.

In this study, we synthesized a series of reducible branched ester-amine quadpolymers (rBEAQs) and investigated their ability to coencapsulate and deliver DNA plasmids and RNA oligos. The rBEAQs are designed to leverage polymer branching, reducibility, and hydrophobicity to successfully cocomplex DNA and RNA in nanoparticles at low polymer to nucleic acid w/w ratios and enable high delivery efficiency. We validate the synthesis of this new class of biodegradable polymers, characterize the self-assembled nanoparticles that these polymers form with diverse nucleic acids, and demonstrate that the nanoparticles enable safe, effective, and efficient DNA-siRNA codelivery as well as nonviral CRISPR-mediated gene editing utilizing Cas9 DNA and sgRNA codelivery.</p><heading id="h-0036" level="1">7.2 BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0639" num="0645">The introduction of exogenous genetic material into mammalian cells has been widely used in the laboratory to modulate gene expression and induce cellular reprogramming, 1 differentiation,2,3 and programmed cell death.4-6 Recently, these technologies have begun moving into the clinic and mark the beginning of a new paradigm for genetic medicine.7,8 Traditional gene therapies involve the delivery of DNA, often in the form of plasmids or minicircle DNA,9 into target cells. RNA oligonucleotides such as short interfering RNA (siRNA) can enable target-specific gene silencing, 0, and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) complex with Cas9 endonucleases to achieve site-specific gene editing via the CRISPR/Cas9 system12,13 The biological functionality of these nucleic acids depends heavily on their successful intracellular delivery. 14</p><p id="p-0640" num="0646">Although nonviral vectors delivering either plasmid DNA or siRNA have been widely reported, very few studies have been able to functionally codeliver both in the same nanoparticle system. This can be challenging as DNA and RNA oligonucleotides are vastly different in size (5000 vs 20 bp) and stiffness. 15,16 In this study, we synthesized a series of reducible branched ester-amine quadpolymers (rBEAQs) and investigated their ability to form nanoparticles that could functionally codeliver plasmid DNA and RNA oligonucleotides. The rBEAQs were designed based on recent studies that have demonstrated that hyperbranched cationic polymers are superior to their linear counterparts at DNA17-20 and oligonucleotide21,22 delivery in multiple polymeric vector systems. The branched polymer architecture could increase the charge density of each polymer molecule, allowing for stronger nucleic acid binding affinity.23 Disulfide bonds are another useful functionality as they can enable environmentally triggered cargo release in the reducing cytosolic environment. They can be incorporated into delivery vectors as polymer side chains,34 cross-linking moieties between polymer chains,25 and part of the polymer backbone26 and have been used successfully in several siRNA delivery systems. Finally, increasing polymer hydrophobicity has been shown to improve nanoparticle stability and increase DNA27 as well as siRNA delivery efficacy.28</p><p id="p-0641" num="0647">Using a facile one-pot Michael addition reaction, we were able to tune the reducibility and hydrophobicity of the polymers by simply adjusting the monomer ratios. We found that the nucleic acid binding affinity, release kinetics, nanoparticle uptake, and functional nucleic acid delivery could be modulated in a highly controlled manner Our nanoparticle system enabled up to 77% DNA transfection and 66% siRNA-mediated knockdown. More importantly, delivery of Cas9 DNA and sgRNA enabled 40% gene knockout, further highlighting the robustness of this codelivery system.</p><heading id="h-0037" level="1">7.3. MATERIALS AND METHODS</heading><p id="p-0642" num="0648">7.3.1. Materials. 2-Hydroxyethyl disulfide (CAS 1892291), triethylamine (CAS 121448), acryloyl chloride (CAS 814686), bisphenol A glycerolate (1 glycerol/phenol) diacrylate (B7; CAS 4687949), trimethylolpropane triacrylate (B8; CAS 15625895), 2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethanol (E6; CAS 4461396), L-buthionine-sulfoximine (CAS 83730534), and solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.). 4-Amino-1-butanol (S4; CAS 133251005) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Tewksbury, Mass.). Plasmids pCAGGFPd2 (14760) and piRFP670-N1 (45457) were purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, Mass.). PB-CMV-MCS-EF1a-RFP PiggyBac plasmid (PB512B-1) and PiggyBac transposase expression plasmid (PB200A-1) were purchased from System Biosciences (Palo Alto, Calif.). Negative control siRNA (1027281) was purchased from Qiagen (Germantown, Md.). GFP siRNA targeting the sequence 5&#x2032;-GCA AGC TGA CCC TGA AGT TC-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO: 3) (P-002048-01) was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, Colo.). Cy5-labeled siRNA (SIC005) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich.<br/>7.3.2. Polymer Synthesis. Bioreducible monomer 2,2-disulfanediylbis(ethane-2,1-diyl) diacrylate (BR6) was synthesized using a method similar to Kozielski et al.26 Briefly, 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide was acrylated with acryloyl chloride (1:1.1 molar ratio in dichloromethane) in the presence of excess triethylamine After filtering out the precipitate, the product was washed with water, dried with sodium sulfate, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation.</p><p id="p-0643" num="0649">For polymer synthesis, monomers BR6, B7, B8, and S4 were dissolved in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) according to the B monomer molar ratios listed in Table 7-S1 for an overall vinyl/amine ratio of 2.2:1 at a concentration of 150 mg/mL. After overnight reaction at 90&#xb0; C. with stirring, the polymers were end-capped by reacting with monomer E6 (0.2 M final concentration in DMSO) at room temperature for 1 h. The end-capped polymers were purified by two diethyl ether washes, after which the remaining solvent was removed in a vacuum chamber. Polymers were dissolved in DMSO at 100 mg/mL and stored in aliquots at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. with desiccant.</p><p id="p-0644" num="0000">7.3.3. Yo-Pro-1 Iodide Nucleic Acid Binding Assay. Yo-Pro-1 iodide fluorescent dye (Invitrogen) was mixed with siRNA at a final concentration of 0.5 &#x3bc;M Yo-Pro and 0.5 &#x3bc;M scRNA in 25 mM sodium acetate (NaAc, pH 5.0). Polymers were dissolved in NaAc, and 25 &#x3bc;L of polymer solution was mixed with 75 &#x3bc;L of RNA/Yo-Pro solution per well in 96-well black-bottom plates. The solutions were incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 20 min before fluorescence readings were taken on a fluorescence multiplate reader (Biotek Synergy 2). To measure siRNA binding in reducing conditions over time, the polymer concentration was set at the lowest concentration at which each polymer achieved &#x3e;80% quenching. The polymer/siRNA/Yo-Pro solution was mixed with 10 &#x3bc;L of glutathione solution (final concentration 5 mM) and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. Fluorescence readings were taken at the indicated time points.<br/>7.3.4. Polymer Characterization: NMR and GPC. The polymer structure was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) via 1H NMR in CDCl3 (Bruker 500 MHz) and analyzed using TopSpin 3.5 software. To measure polymer molecular weight and polydispersity, polymers were dissolved in BHT-stabilized tetrahydrofuran with 5% DMSO and 1% piperidine, filtered through a 0.2 &#x3bc;m PTFE filter, and measured with gel permeation chromatography against linear polystyrene standards (Waters, Milford, Mass.).<br/>7.3.5. Gel Retardation Assay. Nanoparticles were synthesized by dissolving the polymer and siRNA separately in NaAc buffer at the desired concentrations. The solutions were mixed at a 1:1 volume ratio, and nanoparticles were allowed to self-assemble at room temperature for 10 min, after which nanoparticles were incubated in the presence of 5 mM glutathione or 150 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37&#xb0; C. Samples were taken at various time points and frozen at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. to stop the reaction. For gel retardation assays of R6,7,8_64 nanoparticles coencapsulating plasmid DNA and siRNA, nucleic acids were first premixed at a 1:1 volume ratio and then mixed with polymer to allow for nanoparticle self-assembly. Polymer dosage was varied from 10 to 0 w/w (free nucleic acids). Samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel using 30% glycerol as the loading buffer. Gel electrophoresis was performed in TAE buffer at 100 V for 15 min, after which the gel was imaged under UV.<br/>7.3.6. Nanoparticle Characterization. Nanoparticles were prepared as described above and diluted in 150 mM PBS to determine particle size and surface charge in neutral isotonic buffer. Hydrodynamic diameter was measured via nanoparticle tracking analysis at 1:500 dilution in PBS using a NanoSight NS300, whereas &#x3b6;-potential was measured at 1:6 dilution in PBS via electrophoretic light scattering on a Malvern Zetasizer NanoZS (Malvern Panalytical). To characterize nanoparticle stability over time in physiological conditions, nanoparticle size was also measured at 1:6 dilution in 10% serum-containing cell culture medium once per hour for 9 h using a Malvern Zetasizer Pro (Malvern Panalytical). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired with a Philips CM120 TEM (Philips Research). Nanoparticles were prepared at a polymer concentration of 1.8 mg/mL in 25 mM NaAc, 30 &#x3bc;L was added to 400-square mesh carbon-coated TEM grids, and the grids were allowed to coat for 20 min Grids were then rinsed with ultrapure water, counterstained with uranyl acetate (0.5% in distilled water), and allowed to fully dry before imaging.<br/>7.3.7. Cell Culture and Cell Line Preparation. HEK-293T human embryonic kidney and Huh7 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. A PiggyBac transposon/transposase system was used to generate cell lines constitutively expressing a destabilized form of GFP (GFPd229) with a protein half-life of two hours. The GFPd2 PiggyBac transposon plasmid (PB-CAG-GFPd2 Addgene 115665) was created by inserting the GFPd2 gene into a PiggyBac plasmid through standard restriction enzyme cloning. The transposon plasmid was then cotransfected with the PiggyBac transposase expression plasmid into cells using the method described below. Cells underwent two transfections and were then grown out for five passages to allow the fluorescence signal from transient transfections to fade. Positively expressing cells were isolated via fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS), and colonies grown from single cells were grown out to establish stably expressing cell lines.<br/>7.3.8. Transfection. Cells were seeded onto 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 15 000 cells per well in 100 &#x3bc;L of complete medium and allowed to adhere overnight. Nanoparticles were formed immediately prior to transfection as described above. For experiments delivering siRNA only, each nanoparticle condition was formulated with a scrambled control RNA (scRNA) or an siRNA targeting GFP (siGFP) with a final RNA concentration of 100 nM per well. For experiments codelivering siRNA and DNA, nanoparticles were formulated with a final dose of 200 ng of DNA per well in addition to 100 nM scRNA or siGFP, respectively, for a final total nucleic acid dose of 400 ng per well. Nanoparticles coencapsulating DNA and siRNA were formed by premixing the nucleic acids at a 1:1 volume ratio in NaAc buffer prior to mixing with the polymer solution. Prior to the addition of nanoparticles, the cell culture medium was replaced with 100 &#x3bc;L of serum-free media. Then, 20 &#x3bc;L of nanoparticles was added per well and incubated with cells for 2 h, at which point the nanoparticle/media mixture was replaced with fresh complete media. Knockdown of GFPd2 fluorescence was assessed via flow cytometry 1 day post-transfection using a BD Accuri C<sub>6 </sub>flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Knockdown was quantified by normalizing the geo metric mean of fluorescence of wells treated with siGFP to that of wells transfected using the same nanoparticle formulation delivering scRNA. For codelivery experiments, DNA transfection was quantified as the percentage of cells positively expressing iRFP when gated against untreated controls (N=4). Transfections in which sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) was used to increase nanoparticle pH were done by forming nanoparticles in acidic NaAc buffer as previously described and then mixing with 50 mg/mL NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>buffer (pH 9) at a 1:1 volume ratio before adding to cells. Transfections using commercially available nonviral transfection reagents Lipofectamine 2000, Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo-Fisher), and jetPrime (Polyplus) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In DNA-siRNA codelivery experiments, 25 kD bPEI was used at 1 w/w.</p><p id="p-0645" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00114" num="00114"><img id="EMI-C00114" he="154.35mm" wi="158.67mm" file="US20230002790A1-20230105-C00114.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0646" num="0000">7.3.9 Cellular Uptake and Viability.

After 2 h incubation with nanoparticles, cells were replenished with fresh BSO-containing complete media and incubated for 24 h, at which point cell viability and flow cytometry assays were performed.<br/>7.3.11 Confocal Microscopy. HEK-293T cells were plated on Nunc Lab-Tek 8 chambered borosilicate cover glass well plates (155411; ThermoFisher) at 30 000 cells/well 1 day prior to transfection in 300 &#x3bc;L of phenol red free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. R6,7,8_64 nanoparticles nanoparticles (10 w/w) were prepared as described above using premixed Cy3-labeled siRNA and Cy5-labeled plasmid DNA at a 1 w/w ratio of nucleic acids. Cy5-labeled plasmid DNA was prepared as previously described31,32 and mixed at a 4 w/w ratio with unlabeled eGFP-N1 plasmid DNA. Nanoparticles were then diluted into media and added to cells at a total nucleic acid dose of 1000 ng/well and incubated for 2 h. Prior to imaging, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 at a 1:5000 dilution for nuclei visualization. Images were acquired over an area with sides of 140 &#x3bc;m at Nyquist limit resolution using a Zeiss LSM 780 microscope with Zen Blue software and 63&#xd7; oil immersion lens. Specific laser channels used were 405 nm diode, 488 nm argon, 561 nm solid-state, and 639 nm diode lasers. Laser intensity and detector gain settings were maintained across all image acquisitions.<br/>7.3.12 CRISPR Gene Editing. The template used for in vitro transcription of sgRNA targeting GFP was synthesized as a gBlock from IDT (sequence listed in Table 7-S2). In vitro transcription was performed using a MEGAshortscript T7 Transcription kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the sgRNA product was purified using a MEGAclear Transcription Clean-up kit (Invitrogen). Cas9 plasmid DNA (41815)12 was purchased from Addgene and amplified by Aldeveron (Fargo, N. Dak.). For codelivery transfections, DNA and sgRNA were delivered using R6,7,8_64 nanoparticles as described above. Gene knockout was assessed using flow cytometry 5 days post-transfection unless otherwise noted.<br/>2.13. Statistics.

Polymer Synthesis and Characterization. Polymers were synthesized following a facile one-pot Michael addition reaction in which acrylate monomers BR6 and B8 were copolymerized with amine-containing monomer S4 (Scheme 7-1). After end-capping with monomer E6, this class of polymers is referred to as R6,8_N, where N denotes the branching B8 monomer content in the polymer backbone (i.e., R6,8_20 contains 20% B8). In the polymer series containing the additional diacrylate monomer B7, B8 monomer content was kept constant at 20%, and polymers are referred to as R6,7,8_M, where M denotes the B7 monomer content in the polymer backbone. For acrylate-terminated base polymer synthesis, B and S monomers were dissolved in anhydrous DMSO at 150 mg/mL (monomer concentrations &#x3e;400 mg/mL resulted in complete gelation), and stepwise polymerization reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 90&#xb0; C. with stirring. The chemical structures of base polymers were determined via NMR spectroscopy, which verified that the polymers were acrylate terminated by three distinct acrylate peaks at 5.5-6.5 ppm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>63</b></figref>). Polymer end-capping with monomer E6 was performed at room temperature for 1 h and confirmed by the disappearance of these peaks. Molecular weight data was obtained from GPC analysis, which showed that with increasing B8 content, both Mn and Mw values generally increased (Table 7-1). For R6,7,8-4-6 polymers, for which the B8 content was fixed at 20%, the molecular weight did not change significantly with varying B7 content, suggesting that molecular weight is largely controlled by polymer branching and cross-linking effects contributed by triacrylate monomer B8.</p><p id="p-0648" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00021" num="00021"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 7-1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Molecular Weight Data from GPC Characterization and</entry></row><row><entry>Monomer Composition Calculated from 1H NMR Spectra</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Monomer fraction</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>polymer</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>in polymer</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>name</entry><entry>M<sub>n</sub></entry><entry>M<sub>w</sub></entry><entry>PDI</entry><entry>BR6</entry><entry>B7</entry><entry>B8</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>R6,8-4-6</entry><entry>R6,8_0</entry><entry>2224</entry><entry>2682</entry><entry>1.21</entry><entry>1.00</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>R6,8_20</entry><entry>3168</entry><entry>4038</entry><entry>1.27</entry><entry>0.75</entry><entry/><entry>0.25</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>R6,8_40</entry><entry>4050</entry><entry>5896</entry><entry>1.46</entry><entry>0.54</entry><entry/><entry>0.46</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>R6,8_60</entry><entry>4943</entry><entry>9949</entry><entry>2.01</entry><entry>0.36</entry><entry/><entry>0.64</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>R6,8_80</entry><entry>4675</entry><entry>8728</entry><entry>1.87</entry><entry>0.23</entry><entry/><entry>0.77</entry></row><row><entry>R6,7,8-4-6</entry><entry>R6,7,8_16</entry><entry>4511</entry><entry>7616</entry><entry>1.69</entry><entry>0.62</entry><entry>0.17</entry><entry>0.21</entry></row><row><entry>(20% B8)</entry><entry>R6,7,8_40</entry><entry>4570</entry><entry>7435</entry><entry>1.63</entry><entry>0.41</entry><entry>0.40</entry><entry>0.19</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>R6,7-8_64</entry><entry>4438</entry><entry>7066</entry><entry>1.59</entry><entry>0.17</entry><entry>0.63</entry><entry>0.20</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><br/>7.4.2. siRNA Delivery: Gene Knockdown, Cellular Uptake, and Cytotoxicity. R6,8-4-6 polymers were used to deliver siRNA targeting GFP (siGFP) in HEK-293T cells stably expressing a destabilized form of GFP with a short halflife (GFPd2).29 At 100 nM siRNA dose and 180 polymersiRNA w/w ratio, R6,8_20 achieved 75% knockdown with negligible cytotoxicity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b></figref>). All branched polymers in the R6,8_N series with the exception of R6,8_80 achieved significantly higher knockdown than the linear polymer (R6,8_0). Knockdown levels peaked with R6,8_20 and R6,8_40 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b></figref>), and the same trend was observed for nanoparticle uptake (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>B</figref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that nanoparticle uptake and transfection efficacy increased with increasing polymer molecular weight.33,34 This was not the case in our polymer system as R6,8_60 and R6,8_80 had the highest molecular weight but achieved relatively poor knockdown. This could in part be due to the fact that increasing polymer branching resulted in lower cell viability caused by decreasing reducible BR6 monomer content. Indeed, when cells were pretreated with L-buthioninesulfoximine (BSO) to inhibit cellular production of glutathione, the main intracellular reducing agent,35 nanoparticlemediated cytotoxicity significantly increased (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>C</figref>). This increased toxicity was beyond the additive effects of either nanoparticle or BSO treatment alone, indicating that the cell's inability to reduce disulfide bonds after glutathione blockade induced higher levels of cell death and confirming our hypothesis that polymer reducibility attenuated cytotoxicity by enabling them to rapidly degrade to relatively nontoxic oligomers. Thus, the bioreducibility of the rBEAQ nanoparticles is designed both to enable environmentally triggered cargo release upon entering the cytosol and as a mechanism to limit potential cytotoxicity of the branched polymers by quickly breaking them down into smaller components once they reach their target inside the cell. To elucidate the mechanism by which moderately branched polymers achieved the highest levels of knockdown, we assessed the physical characteristics of the nanoparticles. All polymers in the series formed nanoparticles with hydrodynamic diameters around 100 nm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>D</figref>). Nanoparticles formed with the linear polymer had negative surface charge, and -potential generally became increasingly positive with increased polymer branching (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>E</figref>). This is likely due to the fact that increased branching resulted in increasing numbers of secondary amine-containing end-groups per polymer molecule, which are positively charged in the pH 5 NaAc buffer. The increased cationic charge of moderately branched polymer nanoparticles likely contributes to nanoparticle uptake and siRNA-mediated knockdown in vitro, which is consistent with many published reports.36-38 This trend does not apply to very highly branched polymers, however, in part due to the high levels of cytotoxicity incurred by these nanoparticle formulations.<br/>7.4.3. siRNA Binding and Environmentally Triggered Release. A competitive binding assay using Yo-Pro-1 iodide (Yo-Pro) was used to assess siRNA binding strength in R6,8-4-6 polymers. Yo-Pro dye fluoresces upon nucleic acid binding, and quenching of fluorescence after the polymer outcompetes the dye for siRNA binding was used as a measure of binding strength. Increasing polymer branching increased the siRNA binding strength, which was seen in both end-capped (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b>A</figref>) and acrylate-terminated polymers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>A</figref>). Plotting knockdown as a function of the polymer EC50 w/w of siRNA binding (where lower EC<sub>50 </sub>w/w corresponds to tighter siRNA binding and higher degree of polymer branching) revealed a biphasic response (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b>B</figref>). Binding affinity and degree of knockdown both increased approximately 4-fold from R6,8_0 to R6,8_20 and decreased steadily when the B8 content exceeded 40%. This suggests that an optimal range for siRNA binding affinity exists, and polymers that bind too tightly cannot release siRNA to achieve efficient knockdown, whereas those that do not bind tightly enough cannot form nanoparticles that effectively promote nanoparticle internalization.39,40 siRNA binding affinity, along with other nanoparticle biophysical and chemical properties such as the size, surface charge, and bioreducibility discussed earlier, all contribute to the differential gene silencing effects seen here. For polymers with the same B8 content, end-capped polymers exhibited stronger binding than their acrylate-terminated counterparts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>B</figref>). These results suggest that polymer branching increases siRNA binding via two mechanisms. The first is mediated by the increased branching structure in the polymer backbone, which increases the molecular weight of the polymer and drives stronger binding through greater hydrophobic effects. The second is mediated by increased branching endpoints, which increase the number of end-capping molecules. As the secondary amines in the polymer endgroups are positively charged in the pH 5 NaAc buffer, they further increase siRNA binding through electrostatic interactions. We next investigated siRNA release kinetics of R6,8-4-6 nanoparticles in 5 mM glutathione to mimic the reducing intracellular environment.35 Nanoparticles were sampled at specific time points, and standard gel electrophoresis was performed to assess siRNA release (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b>C</figref>). The linear polymer released siRNA almost instantaneously, and release was complete by 1 h. Increased polymer branching slowed siRNA release considerably, with R6,8_20 beginning release at 1 h and higher branching polymers at 7 h. The same trend was observed when a Yo-Pro binding assay was performed with nanoparticles incubated over time in reducing buffer conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b>D</figref>). These results indicate that siRNA binding and release can be modulated in a highly controlled manner by changing the ratio between branching and reducible monomers and that siRNA release can be designed to occur in an environmentally triggered manner via reduction of disulfide bonds. However, we have also shown that blocking intracellular glutathione levels did not significantly decrease the observed level of siRNA-mediated knockdown (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>C</figref>), which suggests that other polymer degradation mechanisms such as the hydrolysis of ester bonds over a period of 4-6 h41 could also contribute to siRNA release from nanoparticles. Incorporation of disulfide linkages in the rBEAQ polymers helps ensure fragmentation of the polymers into small oligomers, reducing cytotoxicity, and enables higher doses, branching, or w/w formulation ratios of the polymers to be safely utilized.<br/>7.4.4. Codelivery of siRNA and DNA. As moderately branched polymers have been shown to maintain strong nucleic acid binding affinity while effectively releasing siRNA cargo in the reducing cytosolic environment, we hypothesized that they may be suitable for the codelivery of plasmid DNA and siRNA. R6,8_20 (the top polymer for siRNA delivery) was used to encapsulate 200 ng each of siGFP siRNA and a plasmid DNA encoding iRFP670. R6,8_20 nanoparticles enabled efficient codelivery to HEK-293T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b>A</figref>), resulting in 66% siRNA-mediated knockdown and 77% DNA transfection with negligible cytotoxicity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b>A</figref>). The same formulation achieved much lower delivery efficiency in harder-to-transfect Huh7 cells (23% knockdown and 5% transfection; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b>B</figref>), prompting the need to develop more effective polymers for codelivery. To this end, we investigated the effect of polymer hydrophobicity by incorporating monomer B7 at ratios indicated in Table 7-S1 to synthesize the R6,7,8-4-6 polymer series. B7 was chosen as it contains a bisphenol A group, which has been shown to bind DNA via hydrophobic effects42 and enable high-efficiency DNA transfection.27,43,44 B7-containing polymers effectively complexed nucleic acids at very low w/w, forming nanoparticles around 150 nm in diameter and +6 to +16 mV in &#x3b6;-potential (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>66</b></figref>). R6,7,8_64 nanoparticles (10 w/w) were quite stable in complete cell culture media mimicking physiological conditions for several hours with a hydrodynamic diameter doubling time &#x3e;4 h as assessed by dynamic light scattering (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>66</b>D</figref>). In contrast, R6,8-4-6 polymers with 0% B7 content formed much larger nanoparticles (270 nm) with &#x2212;11 mV &#x3b6;-potential at 10 w/w. B7-containing polymers were used at significantly lower w/w formulations compared to R6,8-4-6 polymers used for siRNA complexation earlier because R6,7,8-4-6 polymers incurred significantly higher cytotoxicity than the R6,8-4-6 polymers, limiting their use to very low w/w formulations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b>B</figref>). Nevertheless, B7-containing polymers enabled higher levels of knockdown and transfection at 10 w/w in HEK-293T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b>C</figref>), though the difference was less notable when R6,8-4-6 polymers were used at higher w/w. More strikingly, R6,7,8-4-6 polymers enabled significantly higher codelivery in Huh7 cells compared to R6,8-4-6 at all w/w formulations, with the best formulation achieving 53% knockdown and 37% transfection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b>B</figref>). A gel retardation assay demonstrated that R6,7,8_64 completely condensed both plasmid DNA and siRNA at 10 w/w, and decreasing the polymer dose resulted in siRNA release at 5 w/w and DNA release at 1 w/w (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b>D</figref>). We further explored the intracellular delivery locations of siRNA and DNA using confocal laser scanning microscopy, which demonstrated different fates for internalized siRNA and DNA. At an early 3 h time point following nanoparticle treatment, most endosomes possessed both siRNA and DNA, whereas at 24 h post-treatment, diffuse cytosolic siRNA was detectable in most cells and the occasional z-slice revealed some Cy5-labeled plasmid DNA in the nucleus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b>E</figref>). Using a mix of fluorescently labeled plasmid DNA and unlabeled plasmid DNA encoding a fluorescent reporter protein GFP, we were also able to detect a fraction of the cells expressing GFP at 24 h post-transfection, which was undetectable in cells at 3 h post-treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b></figref>). Studies have shown that polymers optimized for DNA delivery may not be optimal for siRNA and vice versa.45 This may be due to the differences in size and charge density between DNA and siRNA as well as their intracellular sites of action. Bishop et al. approached this problem with a polymercoated gold nanoparticle system where siRNA and DNA were adsorbed onto the nanoparticle using different polymers in a layer-by-layer synthesis scheme; the optimal formulation in this study resulted in 34% knockdown and 14% transfection in human brain cancer cells.46 Another study using poly(L-lysine) polyplexes for codelivery of siRNA and DNA to HEK-293T cells showed &#x3e;80% knockdown but achieved &#x3c;10% DNA transfection.47 The delivery system reported herein achieved significantly higher codelivery in both HEK-293T cells and harder-to-transfect Huh7 human liver cancer cells. These polymers are easy to formulate into nanoparticles via selfassembly in a single step and enabled more efficient codelivery of both DNA and siRNA compared to several leading commercially available nonviral transfection reagents (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0649" num="0651">We further compared the DNA-siRNA codelivery efficacy of the system presented herein with that of using nanoparticle formulations previously optimized for the delivery of each nucleic acid separately (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b></figref>). In the latter strategy, plasmid DNA was encapsulated using polymer 446 at 60 w/w (previously optimized for DNA delivery-1) and siRNA was encapsulated using polymer R646 at 120 w/w (previously optimized for siRNA delivery-0). The two nanoparticles were formulated separately and added to cells after nanoparticle formation. In the single nanoparticle strategy, the same amount of nucleic acids was premixed and coencapsulated in R6,7,8_64 nanoparticles (10 w/w). Our results show that using the dual nanoparticle delivery strategy, siRNA knockdown levels were significantly lower than that achieved by the single nanoparticle codelivery strategy while DNA transfection levels were similar. Furthermore, when polymers 446 and R646 were used to formulate nanoparticles at 10 w/w for direct comparison with polymer R6,7,8_64, both siRNA and DNA delivery levels were significantly lower. These results indicate that coencapsulation of multiple nucleic acid cargo types in the same nanoparticle system has the advantages of higher transfection efficiency as well as greater simplicity in formulation; this is especially important for potential clinical translation as it could greatly simplify the synthesis and regulatory approval processes.</p><p id="p-0650" num="0000">7.4.5. Codelivery of Cas9 DNA and sgRNA for CRISPRMediated Gene Editing. Next, we coencapsulated Cas9 plasmid DNA and sgRNA targeting GFP in our nanoparticles for intracellular delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system within one biodegradable nanoparticle. Gene knockout, which can be assessed by a decrease in GFP fluorescence, is contingent upon codelivery of both components as the Cas9 endonuclease must assemble with sgRNA to form a functional ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. This is a rigorous test of codelivery as the two components must be present in the same cell as well as remain bioactive at the same time in order for editing to occur. Our results showed that R6,7,8_64 nanoparticles enabled 40% gene knockout in HEK-293T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b>A</figref>). Delivery of either component alone did not result in appreciable levels of knockout, confirming the need for codelivery. The optimal sgRNA-Cas9 plasmid molar ratio was 33. Interestingly, we saw a distinct GFP-negative population (GFP null) in CRISPR-treated cells, which was not observed in cells treated with GFP siRNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b>B</figref>). siRNA-mediated gene silencing downshifted the GFP fluorescence of the entire population of treated cells, whereas CRISPR-mediated knockout completely turned off GFP in a fraction of cells. Kinetic studies showed that siRNA-mediated gene silencing faded rapidly and fluorescence returned to pretreatment levels after 11 days (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b>C</figref>). In contrast, CRISPR-mediated silencing peaked after 5 days and remained constant for the entirety of the period tested. Our results suggest that gene silencing mediated by siRNA knockdown or CRISPR knockout could be suitable for different therapeutic goals. The former has a faster onset and results in significant but transient downregulation in the entire population of treated cells. The latter takes longer to reach peak levels but can produce a sustained and binary downregulation in a smaller fraction of the population. It is important to note that all transfection experiments so far have been performed in serum-free medium. It has been widely reported that the presence of serum may decrease transfection efficacy by inducing polyplex disruption and aggregation.50 On the contrary, some studies have also demonstrated that the presence of serum proteins may prevent disassembly of nanocomplexes.51 To investigate the performance of our nanoparticle system in serum conditions, R6,7,8_64 nanoparticles (10 w/w) were formulated with siRNA or Cas9 DNA and sgRNA and administered to cells in complete medium (10% serum). The presence of serum significantly reduced transfection efficacy in both cases (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>70</b></figref>). However, when NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>was added to the nanoparticle formulation to increase nanoparticle pH prior to addition to the cells, transfection in both cases increased back to similar levels as in serum-free conditions. The addition of anionic compounds to nanoparticles to increase transfection in serum conditions has been utilized in other delivery systems52 and is a viable strategy to stabilize polymeric polyplexes.</p><heading id="h-0039" level="1">7.5. SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0651" num="0652">We synthesized a new series of reducible branched ester-amine quadpolymers (rBEAQs) that enabled codelivery of plasmid DNA and RNA oligonucleotides in the same biodegradable self-assembled nanoparticle system. Our best formulation achieved 77% DNA transfection and 66% siRNA-mediated knockdown in HEK-293T cells and 37% transfection and 53% knockdown in Huh7 cells. More importantly, codelivery of Cas9 DNA and sgRNA in the same nonviral nanoparticles enabled 40% CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout. To our knowledge, this is the first time that CRISPR-mediated gene editing has been achieved through the codelivery of Cas9 plasmid and sgRNA. The effective codelivery of plasmid DNA and RNA oligonucleotides reported here, as well as the ability to leverage bioreducibility, hydrophobicity, and polymer branching to enable effective codelivery in different cell types, may prove useful for applications such as novel combinatorial gene therapies and genome editing.</p><p id="p-0652" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00022" num="00022"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 7-S1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Backbone B monomer composition for R6,8-</entry></row><row><entry>4-6 and R6,7,8-4-6 polymer series.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="119pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Polymer</entry><entry>Monomer Molar Ratios</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Name</entry><entry>BR6</entry><entry>B7</entry><entry>B8</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>R6,8-4-6</entry><entry>R6,8_0</entry><entry>100%&#x2002;</entry><entry>0%</entry><entry>&#x2002;0%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>R6,8_20</entry><entry>80%</entry><entry>0%</entry><entry>20%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>R6,8_40</entry><entry>60%</entry><entry>0%</entry><entry>40%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>R6,8_60</entry><entry>40%</entry><entry>0%</entry><entry>60%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>R6,8_80</entry><entry>20%</entry><entry>0%</entry><entry>80%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>R6,7,8-4-6</entry><entry>R6,7,8_16</entry><entry>64%</entry><entry>16%&#x2002;</entry><entry>20%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(20% B8)</entry><entry>R6,7,8_40</entry><entry>40%</entry><entry>40%&#x2002;</entry><entry>20%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>R6,7-8_64</entry><entry>16%</entry><entry>64%&#x2002;</entry><entry>20%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0653" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00023" num="00023"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE&#x2003;7-S2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>DNA&#x2003;sequence&#x2003;for&#x2003;sgRNA&#x2003;in&#x2003;vitro</entry></row><row><entry>transcription&#x2003;template.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Sequence</entry><entry>Notes</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry><b>GTTTTTTT</b><img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" he="2.46mm" wi="25.74mm" file="US20230002790A1-20230105-P00002.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> </entry><entry>T7&#x2003;promoter</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>ggagcgcaccatcttcttcagttt</entry><entry>sequence</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>tagagctagaaatagcaagttaaa</entry><entry>GFP&#x2003;target</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>aataaaaggctagtccgttatca</entry><entry>sequence</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>acttgaaaaagtggcaccgagtc</entry><entry>sgRNA&#x2003;scaffold</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>ggtgcttttttt</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0040" level="1">7.6 REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0654" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0653">(1) Bhise, N.

In this study, we utilized biodegradable poly(beta-amino ester) nanoparticles to co-deliver plasmid DNA encoding Cas9 and sgRNA, respectively, to enable gene knockout following 1-cut edits as well as gene deletion following 2-cut edits. We designed a reporter system that allows for easy evaluation of both types of edits: gene knockout can be assessed by a decrease in iRFP fluorescence while deletion of an expression stop cassette turns on a red-enhanced nanolantern fluorescence/luminescence dual reporter. Nanoparticles enabled up to 70% gene knockout due to small indels as well as 45% gain-of-function expression after a 600-bp deletion edit. The efficiency of 2-cut edits is more sensitive than 1-cut edits to Cas9 and sgRNA expression level, which is best predicted by the geometric mean fluorescence of a reporter gene when performing nanoparticle transfection screens. Our findings demonstrate promising biodegradable nanoparticle formulations for gene editing as well as provide new insights into the screening and transfection requirements for different types of gene edits and are applicable for designing varied non-viral delivery systems for the CRISPR/Cas9 platform.</p><heading id="h-0044" level="1">8.2 BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0656" num="0709">The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system consists of a short guide RNA (sgRNA) conferring target sequence specificity which complexes with the Cas9 endonuclease to enable site-specific DNA cleavage.<sup>1-3 </sup>This could result in gene knockout following non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or, in the presence of a repair template, gene knock-in through homology-directed repair (HDR). Targeting sgRNAs to two sites flanking a genomic region of interest can result in the complete removal of the gene segment following NHEJ, which could be important in the silencing of genetic elements with no open reading frames such as microRNAs or long noncoding RNAs.<sup>4-5 </sup>CRISPR-mediated gene editing is contingent upon nuclear colocalization of both the Cas9 protein and sgRNA, and efficient intracellular delivery of CRISPR components remains a challenge.</p><p id="p-0657" num="0710">Viral vectors have been demonstrated to be effective for delivery but are more challenging to produce for both pre-clinical and clinical studies and restricted in cargo size. This is problematic as the Cas9 gene is over 4 kb long, and delivery using AAVs (packaging capacity &#x2dc;4.7 kb) sometimes require that different CRISPR components be packaged in separate viral particles, introducing complexity and potentially reducing efficacy.<sup>6-7 </sup>Synthetic vectors are largely agnostic to cargo size, and several recent reports have demonstrated strategies for non-viral intracellular delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform. These include nanoparticle delivery of Cas9 and sgRNA as a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex<sup>8-12 </sup>or in the form of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA.<sup>13-14 </sup>Cas9 and sgRNA encoded in plasmid DNA is another delivery format for CRISPR gene editing. Plasmid DNA can be easily constructed using standard molecular cloning techniques to include different Cas9 structures,<sup>15-16 </sup>multiplex sgRNA,<sup>17 </sup>and transcriptional targeting elements for cell type-specific editing.<sup>18 </sup>Furthermore, large libraries of biomaterials previously used for plasmid DNA delivery can be screened for CRISPR gene editing in a high-throughput manner<sup>19 </sup>to yield optimal formulations for gene editing in different applications.</p><p id="p-0658" num="0711">Although several studies have reported strategies for non-viral CRISPR plasmid delivery,<sup>18, 20-23 </sup>most involve gene knockout applications using sgRNA designed to enable cleavage at a single site, and none to our knowledge have investigated the transfection requirements for gene deletion after cleavage at multiple sites. In this study, we designed a novel reporter system for easy detection of gene knockout following CRISPR-mediated cleavage at one genomic site (1-cut edit) as well as gene deletion following DNA cleavage at two sites flanking a region of interest (2-cut edit). We used poly(beta-amino ester)s (PBAEs), a class of biodegradable cationic polymers that has been shown to be effective at plasmid DNA delivery,<sup>24 </sup>for intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA encoding both the Cas9 endonuclease and sgRNA, respectively, and demonstrate that these polymeric nanoparticles enable efficient 1-cut as well as 2-cut edits. Moreover, we systematically varied transfection parameters to probe the relationship between the expression of CRISPR components and the subsequent efficacy of different types of CRISPR-mediated edits. A non-viral nanoparticle formulation for safe and effective gene-editing containing only a cationic polymer and plasmid DNA is presented, without the need for co-encapsulation of protein or RNA. Further, our results provide important insights on the threshold gene expression levels required for 1- and 2-cut edits in easy-to-transfect as well as hard-to-transfect cell lines.</p><heading id="h-0045" level="1">8.3 RESULTS</heading><heading id="h-0046" level="2">8.3.1 Polymeric Nanoparticles for Gene Delivery</heading><p id="p-0659" num="0712">Polymer 446, which has been shown previously to be effective at plasmid DNA delivery to a variety of cells,<sup>25-26 </sup>was used to transfect HEK-293T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b>A</figref>). The newly developed branched polymer 7,8-4-J11 enabled higher transfection efficacy in B16-F10 murine melanoma cells<sup>27 </sup>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b></figref>) and was used to transfect these cells. Both polymers formed nanoparticles 100-200 nm in diameter with positive zeta potentials (12-25 mV) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b>B</figref>). Transfection efficacy as assessed with a GFP reporter plasmid showed that &#x3e;80% cells were transfected in both cell lines (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b>C</figref>).

Successful gene knockout was assessed by a decrease in GFP fluorescence. Nanoparticles co-delivering both plasmids enabled co-expression, generating 70% gene knockout, while formulations delivering either component alone had negligible effects (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). A kinetic study revealed that gene knockout reached maximal levels on day 3 and was maintained for over 3 weeks (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). The Surveyor&#xae; mutation detection assay was performed on cells treated with the combination nanoparticles or each component alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) and confirmed that edits occurred only when both CRISPR components were delivered. Sanger sequencing revealed that most edits were single base-pair indels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>), which likely caused frameshift mutations and subsequent gene silencing.</p><p id="p-0661" num="0000">8.3.3 Gain-of-Function Edits after 2-Cut Stop Cassette Deletion</p><p id="p-0662" num="0714">We designed a reporter system based on the Ai9 mouse<sup>28 </sup>in which an expression stop cassette consisting of two SV40 terminators in series was placed upstream of a red-enhanced nanolantern (ReNL) fluorescence-luminescence dual reporter<sup>29 </sup>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). This expression cassette was cloned into a piggyBac transposon plasmid to facilitate genomic integration at high efficiency after co-transfection with a piggyBac transposase plasmid.<sup>3</sup>% near-infrared fluorescent protein (iRFP670)<sup>31 </sup>was also incorporated into the system as a selection marker for positively-expressing cells during fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Thus, this system can be easily used to generate stably-expressing reporter cell lines for rapid read-out of knockout as well as deletion mutations.</p><p id="p-0663" num="0715">A sgRNA targeted to remove both SV40 sequences (sg1) via a 630 bp deletion resulted in turning on of ReNL expression while sgRNAs removing either SV40 sequence alone (sg2 or sg3) yielded negligible expression. A plasmid containing both sg2 and sg3 sequences governed by two U6 promoters (sg2+sg3) also resulted in turning on of expression, although at slightly lower levels than sg1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). Genomic DNA of cells treated with each sgRNA was PCR amplified for the 800 bp region immediately surrounding the stop cassette. Gel electrophoresis of the PCR products confirmed that turning on expression required the complete removal of both SV40 terminator sequences (&#x3e;400 bp removed). Interestingly for cells treated with the combination sg2+sg3 plasmid, a faint band around 500 bp was observed, indicating that only one SV40 sequence was deleted in a fraction of edits. This suggests that the lower level of gene deletion achieved by the combination sgRNA plasmid was due to cases of single SV40 removal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0664" num="0716">RT-qPCR of cells transfected with combination Cas9 and sg1 plasmids revealed that Cas9 mRNA levels stayed relatively constant throughout all time points evaluated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b>A</figref>). Western blots over the same time course showed that Cas9 protein levels steadily accumulated after transfection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b>B</figref>). sgRNA levels plateaued after 48 hours (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b>C</figref>), and the same trend was observed in ReNL mRNA levels after stop cassette removal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b>D</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0048" level="2">8.3.4 Expression Thresholds for 1-Cut and 2-Cut Edits</heading><p id="p-0665" num="0717">In order to assess the expression levels necessary to achieve 1-cut knockout edits and 2-cut gain-of-function edits, respectively, we varied the dosage of plasmid DNA delivered in nanoparticles. A GFP reporter was used to gauge transfection levels, and results showed that lowering the total DNA dose from 600 to 300 ng did not change the percentage of cells positively expressing GFP, but the geometric mean of fluorescence decreased by nearly 50% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b>A</figref>). This effect can be observed in flow cytometry histograms as the 300 ng treatment yielded a larger population of cells with low GFP fluorescence compared to the 600 ng treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b>D</figref>, left panel). Lowering total DNA dose significantly decreased levels of 2-cut deletion edits (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b>B</figref>) but did not significantly change the levels of 1-cut knockout edits (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0666" num="0718">We varied the total DNA dose delivered over a wider range in order to more thoroughly probe the effect of transfection efficacy on gene editing levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b>A</figref>). Plotting percent editing as a function of GFP geometric mean fluorescence revealed a logarithmic relationship for 1 cut edits (R<sup>2</sup>=0.8771) and a linear relationship for 2-cut edits (R<sup>2</sup>=0.9366). Transfection levels were further varied by manipulating cellular metabolic rates through incubation temperature variation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b>B</figref>). Cells were transfected using the same nanoparticle formulation delivering the same DNA dose, after which they were either incubated at standard 37&#xb0; C. or treated with a transient &#x201c;cold shock&#x201d; via incubation at 30&#xb0; C. Transfection efficacy, as measured by GFP geometric mean fluorescence, increased significantly in cold-shocked cells; the same trend was observed for the level of 2-cut edits. Interestingly, cold shock treatment did not significantly change the level of 1-cut editing efficiency, which is consistent with the results from dose titration experiments.</p><p id="p-0667" num="0719">1-cut knockout of iRFP expression and 2-cut gain-of-function edits were also performed on B16-F10 murine melanoma cells, which achieved lower levels of transfection compared to 293T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b></figref>). The lower geometric mean of GFP expression was reflected most notably in the results for 2-cut editing, where the ReNL fluorescence observed in B16 cells was 1 order of magnitude lower than 293T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b>C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b>D</figref>). Interestingly, the effect of lower transfection efficacy was less pronounced for 1-cut iRFP knockout experiments. Although lower knockout levels were observed in B16 compared to 293T cells, the difference was much smaller (12% for B16 and 33% for 293T). This validates results seen earlier with dose titration as well as temperature modulation experiments and confirms our hypothesis that single-cut knockout edits require a lower expression threshold compared to double-cut edits. On the mRNA level, both Cas9 and sgRNA expression levels were an order of magnitude higher in 293T cells compared to B16 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>77</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0668" num="0720">Standard transfection reagents were also used to assess 2-cut editing efficiency. For both cell lines, the commercially available cationic polymer transfection reagent jetPrime&#xae; resulted in significantly lower editing levels than PBAE nanoparticles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>79</b></figref>). The commercially available cationic lipid transfection reagent Lipofectamine&#x2122; 3000 enabled significantly higher editing than earlier generation linear PBAE polymer 446 in 293T cells but did not achieve significantly higher levels of editing than the newly developed next-generation branched PBAE polymer 7,8-4-J11 in harder-to-transfect B16 cells. Notably, Lipofectamine&#x2122; 3000 caused significantly higher levels of cytotoxicity than both PBAE nanoparticle formulations, further demonstrating the advantage of using a biodegradable gene delivery system.</p><p id="p-0669" num="0000">8.3.5 A Multiplex tRNA-gRNA Expression System</p><p id="p-0670" num="0721">To facilitate a simpler method for multiplex CRISPR editing, we designed a tRNA-gRNA expression system<sup>17 </sup>which utilizes the cell's endogenous tRNA processing machinery to generate multiple sgRNAs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>A</figref>). Using a simple Golden Gate assembly strategy, we created a plasmid in which the targeting sequences and gRNA scaffolds of sg2 and sg3 are arrayed in tandem with pre-tRNA, with all components governed by a single U6 promoter. Mature sgRNA is released after processing of the primary RNA transcript by tRNA-processing RNases. When transfected into cells alongside the Cas9 plasmid, this tRNA-gRNA plasmid enabled similar levels of 2-cut editing as the plasmid in which a U6 promoter governed each sgRNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>B</figref>). This demonstrates that the multiplex tRNA-gRNA expression system effectively expressed both sgRNAs required for 2-cut editing.</p><heading id="h-0049" level="2">8.4 Discussion</heading><p id="p-0671" num="0722">In this work, we demonstrated that both linear and branched PBAE nanoparticles co-delivering two DNA plasmids encoding Cas9 and sgRNA, respectively, can achieve efficient gene editing in both 1-cut knockout as well as 2-cut gene deletion applications. We created a novel reporter system that can be used to assess both types of edits: an iRFP fluorescent reporter can be silenced by indels after 1-cut edits while an expression stop cassette upstream of a ReNL reporter can be deleted using 2-cut edits for gain-of-function ReNL expression. This expression cassette was cloned into a piggyBac transposon system and can be used to generate stably-expressing cell lines to investigate gene editing efficacy in vitro, eliminating the need to culture primary cells from the Ai9 mouse,<sup>32 </sup>on which our reporter system is based. This system further has the potential to be used as an in vivo reporter for live-animal imaging studies of effective 2-cut gain-of-function ReNL expression using the red-shifted luminescent properties of ReNL. Using two cell lines stably expressing this construct&#x2014;easy-to-transfect HEK-293T and hard-to-transfect B16-F10&#x2014;we further investigated the transfection requirements for each type of gene editing.</p><p id="p-0672" num="0723">Several recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using polymeric nanoparticles, including a different PBAE formulation,<sup>33 </sup>to deliver CRISPR gene editing components in the form of plasmid DNA.<sup>18, 20-22 </sup>All of these systems have exclusively investigated the use of 1-cut editing to achieve gene knockout, and none have presented a systematic study of the expression levels required for 1-cut and 2-cut edits. The removal of a gene segment requires sgRNA to target two sites flanking the region of interest and is significantly more difficult than 1-cut knockout edits.<sup>5 </sup>To date, only 3 studies have reported the use of non-viral delivery vectors for 2-cut gene deletion by delivering Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA<sup>14 </sup>or RNP complexes<sup>11,32</sup>, but plasmid delivery with polymeric nanoparticles to achieve this type of deletion has not been previously reported. The use of DNA plasmids to encode Cas9 overcomes the manufacturing challenges of producing large scales of Cas9 mRNA or Cas9 protein, but the intracellular delivery and expression of exogenous DNA can be more challenging than the delivery of its downstream products.</p><p id="p-0673" num="0724">We evaluated two types of PBAE nanoparticles to encapsulate Cas9 and sgRNA plasmids for intracellular delivery of gene editing complexes. One of these was the well-published linear PBAE polymer 446 that has shown efficacy in multiple cell types and one was a newly developed branched PBAE polymer 7,8-4-J11, and both were found to be useful for developing efficacious biodegradable nanoparticles for gene editing. The cationic polymer and anionic DNA self-assembled into nanoparticles 100-200 nm in diameter with positive zeta potentials (12-25 mV) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b></figref>). Previous reports have shown that high levels of co-delivery can be achieved by pre-mixing plasmids prior to nanoparticle assembly.<sup>34 </sup></p><p id="p-0674" num="0725">Using this strategy, we showed successful co-delivery of CRISPR plasmids that enabled robust 1-cut gene knockout (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). More importantly, we demonstrated a versatile gene deletion platform in which a single sgRNA targeting sites flanking the region of interest or a combination of sgRNAs targeting sites throughout the region of interest both resulted in successful removal of the entire gene segment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Successful deletion of up to 630 bp could be easily visualized through the gain-of-function expression of a ReNL fluorescence/luminescence dual reporter.</p><p id="p-0675" num="0726">Evaluation of the expression kinetics of Cas9 and sgRNA revealed that Cas9 mRNA maintained at high levels throughout the time period tested (4.5-48 hr), while sgRNA expression reached peak levels at 48 hr (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b></figref>). Actual Cas9 protein levels reached high levels after 20 hr and accumulated steadily, which is consistent with previous reports using lipid transfection reagents for Cas9 plasmid delivery,<sup>35 </sup>and the resulting gain of ReNL expression peaked at 48 hr.</p><p id="p-0676" num="0727">We further explored the transfection requirements for 1-cut and 2-cut edits by titrating the total DNA dose delivered. Interestingly, decreasing total DNA dose from 600 ng to 300 ng significantly decreased the level of 2-cut editing but did not affect the level of 1-cut edits (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b></figref>). In fact, the EC50 DNA dose for 2-cut edits (238 ng) was comparable to that of the eGFP transfection control (258 ng) but significantly higher than that of 1-cut edits (166 ng), suggesting that the efficiency of 2-cut edits depended more heavily on transfection levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>80</b></figref>). The same trend was observed when transfection efficiency was varied by treating transfected cells with a minor &#x201c;cold shock&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b></figref>). Indeed, a brief cold shock slowed the rate of cellular division, which enhances protein accumulation in expressing cells and decreases the rate of plasmid DNA dilution in the cell population. This increased transfection efficiency and the level of 2-cut edits, which is consistent with previous reports using cold shock treatment to enhance the editing efficiency of ZFN-mediated gene disruption<sup>36 </sup>or CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair.<sup>37 </sup>In contrast, cold shock treatment did not significantly change the efficiency of 1-cut edits. Recent studies on the enzyme kinetics of sgRNA-Cas9 RNPs have reported that while Cas9-sgRNA binding (k=6.1 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), target DNA binding (t<sub>1/2</sub>=4-40 s), and DNA cleavage events (k=25-90 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) happen very quickly,<sup>38 </sup>the release of DNA cleavage products is extremely slow (t<sub>1/2</sub>=43-91 h),<sup>39 </sup>causing Cas9 to be virtually a single turnover enzyme. Taken together with these results, our data suggest that 2-cut edits have a much higher expression threshold than 1-cut edits because twice the number of DNA cleavage events, and hence twice the number of RNP complexes, are required for successful edits to occur.</p><p id="p-0677" num="0728">The expression thresholds of single-cut and double-cut edits have important implications on gene editing in different cell types. To demonstrate this, we compared the gene editing efficiency in easier-to-transfect HEK-293T and harder-to-transfect B16-F10 cells. Although the top nanoparticle formulation for each cell line achieved &#x3e;80% transfection as assessed by percentage of total cells transfected, the level of expression, as assessed by the normalized geometric mean of expression of a GFP reporter, was 1 order of magnitude higher for 293T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). This discrepancy was reflected in the level of 2-cut edits as B16 cells showed very minimal levels of ReNL expression after stop cassette deletion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b></figref>). In contrast, the difference in editing efficiency between the two cell lines was much smaller for 1-cut iRFP knockout (&#x3c;3-fold difference compared to nearly 44-fold difference for 2-cut edits). These results further validate our hypothesis that the efficiency of 2-cut edits correlates more strongly with the level of DNA expression.</p><p id="p-0678" num="0729">Finally, we designed and implemented a tRNA-gRNA plasmid in which the expression of multiplex sgRNAs is governed under a single U6 promoter. The expression of two sgRNAs required for turning on of ReNL fluorescence in these tRNA-gRNA tandem repeats enabled similar levels of editing compared to that of a plasmid in which each sgRNA is governed by its own U6 promoter (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b></figref>). This expression system has the advantage of ease of synthesis as upwards of 6 sgRNAs can be arranged in tandem using a single Golden Gate assembly reaction.<sup>17 </sup>More importantly, the tRNA-gRNA system reduces the need for repeating U6 promoters, enabling the use of a much smaller plasmid construct especially at high numbers of sgRNAs. Originally developed for use in rice plants,<sup>17 </sup>this system has also been adapted for use in yeast<sup>40 </sup>and zebrafish.<sup>41 </sup>To our knowledge, this is the first time it has been adapted for gene editing in mammalian cells.</p><p id="p-0679" num="0730">In summary, we have demonstrated that PBAE nanoparticles co-delivering plasmids encoding Cas9 and sgRNA can achieve 1-cut knockout as well as 2-cut deletion edits. We designed a novel reporter system whereby both modes of edits can be easily evaluated. 2-cut deletion events required much higher levels of transfection than 1-cut gene knockout edits, which we demonstrated by titrating the DNA dosage delivered, treating transfected cells with a transient cold shock, and comparing editing efficiencies in two cell lines with different transfection efficacy. The PBAE/DNA nanoparticles optimized here are promising for DNA-based non-viral gene editing. Further, the results presented herein have implications on the design and screening of next-generation non-viral delivery vehicles broadly for CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.</p><heading id="h-0050" level="1">8.5 MATERIALS AND METHODS</heading><heading id="h-0051" level="2">8.5.1 Materials</heading><p id="p-0680" num="0731">Small molecules used as monomers for polymer synthesis were obtained as follows: bisphenol A glycerolate (1 glycerol/phenol) diacrylate (B7; 411167), trimethylolpropane triacrylate (B8; 246808), 2-&#x3b2;-aminopropylamino)ethanol (E6; 09293), and N,N-diethyldiethylenetriamine (J11; 518832)<sup>42 </sup>were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; 1,4-butanediol diacrylate (B4; 32780) and 4-amino-1-butanol (S4; A12680) were purchased from Alfa Aesar.
