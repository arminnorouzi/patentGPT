Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to chest binders and, more particularly, to a chest binding system having enhanced comfort and wearability.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Chest binding is the process of compressing breasts for a flatter appearance and is an important contributor to the wellbeing and mental health of many transgender and non-binary people. Chest binding helps create a more masculine silhouette and reduce gender dysphoria, distress related to the misalignment between physical sex and gender identity. However, 97 percent of the users of binding systems report negative physical symptoms related to binding. The negative symptoms range from relatively minor, such as occasionally itching and back pain, to severe, such as rib fractures.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are a variety of binding methods: wearing a tight sports bra; layering sports bras or shirts; wrapping the chest in bandages, plastic wrap, or duct tape; or wearing a purpose-built binder. Bandages, plastic wrap, and duct tape are high-risk binding tools discouraged in many transgender health and popular sources. There is no regulation on binder designs and there are many areas of concern: there is no clear evidence of medical consultation in the design process; some popular binders were designed for male bodies and may fit transgender and non-binary users poorly (e.g. compression tops to disguise gynecomastia in cisgender men); and there is no known anthropometric data on transgender and intersex people available to the design community. For instance, binders developed using normative female anthropometrics may not fit female-to-male (FTM) transgender people taking testosterone hormone therapy, and long-term binding could result in changes to posture and muscle tone that would impact fit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional binding systems often involve the use of compression garments that must be stretched over the head and then the body of the user and positioned in place. These systems often fit poorly and can be difficult to put on and take off, particularly for users with physical disabilities or medical conditions. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a chest binding system that provides the desired result without any negative symptoms.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is a comfortable chest binder that includes limited stretch regions that allow for binding of breast tissue and flexible regions that enhance wearer comfort. More specifically, the binder comprises a torso formed from a flexible first layer of fabric to define an inner space for the body of a wearer. A limited stretch second layer of fabric is adhered to at least a portion of the torso proximate to any breast tissue of the wearer. A pair of straps are connected at one end to the torso and extend laterally about the torso so that the opposing ends of the straps are releasably attachable to the torso to selectively narrow or widen the inner space. The first layer is dimensioned to encompass a central abdomen area of a wearer and can also be dimensioned to encompass a pair of hips of a wearer. The second layer extends to be proximate to a lower abdomen area of a wearer. The second layer can also extend to be proximate to a pair of hips of a wearer. The chest binder may further comprise a pair of shoulder straps positioned to form a V-neck. The pair of shoulder straps may be formed from the first fabric. The first fabric may be cotton jersey, wool, bamboo, linen, elastane, or combinations thereof. The second fabric may be canvas.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING(S)</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention will be more fully understood and appreciated by reading the following Detailed Description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front view of a breast binder according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a back view of a breast binder according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front perspective view of a breast binder according to the present invention shown positioned on a user;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side view of a breast binder according to the present invention shown positioned on a user; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is rear perspective view of a breast binder according to the present invention shown positioned on a user.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to the drawings, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout, there is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>5</b></figref> a chest binder <b>10</b> according to the present invention. Binder <b>10</b> is a wearable garment having a torso <b>12</b> that forms an inner space <b>14</b> for the wearer. Torso <b>12</b> is formed by a first layer <b>16</b> of a stretch fabric, such as jersey, and second layer <b>18</b> formed by non-stretch or limited stretch fabric, such as canvas. First layer <b>16</b> may be short and just encompass the central abdomen, or longer to extend to contact or cover the hips of a wearer. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, second layer <b>18</b> is shown in phantom as it is preferably positioned on the inside of first layer <b>14</b>. In a preferred embodiment, second layer <b>18</b> is confined to a panel that extends over the portion of torso <b>12</b> that is located proximately to the breast tissue when binder <b>10</b> is worn by a user and a corresponding panel extending over the opposing side of torso, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Second layer <b>18</b> serves as a compression layer that can flatten the breast tissue of the wearer while first layer <b>16</b> provides enhanced comfort and wearability of binder <b>10</b> over the rest of binder <b>10</b>. Panels of second layer <b>18</b> can be sized and located accordingly for a particular fit or size of the wearer, and additionally located in other areas such as the lower abdomen or hips for additional sculping of the wearer. Second layer <b>18</b> may be laminated to first layer <b>14</b>, sewn together, or adhered to each other using any number of conventional methods. For the purposes of the present invention, the term &#x201c;limited stretch&#x201d; refers to fabrics or regions that have less than a 30 percent stretch, with 20 percent stretch found to be acceptable. The term &#x201c;flexible&#x201d; refers to higher stretch fabrics, such as those having 50 percent stretch or more.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As further seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a pair of opposing straps <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are positioned on either side of torso <b>12</b> and fixedly attached at one end to torso <b>12</b>. Straps <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> extend laterally about torso <b>12</b> and can be releasable attached by their opposing ends to a second location on torso <b>12</b> using conventional hook and loop type fastener pads <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> positioned on straps <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and torso <b>12</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the area between the fixed attachment point of straps <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and fastener pads <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are formed exclusively from flexible first layer <b>16</b>. Straps <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> allow the user to easily adjust binder <b>10</b> for a comfortable fit through the period when binder <b>10</b> is worn and also allow binder <b>10</b> to be more easily put on and taken off. Opposing straps <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may be one piece or include individual fingers for more targeted compression. Fastener pads <b>26</b> may be larger in area than corresponding pads <b>28</b> to provide for a larger area of adjustment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Binder <b>10</b> includes a pair of shoulder straps <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> that form a low V-neck so that binder <b>10</b> can be worn discretely under most conventional garments including sleeveless tops and V-neck shirts. Straps <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> may be formed from the same material as flexible first layer <b>16</b>. The particular size and positioning of shoulder straps <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> and shape and size of the resulting V-neck may be varied for the purposes of hiding under sleeveless tops as long as opposing straps <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> do not pinch under the arms of the wearer or compress the shoulder blades.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Binder <b>10</b> includes a pair of shoulder straps <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> that form a low V-neck so that binder <b>10</b> can be worn discretely under most conventional garments including sleeveless tops and V-neck shirts. Straps <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> may be formed from the same material as flexible first layer <b>16</b>. Binder <b>10</b> spreads pressure across the ribs, so it is more evenly distributed and removes pressure from the abdomen so that the wearer can more easily breath. Binder <b>10</b> also removes pressure from the shoulders and upper back to help avoid pain and pressure ulcers on the shoulder blades.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">First layer <b>16</b> is preferably formed from cotton jersey knits, but may also be made from other natural fabrics such as wool, bamboo, and linen that are knit for stretchiness, as well as artificial fabrics such as elastane (LYCRA&#xae; or SPANDEX&#xae;), and blends thereof. Second layer <b>18</b> is preferably formed from woven materials such as canvas, but may also be formed from natural and artificial fibers provided they are woven in such a manner to limit the amount of stretch as described above.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
