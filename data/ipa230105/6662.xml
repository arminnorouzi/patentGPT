For example, a control circuit can generate a control signal in response to a feedback signal. The feedback signal can be generated by measuring (e.g., comparing) a signal generated in response to a quantity developed at least in part in response to the control signal.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some electronic circuits, a feedback signal can be generated by amplifying a signal (e.g., amplifying a voltage difference between respective conductors of a differential signal) generated in response to a quantity that is generated in response to the control signal. The stability and accuracy of such control circuits depend on the latency (e.g., delay) of the circuitry for generating the feedback signal. Generally, lowering the power consumption of the circuitry for generating the feedback signal can increase delay times and/or decrease the accuracy of the feedback signal.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In contrast, increasing the power consumption of the circuitry for generating the feedback signal can decrease delay times and/or increase the accuracy of the feedback signal. However, increasing the power consumption of the circuitry for generating the feedback signal can result in decreased operating characteristics, for example increased power consumption and increased heat dissipation (e.g., which could require remedial cooling), larger components (e.g., for greater power ratings), decreased battery life (e.g., which could otherwise require greater energy storage), and/or increase the need for line power for active cooling.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some electronic systems can include amplifiers (e.g., which can include at least one transistor) that can be arranged for actively controlling a source current in response to input signal voltages. Some examples of the amplifiers can be arranged as comparators. For a given source current (e.g., for powering a comparator), comparators generally respond quickly to smaller voltage changes of the first and second input signals. Also, due to the time during which a common node settles to an appropriate (e.g., ideal) value, comparators generally respond more slowly to larger voltage changes that can be present in the first and second input signals. Increasing the source current output of a current source for powering the comparator can increase the speed and/or accuracy of the comparator. However, increasing the source current of the comparator also raises the power consumption of the comparator. Raising the power consumption of the comparator can render a comparator design as being unsuited for at least some lower power systems.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An example comparator described herein can be arranged for comparing a first input signal voltage against a second input signal voltage, and for generating an output signal (e.g., a single-ended or a complementary output signal) in response to the comparison. The example comparator can selectively increase power during some input conditions that could otherwise degrade performance (e.g., increase latency and/or decrease output accuracy).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an example comparator <b>100</b> for low-power response to input signal fluctuations. The comparator <b>100</b> includes a first stage <b>110</b>, replica input transistor pair <b>120</b>, an Aux_bias generator <b>130</b>, current switch <b>140</b>, a second stage <b>150</b>, and a third stage <b>160</b>. In at least one implementation, the comparator <b>100</b> is arranged to compare a pair of differential input signals and to selectively add current to a common node of a differential amplifier when a current-starved condition of the common node is detected.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first stage <b>110</b> is an amplifier having an input transistor pair <b>112</b> and a current mirror <b>115</b>. The input transistor pair can comprise PMOS (P-type metal-oxide-semiconductor) transistors such as transistors Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>, where the transistors Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> include a common node (e.g., common source node <b>114</b>) coupled to at least a first current source I<b>1</b>. In other examples, transistors Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are different types of transistors. The current mirror includes NMOS (N-type metal-oxide-semiconductor) transistors Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b>, and resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> (e.g., for generating the Replica_load_CG signal for biasing the common gates of Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b>). The drains of Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b> are respectively coupled to the drains of Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>. The resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> (e.g., arranged as a voltage divider) are coupled in series between the respective drains of Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b> (e.g., where the drains are coupled as first and second inputs of a current mirror that includes Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b>). In other examples, transistors Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b> are different types of transistors. A central node <b>113</b> (e.g., divided voltage node) between the resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> is coupled to bias respective control terminals (e.g., to commonly bias the gates) of Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first stage <b>110</b> is a differential amplifier coupled to differentially receive input signals, such as a positive input signal (INP) and a negative input signal (INM). The signal INP and the signal INM respectively control currents flowing through Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>. As described hereinbelow, the voltage of the common source node <b>114</b> is developed in response to the current sourced by a first current source (e.g., current source I<b>1</b>), and in response the currents selectively controlled by transistors Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>. In some conditions (e.g., resulting from voltage changes of the input signals), a current-starved condition of the common source node <b>114</b> can develop, so that the voltage rise of the common node can be delayed and/or result in erroneous output of the comparator <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The replica input transistor pair <b>120</b> is a replica circuit of the input transistor pair <b>112</b>. For example, the replica input transistor pair <b>120</b> includes PMOS transistors Q<b>5</b> and Q<b>6</b>, which can be the same size or otherwise scaled to determine (e.g., detect, imitate, emulate, and/or simulate) a performance (e.g., at least one operational characteristic of Q<b>1</b> and/or Q<b>2</b>) of the input transistor pair <b>112</b>. The source nodes of Q<b>5</b> and Q<b>6</b> are coupled to the common source node <b>114</b>, and the gates of Q<b>4</b> and Q<b>6</b> are respectively coupled to signals INP and INM. In such an arrangement, the replica input transistor pair <b>120</b> can respond to the same (or similar) contemporaneous input conditions to which the input transistor pair <b>112</b> is subjected. For example, the replica input transistor pair can detect a voltage drop of the common node, where the detected voltage drop is generated in response to a rise of an input signal (e.g., signal INP or INM).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The output of the replica input transistor pair <b>120</b> (e.g., the commonly coupled drains of Q<b>5</b> and Q<b>6</b>) is a replica signal (e.g., Replica_load) for indicating (e.g., emulating) a contemporaneous response of the input transistor pair <b>112</b>. As described hereinbelow, the replica signal can be coupled along a feedback path to generate a feedback signal (e.g., Aux_bias) for controlling the herein-described selective addition of current to the common source node <b>114</b> via the current switch <b>140</b>. During a current-starved condition, for example, the output current (e.g., tail current) of the replica input transistor pair <b>120</b> is decreased, which indicates the current-starved condition. In response to the decrease of the tail current of the replica input transistor pair <b>120</b>, the Aux_bias feedback signal is asserted, so that current flowing through the drain of Q<b>7</b> contributes supplemental charge to the common source node <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The Aux_bias generator <b>130</b> is coupled to receive the output of the replica input transistor pair <b>120</b>. The Aux_bias generator <b>130</b> includes a current source <b>12</b>, an NMOS transistor Q<b>8</b>, and an NMOS transistor Q<b>9</b>. The transistor Q<b>8</b> is biased by a normalized cascode (ncas) control signal and Q<b>9</b> is biased by a normalized bias (nbias) control signal. The respective control signal voltages are selected, so that the Aux_bias generator <b>130</b> asserts the Aux_bias signal in response to a decrease in the current of the Replica_load signal (and de-asserts the Aux_bias signal when the Replica_load signal indicates the current-starved condition of the common source node <b>114</b> has been reduced).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the signal Replica_load indicates a current-starved condition of the common source node <b>114</b>, less current is added to the current flowing through the drain of Q<b>9</b> (where the current otherwise flowing through Q<b>9</b> is coupled from <b>12</b> via Q<b>8</b>). In response to less current being added to the current flowing through Q<b>9</b>, the voltage (e.g., of node Aux_bias) of the source of Q<b>8</b> falls, so that PMOS transistor Q<b>7</b> is turned on.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The current switch <b>140</b> includes Q<b>7</b> and the resistor R<b>3</b>. Resistor R<b>3</b> is a current source for coupling a limited current to be selectively coupled through Q<b>7</b> into the common source node <b>114</b>. The node Aux_bias is coupled to the control terminal (e.g., gate) of Q<b>7</b>. The transistor Q<b>7</b> is arranged to selectively apply current to the common source node <b>114</b> in response to the Aux_bias voltage. In at least one example, the current source I<b>1</b> is first current source, the current source R<b>3</b> (e.g., which is coupled to VDD power rail) is a second current source, and the first and second current sources are coupled in parallel between a power rail and the common node.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The second stage <b>150</b> is a second stage amplifier that includes PMOS transistors Q<b>10</b> and Q<b>11</b> and NMOS transistors Q<b>12</b> and Q<b>13</b>. The second stage amplifier is coupled to convert a differential input received from the first stage amplifier to single-ended output of the second stage amplifier. The transistor Q<b>10</b> is a master transistor and the transistor Q<b>11</b> is a slave transistor. The master and slave transistors are arranged as a current mirror for generating a second stage output signal in response to a first stage output signal (e.g., first stage output signals that are differential). For example, the current mirror (Q<b>10</b> and Q<b>11</b>) transistors are biased in response to the first stage output-minus signal (1st_stage_out_minus signal), while the second stage output signal (2nd_stage_output signal) is developed in response to the 1st_stage_out_plus signal and in response to the current supplied by Q<b>11</b>. The second stage <b>150</b> can be arranged as a differential input to single-ended output converter. In another example (not shown), the second stage <b>150</b> can be arranged having a differential output, so that the comparator <b>100</b> can be arranged having a differential output.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The third stage <b>160</b> is an amplifier (e.g., buffer and/or output stage) arranged to quantize the second stage output (e.g., an analog signal, 2nd_stage_output), and to output a signal (e.g., digital signal) for indicating the result of the comparison of the pair of differential input signals. For example, the third stage can include an odd number of inverters for buffering and inverting the second stage output to generate the output signal as a comparator output (Comp_Out).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In examples described herein, a low-power response comparator includes an input transistor pair (e.g., input transistor pair <b>112</b>) arranged for receiving first and second input signals (e.g., voltages that can vary over time). The input transistor pair can include a first transistor (e.g., Q<b>1</b>) and a second transistor (e.g., Q<b>2</b>). A first current terminal (e.g., source or drain) of the first transistor is coupled to a first current terminal of the second transistor and to a common node (e.g., common source node <b>114</b>). A control terminal (e.g., gate) of the first transistor is coupled to the first input signal, and a control terminal of the second transistor is coupled to the second input signal.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A first current source (e.g., always-on current source I<b>1</b>) includes a current output coupled to the common node, so that (for example) the first current source provides a first current coupled through the common node to the respective current terminals of the first and second transistors.

The replica circuit can include a replica input transistor pair that is coupled to receive a current from the common node that sources a current to the input transistor pair. The replica input transistor pair need not be instantiated (e.g., physically manufactured) using the same exact design features of each transistor of the input transistor pair; for example, the transistors of the replica input pair can be scaled, so that the replica circuit can emulate a scaled response of the input transistor pair.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">An example replica input transistor pair can include a third and a fourth transistor.

The combined current is an indication (e.g., the Replica_load signal) of the determined performance and is coupled to the feedback signal node for generating a feedback signal (e.g., the Aux_bias signal) for controlling a current switch (e.g., current switch <b>140</b>).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The current switch includes a first current terminal coupled to a power rail, a second current terminal coupled to the common source node, and a control terminal coupled to the feedback signal node.

A bias generator (e.g., Aux_bias generator <b>130</b>) can generate a feedback signal (e.g., bias signal) in response to the indication of the determined performance. The feedback signal controls (e.g., activates and/or regulates) the current switch (e.g., a boost current source such as current switch <b>140</b>). For example, the bias generator is arranged to assert the bias signal to activate the current switch in response to a decrease in current of the indication received from the feedback signal node.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Accordingly, a feedback loop exists, so that (for example) the current switch regulates (e.g., selectively provides in response to the feedback signal node) the coupling of a second current (e.g., augmentation current) to the common node. The feedback signals can include signals developed in the associated feedback path, such as the control signal for selectively controlling the current switch.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The current switch can be coupled to generate (e.g., amplify and/or inject) a controlled boost current for dynamically augmenting the source current for powering the input transistor pair. The source current for powering the input transistor pair can be selectively applied by controlling the addition of a boost current (e.g., as regulated by the current switch) to the common source node of the input transistor pair. Selectively augmenting the source current for powering the input transistor pair can save power that would otherwise be expended by providing, for example, a fixed magnitude source current (e.g., of the first current source) to avoid a current-starved response of the common source node of the input transistor pair.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The augmented source current is coupled to the first and second current terminals of the input transistor pair.

In the example configuration, the output signal (e.g., analog output signal) of the second stage can be quantized (e.g., converted to a digital value) and coupled as an output signal (e.g., as digital output) of the comparator.
