Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to, and implementations of angled fittings for sloped ceilings. Angled fittings can be used where piping may be angled relative to a floor, such as due to being connected with a sloped ceiling. The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below can be implemented in any of numerous ways, including in new installations as well as retrofits of fire protection systems and sprinklers.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Fire suppression systems are utilized in buildings (e.g., residential, commercial, etc.) to suppress a fire in the event a fire occurs. The fire suppression system includes piping which directs fire suppressant (e.g., water, agent, etc.) from a source of fire suppressant to sprinklers. The sprinklers release the fire suppressant within a room to suppress the fire.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some situations, piping of a fire protection system can be at an angle relative to ground (e.g., a sloped ceiling, etc.). This may result in sprinklers connected with the piping, including the deflectors thereof, also being angled relative to ground, so that a spray pattern from the sprinkler (which may be specifically tailored to the geometry of the building or other environment in which the sprinkler is installed based on the configuration of the deflector) does not have desired characteristics in the space that the sprinkler is intended to address a fire. This can reduce the effectiveness of the fire protection and potentially not suppress a fire adequately. Installing the fire protection system may depend on certification from authorities such as FM Global or NFPA, which may establish standards regarding angles between the deflector and the floor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An adapter assembly structured to enable changing of the angle of the sprinkler relative to the piping may be incorporated within the fire suppression system. The adapter assembly may facilitate repositioning of the sprinkler to a target orientation (e.g., to be parallel to the ground; so that an axis through the sprinkler is perpendicular to the ground), which redirects the spray pattern to a target orientation for the spray pattern (e.g., so that a plane defined by the spray pattern is parallel to the ground) to increase the effectiveness of fire protection of the sprinklers. The adapter assembly can be installed in a preexisting fire suppression system (e.g., a retrofit installation, etc.) or can be installed during installation of the fire suppression system (e.g., a new installation, etc.).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, a fire suppression system may be installed in a building which has sloped ceilings relative to the ground and the piping is installed to be parallel to the ceiling. Therefore, the piping is angled relative to the ground and any sprinklers installed directly into the piping may not have a spray pattern having a desired orientation relative to the ground, such as parallel to the ground, reducing the effectiveness of the sprinklers. An adapter assembly can be coupled with the pipe and the sprinkler to rotate the sprinkler relative to the pipe at a specific angle. The specific angle can be an angle to enable the sprinkler to generate a spray pattern having a target orientation or angle relative to the ground. The adapter assembly can be locked in place once at the specific angle to prevent the angle of the sprinkler relative to the piping from changing during activation of the fire suppression system.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a fire suppression system <b>100</b> is shown. The fire suppression system <b>100</b> can be used in a building <b>10</b> (e.g., residential, commercial, school, business, etc.) to suppress a fire in the event a fire occurs. The fire suppression system <b>100</b> can direct a fire suppressant (e.g., water, agent, etc.) from a supply of fire suppressant to a specified area <b>12</b> in the building <b>10</b>. The specified area <b>12</b> may be an area with a high occurrence of fires igniting (e.g., a kitchen, etc.) or may be any other area in the building <b>10</b>. The fire suppression system <b>100</b> may activate (e.g., release the fire suppressant, etc.) in response to a signal from a user (e.g., a button, a pull box, etc.). The fire suppression system <b>100</b> may actuate in response to a signal from a detector (e.g., thermal detector, fusible link, smoke detector, etc.). The detector senses a condition (e.g., heat, CO<sub>2 </sub>levels, etc.) and automatically actuates the fire suppression system <b>100</b> when the condition reaches a predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The building <b>10</b> has a ceiling <b>14</b> which is angled at angle &#x3b8; relative to a floor <b>16</b>. Angle &#x3b8; can be any angle (e.g., acute, obtuse, etc.). The fire suppression system <b>100</b> includes a pipe system, shown as piping <b>102</b>. The piping <b>102</b> includes at least one pipe coupled with the ceiling <b>14</b>. For example, the at least one pipe of the piping <b>102</b> can be connected with the ceiling</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The piping <b>102</b> can be parallel to the ceiling <b>14</b> and at angle &#x3b8; relative to the floor <b>16</b>. The piping <b>102</b> includes the connectors <b>104</b> coupling each pipe and facilitating fluid communication between the pipes. The connectors <b>104</b> define a supply inlet <b>120</b> and the supply outlet <b>122</b>. The supply inlet <b>120</b> and the supply outlet <b>122</b> facilitate flow of fire suppressant through the connectors <b>104</b> by receiving fire suppressant from an upstream pipe of the piping <b>102</b> and directing fire suppressant to a downstream pipe of the piping <b>102</b>. Flow of fire suppressant from the supply inlet to the supply outlet define a flow path along a flow axis <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The connectors <b>104</b> also define an adapter outlet. The adapter outlet provides a second flow path out of the connector <b>104</b>, allowing fluid to flow into adapter pipe <b>110</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the second flow path can define a release axis <b>108</b>, which can be perpendicular to the flow axis <b>106</b>. The release axis <b>108</b> may be at an angle other than 90&#xb0; relative to the flow axis <b>106</b>. The angle between the release axis <b>108</b> and the flow axis <b>106</b> may be a required angle set forth by a governing agency (e.g., NFPA, etc.).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The fire suppression system <b>100</b> can include at least one adapter pipe <b>110</b>. The adapter pipe <b>110</b> defines an inlet side <b>112</b> (e.g., inlet end) and an outlet side <b>114</b> (e.g., outlet end). Each the connector <b>104</b> couples to the inlet side <b>112</b> of the adapter pipe <b>110</b>. The adapter pipe <b>110</b> may rotate relative to the flow axis <b>106</b>. The adapter pipe <b>110</b> may be rotatably coupled with the connector <b>104</b>. The adapter pipe <b>110</b> may be rotatable during installation of the fire suppression system <b>100</b> and fixedly coupled once installation has finished. The fire suppression system <b>100</b> also includes sprinklers <b>116</b>. The sprinklers <b>116</b> are coupled with the outlet side <b>114</b> of the adapter pipe <b>110</b>. The sprinklers <b>116</b> disperse fire suppressant flowing out of the adapter pipe <b>110</b> onto the specified area <b>12</b> during activation of the fire suppression system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> depict an adapter assembly <b>200</b> coupled with the piping <b>102</b>. The adapter assembly <b>200</b> includes the adapter pipe <b>110</b>, the connector <b>104</b>, and sprinkler <b>116</b>. The connector <b>104</b> is fixedly coupled with at least one pipe of the piping <b>102</b>. The connector <b>104</b> also defines the flow axis <b>106</b>, and the release axis <b>108</b>. The release axis <b>108</b> can be parallel to the floor <b>16</b> in a z direction, enabling a spray pattern outputted by the sprinkler <b>116</b> to satisfy a target orientation. The flow axis <b>106</b> can be parallel to the ceiling <b>14</b> in an x-y direction. The adapter outlet of the connector <b>104</b> is positioned on a side of the piping <b>102</b>. The outlet side <b>114</b> of the adapter pipe <b>110</b> is coupled with sprinkler <b>116</b>. The adapter pipe <b>110</b> defines a target axis <b>202</b>. The target axis <b>202</b> can be defined between the inlet side <b>112</b> and the outlet side <b>114</b>. The target axis <b>202</b> can be in a y direction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The adapter assembly <b>200</b> can include a redirection pipe <b>204</b>. The redirection pipe <b>204</b> is coupled with the adapter outlet of the connector <b>104</b> and the inlet side <b>112</b> of the adapter pipe <b>110</b>. The redirection pipe <b>204</b> can have an outlet at a different orientation than an inlet, such that an orientation of the sprinkler <b>116</b> when connected with the outlet is different than how the inlet connects with the adapter pipe <b>110</b>. For example, redirection pipe <b>204</b> can be a curved pipe which interfaces with the release axis <b>108</b> and the target axis <b>202</b>. Flow of fire suppressant through the redirection pipe <b>204</b> changes direction of flow along the release axis <b>108</b> to the target axis <b>202</b>. The redirection pipe <b>204</b> can include an attachment member on a redirection pipe inlet side. The attachment member may be a thread which interfaces with a threading on one of the connector <b>104</b> and a threaded member <b>208</b>. The threaded member <b>208</b> may rotatably couple with both the connector <b>104</b> and the redirection pipe <b>204</b>. For example, during installation of the adapter assembly <b>200</b>, the redirection pipe <b>204</b> may be rotatably coupled with the connector <b>104</b> with the threaded member <b>208</b>. The redirection pipe <b>204</b> can be rotated to an orientation such that the target axis <b>202</b> is perpendicular to the floor <b>16</b>. The threaded member <b>208</b> may include adhesive (e.g., thread glue, etc.) to fixedly couple the redirection pipe <b>204</b> and the connector <b>104</b>. Fixedly coupling the redirection pipe <b>204</b> and the connector <b>104</b> can limit rotation of the redirection pipe <b>204</b> relative to the connector <b>104</b> and maintain the target axis <b>202</b> in a y direction.

The member <b>602</b> can be at least partially annular (e.g., semi-annular), allowing the member <b>602</b> to be fit around the piping <b>102</b>. The member <b>602</b> can include at least one fastener flange <b>604</b>, which can extend around the outer surface of the piping <b>102</b> (e.g., outward from the piping <b>102</b>).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The fastener flanges <b>604</b> define at least one flange aperture <b>606</b>. The flange apertures <b>606</b> can receive a fastener <b>702</b>. The fastener <b>702</b> can be received through the flange apertures <b>606</b> to secure the fastener flanges <b>604</b> to the piping <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The member <b>602</b> can define at least one fastener aperture <b>608</b>. The fastener apertures <b>608</b> can be defined opposite of the fastener flanges <b>604</b> relative to the outer surface of the piping <b>102</b>. The fastener apertures <b>608</b> receive a fastener <b>704</b>. The locking mechanism <b>600</b> selectively couples to the piping <b>102</b> by coupling the member <b>602</b> to the outer surface of the piping <b>102</b> and inserting fasteners <b>702</b>, <b>704</b> in the flange apertures <b>606</b> and the fastener apertures <b>608</b>, which can form a pressure fit on the piping <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The locking mechanism <b>600</b> can include a body <b>610</b>. The body <b>610</b> can have a U-shape, enabling the body <b>610</b> to limit movement of a sprinkler or other piping components received in the body <b>610</b>. The body <b>610</b> extends from member <b>602</b>. The body <b>610</b> can define a pair of slots <b>612</b>. The slots <b>612</b> can be defined along a length of the body <b>610</b>. The slots <b>612</b> can receive a portion of an adapter assembly (e.g., adapter assembly <b>200</b>, adapter assembly <b>400</b>). The adapter pipe <b>110</b> may be positioned to be external to the locking mechanism <b>600</b>. The adapter pipe <b>110</b> may include a fastener for coupling to the slots <b>612</b>. Once coupled with the slots <b>612</b>, the adapter pipe <b>110</b> can be locked and unable to rotate relative to the piping <b>102</b>.

The outlet flange <b>308</b> may include a fastener that is received by the slots <b>612</b> and locks the outlet side <b>114</b> relative to the inlet side <b>112</b>.

The method <b>800</b> can be performed in any order of the following steps. The method <b>800</b> can include further steps not described in the following steps. The method <b>800</b> can omit any steps included in the following steps. The method <b>800</b> can be performed using various systems and devices described herein, such as the fire suppression system <b>100</b>, the adapter assemblies <b>200</b>, <b>400</b>, and the locking mechanism <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At <b>802</b>, a fire suppression system is installed in a (e.g., building <b>10</b>). A source of fire suppressant, such as a fluid source, is installed within the building <b>10</b>. The source of fire suppressant may be remote from a specified area in the building, or may be in proximity to a specified area in the building (e.g., an area to be protected using the fire suppression system). Piping can be coupled with the source of fire suppressant. The piping can be coupled with a ceiling of the building. The ceiling and the piping can be parallel along a length of the specified area.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At <b>804</b>, at least one adapter assembly (e.g., the adapter assembly <b>200</b>, the adapter assembly <b>400</b>) is coupled with the piping. The adapter assembly can include connectors that are coupled with the piping. The connectors may be spaced apart a predetermined distance. The predetermined distance may be set forth by the governing agency. The predetermined distance may also be calculated to cover a maximum area within the specified area. An inlet side of the adapter pipe can be coupled with an adapter outlet of the connector. For example, the inlet side can be coupled with the adapter outlet subsequent to connecting the connector with the piping. A sprinkler can be coupled with an outlet side of the adapter pipe. For example, the sprinkler can be coupled with the outlet side subsequent to connecting the adapter pipe with the connector. The sprinkler can align with a target axis (e.g., the target axis <b>202</b>, the target axis <b>304</b>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At <b>806</b>, an angle of the ceiling relative to a floor is determined. Determination of the angle can be facilitated by, for example, determining a height of the ceiling by measuring the vertical distance from the floor to a point on the ceiling furthest from ground, determining a horizontal distance between a point on the floor at which the vertical distance was measured and a particular wall at which the ceiling and a top portion of the wall connect, and determining a height of the wall. A height differential between the vertical distance and the height of the wall can be determined by subtracting the height of the wall from the vertical distance. The angle of the ceiling relative to the floor can be determined by determining an inverse tangent of the height differential divided by the horizontal distance. The angle of the ceiling relative to the floor can be determined between a plane in which the ceiling lies and a plane in which the floor lies (e.g., an angle formed at an intersection of the planes).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At <b>808</b>, the outlet side of the adapter pipe can be angled relative to the connector. Thus, the target axis defined by the adapter pipe and the sprinkler can be angled relative to the release axis. Angling the outlet side of the adapter pipe relative to the connector facilitates changing a spray pattern and/or a spray area of the sprinkler. Changing the spray pattern and/or the spray area may increase the effectiveness of sprinkler at suppressing fire within the specified area. For example, the adapter pipe can be angled relative to the connector so that the spray pattern satisfies a spray pattern condition indicating expected water flow to particular locations on the floor.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At <b>810</b>, an orientation of the adapter pipe can be fixed relative to the connector. For example, a locking mechanism may be used to lock the adapter pipe to the connector to fix the orientation of the adapter pipe relative to the connector, which can maintain the sprinkler at a target orientation for achieving the spray pattern. Fasteners can couple to a portion of the adapter pipe and to the locking mechanism to fix the adapter pipe to the connector. The locking mechanism can connect to an outer surface of the piping. Movement of the adapter pipe can be restricted relative to the piping and the connector by the locking mechanism.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Having now described some illustrative implementations, it is apparent that the foregoing is illustrative and not limiting, having been presented by way of example.
