benefit of priority of U.S. non-provisional application Ser. No. 17/249,142, filed 22 Feb. 2021, as a continuation thereof, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to online food delivery systems and, more particularly, an online end-to-end food and grocery delivery ecosystem that leverages blockchain technology to facilitate both shopping for grocery, ordering food delivery and takeout from restaurants, food trucks, and/or professional home kitchens, and reducing food waste through enabling donations to Non-Profit entities in a traceable, audible, secure, and efficient manner with end-to-end transparency of processes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Existing online food ordering and distribution systems have multiple intermediaries between the supplier and the customer. When these layers increase, it also inflates the rates of commission. Data from different sources show that this commission is as high as <b>20</b>%-<b>30</b>%. While yet the delivery teams involved often argue that they only receive the residual. It is possible to minimize costs by introducing automation and implementing algorithms powered by blockchain technology. If a blockchain solution does not power the food delivery app, it makes it a daunting challenge to hustle the whole process of recruiting a participant on the delivery team.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current database and the procurement processes for recruiting delivery workers lack rigor to, for instance, identify and vet recruits with previous criminal background history or those who fail to comply with traffic laws. Lack of blockchain solutions limits visibility of multiple transactions like tipping or commissions between online delivery systems, delivery workers and customers. On the other hand, infusing blockchain technology into a food delivery app enables prevention of food spoilage as well as providing authentic off-menu cuisines to customers with simple clicks.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As can be seen, there is a need for an online end-to-end food and grocery delivery ecosystem that leverages blockchain technology to facilitate both shopping for food, ordering food for delivery, and enabling donations to Non-Profit entities of through identifying excessive waste in a traceable, audible, secure, and efficient manner with end-to-end transparency of processes, whereby centralized layers and intermediaries are replaced with the present invention that promotes enhanced security and strengthened growth. The Non-Profit entities may include, but are not limited to, food pantries, foodbanks, local shelters, and any chartable entity that needs food to feed the less fortunate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The goal is to track products from farm to fork using blockchain and internet of things (IoT) enabled technologies. By creating traceable and transparent supply chains for food, consumers can attain the information they need to make informed choices about the food they buy and the companies they support. For stakeholders in the food supply chain, having traceability and transparency builds better relationships with their customers, increases efficiency, and reduces the risk and cost of food recalls, fraud, and product loss. The blockchain technology creates an opportunity to fix and transform the world's food system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Due to COVID 19, the food service industries are struggling to run the business as customers are choosing not to eat outside and instead relying more on online delivery and take-home services: squeezing out valuable food suppliers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention offers one stop shop for groceries and prepared foods. Additionally, the present invention embodies a platform that bridges the gap of unemployed staff or struggling restaurant's owners to rent their commercial kitchens to home entrepreneurs and allow restaurants and entrepreneurs to donate surplus food to nearby food-pantries and complying all the state and federal regulations.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Specifically, by embedding blockchains in relational tables, the database stores trust related information in a tamper-proof fashion, making the data provenance provably verifiable. Currently there is no platform which offers aforementioned grocery, restaurant's food and regional cuisine order to delivery experience using a distributed electronic ledger providing various capabilities, including traceability, audibility, security, and efficiency with end-to-end transparency of processes. Moreover, currently there are no online food/grocery delivery providers partnered with non-profit organizations to prevent food waste, track their Non-Profit food donations in immutable records from the donor to the non-profit entity, and issue electronic receipt fulfilling their actual obligations.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Current online food delivery and surplus Non-Profit food donations systems are built in client-server centralized system. Centralized databases record present information only, they do not trace information that was previously recorded. With blockchains, the case is different. They not only keep information that is relevant in real-time but also can trace back information of transactions that have come before. Blockchains can create databases that have histories of themselves, i.e., they grow like ever-expanding archives of their own history. A blockchain uses a peer-to-peer or P2P network architecture. It does not require access to a centralized database, instead all participating nodes in the network can connect with each other. There is no &#x201c;master&#x201d; that controls all nodes. Each peer is equal to each other in how they access the blockchain without requiring administrator oversight and thus administrator fallibility.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The primary difference between a blockchain and a database is centralization. In contrast, all records secured on a database are centralized, each participant on a blockchain has a secured copy of all records and all changes so each user can view the provenance of the data. The magic happens when there is an inconsistency&#x2014;since each participant maintains a copy of the records, blockchain technology will immediately identify and correct any unreliable information. Current system neither offer this functionality nor they are integrated to through the soup to nuts of ordering grocery, ordering prepared food, and donation of surplus grocery and prepared foods to nonprofits.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The software application, through online resources, unite grocery, prepared (restaurant and regional cuisine that is prepared at home or in a vehicle). Customers will have flexible options to choose individual or group plans and schedule their delivery in advance, request grocery items, access food recipes they wish to enjoy making on their own, surprise menus set based on chefs' choice and customer eating patterns, and the like. The software application will offer restaurants owners and culinarians to earn additional income by sharing space and meals with desired customers. The strict security measures protect the transactions and information from frauds, and data tampering. With food tests, the possibility of foreign matters in the food items could be detected, along with minute details like a batch of food, timings for execution, etc. With blockchain technology the tracking of food items is very easy. Barcodes, QR code, and the like makes the job much easier for companies. Moreover, businesses can regulate who gets access to see the information of products.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention embodies an integrated mobile and web application that will be one stop shop for customers to order grocery items from grocery stores and to order prepared food from restaurants and will also serve as link for donation of the excess food (prepared at restaurants or stored at grocery stores) to the Non-Profit entities in need. This online application will connect customers and nonprofit organizations with the food services and will enable the restaurant owners, grocery owners and regional cuisine (kitchen) owners to list their leftover food and reach to the needy.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also, most of the people far from home want to eat food that tastes close to their home and culture. The software application embodied in the present invention is adapted to connect those people to certain chefs that make signature dishes not found in any restaurant's menu. Additionally, this application aims at transparency around how much of the tip on any given delivery order goes to the delivery worker. To enable better transparency and a single source of truth for all the stakeholders, blockchain technology will be used.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention relates to distributed electronic ledger or blockchain self-checkout-based technologies providing end-to-end transparency of order to delivery experience for online ordering of perishable food so that surplus food is efficiently donated to Non-Profit entities. For example, if a customer added grocery and meals through the app for checkout and added a tip amount for the buyer, then the buyers will have full transparency on the tip amount, his base pay and additional incentive he has received as part of order. In another example, restaurant owners can donate surplus consumable food and get the benefit of tax advisement.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Blockchain can provide buyers, restaurant owners and Non-Profit entities with the opportunity to account for their activities, track immutable records, pass foods from the donor to the non-profit, and issue electronic receipt fulfilling their actual obligations.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">By being provided traceability and transparency in this supply chains for food, consumers can attain the information they need to make informed choices about the food they buy and the companies they support. For stakeholders in the food supply chain, having traceability and transparency builds better relationships with their customers, increases efficiency, and reduces the risk and cost of food recalls, fraud, and product loss. For grocery, restaurants, regional cuisine outlets (e.g., home cooking), the present invention may use self-checkout technologies, enabling the buyers/delivery personnel check out through a mobile application.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Current systems have buyers fulfill orders at a physical retailer on behalf of customers, using a cyber shopping service system. Once a buyer has collected one or more items for purchase, the buyers/delivery personnel must wait in line or use self-serve checkout station to pay for the items according to the traditional check-out process. This is a time-consuming process, and because buyers/delivery personnel use a mobile device to scan and record items each item picked up for purchase, involves redundant activity. A more efficient check-out process allows the buyers/delivery personnel to complete purchase of selected items on his/her mobile device, thereby eliminating unnecessary actions and reducing the time required to complete an order.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention enables customers to purchase grocery, prepared food which is not easily available in the restaurants while using distributed ledger (blockchain) technology to provide traceability, audibility, security, and efficiency with end-to-end transparency of processes. Restaurants owners will have online application to upload their menu, set the price and donate surplus food to local communities. Customer can place an order for them and/or on behalf of their loved ones for grocery shopping, restaurants food or regional cuisine home cooking. Buyers will have options to accept an entirety of an order or select a portion of the order from the customer order batch. Buyer drivers can orchestrate and plan the logistics of delivering the order and suggest delivery times to customer. For restaurants and other preparers of prepared food (such as cooks of regional cuisine who may be looking to commercial kitchen space), buyers/delivery personnel will pick up and deliver the order. Restaurant owners can submit surplus food donation to multiple local non-profit entity. Non-Profit entity can schedule their own pickup or use cyber shopping system to request a pickup. For grocery shopping it enables a buyer to bypass a physical check-out process at a retailer by completing his/her purchase via a mobile application on the phone of the buyers/delivery personnel.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the buyer is shopping at the retailer on behalf of a customer, who specified a list of items for the buyers to purchase via the cyber shopping service. The customer places an order using a website or client application that communicates with the online smart system. The order specifies one or more items to be purchased at a retailer, restaurants, or regional cuisines. The cyber shopping service collects payment from the customer and transmits the order to a buyers/delivery personnel. The buyers/delivery personnel travels to one or more retailers, restaurants, or regional cuisines to fulfill the order. While at a grocery retailer, the buyers/delivery personnel collect and scan each item using a buyers/delivery personnel mobile application that runs on the buyers/delivery personnel's mobile device. The buyers/delivery personnel mobile application records each item and associated item information describing each product and adds items in the cart for purchase. The buyers/delivery personnel mobile application transmits information describing the cart to the online smart system, which determines a total value for the items in the cart. The cyber shopping service transmits payment to a system associated with the retailer, thereby completing purchasing items from the cart, and it also stores transaction information (hash key#) to blockchain based systems (Hyperledger, C-RDA, etc.) as immutable systems of record. The buyers/delivery personnel then leave the store, restaurant, regional cuisine and delivers the purchased grocery items and food to the customer or food pantry (as requested by customer). Once order has been placed and buyers receives it, buyers will have transparent access to the tip amount that has been allocated by the customer. Regulators will be able to access Blockchain Explorer to view the complete journey of the transaction from restaurant owners placing a donation request to delivering it to nonprofit organization.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention offers customers to purchase grocery, restaurants food and regional cuisine authentic food, which is not easily available in the restaurants while using distributed ledger (blockchain) technology to provide traceability, audibility, security, and efficiency with end-to-end transparency of processes.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The customer places an order using a website or client application that communicates with the online BMA (buyer's mobile application) system.

The barcode scanning module <b>320</b> may also include an interface which allows the buyers/delivery personnel <b>108</b> to manually enter information describing an item (such as its serial number, SKU, quantity and/or weight) if a barcode is not available to be scanned. BMA <b>112</b> also includes a cart manager <b>322</b> which maintains a running record of items collected by the buyers/delivery personnel <b>108</b> for purchase at a retailer <b>110</b>. This running record of items is commonly known as a &#x201c;cart&#x201d;. In one embodiment, the barcode scanning module <b>320</b> transmits information describing each item (such as its cost, quantity, weight, etc.) to the cart manager <b>322</b>, which updates its cart accordingly. The BMA <b>112</b> also includes a system communication interface <b>324</b> which interacts with the CSS <b>102</b>. For example, the system communication interface <b>324</b> can both receive an order from the CSS <b>102</b> and, separately, transmit contents of a cart of items to the CSS <b>102</b>. The BMA <b>112</b> communicates with retailer payment gateway and perform final checkout from the app. For example, buyers add customer's items into the cart and pay directly from the app to retailers, upon successful payment, retailers generate a QR code which can then be scanned by an employee of the retailer <b>110</b> if needed to verify the transaction. For restaurant and regional cuisines <b>302</b> and food pickup screen <b>902</b> submits order to cyber shopping system and cyber shopping system transmits information to buyer to collect the order and deliver it to the customer.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the CMA <b>106</b> is used by the buyers to scan and record pricing, quantity, and other information describing each item in an order. The barcode scanning module <b>320</b> allows a buyers/delivery personnel <b>108</b> to simply scan a barcode attached to an item (or enter information manually if necessary); the cart manager <b>322</b> maintains and updates a record of all items being collected by the buyers/delivery personnel <b>108</b> for a particular order. In some embodiments, the BMA <b>112</b>, subsequent to receiving an identification of items for purchase, can perform a &#x201c;bypass checkout&#x201d; in which it transmits payment to the appropriate retailer <b>110</b> on behalf of the buyers/delivery personnel <b>108</b>, thereby removing the need for the buyers <b>108</b> to wait in line at a physical point-of-sale (such as a check-out counter) within the retailer. Restaurant and regional cuisines <b>302</b> and food pickup screen module may transmit information to buyer to collect the order and deliver it to the customer.

The appropriate retailer, restaurants, regional cuisines may be communicated by the CSS <b>102</b> along with the order details, or it may be left to the discretion of the buyers/delivery personnel. The buyers/delivery personnel locate an item specified by the order <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b</i>, <b>404</b><i>c</i>, and/or <b>404</b><i>d</i>. The buyers/delivery personnel scans <b>406</b><i>a </i>the item using a buyers/delivery personnel mobile application (part of BMA <b>112</b>); the buyers/delivery personnel may also manually enter product and pricing information associated with the item if necessary. The BMA <b>112</b> determines if one or more special restrictions <b>408</b><i>a</i>, <b>408</b><i>b</i>, <b>408</b><i>c</i>, <b>408</b><i>d </i>are associated with the item. As described previously, special restrictions include age restrictions (for alcohol, tobacco, peanut allergies products), quantity/count restrictions (for high-demand items), and so on.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">If the mobile BMA determines that special restrictions do not apply, it simply adds <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c</i>, and <b>412</b><i>d </i>the item to a digital cart which lists all items currently marked for purchase.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">If the BMA <b>112</b> determines that special restrictions do apply, it then determines <b>410</b><i>a</i>, <b>410</b><i>b</i>, <b>410</b><i>c</i>, <b>410</b><i>c </i>if the purchase is allowable. This could include looking up the age of the customer (to see if he/she is old enough to purchase alcohol or any peanut allergies have been noted) or counting how many instances of the item have already been collected for purchase (in the case where a retailer institutes a purchase limit for each customer or additional dietary restrictions have been noted by customers).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The BMA <b>112</b> determines allowability by requesting information from the CSS <b>102</b>. For example, the inventory management smart-engine extracts purchasing rules from the inventory database <b>204</b> and transmits them to the BMA <b>112</b>. In another embodiment, the BAM <b>112</b> maintains a local record of purchasing rules and accesses or references it as required.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, if the buyers mobile application determines that purchase of the item is allowable, it adds <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c</i>, <b>412</b><i>d </i>the item to the digital cart. At the same time, the buyers/delivery personnel physically collect the item.

In one embodiment, the BMA <b>112</b> transmits an identification of each item to the shopping assistance platform, which matches each item against the customer order and verifies that the order has been fulfilled.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Subsequently, the BMA <b>112</b> determines <b>418</b><i>a</i>, <b>418</b><i>b</i>, <b>418</b><i>c</i>, <b>418</b><i>d </i>a total systemic sales price or gross merchandise value (GMV) for the cart of items. The GMV reflects the price that a customer would pay at a physical point of sale within the store. Expression may also involve determining whether one or more discounts, promotions, or other price changes apply, and adjusting the GMV accordingly. The BMA <b>112</b> then directs the CSS <b>102</b> to execute <b>420</b><i>a</i>, <b>420</b><i>b</i>, <b>420</b><i>c </i>a credit card payment to the retailer in the amount of the GMV. Currently or some time thereafter, the BMA <b>112</b> transmits <b>422</b><i>a</i>, <b>422</b><i>b</i>, <b>422</b><i>c</i>, <b>422</b><i>d </i>details of the transaction to the retailer. The details include which items were purchased and how much was paid for each. Asynchronously, the buyers deliver <b>424</b><i>a</i>, <b>424</b><i>b</i>, <b>424</b><i>c </i>and <b>424</b><i>d </i>the order to the customer.

The buyers/delivery personnel fulfill <b>508</b>/<b>708</b>/<b>808</b>/<b>908</b> the order (as described previously with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Once the buyers have fulfilled the order, he/she transmits <b>510</b>/<b>710</b>/<b>810</b>/<b>910</b> the cart details to the system. The system verifies <b>512</b>/<b>712</b>/<b>812</b>/<b>912</b> that the order has been fulfilled satisfactorily. The system then determines <b>514</b>/<b>714</b>/<b>814</b>/<b>914</b> a GMV which represents a total value of the order owed to the retailer. The system then charges <b>516</b>/<b>716</b>/<b>816</b>/<b>916</b> a payment channel associated with the customer. The system then transmits <b>518</b>/<b>718</b>/<b>818</b>/<b>918</b> payment to the retailer in the amount of the GMV, as well as a summary of transaction details. The retailer returns <b>520</b>/<b>720</b>/<b>820</b>/<b>920</b> a transaction confirmation to the system. The system shares <b>522</b>/<b>722</b>/<b>822</b>/<b>922</b> the transaction confirmation with the buyers/delivery personnel. The buyers then deliver the fulfilled order to the Customer <b>524</b><i>a </i>or <b>524</b><i>b </i>Non-Profit entity/<b>724</b><i>a </i>Customer or <b>724</b><i>b </i>Non-Profit entity/<b>824</b><i>a </i>Customer or <b>824</b><i>b </i>Non-Profit entity/<b>924</b><i>a </i>Customer or <b>924</b><i>b </i>Non-Profit entity.

The BAM <b>112</b>, based on an estimation of the funds required to purchase the order items, transfers funds to a stored value or prepaid card in the possession of a buyers/delivery personnel <b>108</b>. The buyers/delivery personnel <b>108</b> then fulfills the order and pays for the items using the card. Consequently, to collect payment from a customer <b>104</b> and enable a buyers/delivery personnel <b>108</b> to pay for the ordered items, the GSS <b>102</b> will bear the processing costs of the transactions.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another embodiment, the buyers<b>108</b> passes through the same check-out process as any other customer at the store. The buyers/delivery personnel must therefore present an identification of the items for purchase as well as a payment instrument with which he/she will pay for the items. Typically, check-out cashiers scan each item individually and a point of-sale (POS) system determines and displays a total sale price. The process of scanning each item individually is time-consuming.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, a buyers/delivery personnel <b>108</b> utilizes the BAM <b>112</b> to accelerate the traditional checkout process at a retailer <b>110</b>.

The customer places the order via the CMA <b>105</b> or via a website associated with the shopping assistant system. The CSS <b>102</b> determines an order total <b>604</b> (including one or all-grocery, restaurants or regional cuisine). The system then charges a payment channel associated with the customer. The system then transmits <b>608</b>/<b>708</b>/<b>808</b>/<b>908</b> the order details to a buyer. The buyers/delivery personnel fulfill <b>610</b>/<b>710</b>/<b>810</b>/<b>910</b> the order (as described previously with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Once the buyers finished collecting items within the retailer <b>110</b>, he/she uses the BMA <b>112</b> to generate <b>612</b>/<b>712</b>/<b>812</b>/<b>912</b> a QR code. As described previously, the encoded image contains information describing each item in the cart, such as its price, quantity, weight, SKU, serial number, and so on. The buyers/delivery personnel display <b>614</b>/<b>714</b>/<b>814</b>/<b>914</b> the QR image to a cashier (or other employee) of the retailer, who scans it to determine which items have been collected for purchase. The cashier scans the encoded image using an image reader or other electronic device which extracts the information encoded in the image. A computer system subsequently determines <b>616</b>/<b>716</b>/<b>816</b>/<b>916</b> a GMV which is owed to the retailer. The cashier requests <b>618</b>/<b>718</b>/<b>818</b>/<b>918</b> payment of the GMV from the buyers/delivery personnel. The buyers/delivery personnel present a payment instrument (such as a credit or debit card) and pays <b>620</b>/<b>720</b>/<b>820</b>/<b>920</b> the GMV. The cashier transmits <b>622</b>/<b>722</b>/<b>822</b>/<b>922</b> a physical or electronic receipt to the buyers/delivery personnel. The buyers/delivery personnel, using his/her buyers/delivery personnel mobile application, returns <b>624</b>/<b>724</b>/<b>824</b>/<b>924</b> a confirmation of successful purchase of the cart to the BMA <b>112</b>.

For example, in some embodiments, the buyers/delivery personnel <b>108</b> may use a self-service automated machine which is configured to transfer the products items directly to retailer as buyer's collect-scan and load the items in cart. Additionally, instead of encoding cart details into an encoded image, the BMA <b>112</b> may instead transmit the cart data via one of multiple communications technologies or protocols, including but not limited to: RFID, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and so on. In one embodiment, the buyers <b>108</b> can tap his/her mobile device to a device at the physical check-out, whereby the BMA <b>112</b> transmits the cart details to the device.
