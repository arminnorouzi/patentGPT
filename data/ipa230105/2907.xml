description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to an electrical steel sheet with an insulating coating, and in particular to an electrical steel sheet with an insulating coating having excellent adhesive compatibility, which is suitable for use as a raw material for iron cores of automobile motors or electric equipment, and which is suitable for use in forming a core by bonding electrical steel sheets together with an anaerobic acrylic adhesive.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, laminated electrical steel sheets used for iron cores of automobile motors and electrical equipment are produced by stacking multiple electrical steel sheets with an insulating coating and then integrating them by, for example, caulking or welding. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for higher efficiency in electrical equipment to save energy. Accordingly, there is a tendency to make the thickness of each electrical steel sheet in a laminated electrical steel sheet thinner to reduce eddy current loss. However, as the electrical steel sheets used become thinner, not only caulking or welding becomes more difficult, but also the laminated electrical steel sheet tends to open at an end face, making it difficult to maintain the shape of the iron core.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To address this issue, the following two technologies have been proposed instead of the technology of integrating electrical steel sheets by caulking or welding. One is a technology in which a laminated electrical steel sheet is formed by thermo-compression bonding multiple electrical steel sheets with adhesive insulating coating formed on the surfaces. The other is a technology in which a laminated electrical steel sheet is formed by applying an adhesive to electrical steel sheets with an insulating coating and bonding them together. It is known that anaerobic acrylic adhesives are frequently used as adhesives applied to the latter technology.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">JP2013-64195A (PTL 1) describes an &#x201c;electrical steel sheet with an insulation coating formed by applying a surface-treatment agent to at least one side of the electrical steel sheet and drying the surface-treatment agent, wherein the surface-treatment agent contains trialkoxysilane and/or dialkoxysilane (A) in which a substituent other than an alkoxy group bound to Si is constituted only by at least one non-reactive substituent selected from hydrogen, an alkyl group, or a phenyl group; a silane coupling agent (B), at a mass ratio (A/B) of 0.05 to 1.0; and plate-like silica (C) having an average particle size of 0.08 &#x3bc;m to 0.9 &#x3bc;m and an aspect ratio of 10 to 100, wherein the content of the plate-like silica is 2 mass % to 30 mass % with respect to a total solid content of the surface-treatment agent&#x201d;.

The type of silane coupling agent (B) is not particularly limited as long as it does not contain a polymerizable unsaturated group in its structure, and one or more of silane coupling agents represented by the general formula XSi(R4)<sub>n</sub>(OR)<sub>3-n </sub>(where n is 0, 1, or 2) can be used simultaneously.

When the mass ratio is more than 1.0, the amount of the silane coupling agent (B) is insufficient, and sufficient strength and toughness of the insulating coating cannot be obtained. As a result, deterioration of tension pad resistance, and scratches or peeling of coating are likely to occur during handling. In the present disclosure, by containing the silane coupling agent (B) in an amount more than that of the trialkoxysilane and/or the dialkoxysilane (A), the tension pad resistance can be significantly improved. From this viewpoint, the mass ratio (A/B) is set to 1.00 or less, and preferably 0.50 or less. On the other hand, if the mass ratio (A/B) is too low, TIG weldability is reduced. From this viewpoint, the mass ratio (A/B) is set to 0.05 or more, and preferably 0.10 or more.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0044">[Plate-Like Silica (C)]</p><p id="p-0049" num="0045">The surface-treatment agent used in this embodiment includes plate-like silica (C). The plate-like silica is also referred to as leaf silica or scaly silica, which has a layered silicate structure in which a number of thin layers of SiO<sub>2 </sub>are stacked. Such plate-like silica is preferably amorphous or microcrystalline. The plate-like silica can be obtained by preparing agglomerated particles of stacked primary particles of the thin layers, and pulverizing these agglomerated particles. Such plate-like silica can inhibit permeation of corrosion substances because of the layered form, and is excellent in adhesion property because of the presence of many hydroxyl groups, and in slidability because of the flexibility, as compared with common silica particles such as colloidal silica and the like. When the surface-treatment agent containing such plate-like silica is applied, the surface-treatment agent remains even on projected parts on the steel sheet surface, where the amount of application tends to be small, and uniform application of the surface-treatment agent according to the roughness of the steel sheet surface is possible. Accordingly, corrosion resistance is not inferior.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0046">The plate-like silica (C) preferably has an average particle size of 0.08 &#x3bc;m or more and an aspect ratio of 10 or more. The plate-like silica (C) preferably has an average particle size of 0.9 &#x3bc;m or less and an aspect ratio of 100 or less. The average particle size is more preferably about 0.1 &#x3bc;m or more. The average particle size is more preferably about 0.5 &#x3bc;m or less. The aspect ratio is more preferably 20 or more. The aspect ratio is more preferably 90 or less. When the average particle size is 0.08 &#x3bc;m or more and the aspect ratio is 10 or more, this is effective in terms of coating morphology and provides sufficient uniformity of the coating. In addition, when the average particle size is 0.9 &#x3bc;m or less and the aspect ratio is 100 or less, the trialkoxysilane and/or the dialkoxysilane (A) and the silane coupling agent (B) are sufficiently incorporated into the insulating coating, and the tension pad resistance becomes sufficient.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0047">The plate-like silica (C) more preferably has an average particle size of 0.1 &#x3bc;m or more and an aspect ratio of 10 or more. The plate-like silica (C) more preferably has an average particle size of 0.3 &#x3bc;m or less and an aspect ratio of 50 or less. The reason is that excellent blanking ability can be obtained in this range. If the average particle size is 0.1 &#x3bc;m or more, the blanking ability is excellent because there is not a lot of powder generated by grind of the plate-like silica by blanking and the press mold is not contaminated. The larger the average particle size of the plate-like silica is, the more the metal mold is likely to be worn in blanking. When the average particle size is 0.3 &#x3bc;m or less, wear of the metal mold is negligible, which results in excellent blanking ability. Furthermore, if the aspect ratio is in the range of 10 to 50, the blanking ability is particularly excellent because the material is easily deformed during blanking as described above. In addition, if the aspect ratio is 50 or less, uniform coating formation more in accordance with the surface roughness of the steel sheet is possible, providing excellent corrosion resistance.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0048">As used herein, the &#x201c;average particle size&#x201d; of the plate-like silica means the length obtained by averaging the major axis diameters of all the particles in the field of view in the plane perpendicular to the thickness of the plate-like silica when the cross-section of the insulating coating is observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) at a magnification of 20,000 times. As used herein, the &#x201c;aspect ratio&#x201d; of the plate-like silica means the value obtained by averaging the ratios of the major axis diameters to the maximum thicknesses of all the particles in the field of view in the plane perpendicular to the thickness of the plate-like silica when the cross-section of the insulating coating is observed with an SEM at a magnification of 20,000 times.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0049">The content of the plate-like silica (C) is in the range of 2 mass % to 30 mass % with respect to the total mass of (A) to (E) in the surface-treatment agent.

Examples of a method of applying the surface-treatment agent to an electrical steel sheet include roll coating, bar coating, dip coating, spray coating, and the like. An appropriate method may be selected depending on the shape or the like of the electrical steel sheet to be processed. More specifically, for example, when an electrical steel sheet is in a sheet form, roll coating, bar coating, or spray coating may be selected. Spray coating is a method in which the surface-treatment agent is sprayed onto the electrical steel sheet and then the coating amount may be adjusted by a squeeze roll or gas blown at high pressure. In a case where an electrical sheet has already been shaped into a product, a method may be employed in which the product is dipped in the surface-treatment agent, taken out of the agent, and in some cases the coating amount is adjusted by blowing away an excess of the surface-treatment agent with compressed air.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">The heating temperature (maximum end-point temperature of the steel sheet) for heat-drying the surface-treatment agent applied to the surface of the electrical steel sheet is generally in the range of 80&#xb0; C. to 350&#xb0; C. It is preferably 100&#xb0; C. or higher. It is preferably 300&#xb0; C. or lower. If the heating temperature is 80&#xb0; C. or higher, moisture, which is the main solvent, does not remain in the insulating coating, and corrosion resistance is not degraded. If the heating temperature is 350&#xb0; C. or lower, crack generation in the insulating coating is suppressed, and corrosion resistance is not degraded. The heating time may be selected depending on the type or the like of an electrical steel sheet to be used. In terms of productivity, for example, the heating time is preferably set to 0.1 seconds or more. It is preferably set to 60 seconds or less. It is more preferably 1 second or more. It is more preferably set to 30 seconds or less.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0066">The coating weight of the insulating coating is not particularly limited. However, it is preferably about 0.05 g/m<sup>2 </sup>or more per surface. It is preferably about 5 g/m<sup>2 </sup>or less per surface. The coating weight, i.e., the total solid content mass of the insulating coating can be measured from the reduction in weight after the removal of the coating through dissolution with alkali. If the coating weight is small, it can be determined from a calibration curve obtained by fluorescent X-ray analysis using a standard sample having a known coating amount as measured in advance by means of alkali dissolution. When the coating weight is 0.05 g/m<sup>2 </sup>or more, the insulation property can be satisfied as well as the corrosion resistance. Meanwhile, when it is 5 g/m<sup>2 </sup>or less, not only the coating adhesion property is improved, but also blistering is not caused in the coat baking, and the deterioration of coatability is not incurred. The coating weight is more preferably 0.1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>or more. It is more preferably 3.0 g/m<sup>2 </sup>or less. Although the insulating coating is preferably formed on both surfaces of the electrical steel sheet, the insulating coating may be formed on only one surface and another type of insulating coating may be formed on the other surface depending on the purpose.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0067">The present disclosure will be described in more detail using the examples below.
