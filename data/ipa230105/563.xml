More particularly, the present disclose relates to procedural suites and methods of use thereof that enable the insertion and placement of high-bandwidth neural interfaces to a target area of the brain, e.g., the temporal lobe, the visual cortex, and/or additional anatomical locations. The disclosed techniques may be applied to, for example, insertion of an electrode interface to treat epilepsy, blindness, paralysis, stroke, impulse control disorders, and other conditions relating to the electrophysiology of the brain.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) rely upon neural recording and stimulation techniques. Neural recording and stimulation techniques often involve design trade-offs among (1) spatial resolution, (2) temporal resolution, (3) degree of invasiveness and collateral damage to normal brain tissue, and (4) optimization for electrical recording and/or electrical stimulation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional techniques for recording and/or stimulating the nervous system face many challenges. For example, imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) provide non-invasive methods for examining brain tissue. However, these non-invasive imaging techniques are unable to detect all functional lesions and lack temporal resolution. Furthermore, these techniques may not be adequate for imaging electrical activity in the nervous system and lack a mechanism for therapeutic electrophysiologic intervention.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electromagnetic recording techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are non-invasive and provide temporal resolution of electrical activity in the brain. However, the resolution of such techniques is limited, due to both the physical distance separating the electrodes from the brain and the dielectric properties of the scalp and skull. Accordingly, conventional recording of neural activity lacks adequate spatial resolution for some applications.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additional techniques such as electrocorticography (ECoG) or intracranial EEG include forms of electroencephalography that offer improved spatial resolution by placing electrodes directly onto the cortical surface of the brain. However, the improved spatial resolution is conventionally achieved only by way of a highly invasive surgical procedure, a craniotomy, which requires the temporary surgical removal of a significant portion of the skull.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Yet another technique for recording and/or stimulating the nervous system involves the use of depth electrodes, which are capable of recording electrical activity in the nervous system with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, conventional depth electrodes are only able to record from a small volume of tissue or a small population of neurons. Additionally, the placement of depth electrodes is highly invasive and may result in damage or destruction of normal brain tissue including neurons. As such, only a limited number of depth electrodes may be placed safely and there is limited ability to adjust the spatial placement of the electrodes after initial placement, except for minor depth adjustments during placement.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Yet another technique for recording and/or stimulating the nervous system involves deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes, which may be configured to stimulate brain regions with millimetric and sub-millimetric precision. DBS electrodes may be used for stimulation as a way of treating conditions such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, and potentially some forms of epilepsy. Although DBS electrodes may be implanted through minimally invasive surgical techniques, the DBS electrodes are nonetheless configured to penetrate the brain and thus carry a risk of damage to the brain, hemorrhage, stroke, and/or seizures. Furthermore, only a limited number of DBS electrodes may be placed safely and there is limited ability to adjust the spatial placement of the electrodes after initial placement. While DBS techniques have an excellent safety profile demonstrated over two decades of standard clinical use, these electrodes are macroscopic and only a small number (typically one or two electrodes) are placed in any single patient, thus limiting their utility for neural interfaces.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there remains a need for high-bandwidth neural interfaces for the brain that allow for improved spatial resolution, temporal resolution, reduced collateral damage to the normal brain tissue, and optimization for electrical recording and/or electrical stimulation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments for systems and methods for high-bandwidth minimally invasive brain computer interfaces (BCIs) and a comprehensive interventional electrophysiology suite are disclosed.

Ideally, the neural interfaces would provide improved spatial resolution, temporal resolution, reduced collateral damage to the normal brain tissue, and optimization for electrical recording and/or electrical stimulation. In some embodiments, the neural interfaces may be used to treat epilepsy, blindness, paralysis, stroke, impulse control disorders, and other conditions relating to the electrophysiology of the brain.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Accordingly, the present disclosure describes a system for minimally invasively interfacing with a nervous system of a patient. The system comprises one or more electrode arrays configured to be minimally invasively inserted to a target area of the nervous system, an imaging module configured to provide real-time information related to a location of the electrode arrays, an electrophysiologic guidance module configured to detect a position of the electrode arrays, and one or more processors configured receive the real-time information from the imaging module and the detected position of the electrode arrays from the electrophysiologic guidance module to confirm placement of the electrode arrays. The processor may also be configured to acquire one or more signals from the electrode arrays related to one or more electrical measurements at the target area of the nervous system, and decode the acquired signals to obtain the one or more electrical measurements. The system may be used, for example, to treat epilepsy, vision loss, and/or other conditions related to the nervous system.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">High-Bandwidth Minimally Invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Disclosed herein are systems and methods for high-bandwidth minimally invasive brain computer interfaces (BCIs). Embodiments include a comprehensive interventional electrophysiology suite.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Disclosed herein are embodiments of neural interfaces configured for use in brain computer interfaces (BCIs) that include applications for various conditions such as epilepsy, blindness, paralysis, functional restoration and rehabilitation after stroke, treatment of obesity and impulse control disorders, and the like. Additionally, the embodiments described herein may be used for enhanced or augmented reality.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Conventional brain-computer interfaces take one of two approaches: (1) non-invasive approach or (2) invasive approach. The non-invasive approach, which may rely upon electroencephalography (EEG), while safe and scalable, has many disadvantages including poor signal quality, and inferior empirical performance. For example, the spatial and temporal resolution of non-invasive BCIs is far inferior to surgical alternatives due to the distance and shielding of target areas in the brain from the electrodes of the device.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Invasive approaches (as exemplified e.g. by the BrainGate system) require high-risk, invasive surgeries that surgically implant electrodes onto the brain surface or deep in the brain itself. While these provide strong signal quality, and precision, they come with many disadvantages. Invasive surgery involves trauma to healthy brain tissue and carries a substantial risk of infection. Additionally, the invasive surgeries and subsequent monitoring require expensive, resource intensive techniques that are not scalable. Many invasive electrophysiology approaches also require patients to remain physically connected to cables and wires that connect electrodes in the brain directly to external hardware and are mechanically tethered to the head of the patient. Thus, the practical benefits to patients remain limited, and patients are reluctant to have elective invasive procedures.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide brain-computer interfaces that adopt a minimally invasive approach. The disclosed brain-computer interfaces allow for the implantation of electrode arrays that provide high data bandwidth and high spatiotemporal resolution. Electrode arrays may be delivered and used for cortical mapping in a minimally invasive manner. Three primary minimally invasive delivery methods are considered: (1) cortical surface delivery, (2) ventricular delivery, and (3) endovascular delivery. The minimally invasive delivery methods are designed to deliver conformable neural interfaces through the fluid-filled spaces of the brain rather than through brain tissue, thus minimizing procedural damage to healthy brain. Additionally, the minimally invasive delivery methods discussed herein may be configured to achieve the high resolution and precision that non-invasive approaches are unable to obtain. Yet at the same time, the minimally invasive delivery methods are capable of being cheaper, faster, and safer than traditional invasive open brain surgery.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Ventricular delivery and endovascular delivery techniques in the nervous system may draw inspiration from cardio electrophysiology techniques. For example, minimally invasive approaches have been well established in the cardiac electrophysiology field, which employs endovascular electrode arrays as well as percutaneous electrophysiology techniques, all in the setting of an interventional radiology suite or catheter laboratory (as opposed to a surgical operating room). The disclosed percutaneous, stereotactic, endoscopic, endovascular, and other delivery techniques may be used to deploy neural interfaces including electrode arrays with hundreds and thousands of small electrodes directly in the brain into the subdural space, the ventricles, through its blood vessels, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a comprehensive interventional neuro-electrophysiology suite 100 built in accordance with the systems and methods described herein. The concept of an interventional neuro-electrophysiology suite has precedent in cardiac electrophysiology, but a comprehensive procedural suite of this nature has no precedent in neuro-electrophysiology. A comprehensive neuro-electrophysiology suite 100 may include one or more of minimally invasive electrode interfaces (not shown), the electronic hardware required to perform real-time signal acquisition, processing and neural decoding (among other functions), storage, and neural stimulation, wired or wireless data telemetry, and real-time imaging (including fluoroscopy, computed tomography, angiography, and other modalities, including those required for stereotactic device placement).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, an imaging and electrophysiologic procedural suite may include a minimally invasive electrode interface (not shown) positioned in the nervous system of a patient <b>101</b>, a processor (not shown) configured to acquire signals from the electrode interface and decode the acquired signals, a memory module (not shown), a data telemetry module (not shown), a real-time imaging module <b>110</b>, and an electrophysiologic guidance module <b>115</b>. The real-time imaging module <b>110</b> may be configured to capture real-time visual images of the nervous system of the patient to guide placement of the electrode interface. The electrophysiologic guidance module <b>115</b> may include a display configured to display one or more electrophysiologic measurements that confirm placement of the electrode interface, e.g., based on measurements collected from the electrode interface and/or another probe. For example, electrophysiological information that identifies electrical activity can be presented as an image that enables determination of an anatomical location. As shown, in some embodiments, a common display may be used for both the electrophysiologic guidance module and for displaying images from the real-time imaging module. In some embodiments, the processor and related components may include architectures configured for accelerating the underlying computational processes such as graphical processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs) and the like. Components of the imaging and electrophysiologic procedural suite may be configured for interacting with high-bandwidth electrode arrays and include improved systems and methods for real-time imaging, signal processing, and neural decoding.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In cardiac electrophysiology pacemaker electrodes enter the heart through its blood vessels and interact with the heart through a unit implanted in the chest wall that includes computing, data storage, wireless telemetry, software upgrades and power. Like implantable pacemakers which are used to regulate the heart, the disclosed systems may be used in connection with devices configured to regulate the brain (e.g., deep brain stimulator for Parkinson's disease or other brain-machine interface or brain-computer interface configuration). Similar to the percutaneous and intravascular electrical interfaces for mapping and stimulating the heart, the disclosed systems and methods may be used for mapping and stimulating the brain. Additionally, similar to the use of four-dimensional cardiac electrophysiologic mapping to diagnose, localize, and treat cardiac arrythmias such as atrial fibrillation, an electrical disorder of the heart, the disclosed systems may be used to localize, diagnose, and treat electrical disorders of the brain, such as epileptic seizures.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a method for ventricular delivery in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. Ventricular delivery of a neural device may include navigating a device such as an endoscope <b>201</b> into a ventricle <b>205</b>, or cavity in the brain filled with spinal fluid. Once in the ventricle, the device can reach deep brain structures. The ventricular delivery of a neural device may only require a small burr hole or slit, which minimizes trauma and operative time.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref> illustrate endoscopic deployment of an electrode array within the ventricular system according to the systems and methods described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate endoscopic insertion of a conformal electrode array <b>300</b> into the occipital horn <b>302</b> of the right lateral ventricle in a human patient. An endoscope <b>301</b> is used to gain access to the temporal horn in minimally invasive fashion. The trajectory of the endoscope is shown in sagittal views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>C</figref> (from the left), and in an axial view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> (from above). The conformal electrode array <b>300</b> may assume a narrow axial configuration when confined to the inner channel of the endoscope, and then expand when unsheathed from the endoscope in the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. Once expanded, the conformal electrode array <b>300</b> may be configured to stimulate the optic radiations as they converge toward the visual cortex in the occipital lobe of the brain.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a method for endovascular delivery in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. Endovascular delivery approaches may be performed in a catheter lab. Various structures in the brain including deep brain structures can be accessed through an entry point in a vein or an artery in an upper or lower limb, or elsewhere in the body. The endovascular delivery approach does not require an incision of the skull. Additionally, endovascular techniques allow for the movement of electrodes though the brain in real time, an advantage over conventional systems. As illustrated, a catheter <b>401</b> may be advanced through a vein <b>403</b> to enter the brain. Once in the target region, the catheter may deploy an electrode array <b>405</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the electrode array may be deployed in connection with a stent located in the intracranial veins adjacent to the temporal lobe.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Minimally invasive neural interfaces may utilize retrievable stents. In some embodiments, retrievable stents may include 10 mm polymer (PEEK) stents including insulating substrates on electrodes. In some embodiments, the retrievable stents may include 5 mm nitinol stents with individually soldered electrodes. In some embodiments, the retrievable stents may include Nitinol stents covered with polymer-electrode composited arrays. A minimally invasive delivery method may include the following steps: (1) inserting a catheter through a vein the in the arm or leg of a patient, (2) navigating the catheter to a large vein in the brain (e.g., transverse sinus), (3) deploying a stent-based electrode array via the catheter, (4) real-time image-guidance and registration for all steps, (5) electrophysiologic confirmation. The deployed stent-based electrode arrays may be capable of one or more of recording and stimulating.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> provides an additional schematic for a method for delivery of an electrode array for a neural interface within the subdural space in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. Panel <b>1</b> depicts a simplified view of a head and brain of a patient prior to performing the method. As shown in Panel <b>2</b>, a first step of the method may comprise drilling <b>501</b> a small burr hole or slit through the skull of the patient. As shown in Panel <b>3</b>, a catheter delivery device may be inserted <b>503</b> through the burr hole or slit and into the subdural space. As shown in Panel <b>4</b>, an expandable electrode array may be advanced <b>505</b> through the delivery catheter or cannula to a target site. As shown in Panel <b>5</b>, the electrode array may be deployed <b>507</b> to a deployed configuration within a target area of the brain, and the catheter delivery device may be retracted.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the disclosed minimally invasive techniques may form a broader platform <b>601</b> including conformable electrode arrays built on a variety of mechanical scaffolds with electrodes <b>603</b> that are implantable, on-array integrated circuits for signal multiplexing and data management <b>607</b>, and advanced user interface and software <b>605</b>. Example applications for said platform <b>601</b> include epilepsy, vision, paralysis, assessment and rehabilitation and restoration of function following stroke, obesity, sleep and memory and cognitive function, gaming and augmented and virtual reality, and the like. For example, applications for epilepsy may include percutaneous and subdural and ventricular and endovascular arrays. In another example, applications for vision may target the visual cortex. In another example, applications for obesity may involve hypothalamic ventricular areas. And in yet another example, applications for sleep and memory may involve a hippocampal array interface.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Embodiments of the disclosed interventional suite for minimally invasive neural interfaces may include electrode arrays such as stent <b>403</b> with many hundreds or thousands of small electrodes configured to be deployed into the brain through its blood vessels, together with the imaging apparatus and electronics and software required to deploy and operate the high-bandwidth array. Analogous to techniques utilized in cardiac electrophysiology devices the disclosed systems and methods may allow for percutaneous, cortical surface, endoscopic, intraventricular, or intravascular electrical interfaces for mapping and stimulating the nervous system.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The disclosed minimally invasive neural interfaces may be used to compile large data sets of neural activity including data obtained at higher resolution (both spatially and temporally). Embodiments of the present disclosure may include software packages capable of remote, wireless or wired upgrades. Accordingly, functionality of the neural interface may be improved over time. Disclosed systems can include software interfaces such as software <b>405</b> that are configured for continuous upgrades. Similar to the manner in which cochlear implants for children are implanted during infancy but receive continuous software upgrades into adulthood without additional surgery, the disclosed BCIs may be configured to receive continuous software upgrades over time, thus improving the operation of the neural interface. Systems and methods of implantation of such systems in the context of a procedural suite designed for real-time imaging and electrophysiology are described herein.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The disclosed minimally invasive neural interfaces may form a portion of a comprehensive interventional electrophysiology system for the brain and may be coupled with one or more of the following: electrode catheters, electrode stents, electrode guide-wires; electrical recording hardware; mapping software; imaging infrastructure in a catheter-laboratory-type setting.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Although the present disclosure has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, other versions are possible. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description and the preferred versions contained within this specification. Various aspects of the present disclosure will be illustrated with reference to the following non-limiting examples:</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Exemplary Applications of the Neural Interface Embodiments Herein</heading><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 1: Vision</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the disclosed minimally invasive neural interface may be used to restore and/or augment vision. Electrodes may be navigated to the transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus of the brain, or through the subdural space onto the visual cortex, in order to stimulate the visual cortex of the brain in order to stimulate and/or restore visual perception.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Conventional neural interface systems for augmenting or treating vision disorders require implantation of devices in the eye itself, incisions in the eye, or traditional &#x201c;open brain&#x201d; neurosurgical procedures, with placement of electrodes on the visual cortex. By contrast, the disclosed systems are capable of avoiding traditional surgery, and do not require surgical opening of the eye or a craniotomy to expose the brain. This type of &#x201c;incisionless&#x201d; or &#x201c;minimally invasive&#x201d; surgery typically appeals to patients intuitively, and when it has replaced &#x201c;open&#x201d; surgery for other indications has had many other benefits (lower rates of infection and shorter hospitalizations, for example, as well as less postoperative pain, better cosmetic outcomes, and no scars).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The disclosed systems may be used for treating common forms of blindness that affect the eye but do not affect the visual cortex of the brain. For example, macular degeneration, impacts approximately 3 million cases per year in the US. While conventional neural interfaces focus on stimulating the retina (although retina cells may be dying), the disclosed systems may provide direct stimulation of the brain (which ultimately receives signals from the retina). Additionally, the disclosed systems and methods would work even if the entire retina were diseased. Embodiments disclosed herein may be capable of refining the stimulation targets and patterns of stimulation. Utilizing a percutaneous, cortical-subdural, or endovascular approach, the disclosed systems may be capable of reaching all stages of the visual processing hierarchy. Systems and methods of implantation of such systems in the context of a procedural suite designed for real-time imaging and electrophysiology are described here.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The disclosed embodiments may be configured to position a conformable electrode array relative to the bloodstream and surrounding tissue outside the blood vessel, or the cortical surface from the subdural space, or brain structure adjacent to the ventricular system. Stimulating the visual cortex (via the cortical surface from the subdural space, or via the transverse sinus and/or superior sagittal sinus) with the disclosed neural interface could meaningfully restore or augment vision. While conventional systems utilize direct retinal or cortical stimulation, one embodiment of the disclosed system may be capable of stimulating the visual cortex through the large venous sinuses (straight sinus, superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus). Anatomically, these large venous sinuses are directly apposed to the visual cortex, and so provide access to the visual cortex.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref> illustrate areas of the visual cortex a high-bandwidth minimally invasive brain computer interface may operate within in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates a superior view of the brain with areas of the visual cortex indicated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrates the visual cortices of the brain <b>701</b>.

For example, the leaflets of the superior sagittal sinus contact the visual cortex, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>B and <b>7</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, an endovascular electrode array may be positioned within a few tens of microns of the visual cortex. In some embodiments, an endovascular electrode array may be configured to expand (in a calibrated manner) into the tissue of the blood vessel wall over time, and the blood vessel wall remodels around the stent struts.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, the disclosed endovascular electrode array may be connected by wires to a unit implanted elsewhere in the body, the chest wall for example. This unit would contain the power supply, telemetry unit for wireless communication, and extensive data processing capability, as in the cases of pacemakers and deep brain stimulators.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In other embodiments, the disclosed endovascular electrode array may be connected to a self-contained, fully implantable system with custom hardware, including an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). In some embodiments, all of the electronics may be contained on the electrode array itself, with no wired connection to a secondary (chest wall) implant.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In other embodiments, the electrode array may be inserted via the subdural space directly onto the cortical surface of the visual cortex. In some embodiments this may be accomplished using real-time noninvasive imaging or by real-time endoscopic visualization.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 2: Epilepsy</heading><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Embodiments of the present disclosure may be used to study, diagnose, and/or treat epilepsy. The disclosed embodiments may be used for minimally invasive mapping of the brain to study, diagnose, and/or treat epilepsy. For example, refractory epilepsy is a seizure disorder that resists treatment by anti-seizure medication. Conventional methods for treating refractory epilepsy involve identifying targets for surgical removal and may require a craniotomy or opening of the skull or skull burr holes or slits, and an insertion of electrodes. A patient may be required to live in a hospital setting for days to observe seizures in order to locate a seizure focus in the brain. The procedure carries significant risk of infection or hematoma during the procedure and afterwards. Further, many patients are reluctant to undergo this procedure given the perceived risk, time, and invasive nature of the procedure. Accordingly, the disclosed minimally invasive system, supported by a comprehensive imaging and electrophysiology suite, provides additional benefits over conventional methods for treating refractory epilepsy.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Systems and methods built in accordance with the present disclosure may enable recording of neural activity from surfaces of the brain as required for monitoring and treating epilepsy and other disorders. Recording may be conducted from the ventricles, with the electrode arrays being placed in the ventricles through minimally invasive techniques. This circumvents the need for a craniotomy (required by current surface mapping techniques) by deployment of the electrode arrays through tiny burr holes or slits in the skull. The minimally invasive deployment also enables mapping from surfaces in the ventricles, which is currently not possible. In addition to the minimally invasive placement, the present disclosure provides a higher resolution mapping of the neural activity to more accurately spatially locate seizure foci.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the electrode arrays may be configured for recapture or retrieval. For example, for diagnostic procedures, the electrode arrays may be configured to be resheathable. For example, the electrode arrays may utilize Nitinol scaffolds with &#x201c;closed-cell geometry&#x201d;. In some embodiments the diagnostic electrode array may be deployed 85-90% of its length from the delivery catheter so that it can be resheathed and repositioned multiple times during a diagnostic procedure. In other embodiments, the stent design may enable resheathing after full deployment by including a triangular and/or conical end to enable capture by surgical tools and guide the electrode array into the catheter and/or back into a cylindrical shape. In other embodiments, a cylindrical mesh may be designed with minimal restoring force when flattened. The restoring force generates a cylindrical shape without any external forces applied but can hold a flattened shape with minimal external force allowing for placement in regions with small vertical spacing without exerting appreciable forces on the surrounding tissue.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The devices, systems, and methods as described herein are not intended to be limited in terms of the particular embodiments described, which are intended only as illustrations of various features.

Similarly, a group having 1-5 cells refers to groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 cells, as well as the range of values greater than or equal to 1 cell and less than or equal to 5 cells, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In addition, even if a specific number is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (for example, the bare recitation of &#x201c;two recitations,&#x201d; without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, and C, et cetera&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (for example, &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, and C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, et cetera). In those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, or C, et cetera&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (for example, &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, or C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, et cetera). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, sample embodiments, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase &#x201c;A or B&#x201d; will be understood to include the possibilities of &#x201c;A&#x201d; or &#x201c;B&#x201d; or &#x201c;A and B.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In addition, where features of the disclosure are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">By hereby reserving the right to proviso out or exclude any individual members of any such group, including any sub-ranges or combinations of sub-ranges within the group, that can be claimed according to a range or in any similar manner, less than the full measure of this disclosure can be claimed for any reason. Further, by hereby reserving the right to proviso out or exclude any individual substituents, structures, or groups thereof, or any members of a claimed group, less than the full measure of this disclosure can be claimed for any reason.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The term &#x201c;about,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to variations in a numerical quantity that can occur, for example, through measuring or handling procedures in the real world; through inadvertent error in these procedures; through differences in the manufacture, source, or purity of compositions or reagents; and the like. Typically, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; as used herein means greater or lesser than the value or range of values stated by 1/10 of the stated values, e.g., &#xb1;10%. The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; also refers to variations that would be recognized by one skilled in the art as being equivalent so long as such variations do not encompass known values practiced by the prior art. Each value or range of values preceded by the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is also intended to encompass the embodiment of the stated absolute value or range of values. Whether or not modified by the term &#x201c;about,&#x201d; quantitative values recited in the present disclosure include equivalents to the recited values, e.g., variations in the numerical quantity of such values that can occur, but would be recognized to be equivalents by a person skilled in the art. Where the context of the disclosure indicates otherwise, or is inconsistent with such an interpretation, the above-stated interpretation may be modified as would be readily apparent to a person skilled in the art. For example, in a list of numerical values such as &#x201c;about 49, about 50, about 55,&#x201d; &#x201c;about 50&#x201d; means a range extending to less than half the interval(s) between the preceding and subsequent values, e.g., more than 49.5 to less than 52.5. Furthermore, the phrases &#x201c;less than about&#x201d; a value or &#x201c;greater than about&#x201d; a value should be understood in view of the definition of the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; provided herein.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein are generally intended as &#x201c;open&#x201d; terms (for example, the term &#x201c;including&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;including but not limited to,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;having&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;having at least,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;includes but is not limited to,&#x201d; et cetera).

While various compositions, methods, and devices are described in terms of &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; various components or steps (interpreted as meaning &#x201c;including, but not limited to&#x201d;), the compositions, methods, and devices can also &#x201c;consist essentially of&#x201d; or &#x201c;consist of&#x201d; the various components and steps, and such terminology should be interpreted as defining essentially closed-member groups. By contrast, the transitional phrase &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claim. The transitional phrase &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or steps &#x201c;and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s)&#x201d; of the claimed invention.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The terms &#x201c;patient&#x201d; and &#x201c;subject&#x201d; are interchangeable and refer to any living organism which contains neural tissue.
