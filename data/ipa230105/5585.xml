This failure leads to hyperglycemia, i.e., the presence of an excessive amount of glucose within the blood plasma. Persistent hyperglycemia has been associated with a variety of serious symptoms and life threatening long-term complications such as dehydration, ketoacidosis, diabetic coma, cardiovascular diseases, chronic renal failure, retinal damage and nerve damages with the risk of amputation of extremities. Because healing is not yet possible, a permanent therapy is necessary which provides constant glycemic control in order to constantly maintain the level of blood analyte within normal limits. Such glycemic control is achieved by regularly supplying external drugs to the body of the patient to thereby reduce the elevated levels of blood analyte. An external biologically effective drug (e.g., insulin or its analog) is commonly administered by means of daily injections. In some cases, multiple, daily injections of a mixture of rapid- and long-acting insulin are administered via a reusable transdermal liquid dosing device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a first aspect, a method comprises: receiving, in a computer system, data regarding insulin therapy treatment of a person with diabetes, the data relating to a time period and comprising blood glucose values for the person with diabetes and time-of-administration information for the insulin therapy treatment; determining, using the computer system and based on the blood glucose values and the time-of-administration information, a total daily basal dose (TDBD) mismatch value for the person with diabetes; and generating, using the computer system, an output based on the determined TDBD mismatch value.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Implementations can include any or all of the following features.

In some implementations, a mismatch value regarding total daily basal dose (TDBD) can be determined for a person with diabetes and used for one or more purposes. For example, the TDBD mismatch value can be determined using a regression model that has been trained based on data for a population (e.g., actual data or simulated data).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Insulin delivery devices include, but are not limited to, insulin injection pens, insulin inhalers, insulin pumps, and insulin syringes. The improper dosing of insulin, whether due to human error, malfunction of an insulin pen, skipping doses, double dosing, or incorrect dosing, is always a concern. Methods, devices, and systems provided herein are described for the delivery of insulin, collection of blood glucose data, and/or the treatment of diabetes. Moreover, methods, devices, and systems provided herein may be adapted for the delivery of other medications, the collection of other analyte data, and/or the treatment of other diseases. Methods, devices, and systems provided herein are described by exemplifying features and functionalities of a number of illustrative embodiments. Other implementations are also possible.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Some examples herein refer to an insulin injection pen. An insulin injection pen includes at least one container holding insulin (e.g., an insulin cartridge), a dial or other mechanism to specify a dose, and a pen needle for transcutaneous delivery of the insulin into the tissue or vasculature of the person with diabetes. In a reusable insulin injection pen, the insulin container (e.g., the cartridge) is replaceable or refillable. A prefilled insulin injection pen is intended for use during a limited time. The dose-specifying mechanism can include a rotatable wheel coupled to mechanics and/or electronics for capping the administered amount of insulin at the volume of the specified dose (e.g., in terms of a number of units of insulin). The dose-specifying mechanism can have a mechanical and/or electronic display that reflects the current setting of the mechanism. The pen needle can be permanently attached to the housing of the insulin injection pen (e.g., as in the case with a disposable pen), or it can be removable (e.g., so that a new needle can be applied when needed). For example, a replaceable pen needle can include a hollow needle affixed to a fitting configured for removeable attachment to an end of the insulin injection pen.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Some examples herein refer to a mobile communication device. As used herein a mobile communication device includes, but is not limited to, a mobile phone, a smartphone, a wearable electronic device (e.g., a smart watch), a tablet, a laptop computer, a portable computer, and similar devices. A mobile communication device includes one or more processors, a non-transitory storage device (e.g., a memory and/or a hard drive) holding executable instructions for operating the mobile communication device, wireless communication components, and one or more input and/or output devices (e.g., a touchscreen, display, or keyboard). The mobile communication device can operate according to one or more application programs stored locally on the mobile communication device, or remotely (e.g., when using cloud computing), or combinations thereof. The mobile communication device can execute at least one operating system in order to perform functions and services.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Some examples herein refer to a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). A CGM is an electronic device configured to take readings of glucose values on an ongoing basis or at regular intervals in order to estimate the blood glucose level of the person with diabetes. Some CGMs determine blood glucose values periodically (e.g., after a certain number of seconds or minutes) and output the information automatically or upon being prompted. The CGM may include wireless communication components for one or more types of signaling, including, but not limited to, Near-Field Communication (NFC) and/or Bluetooth communication.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, systems, devices, and methods provided herein can recommend insulin doses (e.g., dosages of long-acting and/or rapid-acting insulin) using any suitable technique. In some embodiments, recommended insulin dosages may be based upon blood glucose data (e.g., current estimated glucose value (EGV) from a CGM), flash glucose monitor, blood glucose meter, or any other sensor, blood glucose trend data, etc.), insulin administration data (bolus dosage amounts of rapid-acting insulin, dosages of long-acting insulin, dosage times, calculation of Insulin-on-Board (&#x201c;IOB&#x201d;) and/or active insulin, etc.), meal data (mealtimes, user estimated carbohydrates, user estimated meal categorizations, user estimated glycemic impact of meal user meal history, user meal trends, etc.), and/or one or more insulin deliver parameters: total daily dose of basal insulin or long-acting insulin, carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio (CR), insulin sensitivity factor (ISF), etc.). Methods, devices and systems provided herein can, in some embodiments, adjust insulin delivery parameters over time based on glucose data and/or insulin administration data.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Some examples herein refer to long-acting insulin and rapid-acting insulin, or in some cases more generally to first and second types of insulin. Insulin used for therapeutic treatment is often synthesized human insulin. Moreover, different insulins can be characterized in how quickly they typically begin to work in the body of the person with diabetes after administration, and/or how long they typically remain active in the body of the person with diabetes. Rapid-acting insulin can be used to dose for meals or to correct high blood sugar. There is more than one type of insulin that can be considered a rapid-acting insulin. Many, but not necessary all, rapid-acting insulins begin working within about one hour after administration. Similarly, there is more than one type of insulin that can be considered a long-acting insulin, and many, but not necessarily all, long-acting insulins begin working about one hour or longer after administration. Long-acting insulin is often referred to as basal insulin (e.g., insulin used to support basic metabolic needs). Generally, a long-acting insulin has a greater active time (i.e., the length of time that the insulin continues to be active in the body of the person with diabetes after administration) than a rapid-acting insulin. As such, a long-acting insulin is an example of a type of insulin having an active time that is longer than an active time for a type of insulin such as a rapid-acting insulin.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Examples herein refer to TDBD. The TDBD can reflect a setting of an insulin therapy corresponding to the amount of long-acting insulin to be administered. The actual TDBD of a person with diabetes may not be known. Rather, a programmed TDBD value can be entered into a diabetes therapy management system for the person and can be adjusted as needed. A TDBD mismatch value, moreover, can represent a determination of a relationship between the programmed TDBD value and the unknown actual TDBD value. In some implementations, the determined TDBD mismatch value represents a division of the programmed TDBD value with the unknown actual TDBD value. For example, a new (i.e., adjusted) TDBD value can be calculated by dividing the programmed TDBD value by the determined TDBD mismatch value. The term TDBD is sometimes often applied in the context of insulin therapy administration by way of a pump device. Other terms can be used to refer to the dosage of long-acting insulin over a 24-hour period, including, but not limited to, daily long-acting insulin. As used herein, the term TDBD also includes the concept of daily long-acting insulin.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a system <b>100</b> for training a TDBD regression model. The system <b>100</b> can be used with one or more other examples described elsewhere herein. The system <b>100</b> can involve the following stages: gathering data <b>102</b>; preprocessing the data <b>102</b> at <b>104</b> (into a training dataset <b>106</b>) and at <b>108</b> (into a testing dataset <b>110</b>); researching the regression model, in terms of an algorithm <b>116</b> and an evaluation <b>118</b> that are based on the training dataset <b>106</b> at <b>112</b>, by way of one or more iterations 120; testing the regression model using the testing dataset <b>110</b> at <b>114</b>; training, at <b>121</b>, a TDBD regression model <b>122</b>; and evaluating the TDBD regression model <b>122</b> using production data <b>124</b> to make one or more predictions <b>126</b>. In some implementations, the training dataset <b>106</b> can include both a set of training data and a set of validation data.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The data <b>102</b> can include actual patient data or simulated data, or combinations thereof. For example, data can be provided on a real-time basis or from storage. The data <b>102</b> can be preprocessed to clean the data <b>102</b>. For example, the data <b>102</b> can be converted from a raw format (e.g., a format as collected) into a format suitable for regression analysis. As another example, noise can be removed from the data <b>102</b>, and/or inconsistencies in the data <b>102</b> can be removed. As another example, missing values in the data <b>102</b> can be ignored (e.g., by removing a remainder of a column or row of the missing value). The training can involve supervised or unsupervised learning. In some implementations, supervised learning involves regression to learn how to predict a numerical value of a continuous variable.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The TDBD regression model <b>122</b> can take as inputs at least blood glucose values for a person with diabetes and time-of-administration information for the insulin therapy treatment. In some implementations, the blood glucose values are read, estimated, or inferred using one or more devices (e.g., a CGM or a BGM). For example, blood glucose values can be collected from the person with diabetes at regular intervals. In some implementations, the time-of-administration information (e.g., when the person ingested insulin, sometimes referred to as time-of-bolus information) can be read, estimated, or inferred using one or more devices (e.g., an insulin injection pen, or a pen cap of the insulin injection pen).

In some implementations, pen cap usage data can be detected. For example, the pen cap usage data can be based on one or more capping or uncapping events of a pen cap for an insulin injection pen. One or more of dose times data or pen cap usage data can be used in some implementations. For example, the dose times data can be determined or inferred from the pen cap usage data. In some implementations, about two weeks of blood glucose data and dosage timing information can be received. In some implementations, the time period between therapy parameter adjustments can be configurable by an algorithm.
