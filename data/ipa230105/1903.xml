In the brake system, the interface between motor vehicle and trailer is standardized with appropriate compressed air connections.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, the electrification of brake systems in modern vehicles is an attractive way to reduce auxiliary energy consumption, space need and noise emissions. As trailers usually have a longer life cycle, and hence could have many different owners throughout their life cycles, a solution for the electrification of brake systems of motor vehicles should be compatible with existing brake systems of trailers, which usually still work with pneumatic brakes, in order to be able to continue using existing trailers with pneumatic brakes. Therefore, a solution is required, which is able to control, the pneumatic brake system of a trailer from the electro-mechanic brake system which is used preferably in modern motor vehicles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In state of the art brake systems for motor vehicles and trailers, for example described in document DE10310235A1, the brakes of the trailer are controlled by trailer control valves (TCV) or a so-called trailer control module (TCM), which is/are positioned in the motor vehicle and therefore forms/form part of its brake system. In order to be able to provide brake pressure even if one signal does not work, a redundant independent signal is necessary. Hence, the TCVs/TCM comprise at least two independent control input terminals that are able to receive inputs from an electronic control unit (ECU) that processes the signals from a service brake, which is operated by the operator of the vehicle, if there is a need to slow the vehicle down. Those inputs from the ECU to the TCVs/TCM are either both pneumatic in case of the use of TCVs or one is pneumatic and one is electric from an electric control line in case of the use of a TCM. Moreover, TCMs comprise an inverted pneumatic control input coming from the parking brake, a compressed air supply inlet and two coupling head outputs, one for the air supply of the trailer and one for the electric control line for the trailer brakes. Furthermore, there is optionally a digital communication line between the motor vehicle and the trailer in the form of a 24V CAN bus, standardized according to ISO 11992. The description of an internal design of a state-of-the-art TCM is provided for example in the document EP1127764. A TCM according to the state of the art disclosed in the document is provided with three different solenoid valves, with which in combination of a relay valve allows to adjust the brake pressure for the braking units of a motor vehicle trailer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With modern electro-mechanic brake systems of motor vehicles being able to provide only electrical outputs instead of at least one pneumatic output, the need for new TCMs arises. Therefore, it is the objective of the present invention to provide a TCM and a brake system for a motor vehicle with a TCM that are compatible with the pneumatic state-of-the-art trailer brake systems described above.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such a TCM and a brake system for a motor vehicle with the TCM is provided by the subject-matters of the independent claims. Further developments of the invention with advantageous effects are provided by the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A trailer control module for a brake system of a motor vehicle according to the present invention is configured to provide a preset brake control outlet pressure to a pneumatic trailer brake system and comprises at least two electrical terminals, which are configured to receive two independent but redundant electrical control input signals, which comprise the signal for the preset brake control outlet pressure. It further comprises at least one pneumatic inlet terminal, which is configured to receive constant pressure from an air pressure source, at least one valve, configured to adjust the constant air pressure from the air pressure source to the preset break outlet pressure, and at least one pneumatic outlet terminal, configured to provide the preset brake control outlet pressure to the pneumatic brake system of the trailer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention the trailer control module comprises at least two control solenoid groups, each including a load- and an exhaust valve and each group allowing to control the brake control outlet pressure by itself and independently from one another via its own control channel. Each solenoid group is provided with its own independent but redundant signal from the two different ECUs. Hence, in order for the TCM to be able to process both different but redundant electric signals independently from each other in order to satisfy the existing safety requirements, it also needs two separate control channels in which the electric signals can be processed to the brake control outlet pressure. Thus, the control channel is formed by the technical elements like valves that define the brake control outlet pressure. An advantage of the use of solenoids in the TCM is that solenoids are well known in the state of the art, easy to handle also in terms of maintenance and don't need a lot of energy to be operated.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further advantageous embodiment of the TCM according to the invention comprises a normally opened exhaust valve for normally not parked trailer control for each control channel of its relay valve.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, the TCM comprises a normally closed exhaust valve and a feedback orifice to achive a bistable parking brake operation for normally parked trailer control for each control channel of its relay valve.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another advantageous embodiment of the invention the TCM comprises a normally closed exhaust valve and a feedback orifice for normally parked trailer control for one control channel and a normally opened exhaust valve for normally not parked trailer control for another control channel of its relay valve.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet another advantageous embodiment of the invention the TCM comprises at least two independent pressure sensors, configured to measure the brake control outlet pressure of the trailer. In this way the correct functionality of the brake system and the TCM can easily be controlled and adjusted by the ECUs of the motor vehicle brake system if necessary.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, the trailer control module comprises a hold back valve to trigger the automatic trailer emergency braking at disconnection.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A motor vehicle brake system according to the invention comprises, at least two independent brake control units (ECUs) which are configured to provide the TCM with at least two independent but redundant electronic signals comprising the signal for the preset brake control outlet pressure. It further comprises a trailer control module according to the invention and an air pressure source, configured to supply a constant pneumatic pressure to the brakes of the trailer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an advantageous embodiment of the motor vehicle brake system according to the invention, it further comprises a communication line between the trailer and the brake control units, wherein a multiplexer is configured to connect the trailer to either one or the other brake control unit, so that only one brake control unit is connected with the trailer at the time.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of one or more preferred embodiments when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> a schematic layout of the motor vehicle brake system according to an embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> a schematic layout of the architecture of a TCM according to and embodiment of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic layout of the motor vehicle brake system according to an embodiment of the invention.

The pneumatic pressure of the air pressure source <b>60</b> is provided at an air pressure source inlet A.
