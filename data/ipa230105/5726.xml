More particularly, the teachings herein relate to systems and methods for measuring the product ions of the precursor ion mass selection windows produced from using two or more different dissociation methods within each cycle time of a DIA tandem mass spectrometry method.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The systems and methods disclosed herein can also be performed using an additional and preceding sample separation device such as, but not limited to, a liquid chromatography (LC) device, or a differential mobility separation (DMS), or ion mobility (IM). The systems and methods disclosed herein can also be performed in conjunction with a processor, controller, microcontroller, or computer system, such as the computer system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="2">Single Dissociation Technique in MS/MS Experiments</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In conventional biologic characterization, a single dissociation or fragmentation technique may not provide enough information to identify analytes in mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments. MS/MS data is routinely used to identify and quantify species with a high level of selectivity. Relying on selective fragmentation to record the response of an analyte is at the base of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and DIA analysis.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">DIA, for example, is used in conventional peptide analysis. In this analysis, alignment of y-ions signals (typically 3 or more) is used to determine that the appropriate peptide is detected and quantified. Alignment of all liquid chromatography (LC) peaks at a given retention time (RT) is also used to generate MS/MS data for identification and confirmation that the right compound is detected (MS/MS spectra generate). This approach works well if selective fragments are generated for the species of interest (peptide/metabolites). However, this approach can become problematic if species share many common fragment ions (e.g., glycol peptide forming glycan fragments) or if little or no useful fragment information can be obtained (e.g., disulfide-linked peptides). In other words, in an MS/MS experiment, the dissociation or fragmentation technique used may not provide enough information to distinguish the analyte product ions from many other common product ions present in the sample.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One solution recently proposed to address this problem is to trigger a second orthogonal dissociation or fragmentation technique when it appears that not enough distinguishing fragmentation information might be obtained. A second orthogonal technique is one that uses a different mechanism of dissociation or fragmentation known to produce different types of fragments than the first technique used. As described below, an information-dependent acquisition (IDA) or data-dependent acquisition (DDA) method can be used, for example, to trigger a second orthogonal technique.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/877,173 (hereinafter the &#x201c;'173 application&#x201d;), for example, which is incorporated herein in its entirety, electron-based dissociation (ExD) is triggered in an IDA method when alkali-metal adducts of a compound are detected. When collision-induced dissociation (CID) MS/MS is performed on equivalent alkali-metal adducts of the same compound, such as [M+Na]<sup>+</sup> or [M+K]<sup>+</sup>, weak or no fragment ions are typically observed. This reduces the effectiveness of IDA and the amount of information generated in metabolomic applications.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Electron-based dissociation (ExD) techniques, however, are known to be able to dissociate alkali-metal adducts. As a result, the '173 application is directed to detect alkali-metal adducts and trigger an ExD technique for the detected alkali-metal adducts in an IDA method. In this IDA method, the ExD technique is the second dissociation technique used. This second ExD technique is orthogonal to the first CID technique.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an IDA method, certain precursor ions can be dissociated using both of the two dissociation techniques or certain precursor ions can be dissociated using either one of the two dissociation techniques. IDA relies on real-time logic and requires a significant effort on the part of the user to set up the method before acquisition. In other words, IDA is a complex MS/MS acquisition method and it does not guarantee that required MSMS information will be collected for compounds of interest.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, in an IDA method, additional or complementary information is only obtained for certain instances where it is predicted that this information might be available. For all other instances, this additional or complementary information is not obtained. As a result, if it is later found that there are precursor ions in other areas of the mass range that should be interrogated for additional or complementary product ion information, there is no other recourse than to conduct another experiment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a result, additional systems and methods are needed to be able to dissociate precursor ions using two or more different dissociation techniques in an MS/MS method other than IDA. These systems and methods are needed in order to provide enough information to distinguish analyte product ions from many other common product ions present in the sample.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="2">Fragmentation Techniques Background</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Electron-based dissociation (ExD), ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD), infrared photodissociation (IRMPD), and collision-induced dissociation (CID) are often used as fragmentation techniques for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). CID is the most conventional technique for dissociation in tandem mass spectrometers.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">ExD can include, but is not limited to, electron-induced dissociation (EID), electron impact excitation in organics (EIEIO), electron capture dissociation (ECD), or electron transfer dissociation (ETD).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Background on Mass Spectrometry Techniques</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Mass spectrometers are often coupled with chromatography or other separation systems in order to identify and characterize eluting known compounds of interest from a sample. In such a coupled system, the eluting solvent is ionized and a series of mass spectra are obtained from the eluting solvent at specified time intervals called retention times. These retention times range from, for example, 1 second to 100 minutes or greater. The series of mass spectra form a chromatogram, or extracted ion chromatogram (XIC).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Peaks found in the XIC are used to identify or characterize a known peptide or compound in the sample. More particularly, the retention times of peaks and/or the area of peaks are used to identify or characterize (quantify) a known peptide or compound in the sample.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In traditional separation coupled mass spectrometry systems, a fragment or product ion of a known compound is selected for analysis. A tandem mass spectrometry or mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MS/MS) scan is then performed at each interval of the separation for a mass range that includes the product ion. The intensity of the product ion found in each MS/MS scan is collected over time and analyzed as a collection of spectra, or an XIC, for example.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In general, tandem mass spectrometry, or MS/MS, is a well-known technique for analyzing compounds. Tandem mass spectrometry involves ionization of one or more compounds from a sample, selection of one or more precursor ions of the one or more compounds, fragmentation of the one or more precursor ions into fragment or product ions, and mass analysis of the product ions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Tandem mass spectrometry can provide both qualitative and quantitative information. The product ion spectrum can be used to identify a molecule of interest. The intensity of one or more product ions can be used to quantitate the amount of the compound present in a sample.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A large number of different types of experimental methods or workflows can be performed using a tandem mass spectrometer. Three broad categories of these workflows are targeted acquisition, information-dependent acquisition (IDA) or data-dependent acquisition (DDA), and data-independent acquisition (DIA).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a targeted acquisition method, one or more transitions of a precursor ion to a product ion are predefined for a compound of interest. As a sample is being introduced into the tandem mass spectrometer, the one or more transitions are interrogated or monitored during each time period or cycle of a plurality of time periods or cycles. In other words, the mass spectrometer selects and fragments the precursor ion of each transition and performs a targeted mass analysis only for the product ion of the transition. As a result, an intensity (a product ion intensity) is produced for each transition. Targeted acquisition methods include, but are not limited to, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an IDA method, a user can specify criteria for performing an untargeted mass analysis of product ions, while a sample is being introduced into the tandem mass spectrometer. For example, in an IDA method, a precursor ion or mass spectrometry (MS) survey scan is performed to generate a precursor ion peak list. The user can select criteria to filter the peak list for a subset of the precursor ions on the peak list. MS/MS is then performed on each precursor ion of the subset of precursor ions. A product ion spectrum is produced for each precursor ion. MS/MS is repeatedly performed on the precursor ions of the subset of precursor ions as the sample is being introduced into the tandem mass spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In proteomics and many other sample types, however, the complexity and dynamic range of compounds are very large. This poses challenges for traditional targeted and IDA methods, requiring very high-speed MS/MS acquisition to deeply interrogate the sample in order to both identify and quantify a broad range of analytes.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As a result, DIA methods, the third broad category of tandem mass spectrometry, were developed. These DIA methods have been used to increase the reproducibility and comprehensiveness of data collection from complex samples. DIA methods can also be called non-specific fragmentation methods. In a traditional DIA method, the actions of the tandem mass spectrometer are not varied among MS/MS scans based on data acquired in a previous precursor or product ion scan. Instead, a precursor ion mass range is selected. A precursor ion mass selection window is then stepped across the precursor ion mass range. All precursor ions in the precursor ion mass selection window are fragmented and all of the product ions of all of the precursor ions in the precursor ion mass selection window are mass analyzed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The precursor ion mass selection window used to scan the mass range can be very narrow so that the likelihood of multiple precursors within the window is small. This type of DIA method is called, for example, MS/MS<sup>ALL</sup>. In an MS/MS<sup>ALL </sup>method, a precursor ion mass selection window of about 1 amu is scanned or stepped across an entire mass range. A product ion spectrum is produced for each 1 amu precursor mass window. The time it takes to analyze or scan the entire mass range once is referred to as one scan cycle. Scanning a narrow precursor ion mass selection window across a wide precursor ion mass range during each cycle, however, is not practical for some instruments and experiments.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As a result, a larger precursor ion mass selection window, or selection window with a greater width, is stepped across the entire precursor mass range. This type of DIA method is called, for example, SWATH acquisition. In a SWATH acquisition, the precursor ion mass selection window stepped across the precursor mass range in each cycle may have a width of 5-25 amu, or even larger. Like the MS/MS' method, all the precursor ions in each precursor ion mass selection window are fragmented, and all of the product ions of all of the precursor ions in each mass selection window are mass analyzed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">U.S. Pat. No. 8,809,770, which is incorporated herein in its entirety, describes how SWATH acquisition can be used to provide quantitative and qualitative information about the precursor ions of compounds of interest. In particular, the product ions found from fragmenting a precursor ion mass selection window are compared to a database of known product ions of compounds of interest. In addition, ion traces or XICs of the product ions found from fragmenting a precursor ion mass selection window are analyzed to provide quantitative and qualitative information.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exemplary diagram <b>200</b> of a precursor ion mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range that is divided into ten precursor ion mass selection windows for a data independent acquisition (DIA) SWATH workflow.

A tandem mass spectrometer that can perform a SWATH acquisition method can further be coupled with a sample introduction device that separates one or more compounds from the sample over time, for example. A sample introduction device can introduce a sample to the tandem mass spectrometer using a technique that includes, but is not limited to, injection, liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, or capillary electrophoresis. The separated one or more compounds are ionized by an ion source, producing an ion beam of precursor ions of the one or more compounds that are selected and fragmented by the tandem mass spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As a result, for each time step of a sample introduction of separated compounds, each of the ten precursor ion mass selection windows is selected and then fragmented, producing ten product ion spectra for the entire m/z range. In other words, each of the ten precursor ion mass selection windows is selected and then fragmented during each cycle of a plurality of cycles.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exemplary diagram <b>300</b> that graphically depicts the steps for obtaining product ion traces or XICs from each precursor ion mass selection window during each cycle of a DIA workflow.

For example, product ion spectrum <b>311</b> is obtained by fragmenting precursor ion mass selection window <b>201</b> during cycle <b>1</b>, product ion spectrum <b>312</b> is obtained by fragmenting precursor ion mass selection window <b>201</b> during cycle <b>2</b>, and product ion spectrum <b>313</b> is obtained by fragmenting precursor ion mass selection window <b>201</b> during cycle <b>1000</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">By plotting the intensities of the product ions in each product ion spectrum of each precursor ion mass selection window over time, XICs can be calculated for each product ion produced from each precursor ion mass selection window. For example, plot <b>320</b> includes the XICs calculated for each product ion of the 1000 product ion spectra of precursor ion mass selection window <b>201</b>. Note that XICs can be plotted in terms of time or cycles.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The XICs in plot <b>320</b> are shown plotted in two dimensions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. However, each XIC is actually three-dimensional, because the different XICs are calculated for different m/z values.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exemplary diagram <b>400</b> that shows the three-dimensionality of product ion XICs obtained for a precursor ion mass selection window over time. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the x axis is time or cycle number, they axis is product ion intensity, and the z axis is m/z. From this three-dimensional plot, more information is obtained. For example, XIC peaks <b>410</b> and <b>420</b> both have the same shape and occur at the same time, or same retention time. However, XIC peaks <b>410</b> and <b>420</b> have different m/z values. This may mean that XIC peaks <b>410</b> and <b>420</b> are isotopic peaks or represent different product ions from the same precursor ion. Similarly, XIC peaks <b>430</b> and <b>440</b> have the same m/z value but occur at different times. This may mean that XIC peaks <b>430</b> and <b>440</b> are the same product ion, but they are from two different precursor ions.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> show how mass and retention time can be used to characterize compounds such as peptides using a DIA method. However, as described above, this approach works well if selective fragments are generated for the species of interest. However, this approach can become problematic if species share many common fragment ions or if little or no useful fragment information can be obtained. As a result, additional systems and methods are needed to discriminate compounds or peptides with similar mass and minor differences in retention time behavior.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Background on Cycle Time</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cycle time, scan time, or duty cycle time of a DIA experiment is the amount of time it takes to acquire all of the targeted MS/MS data for the entire mass range. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in a conventional DIA method, the cycle time is the amount of time it takes to acquire all of the MS/MS data for all ten precursor ion mass selection windows <b>201</b> to <b>210</b>. In other words, the cycle time is the amount of time it takes to perform each cycle.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The cycle time is a user specified parameter for an experiment. The cycle time selected has implications for other times. For example, the dwell time may refer to the amount of time any of the ten precursor ion mass selection windows <b>201</b> to <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is selected, dissociated, and mass analyzed. A longer cycle time allows for a longer dwell time, which, in turn, produces higher quality results for each precursor ion mass selection window.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, the length of the cycle time is typically limited based on chromatographic considerations. Each cycle time provides a data point across an LC or XIC peak. As a result, shorter cycle times provide more points across an LC or XIC peak. Typically, for example, a cycle time that provides 10-15 data points across an LC or XIC peak is optimal for accurate quantitation and reproducibility.

The dissociation or fragmentation technique used may not provide enough information to distinguish analyte product ions from many other common product ions present in the sample.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">One solution recently proposed to address this problem is to trigger a second orthogonal dissociation or fragmentation technique when it appears that not enough distinguishing fragmentation information might be obtained. An IDA or DDA method can be used, for example, to trigger a second orthogonal technique. However, IDA relies on real-time logic and requires a significant effort on the part of the user to set up the method before acquisition. In other words, IDA is a complex MS/MS acquisition method. In addition, in an IDA method, additional or complementary information is only obtained for certain instances where it is predicted that this information might be available.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As a result, additional systems and methods are needed to be able to dissociate precursor ions using two or more different dissociation techniques in an MS/MS method other than IDA. These systems and methods are needed in order to provide enough information to distinguish analyte product ions from many other common product ions present in the sample.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In various embodiments, a tandem mass spectrometer is modified to include one or more dissociation devices capable of performing at least two different or orthogonal dissociation techniques. The tandem mass spectrometer is then operated to perform a DIA method in which each precursor ion mass selection window of a plurality of precursor ion mass selection windows is fragmented using each of the at least two different or orthogonal dissociation techniques within the cycle time.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, SCIEX of Framingham, Mass. has developed a single dissociation device that can perform CID or ECD. This device is called a Chimera ECD and CID collision cell. A key to this collision cell is its multi-device interface. This multi-device interface is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,358,488, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cutaway three-dimensional perspective view <b>500</b> of a Chimera ECD and CID collision cell, in accordance with various embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows that the dissociation of analyte ions can be performed selectively at location <b>511</b>, in Chimera ECD multi-device interface <b>514</b> or at location <b>512</b> in CID collision cell <b>515</b>. In this case, a single device, the Chimera ECD and CID collision cell, is capable of performing at least two different or orthogonal dissociation techniques. In various alternative embodiments, more than one dissociation device can be used.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A tandem mass spectrometer, including the Chimera ECD and CID collision, can then be operated to perform a DIA method in which each precursor ion mass selection window of a plurality of precursor ion mass selection windows is fragmented using each of the at least two different or orthogonal dissociation techniques within the cycle time. Ideally, the at least two different or orthogonal dissociation techniques generate complementary and unique product ions.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an exemplary flowchart <b>600</b> showing the steps performed in a single cycle of a DIA method in which each precursor ion mass selection window of a plurality of precursor ion mass selection windows is fragmented using each of two orthogonal dissociation techniques (CID and ECD), in accordance with various embodiments. In the DIA method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the mass range of 500-800 m/z is analyzed. Within a specified cycle time, seven steps are performed. First, in step <b>610</b>, the entire mass range of 500-800 m/z is selected and mass analyzed to determine the precursor ions in the mass range. In steps <b>620</b>-<b>640</b>, precursor ion mass selection windows of 500-600, 600-700, and 700-800 m/z, respectively, are selected, the precursor ions within these windows are dissociated or fragmented using CID, and the resulting product ions are mass analyzed. In steps <b>650</b>-<b>670</b>, precursor ion mass selection windows of 500-600, 600-700, and 700-800 m/z, respectively, are selected, the precursor ions within these windows are dissociated or fragmented using ECD, and the resulting product ions are mass analyzed.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the three precursor ion mass selection windows are all first dissociated using CID and then these three windows are all dissociated using ECD. In other words, the steps within the cycle time are ordered by dissociation technique.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In various alternative embodiments, the dissociation of one window using a first dissociation technique can immediately be followed by dissociation of the same window or another window using the second dissociation technique. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, step <b>620</b> may be followed by step <b>650</b> instead of step <b>630</b>. In other words, the steps within the cycle time can be ordered by precursor ion mass selection window range, for example.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the number of the precursor ion mass selection windows dissociated by CID and the range of each precursor ion mass selection windows dissociated by CID are the same as the number of the precursor ion mass selection windows dissociated by ECD and the range of each precursor ion mass selection windows dissociated by ECD. In other words, ECD is used to dissociate the same windows dissociated by CID.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In various alternative embodiments, the number of the precursor ion mass selection windows dissociated by CID can differ from the number of the precursor ion mass selection windows dissociated by ECD. Also, the range of each precursor ion mass selection windows dissociated by CID can differ from the range of each precursor ion mass selection windows dissociated by ECD. Also, the precursor ion mass window size can be different between CID and ECD. In other words, ECD can be used to dissociate different windows than CID. Both techniques, however, should still analyze the same overall precursor ion mass range. Note that using different precursor ion mass selection windows for different dissociation techniques makes comparing the data more difficult since product ions of differing precursor ion mass selection windows have to be compared, but could offer advantages in teasing out MSMS information.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Note that prior to the present embodiments described herein, it was not thought possible by those skilled in the art to perform two dissociation techniques across a useful mass range within a single cycle time using a DIA method. In other words, it was thought that there was not enough time to dissociate the precursor ion mass selection windows of a DIA method twice and still get enough data points across an LC peak.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In various embodiments, due to at least two recent improvements, it is now possible to dissociate the precursor ion mass selection windows of a DIA method twice and still get enough data points across an LC peak. First of all, dissociation devices that provide dissociation techniques other than CID have recently been significantly improved. For example, using the Chimera ECD and CID collision cell of SCIEX, a precursor ion mass selection window can now be selected, dissociated using ECD, and mass analyzed within 50 to 100 ms (or even less).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Secondly, using samples from which analytes can be well separated allows larger precursor ion mass selection windows to be used in a DIA method, which, in turn, requires fewer dissociation steps. For example, it has been found that since most biologic analyses originate from a simplified digest that can be well separated by LC, larger precursor ion mass selection windows (100-200 m/z wide) can be used. This allows a smaller number of precursor ion mass selection windows to be used, which means fewer dissociation steps within each cycle time. In other words, for certain samples, larger precursor ion mass selection windows can be used, which allows enough time to perform at least two different dissociation techniques on these windows.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">This also opens up the possibility to interrogate data in the MS/MS mode to identify regions of interest using the first dissociation technique. Then, the identified region of interest is used to process the data from the second dissociation technique. For example, in the analysis of glycopeptides, an XIC calculated from the CID MS/MS of a specific glycan residue can be used to generate the location of glycopeptides. Then, an XIC calculated from the ECD MS/MS can be used to identify the specific glycopeptide fragments.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Performing at least two different or orthogonal dissociation techniques on the precursor ion mass selection windows in a DIA method provides a number of advantages over triggering a second orthogonal dissociation in an IDA method. For example, from a user perspective, the set up of a DIA method is much simpler than IDA method. In addition, as described above, in an IDA method, additional or complementary information is only obtained for certain instances where it is predicted that this information might be available. So, the complementary information is not available for the entire mass range.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In contrast, in a DIA method, the complementary information from both dissociation techniques is available for the entire mass range. As a result, if it is later found that there are precursor ions in other areas of the mass range that should be interrogated for additional or complementary product ion information, there is no need to conduct another experiment. The data already collected can be interrogated for this information.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">System for Orthogonal Dissociation in DIA</heading><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a system <b>700</b> for performing at least two different dissociation techniques in each cycle of a DIA mass spectrometry experiment, in accordance with various embodiments.
