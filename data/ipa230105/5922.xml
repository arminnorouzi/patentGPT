To further reduce the occupied area of the DRAM, when the DRAM is scaled proportionally, a problem such as the proximity gate effect occurs, which will adversely affect the electrical performance of the DRAM. If vertical gate-all-around (GAA) transistors are used as access transistors, the area occupied by the GAA transistors can reach 4F2. In principle, higher density efficiency can be achieved, but there are problems such as difficulty in word line etching within some size ranges due to the limitations of the equipment used in the manufacturing process and the manufacturing process.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An overview of the subject matter detailed in the present disclosure is provided below, which is not intended to limit the protection scope of the claims.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the embodiments of the present disclosure, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor structure is provided and includes: providing a base; forming bit lines on the base, and forming semiconductor channels on surfaces of the bit lines away from the base, the semiconductor channel including a first doped region, a channel region and a second doped region sequentially arranged along a direction that the base points to the bit line; forming a first dielectric layer, the first dielectric layer surrounding sidewalls of the semiconductor channels; and a first gap being provided between parts of the first dielectric layer located on sidewalls of adjacent semiconductor channels on a same bit line; forming a second dielectric layer, the second dielectric layer filling up the first gaps; and a material of the second dielectric layer being different from a material of the first dielectric layer; removing a part of the first dielectric layer to expose sidewalls of the channel regions; forming an insulating layer, the insulating layer covering at least sidewall surfaces of the channel regions; and second gaps being provided between the insulating layer and the second dielectric layer; and forming word lines, the word lines filling up the second gaps.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a second aspect of the embodiments of the present disclosure, a semiconductor structure is provided and includes: a base; bit lines, located on the base; semiconductor channels, located on surfaces of the bit lines, the semiconductor channel including a first doped region, a channel region and a second doped region sequentially arranged along a direction that the base points to the bit line; and the first doped region being in contact with the bit line; a first dielectric layer, surrounding the first doped regions, and a first gap being provided between parts of the first dielectric layer covering sidewalls of adjacent first doped regions on a same bit line; an insulating layer, covering at least sidewall surfaces of the channel regions; word lines, surrounding the insulating layer located on sidewalls of the channel regions, and a second gap being provided between adjacent word lines; and an isolation layer, located at least in the first gaps and the second gaps, and a top surface of the isolation layer away from the base being not lower than a top surface of the second doped region away from the base.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other aspects of the present disclosure are understandable upon reading and understanding of the drawings and detailed description.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The accompanying drawings incorporated into the specification and constituting part of the specification illustrate the embodiments of the present disclosure, and are used together with the description to explain the principles of the embodiments of the present disclosure.

Apparently, the described embodiments are merely some rather than all of the embodiments of the present disclosure. All other embodiments obtained by those skilled in the art based on the embodiments of the present disclosure without creative efforts should fall within the protection scope of the present disclosure. It should be noted that the embodiments in the present disclosure and features in the embodiments may be combined with each other in a non-conflicting manner.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is found through analyses that when word lines surrounding the sidewalls of the channel regions of the semiconductor channels in the GAA transistor are formed, deposition and etching processes are usually required to form a plurality of discrete word lines. However, due to the relatively high integration and the relatively small gap between adjacent semiconductor channels, the etching precision is difficult to control when the word lines are formed through the etching process, and thus the dimensional precision for forming the word lines is also difficult to control. In addition, when the size of the GAA transistor is relatively small, it is difficult to control the doping concentration of each region of the semiconductor channel to form a GAA junction transistor with a vertical structure, which affects the yield of the PN junction formed finally.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The embodiments of the present disclosure provide a semiconductor structure and a manufacturing method thereof. In the manufacturing method, a part of the first dielectric layer occupies the positions of the insulating layer and word lines to be formed subsequently. After the second dielectric layer is formed, when a part of the first dielectric layer on the sidewalls of the channel regions is removed, the remaining part of the first dielectric layer is located on the sidewalls of the first doped regions, such that when the insulating layer is formed on the sidewalls of the channel regions, the remaining part of the first dielectric layer can protect the first doped regions from impacts. In addition, second gaps are formed between the insulating layer and the second dielectric layer. Word lines with a highly accurate size can be formed in the second gaps in a self-aligned manner, without the etching process, which is beneficial to simplify the forming the word lines. Moreover, adjusting the size of the second gaps can obtain word lines with a small size. In addition, the doping concentrations of the doped ion in the first doped region, the channel region, and the second doped region may be the same, such that the device formed in a semiconductor channel <b>105</b> is junctionless transistor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method of manufacturing a semiconductor structure.
