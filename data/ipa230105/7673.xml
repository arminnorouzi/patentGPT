Therefore, the 5G, advanced 5G or pre-5G communication system is also called a &#x201c;beyond 4G network&#x201d; or a &#x201c;post LTE system.&#x201d; The 5G communication system is considered to be implemented to include higher frequency (mmWave) bands, such as 28 GHz or 60 GHz bands or, in general, above 6 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates, or in lower frequency bands, such as below 6 GHz, to enable robust coverage and mobility support. Aspects of the present disclosure may be applied to deployment of 5G communication systems, 6G or even later releases which may use THz bands. To decrease propagation loss of the radio waves and increase the transmission distance, the beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), full dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, an analog beam forming, large scale antenna techniques are discussed in 5G communication systems.

A gNB can transmit one or more of multiple types of RS including channel state information RS (CSI-RS) and demodulation RS (DMRS). A CSI-RS is intended for UEs to measure channel state information (CSI) or to perform other measurements such as ones related to mobility support.

Monitoring a PDCCH candidates means receiving and decoding the PDCCH candidate according to DCI formats the UE is configured to receive. A DCI format includes cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits in order for the UE to confirm a correct detection of the DCI format. A DCI format type is identified by a radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) that scrambles the CRC bits.

A gNB can configure a UE one or more sets of PRBs, also referred to as control resource sets, for PDCCH receptions. A PDCCH transmission can be in control channel elements (CCEs) that are included in a control resource set. A UE determines CCEs for a PDCCH reception based on a search space such as a UE-specific search space (USS) for PDCCH candidates with DCI format having CRC scrambled by a RNTI, such as a C-RNTI, that is configured to the UE by UE-specific RRC signaling for scheduling PDSCH reception or PUSCH transmission, and a common search space (CSS) for PDCCH candidates with DCI formats having CRC scrambled by other RNTIs.

However, a wireless network can also be implemented by utilizing only device-to-device (D2D) communication links without the need for fixed infrastructure components. This type of network is typically referred to as an &#x201c;ad-hoc&#x201d; network.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0076">A hybrid communication network can support devices that connect both to fixed infrastructure components and to other D2D-enabled devices. While UEs such as smartphones can be envisioned for D2D networks, vehicular communication can also be supported by a communication protocol where vehicles exchange control or data information with other vehicles or other infrastructure or UEs. Such a network is referred to as a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) network.

These three types of V2X can use &#x201c;co-operative awareness&#x201d; to provide more intelligent services for end-users. This means that transport entities, such as vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and pedestrians, can collect knowledge of their local environment (e.g., information received from other vehicles or sensor equipment in proximity) to process and share that knowledge in order to provide more intelligent services, such as cooperative collision warning or autonomous driving.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0080">V2X communications can be used to implement several types of services, that are complementary to a primary communication network, or to provide new services based on a flexibility of a network topology. V2X can support unicasting, broadcasting, or group/multicasting as potential means for V2V communication <b>800</b> where vehicles can transmit messages to all in-range V2V-enabled devices or to a subset of devices that are members of a particular group. V2X can support V2I communication <b>801</b> between one or more vehicles and an infrastructure node to provide cellular connectivity as well as specialized services related to control and safety of vehicular traffic. V2X can also support V2P communication <b>802</b>, for example to provide safety services for pedestrians or traffic management services. V2X multicast communication <b>803</b> can be used to provide safety and control messages to a large number of vehicles in a spectrally efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081">While vehicle devices can support several different communication protocols and include support of mandatory or optional features, since the traffic types, QoS requirements, and deployment topologies are distinct from other types of communications, the hardware/software on a vehicle for supporting V2X can have a reduced or specialized functionality compared to other devices. For example, protocols related to low-complexity, low-data rate, and/or low-latency for machine-type communications <b>804</b> can be supported such as, for example, traffic tracking beacons.

In step <b>1506</b>, the UE determines, based on the set of configurations, a transmission window for transmitting the S-SS/PSBCH blocks in the period.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0159">In one embodiment, the transmission window for transmitting the S-SS/PSBCH block includes one of a periodicity fixed as 16 frames, an offset N<sub>offset</sub><sup>S-SSB </sup>determined from the set of configurations, or a duration N<sub>duration</sub><sup>S-SSB </sup>determined from the set of configurations, or an interval N<sub>interval</sub><sup>S-SSB </sup>determined from the set of configurations.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0160">In step <b>1508</b>, the UE determines a set of candidate slots for transmitting the S-SS/PSBCH blocks in the transmission window.
