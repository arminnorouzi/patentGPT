Hearing impaired users, particularly those who are deaf or are hard-of-hearing users, also have their cell phone numbers assigned by their respective mobile carriers, but such hearing-impaired users use mainly text-oriented services. Captioning services are often referred to as Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS). This type of service is much-needed for users who suffer from hearing loss, including those users who prefer to use their residual hearing, spoken language, and technology to facilitate communication. Generally, the term &#x201c;hearing impairment&#x201d; describes people with any degree of hearing loss (from mild to profound), and thus hearing-impaired individuals includes those who are hard-of-hearing, deaf, or deafened.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When hearing-impaired users communicate with individuals with normal hearing through text-oriented services, many of the former feel that there is a limit to the delivery of nuance and expressive content in text-oriented communication. Also, the latter sometimes feel uncomfortable with text messaging, as speech-related nuances may be missed over text.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, hearing-impaired users (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;users&#x201d;) join a Telecommunications Relay Service (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;TRS&#x201d;) to use voice calls for smooth communication with other people. In the past, a specialized captioned telephone was used, the captioned telephone being similar to that of a captioned television. The captioned telephone converts spoken words into text for the user of the captioning service to read. For the general text service employed these days, things have not changed all that much. To use a captioning service of a CTS provider provided by the TRS, a user must obtain a specific phone number from the TRS and/or install a separate captioning device with an assigned unique phone number to use the captioning service.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a hearing-impaired subscriber (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;TRS user&#x201d;) uses this text service, the TRS user's cell number is the number that is displayed as the caller ID on the phone of the other party who received the text (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;peer user&#x201d;), and when using voice or video call service of the TRS, the virtual number of the TRS remains as a caller ID in the phone of the peer user. That is, the peer user must have both numbers stored, and it is likely that the peer user will later confuse the two numbers when calling-back to the TRS user. To simplify the process and avoid such confusion, TRS users desire the convenience of using a single integrated number when communicating with peer users so that the peer users need only to remember one phone number for the TRS user and the TRS user can utilize services like TRS to allow them to have richer communication content. Unfortunately, current TRS providers do not support these features.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, if the user is dissatisfied with the service of the CTS provider of the TRS that is currently being used and attempts to change the service, the user has the inconvenience of having to obtain an additional or new phone number from another CTS provider with a different TRS or the same TRS in order to use a different CTS service. Additionally, if the user finds a new CTS provider (within the the same TRS or outside thereof), then the user may have to pay more fees to obtain additional or different hardware to use the new CTS provider's features or services. Ultimately, whenever a new phone number is issued from the CTS provider to the user, there is an inconvenience of the user having to inform the peer of a new phone number. Therefore, both the user and the peer might have to juggle a multitude of phone numbers when figuring out how to make a call to each other. Therefore, the calling process and communication between the peer and the user can be cumbersome and inefficient with all of the phone numbers that need to be kept in track by both the user and the peer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, with the rise of the Internet and mobile communication devices such as smart phones, tablets, PDAs, computer laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, and the like, TRS users are no longer tethered to just one location as these mobile communication devices enable users the freedom of movement to take in calls wherever there is an internet wired/wireless network nearby. However, mobile network carriers may not desire to expend resources to enable their networks to handle specialized captioning data and configure their networks to handle calls for the hearing-impaired.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, to solve the above problems, various embodiments of a system for centralized captioned telephone service are provided, as there is a need for a system that accomplishes the goal of providing a captioning service to the hearing impaired over the existing mobile network infrastructure that uses a single-number rather than the typical multi-number usage and does not require the carrier to expend extensive resources in configuring the network to provide such a service. This invention is directed to solve these problems and satisfy the long-felt need.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention contrives to solve the disadvantages of the prior art. The present invention provides a system for centralized captioned telephone service.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000">The object of the invention is to provide a system for centralized captioned telephone service (&#x201c;C-CTS&#x201d;), the system including: a C-CTS system (&#x201c;C-CTSS&#x201d;) for providing a transcription service to a user subscribed to the C-CTS during a phone call with a peer; a mobile communications device of the user which includes a first phone number assigned from a carrier of the user, wherein the first phone number is associated with the C-CTSS; a communications device of the peer which includes a second phone number; and a plurality of caption providers that communicate with the C-CTSS, wherein each of the caption providers provide a captioned telephone service. The carrier of the first phone number includes a voice network, a data network, and a database that stores the first phone number of the user which is subscribed to the C-CTS, the C-CTSS including a database that stores the first phone number of the user.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">The carrier of the first phone number is configured to route a call, which originated from the first phone number and directed to the second phone number, to the C-CTSS. The call includes a call setup message from the carrier. The C-CTSS is configured to: receive a call setup message from the carrier of the first phone number; add or modify a parameter of the call setup message to a predetermined value during a call setup procedure of the call to prevent the carrier from re-routing the call to the C-CTSS; and route the call to the carrier of the first phone number.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">Another object of the invention is to provide a C-CTSS for providing a transcription service to a mobile communications device of a user during a phone call between a first phone number of the user and a second phone number of a peer, the C-CTSS including: a database that stores the first phone number of the user. When the user places a call using the first phone number to the second number of the peer, the C-CTSS is configured to: receive a call setup message which is routed from the carrier of the first phone number; add or modify a parameter of the call setup message to a predetermined value during a call setup procedure of the call to prevent the carrier from re-routing the call to the C-CTSS; and route the call to the carrier of the first phone number.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">The advantages of the present invention are: (1) the user can use one number without requiring the use of a separate TRS phone number; (2) the user can use one mobile communication device rather than using multiple devices at the same time (e.g. mobile communication device and the TRS phone); (3) the user can use several different caption providers for captioning that the C-CTS provides having to subscribe to caption providers individually; (4) little to no interruptions when switching the caption providers; (5) the user can call the peer's phone number directly and, if the peer's communication device has caller ID, then the user's mobile communication device phone number is displayed on the peer's communication device; (6) the peer can call to the user's mobile communication device phone number directly rather than having to call a TRS number of the user to reach the user indirectly, so the peer does not need to keep an extra phone number of the user or juggle between two phone numbers of the user; (7) using pre-existing network infrastructure by using the method provided by the carrier, so no need for expensive overhauls or upgrades to the network; (8) native application is easy to implement because only a packet path for caption/control is created; (9) users do not need to spend extra costs for the traffic; (10) on the carrier side, a simple network structure that can be re-routed to the C-CTSS based on user information provided in the calls routed to itself; and (11) on the carrier side, a separate upgrade is not required for the above re-routing function and measures to prevent double-triggering of this function is easily implemented.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">Although the present invention is briefly summarized, the fuller understanding of the invention can be obtained by the following drawings, detailed description and appended claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0014">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a system for centralized captioned telephone service (&#x201c;C-CTS&#x201d;) according to embodiments of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the system for C-CTS according to embodiments of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the system handling an outbound call according to embodiments of the present invention</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the system handling an outbound call according to embodiments of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of the system handling an outbound call according to embodiments of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the system handling an inbound call according to embodiments of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the system handling an inbound call according to embodiments of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of the system handling an inbound call according to embodiments of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0023">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, which form a part of this disclosure.
