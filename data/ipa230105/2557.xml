High molecular weight PAIs have excellent high temperature strength, low temperature toughness and impact strength, and exceptional chemical resistance and dimensional stability. High molecular weight PAIs can have amic acid groups in the polymer backbone that are not imidized. The amic acid groups lend some flexibility to the polymer backbone, which makes the PAIs somewhat melt processable, although not easily. However, there are still several challenges associated with melt processing of high molecular weight PAL. The melt viscosity is highly sensitive to temperature and shear rate, and the PAI has a narrow processing window with processing temperatures greater than 600&#xb0; F. (316&#xb0; C.) required. Amic acids convert thermally to imides by cyclodehydration, and conversion of amic acid groups to cyclic imide groups results in rapid increase in rigidity of the polymer backbone, and therefore a rapid increase in melt viscosity. If this happens during extrusion, there is a risk that the polymer melt might solidify in the extruder. Due to the presence of non-imidized amic acid groups, PAI is highly moisture sensitive and must be thoroughly dried before, and maintained dry during, melt processing to prevent molecular weight and thermal-mechanical property degradation. Moreover, imidization and removing water of imidization for 20 or more days at 500&#xb0; F. (260&#xb0; C.) may be required to obtain optimal properties. These difficulties have limited the use of high molecular weight PAI to the manufacture of simple stock shapes such as rods, plates, tubes, and other profiles. These stock shapes can then be machined into parts not accessible by injection molding by, for example, turning, drilling, and milling steps.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In view of the processing limitations of high molecular weight PAIs, less viscous injection molding grades have been developed. These grades can be used to produce injection-molded, filled and unfilled parts and stock-shapes, but with difficulty. Injection molding grades are believed to be mixtures of amine-terminated low molecular weight (oligomeric) polyamides with dianhydride chain-extenders, such as pyromellitic anhydride (PMDA), to build molecular weight in situ. The oligomeric nature of the polyamides lowers melt viscosity, which aids in melt processing steps, and the amine-terminated polyamide oligomer is reacted with a dianhydride to form a high molecular weight polyamide amic acid intermediate through chain-extension. After processing, the produced parts and stock shapes need to be post cured. In post curing, the amic acid groups cyclodehydrate to form the PAI. A major disadvantage of this route to PAI is that large amounts of water need to be removed from the final part. There are two sources of such water: i) physisorbed water associated with the hygroscopic residual amic acid moieties in the chain-extended PAI; and ii) water generated in the cyclodehydration step. Removing water from parts and stock shapes is a time-consuming process requiring multiples days to weeks under a programmed heating protocol that is dependent on the thickness of the part and its final application. There is a need in the art for all-aromatic PAIs that do not require extended thermal post-cure and time-consuming water removal steps.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although injection molding grade of PAI was an improvement over high molecular weight PAI, there are still many difficulties in melt processing. As discussed above, amic acid groups are still present in the chain-extended PAI, so it must be thoroughly dried before use. It is also still necessary to perform thermal post-treatment steps to complete polymerization (chain-extension) and/or imidize amic acid groups. As discussed above, water is generated in these post-treatment steps, and must be removed to avoid foaming, formation of micro bubbles, and embrittlement of the part. There are other difficulties with injection molding grade PAI as well. Residence time must be optimized, because excessive residence time will result in loss of flow due to chain extension and increasing viscosity. Molds must be filled rapidly and pressure must be optimized for each mold size and shape. Injection molding with family mold designs does not work well. The viscosity of injection molding grade PAI is still highly shear sensitive. Therefore, injection speed, injection pressure, back pressure, screw speed, barrel temperature, cycle time, and mold heating must all be optimized for each specific mold shape and size.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Post-heat treatment is still critical for injection molding grade PAL. Although as-molded parts might appear to be finished, they are actually weak, brittle, and have poor chemical resistance and wear resistance, and sub-optimal thermal resistance. To achieve optimal properties, molded parts must be heated in a forced-air oven on a cure schedule of a series of incremental temperature increases at time intervals, which must be optimized for each type and size of part. A general cure schedule recommended by a manufacturer is: 1 day at 375&#xb0; F. (191&#xb0; C.), 1 day at 425&#xb0; F. (218&#xb0; C.), 1 day at 475&#xb0; F. (246&#xb0; C.), and 5 days at 500&#xb0; F. (260&#xb0; C.), for a total of 8 days. Thicker parts can take longer to cure because the water of reaction must diffuse from the part for the reaction to proceed. Therefore, the reaction rate diminishes as the diffusion path lengthens. Moreover, certain parts, such as those with very thin walls and/or delicate features, may require fixturing during post-cure to meet tight dimensional tolerances.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the above problems, there remains a need in the art for easily melt processable and curable PAIs that do not require extensive drying before processing and do not require extensive thermal post-treatment to remove water generated from cyclodehydration of amic acid functional groups. There also remains a need for a PAI that is suitable for a variety of article manufacturing processes, e.g. for direct injection molding into complex shapes, for manufacturing unidirectional tape and fiber-reinforced composites using continuous fiber, and for 3D printing applications, such as fused deposition molding (FDM) using filaments or rods, or powder bed printing such as selective laser sintering (SLS). The subject matter described herein addresses these shortcomings in the art and more.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A reactive polyamideimide oligomer comprises units derived from at least one aromatic diamine, at least one aromatic di-, tri-, or tetra-functional carboxylic acid or functional equivalent thereof, and at least one crosslinkable monomer or crosslinkable end-capper; wherein the crosslinkable monomer or crosslinkable end-capper is reactive with the at least one aromatic diamine or at least one di-, tri- or tetra-functional aromatic carboxylic acid or functional equivalent thereof and has at least one unreacted functional group capable of chain extension and crosslinking after formation of the reactive polyamideimide oligomer; and wherein the reactive polyamideimide oligomer has a number average molecular weight (M<sub>n</sub>) of about 1,000 to about 10,000 g/mol, calculated using the Carothers equation.

The routes to polyamideimide articles described herein remove the need for an extended thermal post cure and a time-consuming water removal step. This is accomplished by designing a fully imidized reactive polyamideimide oligomer that can be melt processed followed by a short (at most a few hours) thermal post-cure to yield high molecular weight polyamideimide via chain extension/crosslinking. The latter reactions take place by incorporating carefully selected functional groups into the reactive polyamideimide oligomer. These functional groups remain unreacted during oligomerization, and are then available for thermal post-cure. During thermal post-cure, these functional groups can polymerize (chain extend/crosslink) via addition reactions without generating small molecule by-products like water.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The reactive polyamideimide oligomers with unreacted functional groups described herein allow for the production of stock-shapes, injection molded complex parts, 3D-printed parts and fiber- or mineral-reinforced composites without any thickness limitations because a water-removal step from the final product is no longer necessary. These routes to polyamideimides not only provide processing advantages (e.g., low viscosity, no residual water, no generated water), but also allows for the design and fabrication of PAI articles that were previously impossible to manufacture.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Having a M<sub>n </sub>in the range of about 1,000 to about 10,000 g/mol provides lower melt viscosities and lower processing temperatures, so that melt processing can be done using conventional melt processing equipment. However, low molecular weight polymers (oligomers) are known to have poor mechanical properties because they lack polymer chain entanglements. Using crosslinkable monomers and/or crosslinkable end-cappers in the preparation of the reactive oligomers, molecular weight can be increased either by in-situ thermal polymerization (e.g. during reaction injection molding) or during a thermal post-treatment step (e.g. when preparing fiber reinforced composites).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Several advantages accrue to the reactive polyamideimide oligomers, which have thermally curable groups. The reactive polyamideimide oligomers are easily melt processable, do not require extensive drying before processing, and do not require extensive thermal post-treatment. Complex parts can be made from the reactive polyamideimide oligomer in one step. Curing can be done at about 300 to about 450&#xb0; C. and can be completed in as little as about 1 to about 60 minutes compared to several days for currently available grades of PAL. When the reactive polyamideimide oligomer is fully imidized prior to melt processing, there is no need for the difficult step of water removal from stock shapes or injection molded parts.

As discussed above, the reactive polyamideimide oligomer is manufactured via formation of a reactive polyamide amic acid oligomer intermediate. The temperature and time required to imidize the reactive polyamide amic acid oligomer intermediate in this method depends on whether polar solvent is present or not, the specific reactive polyamideimide oligomer being made, and the desired degree of imidization. When the imidization is done in the absence of solvent, i.e. with neat reactive polyamide amic acid oligomer in the solid state, the sufficient temperature and time to make the reactive polyamideimide oligomer are about 220&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C. for about 1 minute to about 120 minutes. When the imidization is done in the presence of a polar solvent, the sufficient temperature and time to make the reactive polyamideimide oligomer are about 140&#xb0; C. to about 220&#xb0; C. for about 1 minute to about 120 minutes.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0037">The reactive polyamideimide oligomer is manufactured in the presence of a polar solvent, which lowers the temperature range sufficient to make the reactive oligomer.

In some embodiments, the polar solvent is N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. The method of manufacture can further comprise removal of the polar solvent from the polyamide amic acid oligomer prior to heating the reactive polyamide amic acid oligomer at a sufficient temperature and time to make the reactive polyamideimide oligomer.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0038">There are different methods for imidization of the reactive polyamide amic acid oligomer.

The reactive polyamideimide oligomer can also be made by microwave irradiation of the reactive polyamide amic acid oligomer. The imidization agent can be acetic anhydride. Acidic by-products are generated by imidization, e.g. acetic acid when acetic anhydride is used. Therefore, bases, for example tertiary amines, can be used. The tertiary amine can be, for example, pyridine or triethylamine. Thus, in some embodiments, the reactive polyamideimide oligomer is made by heating the reactive polyamide amic acid oligomer in the presence of acetic anhydride and a catalytic amount of a tertiary amine.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0039">Another method of manufacture of the reactive polyamideimide oligomer is copolymerization in the presence of a phosphorylation agent and a catalytic amount of a salt. In this method, the di-, tri-, or tetra-functional carboxylic acid or functional equivalent thereof, does not include an acid halide, such as an acid chloride. The advantage of this method is that costly acid chlorides are not necessary as starting materials. By way of example, copolymerization is conducted in the presence of triphenyl phosphite, a polar solvent such as NMP as solvent, and a catalytic amount of a salt such as LiCl or CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Heating up to 120&#xb0; C. for 1.5 to 2 h. under nitrogen results in formation of a reactive polyamide amic acid oligomer and partial imidization to the corresponding reactive polyamideimide oligomer.

The polar solvent can dissolve the monomers, or alternately, can partially dissolve the monomers and form a fluid suspension or slurry of monomers together with oligomers and intermediates formed during reactive extrusion.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0042">The reactive extrusion can be conducted in the presence of an acid catalyst to facilitate imidization (cyclodehydration) of amic acid intermediates. When liquid under the reactive extrusion conditions, the acid catalyst can also partially dissolve the monomers and form a fluid suspension or slurry of monomers together with oligomers and intermediates formed during reactive extrusion. When the acid catalsyst is a liquid, it can be removed by distillation through vent ports during the reactive extrusion. In some embodiments, the acid catalyst is acetic acid, and it is removed by distillation during the reactive extrusion. The reactive extrusion can also be conducted in the presence of acetic anhydride, wherein the acetic anhydride is removed by distillation during the reactive extrusion. In order to facilitate removal of any water, HCl, polar solvent, acid catalyst, and acetic anhydride present or generated, reactive extrusion can be be conducted in a a melt extruder having a plurality of pre-set heating zones equipped with vent ports or other means for removal of these volatiles.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0043">The reactive polyamideimide oligomer can also be manufactured by the &#x201c;ammonium carboxylate salt&#x201d; method. The ammonium carboxylate salt method comprises: heating at least one aromatic diamine, at least one aromatic di-, tri-, or tetra-functional carboxylic acid or functional equivalent thereof, and at least one crosslinkable monomer or crosslinkable end-capper in the presence of at least one of water or a C<sub>1-4 </sub>alcohol at a sufficient temperature and time to form at least one reactive ammonium carboxylate salt; removing excess water and C<sub>1-4 </sub>alcohol; and heating the reactive ammonium carboxylate salt at a sufficient temperature and time to form the reactive polyamideimide oligomer; wherein the crosslinkable monomer or crosslinkable end-capper is reactive with the at least one aromatic diamine or the at least one di-, tri-, or tetra-functional aromatic carboxylic acid or functional equivalent thereof and has at least one unreacted functional group capable of chain extension and crosslinking after formation of the reactive polyamideimide oligomer.

This will ring-open the anhydrides and make the corresponding dicarboxylic acid alkyl half-esters, e.g. methyl or ethyl half-esters. The solvent is then removed by vacuum distillation. Thus, the reactive ammonium carboxylate salt is a mixture of all possible combinations of Ar&#x2014;COO&#x2014; and <sup>+</sup>H<sub>3</sub>N&#x2014;Ar in which Ar represents the aryl groups, and in which Ar&#x2014;COO&#x2014; is a C<sub>1-4 </sub>alkyl half-ester. The ammonium carboxylate salt (analogous to a Nylon salt) can be converted to the reactive polyamideimide oligomer by polymerization and imidization, which can be accomplished in various ways. Polymerization and imidization can be done by heating dry reactive ammonium carboxylate salt in an inert atmosphere, and preferably under pressure (0 to 300 MPa), up to 300&#xb0; C. to obtain the reactive polyamideimide oligomer. (Option 1 in Scheme 3) The heating can be done in an sealed vessel (Option 1 in Scheme 3) and/or in an extruder with vent capability for removal of water and methanol or ethanol vapor. (Option 2 in Scheme 3) For example, the reactive ammonium carboxylate salt can be heated under an inert atmosphere stepwise at 60, 100, and 200&#xb0; C. for 1 hr each in a sealed vessel, then cooled to 25&#xb0; C., and then oligomerized in an extruder at 320 to 360&#xb0; C. to obtain the reactive polyamideimide oligomer. Thus, in some embodiments, the method comprises reactive extrusion of the reactive ammonium carboxylate salt at a sufficient temperature and time to form the reactive polyamideimide oligomer. Polymerization and imidization can also be done by dissolving the reactive ammonium carboxylate salt in at least one polar solvent, such as water, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, or sulfolane, followed by heating to 160&#xb0; C. (Option 3 in Scheme 3) Thus, in some embodiments, the method comprises dissolving the reactive ammonium carboxylate salt in a polar solvent prior to heating at a sufficient temperature, pressure, and time to form the reactive polyamideimide oligomer.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0045">Alternatively, the at least one aromatic diamine, at least one aromatic di-, tri-, or tetra-functional carboxylic acid or functional equivalent thereof, and at least one crosslinkable monomer or crosslinkable end-capper can be mixed with water, methanol, ethanol, mixture of methanol/water, or mixture of ethanol/water followed by heating in a pressure-resistant container (bomb calorimeter or autoclave) to 220&#xb0; C. to polymerize and imidize the reactive ammonium carboxylate salt.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0046">Advantageously, the reactive ammonium carboxylate salt has a melt complex viscosity that ranges between about 1 to about 100 Pa&#xb7;s at a temperature range between about 80 to about 120&#xb0; C., and solubility of in a polar solvent such as NMP is up to 70 to 80 wt % at 60&#xb0; C.

For example, the reactive polyamideimide oligomers and reactive polyamide amic acid oligomers can be used as plasticizers or reactive diluents to improve the processability of high molecular weight PAI polymer and other high molecular weight polymers. The reactive oligomers added to PAI polymer can reduce compression molding cycle time by improved flow and improved consolidation (minimization of voids) relative to high molecular weight PAI.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0048">Another example of a functional material is a powder coating composition comprising the reactive polyamideimide oligomer.

The material can be at least one polymer, filler, or additive. For example, the reactive polyamideimide oligomer can be compounded with other reactive polyamideimide oligomers and/or reactive polyamide amic acid oligomers, to improve thermomechanical properties.

A variety of manufacturing methods and articles made by the methods are described below.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0056">The method of manufacture can be fiber reinforced composite manufacturing. The reactive polyamideimide oligomer can exist in powder of film. Thus, the fiber reinforced composite manufacturing can comprise heating at least one layer of fiber fabric and at least one layer of the reactive polyamideimide oligomer as a powder or film at a sufficient temperature, pressure, and time to melt the reactive polyamideimide oligomer, impregnate the fiber fabric, and crosslink the reactive polyamideimide oligomer to form a fiber reinforced composite.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0057">The reactive polyamideimide oligomer can also be dissolved in a polar solvent. Thus, the fiber reinforced manufacturing method can comprise impregnating at least one layer of fiber fabric with a solution of the reactive polyamideimide oligomer dissolved in a polar solvent; removing the polar solvent under reduced pressure; and heating at a sufficient temperature, pressure, and time to crosslink the reactive polyamideimide oligomer and form a fiber reinforced composite. The fiber can be, for example, carbon fiber, glass fiber, cellulose (wood/paper fiber, straw), polyaramid (poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide)), polybenzoxazole (PBO), or polybenzimidazole (PBI).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0058">A fiber reinforced composite manufactured by either of these methods is also disclosed.

A unidirectional tape prepared by pultrusion is also disclosed. The unidirectional (UD) tape can be a plain tape, slit tape, roving, or towpreg. UD tape can be used for automated tape lay-up techniques/TOW robots for making fiber reinforced composites.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0060">The method of manufacture can be solution spinning or melt spinning of fibers. A fiber manufactured by solution spinning or melt spinning is also disclosed. Both reactive polyamide amic acid oligomers and reactive polyamideimide oligomers having an M<sub>n </sub>of about to about 10,000 g/mol can be spun into fibers from either the solution state or melt state. In solution spinning, the reactive oligomers dissolved in a suitable polar solvent or polar solvent mixture, e.g. NMP, DMAc, DMF, or NMP/THF, can be spun into fibers using a standard solution spinning set-up including a plunger pump and spinneret operated at 25&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C. Fibers are obtained after coagulation in a non-solvent (e.g. water/acetone at &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C.). The resulting fibers are dried and heated to induce imidization and crosslinking. The as-spun fibers can also be dried using a stream of hot air followed by an additional heating step. During heat treatment the fibers can be exposed to a stretching step, which increases alignment of the polymer chains along the stretching direction and hence the fiber strength. In melt spinning, the reactive polyamideimide oligomers are melted and spun into fibers using a spinning set-up including a plunger pump, a heated resin chamber (250&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C.) and a heated spinneret operated at 300&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C. to induce crosslinking. The hot-drawn fibers can be (air/water) cooled and spooled, followed by a second heating step, with or without post stretching, in order to complete crosslinking and increase fiber strength.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0061">The method of manufacture can be additive manufacturing. Articles manufactured by additive manufacturing are also disclosed. In some embodiments of additive manufacturing, the method is fused filament fabrication. Fused filament fabrication comprises extruding the reactive polyamideimide oligomer in adjacent horizontal layers such that there is an interface between each layer of polyamideimide oligomer, and exposing the layers to heat at a sufficient temperature and time to crosslink the reactive polyamideimide oligomer and form the article. Articles manufactured by fused filament fabrication are also disclosed.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0062">Fused filament fabrication uses material extrusion to print items, where a feedstock material is pushed through an extruder. In most fused filament fabrication 3D printing machines, the feedstock material comes in the form of a filament wound onto a spool. The 3D printer liquefier is the component predominantly used in this type of printing. Extruders for these printers have a hot end and a cold end. The &#x201c;cold&#x201d; end is cooler than the hot end, but can still be in the temperature range of 100 to 250&#xb0; C. The cold end pulls material from the spool, using gear- or roller-based torque to the material and controlling the feed rate by means of a stepper motor. The cold end pushes feedstock into the hot end. The hot end consists of a heating chamber and a nozzle. The heating chamber hosts the liquefier, which melts the feedstock to transform it into a molten state. It allows the molten material to exit from the small nozzle to form a thin, tacky bead of plastic that will adhere to the material it is laid on. The nozzle will usually have a diameter of between 0.3 mm and 1.0 mm. Different types of nozzles and heating methods are used depending upon the material to be print.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0063">The filament can be in the form of a thin filament wound onto a spool. In a variation of this method, the feedstock is in the form of a rod instead of a filament. Since the rod is thicker than the filament, it can be pushed towards the hot end by means of a piston or rollers, applying a greater force and/or velocity compared to conventional fused filament fabrication.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0064">Weld lines are defined as the planar interface between layers of extruded material. The reactive polyamideimide oligomers diffuse across the interfaces and react to rapidly increase polymer chain entanglements and network formation across the interfaces, thereby fusing adjacent layers together. The weld lines (interfaces) are further strengthened by chain extension and/or crosslinking of the reactive polyamideimide oligomers entangled across the interfaces, resulting in improved z-axis strength.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0065">This process of chain entanglement, network formation, chain extension, and crosslinking in fused filament fabrication can be optimized by using reactive polyamideimide oligomers having two different reactive end groups. Oligomer chains having first unreacted functional groups with a first cure temperature can crosslink first to fix the printed structure in place. Oligomer chains having second unreacted functional groups with a second cure temperature that is higher than the first cure temperature can diffuse across the interfaces and cure at the second cure temperature, build molecular weight, crosslink density, and strength of the part.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0066">In some embodiments of additive manufacturing, the method is selective laser sintering. Selective laser sintering comprises selectively sintering and crosslinking particles of the reactive polyamideimide oligomer with a laser to form the article. Articles manufactured by selective laser sintering are also disclosed. Selective laser sintering (SLS) involves the use of a high-power laser (e.g. a carbon dioxide laser) to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired three-dimensional shape. The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3D digital description of the part (e.g. from a CAD file or scan data) on the surface of a powder bed. After each cross-section is scanned, the powder bed is lowered by one-layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top, and the process is repeated until the part is completed. The SLS machine preheats the bulk powder material in the powder bed to a temperature below the flow point of the powder, to make it easier for the laser to raise the temperature of the selected regions to the point where the powder softens and fuses together.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0067">In some embodiments of additive manufacturing, the method of manufacture is directed energy deposition (DED) or laser engineered net shaping (LENS). Articles manufactured by DED and LENS are also disclosed.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0068">In contrast with some other additive manufacturing processes, such as stereolithography (SLA) and fused filament fabrication (FFF), which most often require special support structures to fabricate overhanging designs, SLS does not need a separate feeder for support material because the part being constructed is surrounded by unsintered powder at all times, this allows for the construction of previously impossible geometries. Also, since the machine's chamber is always filled with powder material the fabrication of multiple parts has a far lower impact on the overall difficulty and price of the design because through a technique known as &#x201c;nesting&#x201d;, multiple parts can be positioned to fit within the boundaries of the machine.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0069">In additive manufacturing methods such as FFF and SLS using the reactive polyamideimide oligomers as the raw materials, the oligomers diffuse across particle or filament interfaces and interact to rapidly increase polymer chain entanglements across the particle or filament interfaces, thereby fusing adjacent particles or filaments together. The interfaces are further strengthened by chain extension and crosslinking of the reactive polyamideimide oligomers entangled across the interfaces.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0070">The concepts of diffusion across interfaces, and chain entanglement and crosslinking across interfaces are further illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>D</figref>. In each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>D</figref>, the oligomer or polymer on the left is in the solid state and the oligomer or polymer on the right is in the molten state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> depicts high molecular weight high performance thermoplastic on either side of an interface. The high molecular weight polymer can diffuse across the interface in both directions and form chain entanglements depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. However long thermal annealing times (hours) at temperatures above T<sub>g </sub>but below T<sub>m </sub>are required.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> depicts reactive oligomer on either side of an interface. The low molecular weight reactive oligomer diffuses much faster across the interface in both directions above T<sub>g </sub>but below T<sub>m </sub>and form chain entanglements depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>. This rapid diffusion results in reduced thermal annealing times. Chain extension and crosslinking can also occur through the unreacted functional groups. The net effect of faster diffusion, chain entanglement, and chain extension and crosslinking is improved inter-layer strength, i.e. improved z-axis strength in FFF and in SLS.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0072">As with fused filament fabrication, this process of chain entanglement, network formation, chain extension, and crosslinking can be further enhanced in selective laser sintering by using reactive polyamideimide oligomers having two different reactive end groups. Oligomer chains having first unreacted functional groups with a first cure temperature can crosslink first to fix the printed structure in place. Oligomer chains having second unreacted functional groups with a second cure temperature that is higher than the first cure temperature can diffuse across the interfaces and cure at the second cure temperature, build molecular weight, crosslink density, and strength of the part.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0073">The method of manufacture can be solution casting. Solution casting comprises: casting a solution of the reactive polyamideimide oligomer dissolved in a polar solvent onto a mold; removing the polar solvent to form a reactive polyamideimide oligomer film; and heating the polyamideimide oligomer film at a sufficient temperature and time to crosslink the polyamideimide oligomer and form a flexible film. Flexible films manufactured by solution casting of the reactive polyamideimide oligomer are also disclosed.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0074">The method of manufacture can also be injection molding. Articles manufactured by injection molding of the reactive polyamideimide oligomer are also disclosed.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0075">As mentioned above, reactive polyamide amic acid oligomers are intermediates in the manufacture of reactive polyamideimide oligomers. Thus, a reactive polyamide amic acid oligomer comprises units derived from at least one aromatic diamine, at least one aromatic di-, tri-, or tetra-functional carboxylic acid or functional equivalent thereof, and at least one crosslinkable monomer or crosslinkable end-capper, wherein the crosslinkable monomer or crosslinkable end-capper is reactive with the at least one aromatic diamine or the at least one di-, tri-, or tetra-functional aromatic carboxylic acid or functional equivalent thereof and has at least one unreacted functional group capable of chain extension and crosslinking after formation of the reactive polyamide amic acid oligomer; and wherein the reactive polyamide amic acid oligomer has a number average molecular weight (M<sub>n</sub>) of about 1,000 to about 10,000 g/mol, calculated using the Carothers equation.

The first step in this method is formation of a reactive ammonium carboxylate salt. As an intermediate in the manufacture of reactive polyamideimide oligomer, the reactive ammonium carboxylate salt is itself a useful composition.

Currently available high molecular weight PAI can have relatively high levels of amic acid groups in order to have sufficiently low complex viscosity to be melt processable. The presence of amic acid groups can make PAI extremely hygroscopic. Therefore, pre-processing drying is also required. The manufacturing and processing of currently available PAI configured as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, would involve imidization of polyamide amic acid stock shapes or injection molded parts, long periods of thermal post-treatment to remove water generated from conversion of amic acid groups to imide groups are necessary. PAI parts that have been machined are also exposed to a multi-day thermal treatment protocol after machining. A general cure schedule recommended by a manufacturer is: 1 day at 375&#xb0; F. (191&#xb0; C.), 1 day at 425&#xb0; F. (218&#xb0; C.), 1 day at 475&#xb0; F. (246&#xb0; C.), and 5 days at 500&#xb0; F. (260&#xb0; C.), for a total of 8 days. In contrast, curing for the reactive polyamideimide oligomers at about 300 to about 450&#xb0; C. can be completed in as little as about 1 to about 60 minutes. Advantageously, this reduction in the thermal post-treatment time results in greatly reduced manufacturing cycle time and cost.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0111">The reactive polyamideimide oligomers having a M<sub>n </sub>of about 1,000 to about 10,000 g/mol advantageously exhibit a melt complex viscosity of about 1,000 to about 100,000 Pa&#xb7;s at 360&#xb0; C., specifically about 5,000 to about 30,000 Pa&#xb7;s at 360&#xb0; C. In contrast, currently available PAI is reported to have a melt complex viscosity of about 1,000,000 Pa&#xb7;s at 2 radians/second. The low melt complex viscosity of the fully imidized reactive polyamideimide oligomer relative to currently available PAI is unexpected. In contrast to the low melt complex viscosity obtained, the combination of backbone phthalimide units, which are rigid, alternating with aromatic amide units, which are expected to be strongly hydrogen bonded as in polyaramid, is expected to result in a high melting point and high melt complex viscosity even for the reactive polyamideimide oligomers. Advantageously, with melt complex viscosity in the range of from about 1,000 to about 100,000 Pa&#xb7;s at 360&#xb0; C., melt processing can be done using conventional melt processing equipment, and ready-to-use injection molded parts, films, fibers and melt processable high temperature adhesives can be made. Also, compared to polyamide amic acid polymers, fully imidized reactive polyamideimide oligomers are less hygroscopic than polyamide amic acid polymers, and can be insoluble in polar solvents such as DMF, NMP, and DMAc, depending on the monomer and reactive and non-reactive end-capper used.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0112">Advantageously, thermal cure temperature ranges and after-cure thermomechanical properties can be controlled by selection of backbone monomers, crosslinkable monomers, crosslinkable end-cappers, and non-crosslinkable end-cappers. Moreover, improved thermomechanical properties are obtained with the present reactive polyamideimide oligomers. Reference is made to Example 1C below, which is a reactive polyamideimide oligomer having a M<sub>n </sub>of 5,000 g/mol in which both reactive end groups are phenylethyne. A film made from the reactive polyamideimide oligomer and cured for 1 h at 370&#xb0; C. had a T<sub>g </sub>of 326&#xb0; C., which is about 46&#xb0; C. higher than the T<sub>g </sub>of a currently available PAI film. Reference is also made to Example 2 below, which is a reactive polyamideimide oligomer having a M<sub>a </sub>of 5,000 g/mol and mixed reactive end groups (50/50 methylethyne/phenylethyne). A film made from the reactive polyamideimide oligomer and cured for 1 h at 370&#xb0; C. had a T<sub>g </sub>of 301&#xb0; C. The film had a toughness of 94.3 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>. In contrast, currently available PAI has a toughness of only &#x2dc;10 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>. Therefore, the toughness of PAI films made from this reactive polyamideimide oligomer can be almost 10 times higher than PAI made from currently available PAL. T<sub>g</sub>, strength at break, and elongation at break are also increased compared to currently available PAI.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0113">Advantageously, the low melt complex viscosity of the reactive polyamideimide oligomers relative to high molecular weight polyamideimide polymers makes reactive polyamideimide oligomers ideally suited for preparing fiber reinforced composites such as glass, carbon, and aramid fiber reinforced composites. Solution-based pre-preg, melt impregnation, and melt pultrusion methods can all be used. High molecular weight polyamide amic acid could be used to prepare fiber/resin pre-pregs and composites. However, it would be difficult to obtain enough melt flow to melt consolidate polyamide amic acid pre-pregs into a composite panel. Also, it can be difficult to remove water from the composite panel during imidization of the polyamide amic acid. This means it would be difficult to achieve less than 2% voids, which is considered acceptable. Alternatively, high molecular weight polyamide amic acid can be converted to high molecular weight polyamideimide at the pre-preg stage, and the polyamideimide pre-pregs can be consolidated into a composite. The even higher melt complex viscosity of the high molecular weight polyamideimide can make it difficult to obtain sufficient melt flow under pressure to consolidate the pre-pregs into an acceptable quality composite panel. Therefore, the relatively low melt complex viscosity of reactive polyamideimide oligomers provides an advantage over both high molecular weight polyamideimide and high molecular weight polyamide amic acid in fabrication of fiber reinforced composites.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0114">In contrast to high molecular weight polyamideimide polymers, the low melt complex viscosity of the reactive polyamideimide oligomers also makes them ideally suited for 3D printing applications.

Molecular weight of the oligomer influences thermal, (thermo-)mechanical, and melt properties of the reactive polyamideimide oligomers. In this example, a phenylethynyl end-capper (PEPA) was used to prepare reactive polyamideimide oligomers with M<sub>n </sub>values of 5,000 g/mol (Ex. 1B-1E), 3,000 g/mol (Ex. 1F-1G), and 8,000 g/mol (Ex. 1H-1I). The Carothers equation (Eq. 2) was used to calculate monomer amounts needed to prepare reactive polyamideimide oligomers with the desired M<sub>n </sub>values. Keeping M<sub>n </sub>constant, when more than one diamine monomer is utilized, the relative molar amounts of the diamine monomers will affect the rigidity of the oligomeric backbone. Thus, the thermal, (thermo-)mechanical, and melt properties of reactive polyamideimide oligomer can be varied by varying the ratio of diamine monomers. In Example 1A, the M<sub>n </sub>of the reactive polyamideimide oligomer was 5,000 g/mol and the backbone consisted of two diamines, 4,4&#x2032;-ODA and 1,3-PD in a 0.72:0.28 molar ratio. Changing the molar ratio of the two diamines will result in change in oligomer properties. The molar ratio of 4,4&#x2032;-ODA to 1,3-PD is 0.72:0.28 in Ex. 1A-1I, 0.62:0.32 in Examples 1J-1K, and 0.813:0.197 in Examples 1L-1M.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00043" num="00043"><img id="EMI-C00043" he="54.53mm" wi="157.14mm" file="US20230002558A1-20230105-C00043.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 1A&#x2014;Reactive Polyamide Amic Acid Oligomer Solution, M<sub>n</sub>=5,000 g/mol</heading><p id="p-0338" num="0297">A 150 mL 2-neck round bottom flask equipped with stir bar and nitrogen inlet tube was charged with 1,3-phenylene diamine (6.38 mmol, 0.69 g), 4,4&#x2032;-oxydianiline (16.33 mmol, 3.27 g) and 37 g NMP.
