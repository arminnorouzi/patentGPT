id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a device for injecting a product into a site. The invention relates more particularly to a device for inserting a needle used to dispense a product into the site where the needle was inserted, especially by using a catheter (or cannula).</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The state of the art, in particular document WO2015164645, already describes a device for inserting a needle in order to insert a catheter (or cannula) to dispense a medication. The device comprises a torsion spring allowing a movement in vertical translation of a needle support when the spring changes from a compressed state to a relaxed state. The device further comprises a pump system, independent of the torsion spring, allowing the medication to be dispensed from a reservoir. In addition, the use of a spring or any other preset drive element in this type of device causes a certain amount of wear of the plastic parts with which it interacts. Due to the robustness required to prevent any accidental activation, this use may also cause assembly and/or operating difficulties, for example regarding reproducibility of the movements.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A connection element must in fact firstly be assembled with the needle support, then the assembly is attached to the base while taking care to compress the torsion spring against a stop provided on the base and to insert a drive pin in a camway. This implies various assembly constraints. In addition, insertion of the needle and dispensing of the medication are controlled independently, which means that the insertion device requires more components and is therefore larger.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention aims in particular to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages and to provide a more compact injection device that is easier to assemble.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention therefore relates to a device for injecting a product into a site comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0006">a body provided with a bearing wall for bearing on the site,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0007">a needle support on which a needle is mounted, the needle support being mounted so as to be movable with respect to the bearing wall between:        <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0008">a pre-insertion position in which the needle is retracted with respect to the bearing wall,</li>            <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0009">at least one insertion position in which the needle protrudes with respect to the bearing wall, and</li>            <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0010">at least one retracted position in which the needle is once again retracted with respect to the bearing wall,</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0011">a catheter mounted so as to be movable with respect to the needle and intended to dispense product into the site,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0012">a drive unit intended to translate the needle support between the various positions of the needle support,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0013">a pump connected to a reservoir so as to transfer product from the reservoir to the catheter,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0014">a single electric motor intended to drive the drive unit and for supplying the pump to transfer the product.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0015">The injection device as proposed by this invention requires a single motor which inserts the needle and injects product, which reduces the size of the injection device and the manufacturing cost. Assembly is therefore easier since there are fewer parts. In particular, there is no need to provide for a specific return unit to actuate the needle insertion, which reduces the number of parts subject to wear. Moreover, control of the needle and catheter insertion movement is more precise and easier thanks to the drive by the electric motor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0016">According to other optional characteristics of the injection device taken alone or in combination:<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0017">The electric motor is configured to:        <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0018">rotate in a first direction of rotation so that the drive unit drive the needle support towards the at least one insertion position;</li>            <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0019">rotate in a second direction of rotation so that the pump operates in order to transfer product from the reservoir to the catheter, and preferably so that the drive unit drive the needle support towards the at least one retracted position, preferably simultaneously.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0020">Thus, the various functions performed by the single electric motor take place simply by changing the direction of rotation of the electric motor, which is easy to control. It is understood that the second direction of rotation corresponds to a direction of rotation opposite to the first direction of rotation. Since the needle is retracted and the product dispensed at the same time, the injection device is even more efficient.<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0021">The drive unit comprises a series of teeth arranged on the circumference of a rotating element of the electric motor and intended to cooperate with a rack carried by at least the needle support or a complementary drive element preferably configured to be connected in translation with the needle support.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0022">Since the teeth cooperate with the rack, rotation of the rotating element is easily converted into translation of the needle support, more particularly when inserting and retracting the needle.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0023">It is understood that the rack can be carried exclusively by the needle support (for example the complementary drive element and the needle support are made in one piece), which means that one part less is required. The complementary drive element may also consist of a part separate from the needle support, in which case the use of such a complementary drive element, which is in direct contact with the rotating element, means that the needle support can take different shapes to meet any constraints relating to the arrangement or size of the injection device. Lastly, the needle support and the complementary drive element may simultaneously include surfaces forming the rack so that the movements of these elements in the injection device are controlled more precisely.<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0024">The injection device comprises a catheter support adapted to move the catheter with the needle when the needle support changes from its pre-insertion position to the at least one insertion position and to separate it from the needle so that its movement remains locked when the needle support changes from its insertion position to the at least one retracted position.</li>        <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0025">The injection device comprises a locking member configured to cooperate with notches carried by the catheter support in order to lock the movement of the catheter support and define at least first and second needle support insertion positions.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0026">The locking member and the notches lock the movement of the catheter support with respect to the bearing wall in at least two different positions corresponding to at least two different insertion positions of the needle support. It is particularly interesting to be able to vary the needle support insertion positions in order to vary the product injection depth and thus adapt the injection to variables such as the user's morphology or the type of injection required.<ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0027">The catheter support and the complementary drive element are configured to be:        <ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0028">connected in translation when moving the needle support from its pre-insertion position to the at least one insertion position, and</li>            <li id="ul0015-0002" num="0029">movable with respect to each other when moving the needle support from the at least one insertion position to the at least one retracted position.</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0030">The injection device comprises an elastic element carried by the catheter support or the complementary drive element, the elastic element being configured to keep the complementary drive element in contact with the drive unit when the electric motor rotates in the second direction of rotation before inserting the needle.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0031">By using such an elastic element, it is possible to use a priming function which purges the air present in the reservoir or upstream from the catheter, so as to bring product into the catheter. When the motor rotates in the second direction of rotation, in fact, during normal operation (excluding priming), the drive unit drive the needle support towards the at least one retracted position with respect to the catheter support.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0032">The elastic element can be used to attach the rack to the catheter support during priming, before inserting the needle and the catheter into the body of the subject. Similarly, the elastic element provides an additional and indirect attachment link between the catheter support and the needle support.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0033">With this ingenious configuration, a single motor is required to insert the needle, transfer product and prime the device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0034">Advantageously, a stop interacts with the elastic element so that the rack continues to interact with the drive unit. The elastic element and the stop no longer interact when the rack and the needle support are retracted after insertion. Advantageously, the elastic element can also be used to hold the assembly (rack, catheter support and needle support) together during the steps of handling the injection device (storage, transport and priming phase).<ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0035">The injection device comprises a base having a guide housing defining a guide axis and intended to receive a needle support, and in which the needle support comprises blocking member configured to cooperate with complementary blocking member carried by the guide housing when the needle support is in the pre-insertion position and in the at least one retracted position.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0036">The blocking member and the complementary blocking member hold the needle during injection and guarantee the stability of the needle when the needle support is stationary, i.e. before inserting (including during priming) and after inserting the catheter.<ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0019" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0019-0001" num="0037">The

retracted position.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0018" num="0040">This allows the drive unit to rotate during priming and injection, the movement of the complementary drive element therefore not being hindered by the needle support.<ul id="ul0021" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0021-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0022" list-style="none">        <li

The first vertical guide <b>221</b> and the second vertical guide <b>222</b> are fixedly mounted to each other, by clipping member <b>223</b> for example. The guide axis (B) can be designed to be substantially perpendicular to the bearing wall <b>19</b> or according to any other suitable inclination. In addition, the base <b>22</b> comprises, on the first vertical guide <b>221</b>, a through opening <b>224</b> having a longitudinal shape along the guide axis (B). The base <b>22</b> also comprises a locking member <b>51</b> carried by the second vertical guide <b>222</b> near the bearing wall <b>19</b>.

The needle support <b>24</b> comprises a main block <b>240</b> of substantially cross-shaped section along a plane parallel to the bearing wall <b>19</b>. In addition, the shape of the main block <b>240</b> is substantially complementary to that of the guide housing <b>23</b>, so that the needle support <b>24</b> can slide in the guide housing <b>23</b> along the guide axis (B).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0068">The needle support <b>24</b> further comprises a blocking member <b>25</b>, consisting of an elastic hook <b>251</b> mounted on a flexible portion, the blocking member <b>25</b> being configured to cooperate with complementary blocking member <b>26</b> comprising a first vertical stop <b>261</b> and a second vertical stop <b>262</b> carried by the base <b>22</b>, the cooperation between the blocking member <b>25</b> and the complementary blocking member <b>26</b> being shown more clearly on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref><i>e. </i></p><p id="p-0036" num="0069">As shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>through <b>4</b><i>e, </i>the needle support <b>24</b> also comprises a protuberance <b>241</b> intended to cross the longitudinal through opening <b>224</b> and to slide therein.

Advantageously, the elastic element <b>32</b> and the locking pin <b>36</b> no longer interact when the rack <b>33</b> and the needle support <b>24</b> are retracted after insertion of the needle <b>21</b> and rotation of the electric motor <b>13</b> according to a second direction of rotation S<b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>e</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0076">The catheter support <b>31</b> is connected in translation to the needle support <b>24</b> during insertion of the needle <b>21</b>. The catheter <b>30</b> is movably mounted with respect to the needle <b>21</b>. Similarly, since the needle <b>21</b> is housed inside the catheter <b>30</b>, insertion of the needle <b>21</b> into the site allows simultaneous insertion of the catheter <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>e </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>e </i></figref>show the various operating steps of the injection device <b>1</b>, which will be described as follows: when the injection device <b>1</b> is ready to be used by a patient or by a member of the medical staff, the needle support <b>24</b> is in a pre-insertion position in which the needle <b>21</b> is retracted with respect to the bearing wall <b>19</b>. The needle support <b>21</b> is kept in this pre-insertion position by the interaction between the blocking member <b>25</b>, in this case consisting of an elastic hook <b>251</b> and the complementary blocking member <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>). The catheter support <b>31</b> and the complementary drive element <b>3</b> are also kept in this pre-insertion position since they are respectively against the needle support <b>21</b> on one side and blocked in translation by the interaction between the elastic element <b>32</b> and the locking pin <b>36</b> carried by the complementary drive element <b>3</b> on the other side.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0078">When the user places the injection device <b>1</b> on a site to be injected, the bearing wall <b>19</b> is for example in direct contact with the site. The user then activates the electric motor <b>13</b>, using a control button for example, to rotate the electric motor <b>13</b> as well as the rotating element <b>4</b> in the second direction of rotation S<b>2</b> as shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>. The injection device <b>1</b> is then in priming phase, during which the pump <b>14</b> starts to transfer product from the reservoir towards the catheter <b>30</b>, successively via the tube <b>6</b>, the pump <b>13</b> and the needle <b>21</b>. This priming phase is programmed to last for a short period of time, but sufficient to purge the air present upstream from the catheter <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0079">During the priming phase, the series of teeth <b>44</b> carried by the rotating element <b>4</b> in contact with the rack <b>33</b> carried by the complementary drive element <b>3</b> drives the latter in an upward direction with respect to the guide axis (B), i.e. in a direction away from the bearing wall <b>19</b>. Simultaneously, the elastic element <b>32</b> presses down on the pin <b>36</b>, i.e. in a downward direction with respect to the guide axis (B) and therefore towards the bearing wall <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0080">Thus, the complementary drive element <b>3</b> exerts a very small back and forth movement so that the complementary drive element <b>3</b> continues to interact with the series of teeth <b>44</b> of the rotating element <b>4</b>. The complementary drive element <b>3</b> is therefore brought into contact with the drive exerted by the rotation of the rotating element <b>4</b> in the second direction of rotation S<b>2</b> and can therefore continue priming the injection device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0081">When priming of the injection device <b>1</b> is finished, the electric motor <b>13</b> rotates in a first direction of rotation S<b>1</b>, which is opposite to the second direction of rotation S<b>2</b>, to drive the needle support <b>24</b> towards a preset insertion position. More precisely, the series of teeth <b>44</b> engages with the rack <b>33</b> and converts the rotation of the rotating element <b>4</b> into translation of the complementary drive element <b>3</b> towards the bearing wall <b>19</b>. The complementary drive element <b>3</b> itself drives the needle support <b>24</b> and the catheter support <b>31</b> in the same direction towards the bearing wall <b>19</b> as shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>c </i>and <b>4</b><i>c</i></figref>. When the needle support <b>24</b> leaves its pre-insertion position and moves towards the bearing wall <b>19</b>, the blocking member <b>25</b> then no longer interact with the complementary blocking member <b>26</b>, since the blocking member <b>25</b> comprise an elastic hook <b>251</b> which is held completely inside the guide housing <b>23</b> as shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0046" num="0082">When the needle support <b>24</b> has nearly reached the bearing wall <b>19</b>, the notches <b>52</b> carried by the catheter support <b>31</b> start to come into contact with the locking member <b>51</b>, one after the other. If the needle support <b>24</b> reaches the preset insertion position, the corresponding notch which is already in contact with the locking member <b>51</b> continues to cooperate with the locking member <b>51</b> to keep the catheter support <b>31</b> in position. If the needle support <b>24</b> has not reached the preset insertion position, the rack <b>33</b> continues to move until the needle support <b>24</b> reaches the preset insertion position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c </i>through <b>4</b><i>e </i></figref>show an insertion position in which the last notch which comes into contact with the locking member <b>51</b> cooperates with the latter to keep the catheter support <b>31</b> in a position which corresponds to a &#x201c;shallow&#x201d; insertion position of the needle <b>21</b>, equivalent for example to the subcutaneous layer of the patient's skin. According to the example shown, the needle support <b>24</b> can have up to 5 different insertion positions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0083">Once the catheter <b>30</b> has been inserted into the site by inserting the needle <b>21</b>, the needle support <b>24</b> separates from the catheter support <b>31</b> and moves from its insertion position to its retracted position. To do this, the electric motor <b>13</b> rotates again in the second direction of rotation S<b>2</b> so that the drive unit <b>4</b>, <b>44</b> drive the complementary drive element <b>3</b> and the needle support <b>24</b> in an upward direction with respect to the guide axis (B), towards the retracted position of the needle support <b>24</b>. Since the driving force of the electric motor <b>13</b> is greater than the clipping between the notches <b>52</b> and the locking member <b>51</b>, the elastic element <b>32</b> and the locking pin <b>36</b> no longer cooperate and the complementary drive element <b>3</b> separates from the catheter support <b>31</b>. The needle support <b>24</b> is connected in translation with the complementary drive element <b>3</b> by the hooking formed by the blocking member <b>25</b> via the elastic hook <b>251</b> on the first horizontal portion <b>34</b> of the complementary drive element <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0084">As the needle <b>21</b> is being removed, the electric motor <b>13</b> rotates in the second direction of rotation S<b>2</b> and therefore operates the pump <b>14</b> in order to transfer a preset quantity of product from the reservoir <b>7</b> to the catheter <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0085">When the needle support <b>24</b> reaches the retracted position, the elastic hook <b>251</b> and the complementary blocking member <b>26</b> cooperate again to lock the needle support <b>24</b> in this retracted position, as shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>d </i>and <b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>. Since the elastic hook <b>251</b> is no longer in contact with the first horizontal portion <b>34</b> of the complementary drive element <b>3</b>, the latter becomes movable with respect to the needle support <b>24</b>. The needle support <b>24</b> is then stable in the retracted position where it is held. Thus, the electric motor <b>13</b> can continue to rotate in the second direction of rotation S<b>2</b> in order to finalise the transfer of the preset quantity of product.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0086">The injection device <b>1</b> is for example assembled using an assembly kit comprising:<ul id="ul0030" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0030-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0031" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0031-0001" num="0087">a body <b>2</b> provided with a bearing wall <b>19</b> for bearing on the site,</li>        <li id="ul0031-0002" num="0088">a needle support <b>24</b>, the needle support <b>24</b> being mounted so as to be movable with respect to the bearing wall <b>19</b> between:        <ul id="ul0032" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0032-0001" num="0089">a pre-insertion position in which the needle <b>21</b> is retracted with respect to the bearing wall <b>19</b>,</li>            <li id="ul0032-0002" num="0090">at least one insertion position in which the needle <b>21</b> protrudes with respect to the bearing wall <b>19</b>, and</li>            <li id="ul0032-0003" num="0091">at least one retracted position in which the needle <b>21</b> is once again retracted with respect to the bearing wall <b>19</b>,</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0031-0003" num="0092">a catheter <b>30</b> configured so as to be movable with respect to the needle <b>21</b> and intended to dispense product into the site,</li>        <li id="ul0031-0004" num="0093">a drive unit <b>4</b>, <b>44</b> intended to translate the needle support <b>24</b> between the various positions of the needle support <b>24</b>,</li>        <li id="ul0031-0005" num="0094">a pump <b>14</b> connected to a reservoir so as to transfer product from the reservoir to the catheter <b>30</b>,</li>        <li id="ul0031-0006" num="0095">a single electric motor <b>13</b> intended to drive the drive unit <b>4</b>, <b>44</b> and for supplying the pump <b>14</b> to transfer the product.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0051" num="0096">The invention is not limited to the embodiments described and other embodiments will be clearly apparent to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0097">The complementary drive element <b>3</b> may in particular comprise a flexible portion carrying the flexible rack <b>33</b>, the flexible portion preferably having an arcuate shape.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0098">The drive unit could also comprise a first series of teeth arranged on the circumference of a rotating element and intended to cooperate with a second series of teeth carried by a complementary rotating element provided with a camway configured to guide the needle support <b>24</b> in translation.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
