Since there can be slight tilting within the bearing during lateral acceleration when driving, there is a risk that the lip seals used will lift off the sliding surfaces. The seals used can interact with a centrifugal sheet made of formed sheet metal. The centrifugal sheet connected to a rotating wheel hub or a wheel bearing flange can form an additional sealing labyrinth together with another sheet metal ring arranged in a stationary part of the wheel suspension. In addition, sealing lips of at least one sealing ring run in the axial or radial direction and are guided on the centrifugal sheet. The aforementioned components of the seal can also be an integral part of a seal cartridge in which the sealing lips are axially prestressed in a defined manner.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Axially on the vehicle side of the wheel bearing there is a mainly axially directed opening between the rotating partners involved, which is occasionally covered by a joint bell of the adjacent constant velocity joint. On the axial side of the wheel flange, the opening between the rotating partners of the wheel bearing is directed radially outwards due to the immediately adjacent wheel flange and is very easy to reach for spray water. Since a centrifugal sheet made of sheet metal on the wheel flange leads to better rubbing sealing contact than the usually untreated inner side of the wheel flange, a centrifugal sheet is mounted adjacent to the wheel flange before the wheel bearing is installed on the wheel hub.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A slippage of the centrifugal sheet can be triggered by a shock, continuous vibration loads or other causes, whereby the centrifugal sheet on the outer surface approaches the rolling bodies axially and damages them if they come into contact. This leads to failure of the wheel bearing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A bearing seal for wheel bearings is known from DE 10 2010 034 385 A1, in which a centrifugal sheet is fixed to a wheel bearing flange, which is integrally connected to a rotating bearing ring of the wheel bearing. Sealing lips of a sealing arrangement are supported on the centrifugal sheet, which is coupled to the further torsionally rigid bearing ring.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">DE 10 2009 052 311 A1 describes a wheel bearing with a sealing arrangement which includes a centrifugal ring on the flange side for sealing the roller bearing. In the installed state, axial sealing lips are supported on the centrifugal sheet via rubbing sealing contacts. The sealing lips are associated with a carrier that is attached to an outer ring.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">DE 103 58 876 A1 discloses a sealing arrangement for wheel bearings, which uses two sealing rings to form an axial opening between the two parts of the wheel bearing that can rotate relative to one another and seals the wheel bearing axially. For this purpose, the two sealing rings form a gap labyrinth, which has a catch channel with a sealing gap that opens out axially and extends radially.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure provides a sealing arrangement which seals reliably over the operating life and has an increased service life.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the disclosure, a sealing arrangement of a wheel bearing has a first bearing part and a second bearing part which is integrally connected to a wheel bearing flange, and rolling bodies are guided between the first bearing part and the second bearing part. The sealing arrangement includes the following:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a carrier element, which is connected to the first bearing part, with an elastic element provided on the carrier element, the elastic element having at least one sealing lip, and the carrier element has a fastening section connected to the first bearing part,</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a stop part which is fastened to the second bearing part and with Which the at least one sealing lip is in sliding contact,</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">the wheel bearing flange has an axial projection, and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">the axial projection of the wheel bearing flange is provided such that said projection protrudes in the direction cavity formed by an axial projection of the first bearing part, and an inner surface of the axial projection of the wheel bearing flange forms a seat for the stop part.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In known sealing arrangements, a stop part is pulled onto the second bearing part in the region adjacent to the wheel bearing flange. However, this region of the seat of the stop part is one of the most stressful regions of the second bearing part and the wheel bearing flange. Excited by high stress, which is caused by vibrations, etc., for example, the starting part moves axially. The axial migration causes the approach part to approach the rolling bodies, which can damage them if they come into contact.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the sealing arrangement according to the disclosure, the wheel bearing flange therefore has an axial projection, the axial projection of the wheel bearing flange is provided such that said projection protrudes in the direction cavity formed by an axial projection of the first bearing part, and an inner surface of the axial projection of the wheel bearing flange forms a seat for the stop part. With such a design, the seat of the sealing plate is moved out of the most stressful region. The fact that the contact part is now seated on the axial projection of the wheel bearing flange means that the contact part can be prevented from moving. In the region in which stop part was seated according to the state of the art, this is now contactless. Due to the arrangement of the projections relative to one another, there is sufficient installation space for the fastening screws on the wheel flange, as a result of which simple assembly/disassembly<sup>- </sup>of the rim and/or brake disc is possible.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one embodiment, a first sealing gap is formed between an end face of the axial projection of the wheel bearing flange and an end face of the first bearing part. This sealing gap defines the pre-seal or the labyrinth seal. This makes it difficult for contamination or the like to enter. At the same time, the sealing gap diverts the resulting force from the wheel flange to the first bearing part in the event of axial impacts which act on the second bearing part or the wheel bearing flange. This prevents damage to the rolling bodies.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The carrier element may be fastened to an inner peripheral surface of the first bearing part with the fastening section. This prevents this seat from being infiltrated by contaminants or the like and corrosion from occurring, which negatively affects the sealing arrangement.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to one embodiment, the carrier element is designed in such a way that it forms a free space and a cage of a bearing protrudes into this free space. The support element has a course which is oriented in the direction of the wheel flange and not in the direction of the rows of bearings. As a result, a free space is again created into which a cage of the rows of bearings can protrude. With this design, overall installation space can be saved in an axial direction of the wheel bearing unit and the wheel bearing unit is therefore axially narrow.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to one embodiment, at least one first drainage channel is provided on an outer peripheral surface of the carrier element and/or the elastic element. This drainage channel reinforces the sealing effect and prevents the ingress of contaminants or the like into the interior. The elastic element may provide a sealing lip which delimits the first drainage channel.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">One embodiment provides that the wheel bearing flange facing the wheel bearing is formed with a radially extending side face and an outer surface adjoining rolling body raceways on the second bearing part in the direction of the wheel bearing flange and receiving the stop part, and in that a radial and/or axial circumferential groove is arranged in a transition region between the outer surface and the side face. The fact that the stop part no longer has a seat in this region means that the groove or this region can be designed in such a way that this leads to an improvement in the strength of the component. The groove can, in each case, be arranged entirely or partially in the outer surface and/or the side face.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A groove base of the groove may be formed with at least one radius. The at least one radius of the groove can be adapted to different geometries of the wheel bearing flange in order to minimize stress in the transition region and to increase component strength. A single radius as well as a plurality of radii can be provided.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A free space may be formed between the transition region of the stop part and the groove base. Grease or sealant can accumulate in this free space and be optimally distributed, which further improves the fit of the stop sheet.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to one embodiment, at least one second drainage channel is provided on an outer peripheral surface of the first bearing part. This second drainage channel reinforces the sealing effect and prevents the ingress of contaminants or the like into the sealing labyrinth.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Exemplary embodiments are illustrated below using two figures.

The wheel bearing <b>1</b> has a first bearing part <b>3</b>, which is designed as an outer ring <b>4</b> and is connected to a wheel carrier (not shown) when installed. A second bearing part <b>5</b> is further provided, which forms the inner ring <b>6</b>. The second bearing part <b>5</b> has a wheel bearing flange <b>7</b> connected in one piece. Two rows of rolling bodies <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> are guided between the first bearing part <b>3</b> and the second bearing part <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sealing arrangement <b>1</b> of the wheel bearing <b>2</b> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. This includes a carrier element <b>10</b> which is connected to the inner circumference of the first bearing part <b>3</b> by means of a press fit. An elastic element <b>11</b> is provided on the carrier element <b>10</b>, the elastic element <b>11</b> having at least one sealing lip. The carrier element <b>10</b> further has a fastening section for fastening to the first bearing part <b>3</b>. In order to avoid rusting under the fastening section, a so-called static seal is formed by means of a sealing ring molded onto the elastic part.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The sealing arrangement further has a stop part <b>12</b> which is fastened to the second bearing part <b>5</b> and on which two sealing lips <b>28</b> are in sliding contact. It can also be seen that the wheel bearing flange <b>7</b> has an axial projection <b>13</b>. This axial projection <b>13</b> is provided in such a way that it protrudes in the direction of a cavity formed by an axial projection <b>14</b> of the first bearing part <b>3</b>. The interior space which is formed and delimited by the two bearing parts <b>3</b>, <b>5</b> is meant as a cavity. The axial projection <b>13</b> extends, so to speak, in the direction of the rows of rolling bodies <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>. Based on this design, a pre-seal is formed in the form of a labyrinth. Here, a first sealing gap is formed between an end face <b>16</b> of the axial projection <b>13</b> of the wheel bearing flange <b>7</b> and an end face <b>17</b> of the first bearing part <b>3</b>. The end face <b>17</b> of the first bearing part is formed on a side face which adjoins the projection <b>14</b> radially and extends radially away from the rows of rolling bodies <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, the carrier element <b>10</b> is designed in such a way that it forms a free space <b>30</b>. A cage <b>31</b> of a row of rolling bodies <b>8</b> protrudes into this free space <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, an inner surface <b>15</b> of the axial projection <b>13</b> of the wheel bearing flange <b>7</b> forms a seat for the stop part <b>12</b>. This eliminates the seat known from the prior art in the region of the transition between the second bearing part <b>5</b> and the wheel bearing flange <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A radially extending side face <b>18</b> adjoins the axial projection <b>13</b>. Furtheimore, an outer surface <b>19</b> adjoining the second bearing part <b>5</b> and adjoining rolling body raceways in the direction of the wheel bearing flange <b>7</b> is provided. The outer surface <b>19</b> can be cylindrical and have a conical shape. This outer surface <b>19</b> transitions into the radially extending side face <b>18</b> in a transition region <b>20</b>. A radial and/or axial circumferential groove <b>21</b> is formed in the transition region <b>20</b>. The groove <b>21</b> can be adapted to the respective geometry of the wheel bearing flange <b>7</b>. A groove base <b>22</b> of the groove <b>21</b> is formed with at least one radius. A free space <b>32</b> is formed between the groove base <b>22</b> and the stop part <b>12</b>.
