Demand for the ability to treat clothing with various desirable or protective liquids is rising. In particular, demand for the ability to introduce a scent to dry clothing is growing. Additionally, there is a demand to treat dry clothing with various protective coatings, such as with liquids providing ultraviolet light protection, anti-microbial liquids, or other medicinal fluids.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, clothing is treated, for example with stain removers and the like, prior to washing. However, this method is ineffective for treating cloths with scent, ultraviolet protection, anti-microbial protection, and other similar medicinal fluids because washing the clothes will remove the intended application. Such treatments must be applied to dry clothing after the washing cycle is complete. Currently, the application of such fluids would not involve the use of a dryer, but would instead be done manually on each item of clothing individually, resulting in a large investment of time and treatment materials.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, a dryer appliance capable of applying a scent or other fluid to coat dry clothing is desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be apparent from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one exemplary embodiment, an appliance is provided, including a cabinet, a rotatable drum within the cabinet, the rotatable drum defining a chamber for the receipt of articles for drying, a reservoir for receipt of a treatment fluid, a heater housing disposed within the cabinet and defining a volume, a heater at least partially disposed within the volume defined by the heater housing, a fluid distribution element for directing the treatment fluid into the volume defined by the heater housing, and a supply duct. The heater housing includes a first end and a second end, the first end of the heater housing defining an opening. The supply duct includes a first end and second end, the first end of the supply duct in fluid communication with the second end of the heater housing and the second end of the supply duct in fluid communication with the chamber.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another exemplary embodiment, an appliance is provided, including a cabinet, a rotatable drum within the cabinet, the rotatable drum defining a chamber for the receipt of articles for drying, a reservoir for receipt of a treatment fluid, a heater housing disposed within the cabinet and defining a volume, a heater at least partially disposed within the volume defined by the heater housing, a fluid distribution element for directing the treatment fluid into the volume defined by the heater housing, a supply duct, a fluid communication path, and a valve. The heater housing includes a first end and a second end, the first end of the heater housing defining an opening. The supply duct includes a first end and second end, the first end of the supply duct in fluid communication with the second end of the heater housing and the second end of the supply duct in fluid communication with the chamber. The fluid communication path includes a first end and a second end, the first end of the fluid communication path attached to the reservoir and the second end of the fluid communication path attached to the fluid distribution element.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, two sides of the dryer appliance is omitted to provide an exemplary internal view of dryer appliance <b>10</b>. While described in the context of a specific embodiment of a dryer appliance, using the teachings disclosed herein it will be understood that dryer appliance <b>10</b> is provided by way of example only. Other dryer appliances having different configurations and components may also be utilized with the present subject matter as well.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Dryer appliance <b>10</b> defines a vertical direction V, a lateral direction L, and a transverse direction T. The vertical direction V, lateral direction L, and transverse direction T are mutually perpendicular and form an orthogonal direction system. Cabinet <b>12</b> includes a front panel <b>14</b> and a rear panel <b>16</b> spaced apart along the transverse direction T, a side panels (not shown) spaced apart along the lateral direction L, and a bottom panel <b>22</b> and a top surface <b>24</b> spaced apart along the vertical direction V. Within cabinet <b>12</b> is a container or drum <b>26</b> which defines a chamber <b>28</b>. Chamber <b>28</b> defines a front opening <b>29</b> for receipt of articles, e.g., clothing, linen, etc., for drying. Drum <b>26</b> extends between a front portion and a back portion, e.g., along the transverse direction T. In example embodiments, drum <b>26</b> is rotatable, e.g., about an axis that is parallel to the transverse direction T, within cabinet <b>12</b>. Rotation of drum <b>26</b> is driven by a motor (not shown). A door <b>30</b> is rotatably mounted to cabinet <b>12</b> for providing selective access to drum <b>26</b>. Door <b>30</b> rotates between an open position and a closed position. When in the closed position, door <b>30</b> covers front opening <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an air handler <b>32</b>, such as a blower or fan, may be provided to motivate an airflow through an entrance air passage and an air exhaust passage <b>34</b>. Specifically, air handler <b>32</b> may include a motor which may be in mechanical communication with a blower fan, such that the motor rotates the blower fan (not shown). Air handler <b>32</b> is configured for drawing air through chamber <b>28</b> of drum <b>26</b>, e.g., in order to dry articles located therein, as discussed in greater detail below. In alternative example embodiments, dryer appliance <b>10</b> may include an additional motor (not shown) for rotating the fan of air handler <b>32</b> independently of drum <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Drum <b>26</b> may be configured to receive heated air that has been heated by a heating assembly in order to dry damp articles disposed within chamber <b>28</b> of drum <b>26</b>. Heating assembly <b>50</b>, as further described below, includes a heater housing <b>54</b> that is in fluid and thermal communication with chamber <b>28</b>. A heater <b>52</b> may be at least partially disposed within heater housing <b>54</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Heater <b>52</b> may include, for example, one or more electrical resistance heating elements or gas burners, for heating air being flowed to chamber <b>28</b>. More specifically, heater housing <b>54</b> defines a volume within which heater <b>52</b> is at least partially disposed. Heater housing <b>54</b> may consist of a single, integrated element or may comprise two or more elements attached to one another to define the volume in which heater <b>52</b> is disposed. Further, heater housing <b>54</b> may include a first end <b>51</b> and a second end <b>53</b>. First end <b>51</b> of heater housing <b>54</b> defines an opening <b>55</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). As discussed above, during operation of dryer appliance <b>10</b>, a motor rotates a fan of air handler <b>32</b> such that air handler <b>32</b> draws air through chamber <b>28</b> of drum <b>26</b>. In particular, ambient air enters an air entrance passage defined by heating assembly <b>50</b> via opening <b>55</b> due to air handler <b>32</b> urging such ambient air into opening <b>55</b>. Such ambient air is heated within heating assembly <b>50</b> and exits heating assembly <b>50</b> as heated air. Air handler <b>32</b> draws such heated air from heating assembly <b>50</b>, through supply duct <b>56</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), and delivers it to chamber <b>28</b> of drum <b>26</b>. The heated air enters drum <b>26</b> through an outlet <b>58</b> of supply duct <b>56</b> positioned at a rear wall of drum <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Within chamber <b>28</b>, the heated air can remove moisture, e.g., from damp articles disposed within chamber <b>28</b>. This internal air flows in turn from chamber <b>28</b> through an outlet assembly positioned within cabinet <b>12</b>. The outlet assembly generally defines an air exhaust passage <b>34</b> and includes a trap duct (not shown), air handler <b>32</b>, and an exhaust conduit <b>62</b>. Exhaust conduit <b>62</b> is in fluid communication with the trap duct via air handler <b>32</b>. During a dry cycle, internal air flows from chamber <b>28</b> through the trap duct to air handler <b>32</b>, e.g., as an outlet flow portion of airflow. As shown, air further flows through air handler <b>32</b> and to exhaust conduit <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The internal air is exhausted from dryer appliance <b>10</b> via exhaust conduit <b>62</b>. In some embodiments, an external duct (not shown) is provided in fluid communication with exhaust conduit <b>62</b>. For instance, the external duct may be attached (e.g., directly or indirectly attached) to cabinet <b>12</b> at rear panel <b>16</b>. Any suitable connector (e.g., collar, clamp, etc.) may join the external duct to exhaust conduit <b>62</b>. In residential environments, the external duct may be in fluid communication with an outdoor environment (e.g., outside of a home or building in which dryer appliance <b>10</b> is installed). During a dry cycle, internal air may thus flow from exhaust conduit <b>62</b> and through the external duct before being exhausted to the outdoor environment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In exemplary embodiments, trap duct may include a filter portion which includes a screen filter or other suitable device for removing lint and other particulates as internal air is drawn out of chamber <b>28</b>. The internal air is drawn through the filter portion by air handler <b>32</b> before being passed through exhaust conduit <b>62</b>. After the articles have been dried (or a drying cycle is otherwise completed), the articles are removed from drum <b>26</b>, e.g., by accessing chamber <b>28</b> by opening door <b>30</b>. The filter portion may further be removable such that a user may collect and dispose of collected lint between drying cycles.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">One or more selector inputs <b>80</b>, such as knobs, buttons, touchscreen interfaces, etc., may be provided on a front control panel <b>82</b> and may be in communication with a processing device or controller <b>84</b>. Signals generated in controller <b>84</b> operate the motor, heating assembly <b>50</b>, and other system components in response to the position of selector inputs <b>80</b>. Additionally, a display <b>86</b>, such as an indicator light or a screen, may be provided on front control panel <b>82</b>. Display <b>86</b> may be in communication with controller <b>84</b> and may display information in response to signals from controller <b>84</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, &#x201c;processing device&#x201d; or &#x201c;controller&#x201d; may refer to one or more microprocessors or semiconductor devices and is not restricted necessarily to a single element.

Alternatively, or additionally, reservoir <b>120</b> may be integral to top surface <b>24</b> such that top surface <b>24</b> constitutes the top cover of reservoir <b>120</b>. In this embodiment, an opening in top surface <b>24</b> permits access to reservoir <b>120</b> to allow the addition of treatment fluids. In still other embodiments, reservoir <b>120</b> may be below and separated from top surface <b>24</b> and may lack a top cover entirely.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Once again referring to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, reservoir <b>120</b> further includes a reservoir lid <b>125</b>. Reservoir lid <b>125</b> may reside on or in top surface <b>24</b> and may further cover an opening in top surface <b>24</b>. Further reservoir lid <b>125</b> may connected to reservoir <b>120</b>. However, such a connection is not necessary to fall within the scope of the invention. In some embodiments, reservoir lid <b>125</b> may be completely, physically separate from reservoir <b>120</b> or may not be included at all, for example, in embodiments where reservoir <b>120</b> is a sliding drawer. In the preferred embodiment, reservoir lid <b>125</b> may be movable such that it can be positioned so as to uncover the opening in top surface <b>24</b>, thereby providing selective access to reservoir <b>120</b>. In the preferred embodiment, reservoir lid <b>125</b> screws into place. In other embodiments, reservoir lid <b>125</b> may be movable by snapping into place, pivoting, rotating, sliding, or otherwise. Similarly, in some embodiments, reservoir lid <b>125</b> may reside, for example, on a side or front surface of dryer appliance <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, dryer appliance <b>10</b> may further include a fluid distribution element <b>140</b> for directing treatment fluid into the volume defined by heater housing <b>54</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, fluid distribution element <b>140</b> may be a nozzle, which will aid in directing of the treatment fluid. However, any fluid distribution element capable of distributing treatment fluids may be used consistent with the present disclosure. In fact, in some embodiments, fluid distribution element <b>140</b> may simply be the opening at the end of a hose or pipe, such as used to establish a fluid communication path between reservoir <b>120</b> and heating assembly <b>50</b>, as further described below. Fluid distribution element <b>140</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, may direct treatment fluids into opening <b>55</b> on first end <b>51</b> of heater housing <b>54</b>. In particular, fluid distribution element <b>140</b> should be oriented to distribute treatment fluids above or on heater <b>52</b> so that the treatment fluids may be heated and evaporate and mix with the ambient air drawn through heating assembly <b>50</b>. In alternative embodiments, fluid distribution element <b>140</b> may interact with heating assembly <b>50</b> through a port <b>142</b> on an upper surface of heater housing <b>54</b>. Port <b>142</b> may be situated above heater <b>50</b> and above at least a portion of heating plate <b>180</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, described further below), where used. In this embodiment, fluid distribution element <b>140</b> may be situated such that at least a portion of fluid distribution element <b>140</b> extends through port <b>142</b>. Alternatively, fluid distribution element <b>140</b> may be situated above port <b>142</b> and may direct treatment fluids through port <b>142</b>. In still other embodiments, fluid distribution path <b>130</b> may extend through port <b>142</b> and fluid distribution element <b>140</b> may be situation below port <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As previously discussed, dryer appliance <b>10</b> further includes a fluid distribution path <b>130</b> for directing the treatment fluid from reservoir <b>120</b> to fluid distribution element <b>140</b>. Fluid distribution path <b>130</b> may take the form of a hose, conduit, pipe, or other similar fluid communication means. Fluid distribution path <b>130</b> may have a first end <b>132</b> and a second end <b>134</b>. First end <b>132</b> of fluid distribution path <b>130</b> may be connected to reservoir <b>120</b> to permit treatment fluids to flow from reservoir <b>120</b> into fluid distribution element <b>130</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, dryer appliance <b>10</b> relies on gravity to motivate the treatment fluid from reservoir <b>120</b> into fluid distribution path <b>130</b>. In this embodiment, fluid distribution path <b>130</b> may be mounted to a bottom surface of reservoir <b>120</b> or through a lower portion of the one or more side walls (i.e., below the surface level of the treatment fluids). However, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that alternative arrangements exist. For example, a pump may be used to draw treatment fluids from reservoir <b>120</b>, in which case fluid distribution path <b>130</b> may be attached through any surface of reservoir <b>120</b>. Second end <b>134</b> of fluid distribution path <b>130</b> may be attached to fluid distribution element <b>140</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, dryer appliance <b>10</b> may further include a valve <b>150</b> (e.g., a solenoid valve) disposed between first end <b>132</b> and second end <b>134</b> of fluid distribution path <b>130</b>. Valve <b>150</b> may be biased in the closed position to interrupt the flow of treatment fluid through fluid distribution path <b>130</b> to fluid distribution element <b>140</b>. Controller <b>84</b> may be electrically connection to valve <b>150</b> to control its opening and closing. In particular, controller <b>84</b> may be configured to open valve <b>150</b> during at least a portion of the drying cycle. In the preferred embodiment, controller <b>84</b> opens valve <b>150</b> for a brief period of time to allow a single dose of treatment fluid to bypass valve <b>150</b> and be dispensed through fluid distribution element <b>140</b>. Distribution of treatment fluid into chamber <b>28</b>, as described herein, should occur while drum <b>26</b> continues to rotate and near the end of the drying cycle, once the articles in chamber <b>28</b> have been substantially dried, although such timings are not necessary to practice the invention.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As previously explained, fluid distribution element <b>140</b> may deposit treatment fluid directly onto heater <b>52</b>. However, it is to be expected that, over time and depending on the nature of the treatment fluid, residue may accumulate on heater <b>52</b> and maintenance and cleaning would be difficult in light of the inaccessibility of heater <b>52</b> within dryer appliance <b>10</b>. Therefore, in certain embodiment, it may be desirable to add an intermediate layer between the treatment fluid and heater <b>52</b>. As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, dryer appliance <b>10</b> may further include a heating plate <b>180</b> disposed above at least a portion of heater <b>52</b>. Heating plate <b>180</b> may be positioned such that fluid distribution element <b>140</b> directs treatment fluid onto heating plate <b>180</b>. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to allow users to remove heating plate <b>180</b> for cleaning of any residue. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, heating plate <b>180</b> may take the form of a drawer <b>190</b>. Drawer <b>190</b> may slide between an open position and a closed position. When in the closed position, at least a portion of drawer <b>190</b> is disposed above at least a portion of heater <b>52</b> so that treatment fluid deposited on drawer <b>190</b> may be heated to the point of evaporation. Additionally, a portion of drawer <b>190</b> may extend through an opening in an outer surface of cabinet <b>12</b> to enable users to access and pull the drawer into an open position. When in the open position, a portion of drawer <b>190</b> may extend outside cabinet <b>12</b> to allow access to the inside of drawer <b>190</b> for cleaning, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In certain embodiments, drawer <b>190</b> may be fully removable from cabinet <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Once treatment fluid is deposited with heating assembly <b>50</b>, heater <b>52</b> evaporates the treatment fluid. The gaseous treatment fluid then mixes with the ambient air drawn through heating assembly <b>50</b> as previously described. The mixture passes through an opening <b>200</b> in cabinet <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), where it enters supply duct <b>56</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Supply duct <b>56</b> has a first end <b>57</b> and a second end <b>59</b>. First end <b>57</b> of supply duct <b>56</b> is connected to opening <b>200</b> such that supply duct <b>56</b> is in fluid communication with the second end <b>53</b> of heater housing <b>54</b>. The second end <b>59</b> of supply duct <b>56</b> is further connected to outlet <b>58</b> on a rear wall of drum <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) such that supply duct <b>56</b> is in fluid communication with chamber <b>28</b>. Accordingly, supply duct <b>56</b> provides a passage between heating assembly <b>50</b> and chamber <b>28</b> for the delivery of the mixture. As the mixture passes through chamber <b>28</b> of drum <b>26</b>, articles within chamber <b>28</b> are treated with the gaseous treatment fluid.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">This written description uses examples to disclose the invention, including the best mode, and also to enable any person skilled in the art to practice the invention, including making and using any devices or systems and performing any incorporated methods.
