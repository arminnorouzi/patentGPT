This non-invasive treatment targets solid tumors and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,565,205, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TTFields disrupt cell division through physical interactions with key molecules during mitosis. TTFields therapy is an approved mono-treatment for recurrent glioblastoma, and an approved combination therapy with chemotherapy for newly diagnosed patients. These electric fields are induced non-invasively by transducer arrays (i.e., arrays of electrodes) placed directly on the patient's scalp. TTFields also appear to be beneficial for treating tumors in other parts of the body. Laboratory research has begun to test intermediate frequency alternating electric fields (Tumor Treating Fields, or TTFields) to subcutaneous tumors and orthotropic tumors located in the torso of small animals (e.g., mice).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Described herein, in various aspects, is a treatment assembly comprising an inner layer having an inner surface and an outer surface.

Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As used herein the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example, use of the term &#x201c;an electrode&#x201d; can refer to one or more of such electrodes, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">All technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs unless clearly indicated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;optional&#x201d; or &#x201c;optionally&#x201d; mean that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As used herein, the term &#x201c;at least one of&#x201d; is intended to be synonymous with &#x201c;one or more of&#x201d; For example, &#x201c;at least one of A, B and C&#x201d; explicitly includes only A, only B, only C, and combinations of each.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Ranges can be expressed herein as from &#x201c;about&#x201d; one particular value, and/or to &#x201c;about&#x201d; another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another aspect includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent &#x201c;about,&#x201d; it will be understood that the particular value forms another aspect. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. Optionally, in some aspects, when values are approximated by use of the antecedent &#x201c;about,&#x201d; it is contemplated that values within up to 15%, up to 10%, up to 5%, or up to 1% (above or below) of the particularly stated value can be included within the scope of those aspects. Similarly, use of &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;substantially parallel&#x201d;) or &#x201c;generally&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;generally planar&#x201d;) should be understood to include embodiments in which angles are within about ten degrees, or within five degrees, or within one degree.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The word &#x201c;or&#x201d; as used herein means any one member of a particular list and also includes any combination of members of that list.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">It is to be understood that unless otherwise expressly stated, it is in no way intended that any method set forth herein be construed as requiring that its steps be performed in a specific order. Accordingly, where a method claim does not actually recite an order to be followed by its steps or it is not otherwise specifically stated in the claims or descriptions that the steps are to be limited to a specific order, it is in no way intended that an order be inferred, in any respect. This holds for any possible non-express basis for interpretation, including: matters of logic with respect to arrangement of steps or operational flow; plain meaning derived from grammatical organization or punctuation; and the number or type of aspects described in the specification.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the following description and claims, wherever the word &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; or &#x201c;include&#x201d; is used, it is understood that the words &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; and &#x201c;include&#x201d; can optionally be replaced with the words &#x201c;consists essentially of&#x201d; or &#x201c;consists of&#x201d; to form another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The following description supplies specific details in order to provide a thorough understanding. Nevertheless, the skilled artisan would understand that the apparatus, system, and associated methods of using the apparatus can be implemented and used without employing these specific details. Indeed, the apparatus, system, and associated methods can be placed into practice by modifying the illustrated apparatus, system, and associated methods and can be used in conjunction with any other apparatus and techniques conventionally used in the industry.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">TTFields, also referred to herein as alternating electric fields, are established as an anti-mitotic cancer treatment modality because they interfere with proper micro-tubule assembly during metaphase and eventually destroy the cells during telophase and cytokinesis. The efficacy increases with increasing field strength and the optimal frequency is cancer cell line dependent with 200 kHz being the frequency for which inhibition of glioma cells growth caused by TTFields is highest. For cancer treatment, non-invasive devices were developed with capacitively coupled transducers that are placed directly at the skin region close to the tumor. For patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most common primary, malignant brain tumor in humans, the system for delivering TTFields therapy is called the OPTUNE&#x2122; system (Novocure Ltd.).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Because the effect of TTFields is directional with cells dividing parallel to the field affected more than cells dividing in other directions, and because cells divide in all directions, TTFields are typically delivered through two pairs of transducer arrays that generate perpendicular fields within the treated tumor. More specifically, for the OPTUNE system, one pair of electrodes is located to the left and right (LR) of the tumor, and the other pair of electrodes is located anterior and posterior (AP) to the tumor. Cycling the field between these two directions (i.e., LR and AP) ensures that a maximal range of cell orientations is targeted.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Although TTFields have been approved for use in certain patients, there is a need for systems that permit reliable, consistent, and safe testing of TTFields in animal test subjects. In small animal (e.g., mice) studies in which electrical components are coupled to the animals, the animals frequently chew or otherwise damage the electrical components. Additionally, when the animals are tethered using a cable, the animals frequently cause twisting of the cable. When too much slack is provided in such cables, the animals can easily turn over, leading to damage or incorrect positioning of the electrical components. When insufficient slack is provided in such cables, the movement of the animal can be too restricted. Further, it can be difficult to couple electrical components to animals without significant adjustment and repositioning.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Disclosed herein, in various aspects and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is a system <b>10</b> for providing TTFields to test subjects <b>12</b> (e.g., animal test subjects such as mice). The system <b>10</b> can comprise one or more cage assemblies <b>100</b> to receive and house one or more test subjects. Some test subjects in an experimental group <b>14</b> can be fitted with a TTField treatment assembly <b>200</b>, <b>200</b>&#x2032;, <b>200</b>&#x2033; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, and <b>24</b></figref>) that can comprise a transducer array for providing treatment to the test subjects. Other test subjects in a control group <b>16</b> can be fitted with a control heater treatment assembly <b>400</b>,<b>400</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref>) that is configured to provide the same weight and heat as a TTField treatment assembly <b>200</b>, <b>200</b>&#x2032;, <b>200</b>&#x2033;. A plurality of TTField treatment assemblies <b>200</b>, <b>200</b>&#x2032;, <b>200</b>&#x2033; can communicatively couple to a TTField generator <b>18</b>. Optionally, the TTField generator can be a generator provided as part of an INOVITRO laboratory research system (NOVOCURE GMBH). Similarly, a plurality of control heater treatment assembly <b>400</b> can communicatively couple to the same or a separate TTField generator <b>18</b> (or other generator capable of initiating heat through the control heater treatment assembly as further disclosed herein). A computer <b>1001</b> can communicatively couple to the TTField generator <b>18</b>. The computer <b>1001</b> can control the output of the TTField generator(s) <b>18</b> as well as log data from the TTField generator <b>18</b>, the treatment assemblies <b>200</b>, <b>200</b>&#x2032;, <b>200</b>&#x2033;, the control heater treatment assembly <b>400</b>, and/or the test subjects <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The TTField treatment assemblies <b>200</b>, <b>200</b>&#x2032;, <b>200</b>&#x2033; and control heater treatment assemblies <b>400</b> can communicate with the TTField generator <b>18</b> via respective cables <b>204</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). To enable the test subject to move freely within the cage assembly <b>100</b> without winding the cable <b>204</b>, the cable <b>204</b> can extend to, and couple to, a swivel <b>300</b> (also interchangeably referred to herein as a swivel assembly <b>300</b>). The swivel <b>300</b> can, in turn, couple to a second cable <b>20</b> that extends to, and couples to, the TTField generator <b>18</b>. Thus, the swivel <b>300</b>, as further disclosed herein, can enable electrical communication from the TTField generator <b>18</b>, through the second cable <b>20</b>, through the swivel assembly <b>300</b>, and to the cable <b>204</b> for communicating with the treatment assemblies <b>200</b>, <b>200</b>&#x2032;, <b>200</b>&#x2033; while inhibiting winding of the cable <b>204</b>.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">The Cage Assembly</heading><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the cage assembly <b>100</b> can include a main body <b>102</b>. The main body <b>102</b> can comprise a floor <b>104</b> that defines a floor area having a major dimension. Optionally, the floor <b>104</b> can be rectangular or generally rectangular with corners <b>16</b>. Optionally, the corners <b>16</b> can be rounded. The corners can have, for example, a radius of about 17 mm. The major dimension can be a maximum diagonal between the corners <b>106</b> of the cage. The main body <b>102</b> can further comprise one or more sidewalls <b>108</b>. For example, the main body <b>102</b> can comprise a front sidewall <b>108</b>A, an opposing rear sidewall <b>108</b>B, and a pair of opposing sidewalls <b>108</b>C that extend between respective edges of the front sidewall <b>108</b>A and rear sidewall <b>108</b>B. The intersections between the respective sidewalls can define rounded corners <b>110</b>. Optionally, the sidewalls <b>108</b> can converge in a direction toward the floor <b>104</b> (i.e., slope inwardly moving in a downward direction) to provide draft angles for enabling manufacturing via injection molding. Optionally, the floor can comprise padding as is commonly used in conventional animal cages. The padding can be, for example, sawdust. Food pellets can be placed on the floor of the enclosure for foraging. A conventional water bottle can attach to the cage for hydrating the test subject. Optionally, the cage can comprise an opening within a sidewall of each enclosure to receive a dispensing portion of the conventional water bottle.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In exemplary aspects, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the sidewalls <b>108</b> can define a plurality of apertures <b>130</b> for ventilation. One or more filters <b>132</b> can optionally cover the plurality of apertures in each sidewall <b>108</b>. A frame <b>134</b> can extend about a perimeter of the filter <b>132</b> and receive fasteners (e.g., nuts <b>136</b> and bolts <b>138</b>) to attach to the main body <b>102</b> of the cage assembly <b>100</b>. In this way, the cage assembly is sealed so that all or substantially all ventilation to each enclosure travels through the at least one filter before entering a ventilation opening. Optionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a single filter <b>132</b> can cover a plurality of apertures <b>130</b> (optionally, all the apertures) of a sidewall <b>108</b>. The filter can be removable, autoclavable, and replaceable. The filter can minimize penetration of infectious materials and bodies while enabling rapid air exchange. It is contemplated that a net, screen, grate, air-permeable membrane, or other permeable structure can be positioned between the plurality of apertures <b>130</b> in the cage and the filter <b>132</b> to inhibit the test subjects from chewing on the filter.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a door <b>112</b> can pivotably couple to the main body portion <b>102</b> by a pair of hinges <b>114</b>. In use, the door <b>112</b> can be moveable about and between (1) a closed position in which the door <b>112</b> cooperates with the sidewalls to provide the enclosure(s); and (2) an open position in which the door is pivoted away from the interior of the cage assembly to provide one or more openings through which the interior of the cage assembly can be accessed.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">A cover <b>120</b> can extend across a top of the main body <b>102</b>. The cover <b>120</b> can releasably attach to the main body <b>102</b> via latch <b>122</b>. The latch <b>122</b> can pivotably attach to the main body <b>102</b> via hinges <b>124</b>. A latch <b>126</b> that is pivotable about a hinge <b>128</b> can attach to the door <b>112</b>. The latch <b>126</b> can releasably engage a catch on top of the cover <b>120</b> for holding the door <b>112</b> in a closed position. Optionally, the cover <b>120</b> can comprise one or more swivel housings <b>180</b> that are configured to receive at least a portion of a swivel as further disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">A partition <b>140</b> can define a common sidewall that divides the interior of the cage into a first enclosure <b>142</b> and a second enclosure <b>144</b>. The partition <b>140</b> can optionally be removable. The main body can optionally define a slot into which the partition <b>140</b> can be inserted. The partition <b>140</b> can define an opening <b>146</b> (optionally, a plurality of openings) between the first enclosure <b>142</b> and the second enclosure <b>144</b> for allowing respective test subjects <b>12</b> in each of the first and second enclosures to interact with each other (e.g., through vocal interaction, through scent, through body warmth, and the like). Thus, the first enclosure <b>142</b> and second enclosures <b>144</b> can each have respective sidewalls (or sidewall portions) defined by the front sidewall <b>108</b>A, the door <b>112</b>, the rear sidewall <b>108</b>B, a sidewall <b>108</b>C extending between the front and rear sidewalls, and the partition <b>140</b>. In these examples, it is contemplated that the floor area within each enclosure can have a respective major dimension, which can be equal a maximum diagonal between corners of the enclosure.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The sidewalls (e.g., main body <b>104</b> and partition <b>140</b>) and cover can optionally comprise polycarbonate and can optionally be autoclavable. Portions of the cage, such as, for example, the main body <b>102</b> and cover <b>120</b>, can be transparent so that the test subject can be observed while closed in the cage.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a shelter subassembly <b>150</b> can extend inwardly from the partition <b>140</b> into each of the first enclosure <b>142</b> and the second enclosure <b>144</b>. Within each enclosure, the shelter subassembly <b>150</b> can comprise an arcuate roof, a pair of parallel walls extending vertically downward from the arcuate roof, and, optionally, a floor cover extending between bottom edges of the sidewalls of the shelter subassembly. Within each enclosure, the shelter subassembly <b>150</b> can project from the partition <b>140</b> a select distance D. Optionally, the distance D can be about 4-5 centimeters. It is contemplated that the distance D can be selected so that the cable will not restrict the test subject from interacting with the test subject of the opposing enclosure. For example, the cable can be strapped to the back of the test subject a select spacing, d, away from the subject's head. In this way, the test subject cannot chew on the cable. This select spacing can also enable the test subject to enter the shelter subassembly before the cable touches the shelter subassembly. Further, the cable can be sufficiently flexible to bend upon contact with the shelter subassembly. The select distance that the shelter subassembly <b>150</b> protrudes from the partition <b>140</b> can be selected so that the test subject (e.g., at least the nose and/or face of the test subject) can at least reach a plane defined by the partition <b>140</b> when the cable is fully taut against the shelter subassembly. As further disclosed herein, the cable length can be a function of the enclosure's dimensions. Thus, the select distance D that the shelter subassembly <b>150</b> protrudes from the partition <b>140</b> can be a function of the cable length and the enclosure's height and width dimensions.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The covers <b>120</b> for the first enclosure and the second enclosure can be unitarily constructed as a cover assembly <b>178</b>.

The cover assembly <b>178</b> can comprise first and second openings between the first and second enclosures and their respective swivels <b>300</b>. The first and second openings can provide communication to enable the cable of the treatment assembly to couple to the respective swivel. Each swivel can be in overlying relation to a respective one of the first and second openings. According to various aspects, each swivel can extend through a respective opening in the cover assembly and at least partially into a respective enclosure to receive a respective cable.

In order to prevent the test subject from having sufficient slack in the cable <b>204</b> in order to flip over or get tangled with the cable, the cage assembly can have a select cage height, h, that is a function of the length, R<sub>1</sub>, and width, R<sub>2</sub>, of each enclosure. For example, cable <b>204</b> can have a select length to prevent providing enough slack for the test subject to wrap the cable around its body. According to some optional aspects, the dimensions of each enclosure <b>142</b>,<b>144</b> can be selected so that the test subject can access the corners of the cage, but when the test subject is positioned directly below the attachment of the cable to the swivel <b>300</b>, the cable does not have enough slack to hang or extend downwardly from the back of the test subject and touch the floor of the cage. To maximize the usable area for a given cage height, the cable can extend from directly above a center of the floor space of each enclosure. Accordingly, the height of the cage can be selected as a function of the major dimension of the cage floor (of a given enclosure) and the height of the test subject. For example, the height can be selected based on the following equation:</p><p id="p-0106" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>h</i>&#x2265;(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup><i>+R</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>&#x2212;16<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>)/16<i>a </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0107" num="0000">where h is the height of the cage, R<sub>1 </sub>is a length of the enclosure, R<sub>2 </sub>is width of the enclosure, and a is the height of the animal.<br/>Thus, the height can be a function of the major dimension of the cage floor, Y, according to the following equation:</p><p id="p-0108" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>h</i>&#x2265;(<i>Y</i><sup>2</sup>&#x2212;16<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>)/16<i>a </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0109" num="0000">A typical test subject mouse can have a height (a) of 20 mm.

Thus, with a partition dividing the length of the floor, each enclosure can have a floor with a long side of 185 mm and a short side of 157 mm. Thus, the floor area of each enclosure can have a major dimension of 242 cm (equal to the maximum diagonal between corners of the enclosure). Thus, it is contemplated that the height of the cage can have a minimum height of at least 163 mm, providing a height that is about 0.7 times the major dimension of the cage floor. According to various aspects, the floor area of each enclosure can have a minimum major dimension of at least 160 mm, between about 160 mm and about 200 millimeters, between about 200 millimeters and about 250 mm, between about 250 mm and about 300 mm, between about 300 mm and about 400 mm, or above 400 mm. In some embodiments, the cage height can be about 260 mm. In further embodiments, the height of the cage can be at least 60 mm, at least 105 mm, at least 175 mm, at least 261 mm, or at least 480 mm.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0107">It is contemplated that the above equations for selecting the height of the cage are not absolute because the cable has some amount of rigidity (i.e., the cable has a limit to its flexibility), thereby limiting the ability of the cable to reach the floor of the cage. Thus, it is contemplated that the height of the cage can be less than the minimum heights of the above equations while still providing a sufficient cage height to prevent entanglement of the test subject.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0108">Optionally, the cage can comprise a feeder (e.g., a food tray or food dispenser).

The average metrics can be the average metrics for similar test subjects or for average metrics for a given subject over a select time period (e.g., over the course of an hour, a day, or a week). For example, the average metrics can comprise an average amount of movement that the test subject moves each day. Thus, it is contemplated that a decreasing amount of movement each day can be indicative of degrading health of the test subject. It is further contemplated that an excessively high amount of movement or an excessively low amount of movement in comparison to other similar test subjects can indicate relative health of the test subject.

The test subject's fur can be removed at the application area with a trimming device and/or a hair removal cream (e.g., VEET hair removal cream). Similarly, test subjects <b>12</b> of the control group can be fitted with respective control heater treatment assemblies <b>400</b> or control heater treatment assemblies <b>400</b>&#x2032; (to match the experimental group's counterpart).</p><p id="p-0164" num="0158">The treatment assembly can be positioned on the body so that the electrodes are positioned as close as possible to the tumor. In various aspects, the treatment assembly (or control heater assembly) can be positioned on the body of the test subject so as to minimize or eliminate interruption of natural movements. For example, if the treatment assembly can be positioned away from the hind legs or the front legs of a mouse to allow natural movements. The treatment assembly can be selected based at least in part on the size of the mouse. For example, a narrow treatment assembly can be positioned on a mouse weighing less than 23 grams, and a wide treatment assembly can be positioned on a mouse weighing greater than 23 grams.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0159">The treatment array (or control heater assembly) can be oriented so that the cable extends toward the tail/hind end of the test subject. It is contemplated that the subcutaneous treatment assembly and control heater assemblies can have formed bends (e.g., 90 degree bends) that can enable the cable to extend to the middle of the back of the test subject and then extend along the back toward the hind end. The formed bends can be provided in either direction, depending on the side of the test subjection on which the subcutaneous tumor is positioned. An adhesive (e.g., plaster) can be disposed on the test subject to promote adherence of the treatment assembly (or control heater assembly).</p><p id="p-0166" num="0160">The test subjects can be placed within respective enclosures of cage assemblies. The connector end of each treatment assembly and control heater treatment assembly <b>400</b> can be attached to a respective swivel.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0161">The treatment assemblies can be controlled to provide TTFields to the test subjects. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b></figref>, TTFields from 50-500 kHz (optionally, 150-500 kHz) can be delivered to an organ tumor <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>) or a subcutaneous tumor <b>22</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>). Optionally, the TTFields can be delivered sequentially in separate axes of propagation (to provide alternating fields). For example, a first pair of opposing electrodes can apply a first electric field across the tumor along a first axis of propagation <b>60</b>. A second pair of electrodes that are positioned so as to have a second axis of propagation <b>62</b> that is perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the first axis of propagation can alternate with the first pair of opposing electrodes to provide alternating fields across the tumor. For the treatment assembly <b>200</b>, each electrode can cooperate with a respective electrode positioned farthest from its location (e.g., on the other side of the body of the test subject) to provide alternating TTFields. Optionally, each electrode can be independently controlled to provide a tailored treatment. The control heater treatment assemblies can be controlled via a TTField generator or other controller to provide placebo heat to match or substantially match the temperatures of the treatment assemblies. The treatments can optionally continue for about 1-2 weeks.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0162">The tumors of the experimental group and the control group can be compared during and after treatment. For example, for subcutaneous tumors, while leaving the treatment assembly attached to the subject, the cap can be removed to expose the tumor, and the tumor size can be measured with calipers. Organ tumors can be measured via, for example, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), or computed tomography (CT) scans. The treatment assemblies can be removed prior to such scans.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Computing Device</heading><p id="p-0169" num="0163"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows a system <b>1000</b> including an exemplary configuration of a computing device <b>1001</b> for use in the system <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0164">The computing device <b>1001</b> may comprise one or more processors <b>1003</b>, a system memory <b>1012</b>, and a bus <b>1013</b> that couples various components of the computing device <b>1001</b> including the one or more processors <b>1003</b> to the system memory <b>1012</b>.
