MCSG is a light hydrocarbon-containing gas comprising methane and impurities lighter than methane that can be produced from the gasification of coal or oil residues. Making MCSG from gasification products is a clean way of using traditionally solid and low-value heavy liquid fuels by allowing centralized carbon capture and sequestration while the clean low-carbon containing methane is produced and distributed. Additionally, co-production of LNG from a gasification process provides an attractive option to diversify a product portfolio, thus improving the overall economics of a project.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An exemplary prior art process for producing LNG from MCSG is depicted and described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,436,505. In the process depicted therein, a hydrocarbon-containing feed gas stream, such as a syngas stream, is cooled to a relatively warm temperature of &#x2212;30 to &#x2212;130&#xb0; C. in a main heat exchanger that utilizes a vaporizing mixed refrigerant to provide the refrigeration. The cooled feed gas stream exiting the main heat exchanger is further cooled in a reboiler which provides heat for boilup in a secondary distillation column (lower operating pressure). The cooled feed gas stream exiting the reboiler is then further cooled to a temperature &#x2212;120 to &#x2212;200&#xb0; C. and at least partially liquefied in the main heat exchanger before being flashed and separated in a drum to form a flashed vapor stream and a liquid stream. The flashed vapor stream is expanded in the expander portion of a compander and routed to the rectification section of a primary distillation column (higher operating pressure). The liquid stream is let down in pressure via a valve and routed to the bottom of the primary distillation column.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A stream of bottoms liquid withdrawn from the primary distillation column is routed to the secondary distillation column to further improve methane recovery. A stream of bottoms liquid withdrawn from the secondary distillation column is cooled to a final temperature of &#x2212;120 to &#x2212;200&#xb0; C. in the main heat exchanger to form the LNG product stream. A stream of overhead vapor from the secondary distillation column is condensed in the main heat exchanger and flashed in reflux drum. The reflux drum liquid is used as reflux for both the primary and secondary distillation columns. The reflux drum vapor is compressed in the compression portion of the compander and is joined with the overhead vapour from the primary distillation column to form a stream of residue gas that is warmed in the main heat exchanger and recompressed in a residue gas compressor before being routed out of the facility.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A standard heat pump configuration using a two-stage compressor and a JT valve is used to provide cold refrigerant and hence refrigeration to the main heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The configuration shown in U.S. Pat. No. 10,436,505 can produce high purity methane-rich LNG, but it does have certain disadvantages. One issue is that the mixed refrigerant stream is introduced into the main heat exchanger as a two-phase mixture. This complicates the design of the piping and may cause undesirable unsteady operation due to slugging. Also, two-phase flow requires special design features of the main heat exchanger to ensure that the liquid and vapor phases are evenly distributed. For example, if the main heat exchanger is a plate-fin exchanger, special devices such as a separator and injection tubes must be provided to evenly distribute the phases across all passages. The use of these devices adds cost and can reduce operation stability. Additionally, the two-phase flow may become unstable at low flowrates causing disengagement of the phases resulting in large internal temperature gradients and potential damage to the main heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another disadvantage is that the main exchanger utilises two different low pressure streams for provide cooling duty to the heat exchanger (i.e. the cold vaporizing mixed refrigerant stream and the residue gas stream), which practically precludes the use of a coil-wound type heat exchanger as the main heat exchanger. Coil-wound heat exchangers are proven to be efficient, reliable, and robust for natural gas liquefaction and end flash gas heat exchange applications. The design and manufacturing technology of coil-wound heat exchangers allows much higher unit processing capacity (heat exchange duty achieved per coil-wound heat exchanger unit), avoiding using multiple heat exchanger units (in the case of plate fine heat exchanger) in parallel up to very large capacities. A coil-wound heat exchanger unit comprises one or more tube bundles encased in a shell casing, the tube side of the unit being designed to receive one or more hot streams that require cooling, and the shell side of the unit being designed to receive a single stream of cold refrigerant or two or more cold streams that mix in the shell side and exit as a single stream of warmed refrigerant. The only way that a coil-wound heat exchanger could accommodate the use of two or more cold streams that are to be kept separate would be to pass at least one of the cold streams through one of the passages on the tube side of the heat exchanger. However, the design of the coil-wound exchanger would then be difficult given the low available pressure drop and the relatively high typical resistance in the passages on the tube side of the heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A further disadvantage of the depicted process is that all of the residue gas is produced at a relatively low pressure. This increases the operating and capital costs of the process, as the larger the amount of residue gas produced at low pressure the greater the power requirement for recompressing said gas and the larger the residue gas compressor has to be to accommodate said gas.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Disclosed herein are methods and systems for producing LNG from MCSG that provide several advantages over the prior art described above. The methods and systems may employ a single distillation column (instead of two or more columns). A coil-wound heat exchanger unit may be used that is separate from the heat exchanger unit(s) used to recover refrigeration from the residue gas streams, which coil-wound heat exchanger unit may receive, cool, and partially liquefy a portion of the MCSG feed stream, and/or which may receive and cool the refrigerant (such as a mixed refrigerant or other vaporizing refrigerant) that is then used for cooling and partially liquefying the MCSG feed stream. A portion of the residue gas may be rejected at substantially the same pressure as the MCSG feed stream and require relatively little or no recompression.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Several

methods and systems for producing LNG from MCSG.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0099">As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; mean one or more when applied to any feature in embodiments of the present invention described in the specification and claims. The use of &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; does not limit the meaning to a single feature unless such a limit is specifically stated. The article &#x201c;the&#x201d; preceding singular or plural nouns or noun phrases denotes a particular specified feature or particular specified features and may have a singular or plural connotation depending upon the context in which it is used.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0100">Where letters are used herein to identify recited steps of a method (e.g. (a), (b), and (c)), these letters are used solely to aid in referring to the method steps and are not intended to indicate a specific order in which claimed steps are performed, unless and only to the extent that such order is specifically recited.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0101">Where used herein to identify recited features of a method or system, the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, &#x201c;third&#x201d; and so on, are used solely to aid in referring to and distinguishing between the features in question, and are not intended to indicate any specific order of the features, unless and only to the extent that such order is specifically recited.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0102">As used herein, the term &#x201c;methane containing synthetic gas&#x201d;, also referred to herein as &#x201c;MCSG&#x201d;, refers to a gas comprising methane and components lighter than methane (i.e. components having a higher volatility and lower boiling point than methane) such as in particular hydrogen and/or carbon monoxide. The term as used herein includes gasification syngas product streams containing methane molecules and synthetic natural gas streams produced from methanation process which contain impurities such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide. In preferred embodiments, a methane-containing synthetic gas feed stream may comprise 10-60 mol % methane with the remaining content being a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, optionally with a small amounts of carbon dioxide, water, and/or other impurities.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0103">As used herein, the term residue gas refers to a gas comprising predominantly components lighter than methane removed from the MCSG feed stream, such as in particular hydrogen and/or carbon monoxide. In preferred embodiments, a residue gas stream may comprise less than 10 mol % methane, and more preferably less than 2 mol % methane, with the remainder consisting or consisting essentially of components lighter than methane, such as for example a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, optionally with small amounts of other components such as nitrogen and/or argon.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0104">As used herein, the term &#x201c;liquefied natural gas&#x201d; or &#x201c;LNG&#x201d; refers to a liquefied gas stream comprising predominantly methane, which preferably comprises at least 85 mole %, more preferably at least 90 mole %, and most preferably at least about 95 mole % of the feed stream. An LNG stream may still contain small amounts of other components as may have been present in the MCSG feed stream and have not been removed by the process, such as small amounts of other components heavier (i.e. lower volatility and higher boiling point) than methane, such as carbon dioxide or hydrocarbons heavier than methane (e.g. ethane, propane, butane, pentanes) and/or small amounts of components lighter than methane, such as nitrogen, hydrogen or carbon monoxide.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0105">As used herein, the term &#x201c;distillation column&#x201d; refers to a column containing one or more separation stages, composed of devices such as packing or trays, that increase contact and thus enhance mass transfer between upward rising vapor and downward flowing liquid flowing inside the column. In this way, the concentration of lighter (i.e. higher volatility and lower boiling point) components increases in the rising vapor that collects as overhead vapor at the top of the column, and the concentration of heavier (i.e. lower volatility and higher boiling point) components increases in the descending liquid that collects as bottoms liquid at the bottom of the column. The &#x201c;top&#x201d; of the distillation column refers to the part of the column at or above the top-most separation stage. The &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; of the column refers to the part of the column at or below the bottom-most separation stage. An &#x201c;intermediate location&#x201d; of the column refers to a location between the top and bottom of the column, between two separation stages.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0106">As used herein, the term &#x201c;phase separator&#x201d; refers to a drum or other form of vessel in which a two phase stream can be introduced in order to separate the stream into its constituent vapor and liquid phases where the liquid and vapor streams exiting the vessel are in equilibrium. In contrast to a distillation column (in which the liquid and vapor streams exiting the column are not in equilibrium), a phase separator does not contain any separation stages (i.e. packing or trays) inside the vessel for bringing upward rising vapor and downward flowing liquid into contact.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0107">As used herein, the term &#x201c;fluid flow communication&#x201d; refers to the nature of connectivity between two or more components that enables liquids, vapors, and/or two-phase mixtures to be transported between the components in a controlled fashion (i.e., without leakage) either directly or indirectly. Coupling two or more components such that they are in fluid flow communication with each other can involve any suitable method known in the art, such as with the use of welds, flanged conduits, gaskets, and bolts. Two or more components may also be coupled together via other components of the system that may separate them, for example, valves, gates, or other devices that may selectively restrict or direct fluid flow.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0108">Reference herein to a second device or component being in &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; fluid flow communication with a first device or component means that said second device or component is arranged so as to receive fluid, either directly or indirectly, from said first device or component.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0109">As used herein, the term &#x201c;indirect heat exchange&#x201d; refers to heat exchange between two fluids where the two fluids are kept separate from each other by some form of physical barrier.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0110">As used herein, the term &#x201c;coil-wound heat exchanger unit&#x201d; refers to a heat exchanger unit of the type known in the art, comprising one or more tube bundles encased in a shell casing. Each tube bundle comprises a plurality of tubes, the interior of the tubes defining one or more passages (also referred to as tube circuits) for passing one or more fluid streams through the heat exchanger unit, the interior of said tubes being referred to herein as the &#x201c;tube side&#x201d; of the heat exchanger unit. The space internal to the shell casing and external to the tubes defines a single passage for passing a fluid stream through the heat exchanger unit, said space internal to the shell casing and external to the tubes being referred to herein as the &#x201c;shell side&#x201d; of the heat exchanger unit. In this way, a fluid passing through the shell side of the heat exchanger can undergo indirect heat exchange with a fluid passing through the tube side of the heat exchanger. Where the coil-wound heat exchanger unit is being used to cool one or more &#x2018;hot&#x2019; fluid streams via indirect heat exchange with a &#x2018;cold&#x2019; refrigerant, the cold refrigerant is almost always passed through the shell side of the heat exchanger, as the shell side provides much lower flow resistance and allows for a much greater pressure drop than the tube side, which makes passing the cold refrigerant through the shell side much more effective and efficient (the cold refrigerant typically being a vaporizing or expanding fluid at a relatively low pressure). Coil wound heat exchangers are a compact design of heat exchanger known for their robustness, safety, and heat transfer efficiency, and thus have the benefit of providing highly efficient levels of heat exchange relative to their footprint. However, because the shell side defines only a single passage through the heat exchanger, it is not practicable use more than one stream of cold refrigerant to provide cooling duty in a coil-wound heat exchanger if the mixing of said streams of refrigerant is not permitted.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0111">Solely by way of example, various exemplary embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the Figures.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0112">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a method and system for producing LNG from MCSG in accordance with a first embodiment of the invention is shown.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0113">An MCSG feed stream <b>100</b>, such as for example a syngas stream <b>100</b> comprising a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water, methane, ethane and other hydrocarbons, which is at ambient temperature and a high-pressure, typically 20 to 80 bara, may first be routed to a pretreatment system <b>105</b>. Depending on the composition of the MCSG feed stream, the pretreatment system can include an acid gas removal unit for removing hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide impurities, a dehydration unit for removing water, and a mercury removal unit for removing mercury. There may also be a heavy component removal step in which LPG (liquified petroleum gas) components, freezable pentane and heavier components, are removed. As such, the flowrate and composition of the MCSG feed stream <b>111</b> exiting the pretreatment section <b>105</b> may be significantly different than that of the MCSG feed stream <b>100</b> entering said pretreatment section <b>105</b>, although the MCSG feed stream will still comprise methane and components lighter than methane, in particular hydrogen and carbon monoxide.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0114">The MCSG feed stream <b>111</b> exiting the pretreatment section <b>105</b>, which is typically at ambient temperature, is then divided into two streams, namely a first stream <b>113</b> and a second stream <b>115</b>. The first stream <b>113</b>, which preferably consists of a minor portion of the MCSG feed stream <b>111</b>, such as between 10 and 40 percent and more preferably between 20 and 30 percent of the flow of the MCSG feed stream <b>111</b>, is sent to a first heat exchanger unit or set of units <b>114</b>. The second stream <b>115</b>, which consists of the remainder of the flow of the MCSG feed stream <b>111</b> and hence preferably consists of a major portion of said stream, is sent to a second heat exchanger unit or set of units <b>116</b>. The second heat exchanger unit or set of units <b>116</b> may for example comprise a plate fin exchanger unit or a plurality of plate fin exchanger units arranged in parallel. The first and second streams <b>113</b> and <b>115</b> are cooled and partially liquefied in, respectively, the first heat exchanger unit(s) <b>114</b> and second heat exchanger unit(s) <b>116</b>, forming respectively a first cooled and partially liquefied stream <b>120</b> and a second cooled and partially liquefied stream <b>117</b> that are each at a temperature of between &#x2212;130&#xb0; C. and &#x2212;160&#xb0; C. and more preferably between &#x2212;140&#xb0; C. and &#x2212;150&#xb0; C. The first and second cooled and partially liquefied streams <b>120</b>, <b>117</b> are then combined (with the pressure of the second cooled and partially liquefied stream <b>117</b> first being regulated, if necessary, and via for example a pressure regulator valve <b>117</b>A, to control the flow of said stream <b>117</b>) to form a partially liquefied MCSG feed stream <b>130</b> that is then separated using a first phase separator <b>140</b> and a second phase separator <b>135</b> arranged in series, with the second phase separator being in downstream fluid flow communication with the first phase separator.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0115">More specifically, the partially liquefied MCSG feed stream <b>130</b> is first introduced into the first phase separator <b>140</b> which in this case is a flash drum in which the partially liquefied MCSG feed stream is flashed and separated into a liquid steam that forms a first feed stream <b>152</b>, and a vapor stream <b>141</b>. The vapor stream <b>141</b> is divided to form a second feed stream <b>143</b> (which preferably consists of between 60 and 90 percent or more preferably between 70 and 80 percent of the flow of vapor stream <b>141</b>) and a third feed stream <b>142</b> (which consists of the remainder of vapor stream <b>141</b>, i.e. preferably between 10 and 40 percent and more preferably between 20 and 30 percent of the flow of said stream). The third feed stream <b>142</b> is further cooled and partially liquefied to form a partially liquefied third feed stream <b>133</b> at a temperature of between &#x2212;170&#xb0; C. and &#x2212;200&#xb0; C. and more preferably between &#x2212;180&#xb0; C. and &#x2212;190&#xb0; C.
