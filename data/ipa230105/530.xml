Specifically, the present disclosure includes a spinal implant that may be positioned along an individual's vertebrae to simulate the natural spinous process and lamina portions of the vertebral arch removed during a laminectomy procedure.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A laminectomy is a surgical procedure for removal of the vertebral arch, including the spinous process and portions of the lamina, located in the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions of the spine. This procedure may be performed on patients with back pain due to compression along the spinal cord or nerves, which may be caused from various spine diseases, including (but not limited to) degenerative, infectious, neoplastic, traumatic, and congenital pathologies. Removal of the vertebral arch allows for decompression of the spinal canal, and gives the surgeon access to the contents of the spinal canal as needed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Despite its advantages, a laminectomy procedure may present various complications. For example, a laminectomy procedure inherently results in postoperative dead space around the surgical area. This dead space may lead to dangerous postoperative fluid collections, such as hematomas, and may lead to infection. Known methods to address these complications may involve rotating muscles in the patient's back to re-occupy the dead space. However, this generally requires a plastic surgeon, additional time, and may cause additional blood loss.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, some patients may require the application of a spinal fixation construct, which may include e.g., pedicle screws and rods, along a spinal segment for treatment of spinal instability, in addition to laminectomies for decompression of the neural elements. Any spinal fusion procedure carries the risk of causing adjacent segment disease or proximal junctional kyphosis. Moreover, such fixation constructs generally exacerbate the problem of postoperative dead space in the laminectomy defect because it is more difficult to bring the paraspinal muscles back towards the midline to fill this dead space after the pedicle screws and rods have been placed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is with these observations in mind, among others, that various aspects of the present disclosure were conceived and developed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a postoperative posterior view of a spinal segment after a laminectomy procedure.

In addition, the removable screw tabs <b>422</b> may include respective screw tab openings <b>428</b> through which screw tab screws (not shown) may be threaded such that the surgeon may substantially secure the spinal implant <b>410</b> to a patient's bone. It is contemplated that the spinal implant <b>410</b> may include an alternative fastening device without departing from the scope of the disclosure.

In addition, it is also contemplated that the first lamina support <b>414</b>A and the second lamina support <b>414</b>B may be configured to attach to each other. For example, a support bar (not shown) may be installed within the space between the first lamina support <b>414</b>A and the second lamina support <b>414</b>B. This support bar may be substantially rigid, or it may be configured to allow relative motion between the first lamina support <b>414</b>A and the second lamina support <b>414</b>B. Additionally, the first lamina support <b>414</b>A and the second lamina support <b>414</b>B may include curved bottom surfaces that may be capable of closely engaging with portions of the cut lamina (not shown).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one non-limiting embodiment, the removable screw tabs <b>422</b> are configured to be detached from the first screw shelf <b>420</b>A or the second screw shelf <b>420</b>B such that they may accommodate varying interpeduncular distance. To illustrate, in this non-limiting embodiment, the surgeon may cut off any excess or undesired screw tabs <b>422</b> in order to provide the patient with a better implant. If the patient's spine is particularly wide, the at least one removable screw tabs <b>422</b> may be used by the surgeon to connect the device to the patient; however, if the spine is too narrow for the removable screw tabs <b>422</b> than any or all of them may be removed by the surgeon so that the connection can be made directly with the first screw shelf <b>420</b>A and the second screw shelf <b>420</b>B. In addition, the removable screw tabs <b>422</b> may have a reduced thickness compared to the first screw shelf <b>420</b>A or the second screw shelf <b>420</b>B such that the surgeon may quickly and easily cut off the screw tab or tabs <b>422</b> that are not needed, while still sufficiently thick enough to substantially achieve a secure engagement of the muscle, tissue, or other material.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, it is contemplated that the at least one of the removable screw tabs <b>422</b> may vary in number and in distance between each tab and perform substantially the same function without departing from the scope of the disclosure. In one non-limiting example, the body of the removable screw tabs <b>422</b> may further include another removable screw tab (not shown) extending outwardly therefrom from, with a profile that generally matches the dimensions of the screw tabs <b>422</b>. In this case, another removable screw tab may be separated by a scored section (not shown) that has a substantially reduced material thickness in comparison to the screw tabs <b>422</b> such that a surgeon may quickly and easily separate one tab from another. It is also contemplated that the at least one removable screw tab <b>422</b> may comprise any known or suitable alternative to size and shape, location, configuration, etc. without departing from the scope of the disclosure. It is further appreciated that any known or suitable alternative configuration of the at least one removable screw tab <b>422</b> could be employed, such as multi-level removable screw tabs, wherein the one or both of the screw shelves may extend along a first vertical axis such that the screw shelf can be configured to attach to multiple screw tabs each stacked upon one another such that the screw tab screws may extend through multiple screw tab openings and can be threadably received by the screw tab openings. It is also contemplated that the at least one removable screw tab <b>422</b> may extend from the first screw shelf <b>420</b>A and second screw shelf <b>420</b>B from different angles. In addition, the at least one removable screw tab <b>422</b> may also be arranged in a shaft-loop configuration.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another non-limiting embodiment, the spinal implant <b>410</b> may further include an anchor jaw assembly (not shown). The anchor jaw assembly may include a rectangular support component (not shown) that may extend outward from the anterior or posterior surface of the support bridge <b>418</b>, first lamina support <b>414</b>A, second lamina support <b>414</b>B, first screw shelf <b>420</b>A, second screw shelf <b>420</b>B, or any combination of these components, with the support component being adjustably secured to an anchor jaw (not shown). The anchor jaw may include a dual-prong configuration that extends outward from the support component and may comprise a first elongated prong of the anchor jaw, a second elongated prong of the anchor jaw, and a plurality of jaw openings positioned on both the first prong, and the second prong. In this manner, a screw, rail, pin, or other suitable fastening device may extend through the first prong of the anchor jaw, the patients natural spinous process, and the second prong of the anchor jaw so that a surgeon may fix the spinal implant <b>410</b> to inferior and superior adjacent spinous processes, additional spinous process implants, or both, as a means to correct multilevel laminar defects or other relevant conditions. The anchor jaw may integrate with these features in other methods as well. For example, in one non-limiting embodiment, the anchor jaw may also be designed as a rotatable clamp structure (not shown) that may secure the assembly to a feature by compressing the prongs, against the feature, and wherein the rotatable clamp structure is rotatable about an anchor locking position disposed between the rectangular support component and the clamp structure so that the assembly may accommodate for variations in the curvature of the patient's spine.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another non-limiting embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, the support bridge <b>418</b> may include a curved bottom surface, which may be configured such that it curves substantially inwards towards the spinous process plate section <b>416</b>. In this non-limiting embodiment, the curved bottom surface provides the device with a decompression zone so that it may relieve pressure caused by spinal cord abnormalities without compromising the protection allotted by the device. Additionally, the support bridge <b>418</b> may have a substantially flat surface, sloped surface, or a combination of flat, sloped, and curved surfaces. For example, the support bridge <b>418</b> may have a bottom surface that is gradually sloped from anterior end to posterior end such that it forms a modest angle in one embodiment. Further, the curved bottom surface could have a plurality of protrusions extending away from the bottom surface in any number of configurations such that they may provide substantial surface contact with the patient to allow for better a better fit while still providing the benefits of the decompression zone.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, the plate section openings <b>424</b> can be seen at the anterior, posterior, and top edge of the spinous process plate section <b>416</b>. The varying height arrangement of these plate section openings <b>424</b> provides the surgeon with an array of options for connecting the muscle, tissues, or other materials along the spinal implant <b>410</b>. It is also contemplated that the number of plate section openings <b>424</b>, and the size of the plate section openings <b>424</b> may vary without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, in another non-limiting embodiment, the spinous process plate section <b>416</b> may include a plurality of engagement members <b>492</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>), which may include plate section loops extending outward from the spinous process plate section <b>416</b> which may also provide the surgeon with sufficient coverage and attachment options. Arranged across the spinous process plate section <b>416</b>, these outwardly facing loops may be constructed at different orientations and still achieve secure engagement of the muscle, tissue, or other material to the spinal implant <b>410</b>. Additionally, it is also contemplated that the loops could be designed as hooks and achieve substantially the same function without departing from the scope of the disclosure. As an example, the plurality of plate section loops may be designed such that the component material curves around and crosses itself to form a complete loop. However, in this non-limiting embodiment, the loop may not cross itself such that it forms a hook and still allows for the purpose of sewing the paraspinal muscles to the spinal implant <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is further contemplated that a person with ordinary skill in the art would understand that the at least one of the screw tab openings <b>428</b>, the plate section openings <b>424</b>, and the screw shelf openings <b>426</b> may have different shapes depending on the surgeon's needs. For example, the plate section openings <b>424</b> may have a square shape or an oblong shape and serve substantially the same purpose without departing from the scope of the disclosure. In addition, although not depicted, any of the openings may have a textured or threaded surface such that they are configured to receive a suitable fastening device.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the first lamina support <b>414</b>A and the second lamina support <b>414</b>B can generally be shaped into any substantially structurally compliant form. For example, the first lamina support <b>414</b>A may comprise a straight rectangular portion, a straight rectangular portion and a portion angled outward from the support bridge <b>418</b>, a straight cylindrical portion, or any combination of these or forms. In one non-limiting embodiment, the first lamina support <b>414</b>A and the second lamina support <b>414</b>B may have substantially different lengths than depicted. Alternatively, the first lamina support <b>414</b>A. In one non-limiting embodiment, the spinal implant <b>410</b> may be designed without either of the first lamina support <b>414</b>A and the second lamina support <b>414</b>B. For example, the spinous process plate section <b>416</b> may be configured to attach directly to the first screw shelf <b>420</b>A, second screw shelf <b>420</b>B, and the support bridge <b>418</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally, the spinous process plate section <b>416</b> is depicted having a pentagon-shaped dimension, but it should be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the spinous process plate section <b>416</b> may be comprised in other shapes and forms without departing from the scope of the disclosure. For example, it is contemplated that the spinous process plate section <b>416</b> may have a substantially rounded dimension instead of the pentagonal dimension depicted in the figures. In addition, the spinous process plate section <b>416</b> could be designed to imitate the natural appearance of a person's spinous process.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, a fifth embodiment of a spinal implant <b>510</b> according to a system <b>500</b>, may be positioned along a first vertebral segment <b>504</b> of a spine <b>502</b> between a second vertebral segment <b>506</b> and a third vertebral segment <b>508</b> in the manner indicated, and may generally be mounted to or at least oriented along cut lamina portions <b>507</b>A and <b>507</b>B of the first vertebral segment <b>504</b> in order to occupy dead space resulting from a laminectomy procedure applied to the first vertebral segment <b>504</b>. The spinal implant <b>510</b> may provide various postoperative advantages as described herein.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As further shown, the spinal implant <b>510</b> may be integrated with a spinal fixation construct <b>511</b> comprising one or more pedicle screws, rods, or other spinal fixation hardware that is coupled to the spine <b>502</b>. In the embodiment shown, the spinal fixation construct <b>511</b> may include any cross link system for spinal fixation as would be understood by one skilled in the art.
