id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a child safety zipper and a child safety zipper bag with the same, and more specifically, to a child safety zipper and a child safety zipper bag with the same which enable strong coupling to be fulfilled so as to tightly seal an inside of the plastic bag and can effectively prevent a child from opening the plastic bag.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, plastic bags made of vinyl are used to pack food or the like and are divided into a disposable type of plastic bag which is discarded after being used once and a reusable type of plastic bag which can be resealed. Of the plastic bags, the reusable type of plastic bag is sealed by a zipper structure including external and internal coupling units and has a zipper strip provided on inside surfaces on a mouth side of the plastic bag which is open on one side. Thus, when contents are put into the inside of the plastic bag and pressure is applied thereto, the inside of the plastic bag is sealed. Various types of zipper structures as described above are already proposed and are actively developed in various shapes to increase the sealing force.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, the plastic bag needs to be prevented from being easily opened even when a force is applied from outside depending on contents stored in the plastic bag, and a safety problem arises particularly when the plastic bag contains contents which needs to be kept out of reach of a child or an infant. A zipper with a double- or triple-coupling structure is applied to the plastic bag with consideration for the problem in some cases; however, such zipper can also be easily opened. Consequently, a plastic bag with a separate safety lock device is developed; however, a problem arises in that the plastic bag is inconvenient to use and costs are increased due to the additional safety lock device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this respect, there is a demand for a zipper and a zipper bag which have a structure that enables an inside of a plastic bag to be tightly sealed and can effectively prevent a child from opening the plastic bag.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A technical object of the present invention is to provide a child safety zipper that enables strong coupling to be fulfilled so as to tightly seal an inside of a plastic bag and can effectively prevent a child from opening the plastic bag.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another technical object of the present invention is to provide a child safety zipper bag that enables strong coupling to be fulfilled so as to tightly seal an inside of the plastic bag and can effectively prevent a child from opening the plastic bag.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Technical objects of the present invention are not limited to the technical objects mentioned above, and the following description enables those skilled in the art to clearly understand additional unmentioned technical objects.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the present invention to achieve the technical object, there is provided a child safety zipper including: a first zipper strip having a first band unit that is attached to an inside wall on one side of a plastic bag, a first connection unit that extends from the first band unit, a first base unit that is expanded from the first connection unit and is formed to overlap the first band unit in parallel with each other, a pair of first hook units which projects in parallel with each other from the first base unit, and a first support unit that is separated from the first hook units and projects from the first base unit; and a second zipper strip that is coupled to the first zipper strip to seal the plastic bag, the second zipper strip having a second band unit that is formed in parallel with the first band unit and is attached to an inside wall on the other side of the plastic bag, a second connection unit that extends from the second band unit, a second base unit that is expanded from the second connection unit and is formed to overlap the first base unit in parallel with each other, a pair of second hook units which projects in parallel with each other from the second base unit and is hooked to the pair of first hook units, respectively, and a second support unit that is separated from the second hook units and projects from the second base unit.

Hence, an accident due to opening of the plastic bag <b>2</b> by a child can be prevented in advance.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Hereinafter, the child safety zipper <b>1</b> and working of the child safety zipper <b>1</b> will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> are operation views for illustrating the working of the child safety zipper and the child safety zipper bag.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The child safety zipper <b>1</b> and the child safety zipper bag <b>3</b> according to the present invention have the first zipper strip <b>10</b> and the second zipper strip <b>20</b> which are strongly coupled to each other to tightly seal the inside of the plastic bag <b>2</b>. In addition, since a coupled state is maintained when opening of the plastic bag is attempted by the general method of stretching out and separating the first zipper strip <b>10</b> and the second zipper strip <b>20</b> from each other toward both sides, and the uncoupling is performed by twisting and stretching the plastic bag in the length direction of the zipper strips, it is possible to effectively prevent a child from opening the plastic bag with a simple structure.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view illustrating a state where the plastic bag is held and stretched out toward both sides, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a view illustrating a state where the plastic bag is held and then twisted and stretched in the length direction of the zipper strips.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">First, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when the plastic bag <b>2</b> is held and stretched out toward both side, the coupling of the first hook units <b>14</b> to the second hook units <b>24</b> is maintained.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The first band unit <b>11</b> and the second band unit <b>21</b> are attached to the plastic bag <b>2</b> with distance from the opened top edge of the plastic bag.

In particular, the stretching force is not directly applied to the first hook units <b>14</b> and the second hook units <b>24</b> due to the embayment portions <b>16</b> and <b>26</b> embayed more inward than the inner hook units, and thus the coupling of the first hook units <b>14</b> to the second hook units <b>24</b> can be maintained. In other words, according to the child safety zipper bag <b>3</b> of the present invention, even when a child tries to open the plastic bag <b>2</b> by the usual method of holding and stretching out the plastic bag toward both sides, the coupling of the first hook units <b>14</b> to the second hook units <b>24</b> is maintained such that a safety-related accident due to the opening of the plastic bag <b>2</b> can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Subsequently, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when the plastic bag <b>2</b> is held and then twisted and stretched in the length direction of the zipper strips, the first hook units <b>14</b> and the second hook units <b>24</b> are uncoupled from each other.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As illustrated in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a user can hold the plastic bag <b>2</b> extending more upward from both the first band unit <b>11</b> and the second band unit <b>21</b> so as to twist and stretch the plastic bag in the length direction of the zipper strips. Since the upper ends of the first band unit <b>11</b> and the second band unit <b>21</b> are detached from the inside walls of the plastic bag <b>2</b>, a user can insert a hand both between the first band unit <b>11</b> and the plastic bag <b>2</b> and between the second band unit <b>21</b> and the plastic bag <b>2</b> to come closer to the first zipper strip <b>10</b> and the second zipper strip <b>20</b> and can apply a force to the first hook units <b>14</b> and the second hook units <b>24</b> while holding and twisting the plastic bag <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">When the plastic bag <b>2</b> is held and then twisted and stretched in the length direction of the zipper strips, the inner hook unit of the first hook units <b>14</b> and the inner hook unit of the second hook units <b>24</b> can slide over the slope surfaces abutting on each other in opposite directions from each other, respectively, as illustrated in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.

The inner hook unit of the first hook units <b>14</b> and the inner hook unit of the second hook units <b>24</b> can slide over the slope surfaces in the opposite directions from each other, and thereby the hooks <b>14</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; and <b>24</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; of the outer hook units and the hooks <b>24</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; and <b>14</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; of the inner hook units can be easily uncoupled from each other while the first support unit <b>15</b> and the second support unit <b>25</b> are separated from the first hook units <b>14</b> and the second hook units <b>24</b>, respectively.
