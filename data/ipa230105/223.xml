level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2021-109116, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">One embodiment of the present invention relates to the structure of a jewelry item including a plurality of metal materials and a method for manufacturing a jewelry item including a plurality of metal materials.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Gold (Au) is a precious metal and is widely used in jewelry applications. Gold (Au) usually shines in a gold color, but a gold alloy called colored gold is also used to create unique and original accessories and jewelries in the field of jewelry. There are several types of gold alloys called yellow gold, pink gold, and so on. Among these, a gold-aluminum alloy called purple gold is known (for example, refer to PCT International Publication No. WO2000/046413, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. H11-264036, and PCT International Publication No. WO2010/067422).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since purple gold is hard, non-ductile, and brittle, it is necessary to have a thickness of, for example, 1 mm or more when used in jewelry item. Also, to make jewelry item larger than 100 mm<sup>2</sup>, it needs to be protected with a frame or made thicker. Therefore, jewelry item which has a large shape, or a complicated design has a problem whereby the number of parts increases, the processing time becomes long, and the weight increases.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a result, it was sometimes considered that the jewelry item made of purple gold was heavier, less comfortable, and more expensive than it appears. In order to reduce weight, the design must be simplified, and since the size is limited, the variety of products is limited, and the jewelry item using purple gold is inferior in price competitiveness compared with other color gold jewelry.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A jewelry item in an embodiment according to the present invention includes a thin piece member formed from a gold alloy containing gold (Au) as a first metal element and a second metal element other than gold (Au), a frame member including a third metal element other than the first metal element and the second metal element and a fourth metal element as a metal for an alloy, and forming a bond with and surrounding the peripheral edge of the thin piece member, and a compound layer containing the first metal element, the second metal element, the third metal element, and the fourth metal element interposed between the thin piece member and the frame member.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method for manufacturing a jewelry item in an embodiment according to the present invention, the method includes injecting a molten gold alloy containing gold (Au) as a first metal element and a second metal element other than gold (Au) into a casting mold wherein the casting mold is formed by a frame member containing a third metal element other than the first metal element and the second metal element and a fourth metal element as a metal for an alloy, and a cavity for exposing a side surface of the frame member, cooling the casting mold after the molten gold alloy is injected, and forming a compound layer containing the first metal element, the second metal element, the third metal element, and the fourth metal element between the frame member and the thin piece member formed from the molten gold alloy in the casting mold.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief

The fourth metal element is selected from a metal for forming an alloy with platinum (Pt) which is the third metal element. It is preferable to use platinum containing the fourth metal element rather than pure platinum, when the frame member <b>104</b> is made of platinum.

In addition, it is necessary to carry out careful and detailed work to attach a thin piece member made of a precious metal to the bezel by using a claw, resulting in a long processing time. On the other hand, it is possible to provide a durable jewelry item having high bonding strength by forming the compound layer <b>108</b> when the thin piece member <b>102</b> and the frame member <b>104</b> of different metals are bonded together, as shown in this embodiment. Further, since the thin piece member <b>102</b> is directly bonded to the frame member <b>104</b> via the compound layer <b>108</b>, the conventional frame fitting work is not required, and the processing time can be shortened.

Therefore, it is considered that an alloy of these metals is formed at the measurement points (<b>3</b>) and (<b>4</b>).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0097">The content of gold (Au) is the highest at the measurement point (<b>3</b>), and the content of other metal elements is lower in the order of platinum (Pt), aluminum (Al), and palladium (Pd), as shown in Table 2. On the other hand, the ratio of gold (Au) and platinum (Pt) is almost the same at the measurement point (<b>4</b>), and the ratio of palladium (Pd) is higher, and the ratio of aluminum (Al) is lower than at the measurement point (<b>3</b>). It is understood from this result that the measurement point (<b>4</b>) contains more metal components constituting the frame member <b>104</b> than the measurement point (<b>3</b>).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0098">The measurement point (<b>4</b>) is a portion with the silver-white hue on the back surface side of the sample and is the position overlapping the frame member <b>104</b>. The measurement point (<b>4</b>) is considered to indicate the composition of the first compound layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>exhibiting a gray hue produced along the frame member <b>104</b>, in relation to the regions of different apparent hues shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>. The measurement point (<b>3</b>) is considered to indicate the composition of the second compound layer <b>108</b><i>b </i>exhibiting the gold or yellowish silver color.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0099">As described above, the jewelry item <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment has a compound layer <b>108</b> having a composition different from that of the thin piece member <b>102</b> between the frame member <b>104</b> and the thin piece member <b>102</b>. The compound layer <b>108</b> contains both metal elements constituting the frame member <b>104</b> and metal elements constituting the thin piece member <b>102</b>, and it is considered that an intermetallic compound is formed. The compound layer <b>108</b> is harder than the frame member <b>104</b> and the thin piece member <b>102</b> and has a different hue in appearance. The compound layer <b>108</b> further includes at least two regions having different compositions. The first compound layer <b>108</b><i>a </i>formed on the side of the frame member <b>104</b> has a higher component ratio of metal elements constituting the frame member <b>104</b> than the second compound layer <b>108</b><i>b </i>formed on the side of the thin piece member <b>102</b>, and has a relatively hard Vickers hardness.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">According to the present embodiment, the compound layer <b>108</b>, which is an intermetallic compound, is provided between the frame member <b>104</b> and the thin piece member <b>102</b>, and the compound layer <b>108</b> has a characteristic that it is hard on the frame member <b>104</b> side and its hardness is slightly reduced on the thin piece member <b>102</b> side, thereby providing the rugged and durable jewelry item <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">As described above, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the compound layer having a different hue can be formed between the frame member and the thin piece member by casting and cooling a gold alloy (purple gold) by the injection casting method in order to be bonded to the frame member <b>104</b> made of platinum. The compound layer is much harder in Vickers hardness than platinum and purple gold and can make jewelry item rugged. This configuration makes it possible to make jewelry item with a single unit size of 0.5 mm thick and an area of over 100 mm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, the design and size of the jewelry item using purple gold can be varied, and the price competitiveness of the jewelry item using other materials can be improved.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0102">The jewelry item according to one embodiment of the present invention does not require frame alignment and processing can be shortened by integrating a platinum frame member and a purple gold thin piece member.
