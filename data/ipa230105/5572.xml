Collecting data in a standardized way is a step for reducing disorganized, time-wasting efforts that may negatively impact patient safety, development timelines, and resource utilization. Manual data entry based on paper-and-pen case report forms (CRFs) followed by a chart review is the conventional way of clinical trial data collection. However, with the development of health care information technology, electronic data capture (EDC) systems accelerate the clinical data collection process and assure data quality with real-time data entry, review, analysis, and verification. Driven by the prevalent use of EDC systems, CRFs gradually transitioned from paper to electronic forms. Many studies have suggested that data entry using electronic CRF (eCRF) applications of EDC systems may achieve higher efficiency and accuracy at a lower cost than the conventional paper-and-pen approach. However, neither EDC nor eCRF fundamentally changed the methods of collecting data. Researchers still need to manually transcribe the data one by one from electronic medical records (EMRs), especially for observational trials using patient data. The data entry process takes time and becomes a significant efficiency bottleneck.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The growing interest in observational trials using patient data from electronic medical records (EMRs) poses challenges to both efficiency and quality of clinical data collection and management. Even with the help of electronic data capture systems and electronic case report forms (eCRFs), the manual data entry process followed by a chart review is still time consuming. Guidance published by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2018, titled &#x201c;Use of Electronic Health Record Data in Clinical Investigations Guidance for Industry&#x201d;, promoted the idea of secondary use of source data at the time of care to prepopulate eCRFs without specific user efforts. The guidance focused more on the use of structured data, for example, demographics, vital signs, and laboratory data, but little on the use of unstructured clinical narratives, which account for about 80% of patient care information. To achieve data interoperability for these unstructured clinical narratives, many electronic data capture (EDC) systems created predesigned patient information templates including standardized documentation or forms for coded data entry in lieu of free text documentation to structuralize the medical records. Clinicians record patient information under the guidance of these patient information templates, and at the same time, the EDC systems store the coded data from the patient information templates for future analysis. Patient information templates assist in data collection for research and patient care, integrate EDC systems and EMRs, and automatically prepopulate the eCRF. However, there are obvious limitations to the patient information templates. For clinicians, the one-size-fits-all templates restrict freedom of expression. For researchers, predesigned data elements limit usability of the data in different research topics. The development of natural language processing (NLP) technologies provides new potential for better secondary use of free unstructured EMR data.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Pharmaceuticals are strictly regulated by government agencies, for example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The regulation process involves extensive clinical research and testing to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of new drugs and devices before they can be approved for commercial use. In the pharmaceutical industry, health care data is available in multiple physical formats. The reason for the presence of health care data in multiple physical formats could be attributed to rules such as the regulatory requirements for capturing data in electronic data capture (EDC) systems, study design, different technology vendors, etc. It is challenging to combine and build comprehensive business intelligence from data originating from these disparate systems and formats. Clinical data standards automation improves the accuracy of results in the clinical trial process and discards manual processes, for example, creating forms and annotations by hand or entering data manually onto a spreadsheet. Clinical data standards automation also makes it easier to comply with the standards required by regulatory authorities.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hence, there is a long-felt need for a method and a system for automating clinical data standards and generating study data tabulation model (SDTM) artifacts required for a regulatory submission process using a machine learning model and a natural language processing engine with minimal user intervention.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further disclosed in the detailed description.

As used herein, &#x201c;SDTM&#x201d; refers to a standard structure for human clinical trial or study data tabulations and for non-clinical study data tabulations that are to be submitted as part of a product application to a regulatory authority such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The data used in the SDTM is consistent and minimizes the chance of errors. The data consistency in the SDTM ensures cross-study and cross-organization pooling and improved analysis, which helps reviewers quickly understand the data, leading to fewer questions and a faster approval in order to submit SDTM artifacts to a regulatory board. SDTM defines the standardized domains for submitting clinical data, thereby providing the regulatory authority with a consistent method of viewing the clinical data. The core SDTM model comprises different classes of domains, for example, events, interventions, and findings. Each domain comprises a number of possible variables. The actual domains and variables required to represent the non-clinical data is different compared to the clinical data. The Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) recommends the Standard for Exchange of Non-clinical Data (SEND) for the non-clinical data. The SEND defines standard domains and variables to be used when submitting non-clinical data to the regulatory board.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The method disclosed herein employs a clinical data standards (CDS) automated system comprising at least one processor configured to execute computer program instructions for automating clinical data standards and generating study data tabulation model (SDTM) artifacts required for a regulatory submission process, using a machine learning model and a natural language processing engine with minimal user intervention. The CDS automated system is a metadata-driven artificial intelligence system configured to automate the clinical data standards and submission process. The CDS automated system generates reliable and precise results that provide a substantial benefit to pharmaceutical industries, biotech industries, the Contract Research Organization (CRO), etc. The CDS automated system is a metadata multi-level management system. The multi-level management system comprises a global level and a project level. The CDS automated system generates SDTM artifacts required for a regulatory submission process with minimal user input, for example, study data and a blank Case Report Form (CRF). As used herein, &#x201c;CRF&#x201d; refers to a paper or electronic questionnaire specifically used in clinical trial research. CRFs contain data obtained during a patient's participation in a clinical trial. A sponsor of the clinical trial develops the CRF to collect specific data they need in order to test their hypotheses or answer their research questions. The size of the CRF ranges from a handwritten one-time snapshot of a patient's physical condition to hundreds of pages of electronically captured data obtained over a period of weeks or months. The metadata driven machine learning and natural language processing engine assists the CDS automated system to learn study-based information with minimal user intervention, improves annotation results, and maps continuously on every subsequent study.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the method disclosed herein, the clinical data standards (CDS) automated system extracts <b>101</b> metadata from multiple raw datasets automatically using natural language processing and feeds the extracted metadata into the machine learning model. As used herein, metadata is data which describes information about any raw data that is being entered into the CDS automated system using natural language processing methods. In an embodiment, the CDS automated system converts raw metadata into standardized, Standard for Exchange of Non-clinical Data (SEND) data similar to conversion of raw data into study data tabulation model (SDTM) datasets. The natural language processing (NLP) engine preprocesses text information before feeding the processed text information into the machine learning model. The NLP engine extracts the required intend, for example, sentences, from a questionnaire available in several case report forms (CRFs), for example, pages, as part of preprocessing of the text information performed in the CDS automated system. The questionnaire comprises sentences received from a user. The NLP engine uses the extracted text for the preprocessing steps performed in the CDS automated system. In this example, the input to the NLP engine is the preprocessed text and the output is the intends from the NLP engine. The CDS automated system predicts the intend of the questionnaires in the CRF.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The clinical data standards (CDS) automated system predicts <b>102</b> one or more automatic case report form (CRF) annotations on the extracted metadata using the machine learning model and records new leanings in the CDS automated system with minimal user intervention. The machine learning model predicts appropriate CRF annotations based on annotated metadata information available in the CDS automated system and information acquired from previous learnings. The previous leanings are learnings recorded by the CDS automated system based on the annotated metadata information acquired from a user for the first time. In an embodiment, any questionnaire that is unknown to the CDS automated system is annotated by a user for the first time. The CDS automated system records the leanings from the questionnaire in the background and applies the learnings in subsequent studies. The CDS automated system significantly reduces manual intervention based on the continuous learning and reuse capabilities of the CDS automated system. The extracted metadata is pre-filled in a blank CRF. The CDS automated system extracts and preprocesses the contents of the CRF automatically using natural language processing methods prior to importing the contents into the machine learning model. The CDS automated system utilizes the preprocessed metadata in the machine learning (ML) model to predict appropriate CRF annotations. The machine learning model predicts appropriate CRF annotations based on the annotated metadata information available in the CDS automated system and the information acquired from the previous learnings.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, the clinical data standards (CDS) automated system extracts metadata, for example, text information, and attributes from a blank case report form (CRF). The blank CRF is, for example, in a Portable Document Format (PDF). The CDS automated system stores the extracted metadata in a structured machine-readable format. The CDS automated system performs preprocessing steps on the extracted text and the attributes. After preprocessing performed by the CDS automated system, the machine learning (ML) model predicts appropriate CRF annotations for the extracted text and the attributes. The ML model sends the predicted CRF annotations and their corresponding text and the attributes to an application in the CDS automated system. The application in the CDS automated system inserts the appropriate CRF annotations based on the ML prediction at the right location in the blank CRF. The CDS automated system allows a user to annotate the extracted text and the attributes manually in case of any inappropriate or missing annotation performed by the CDS automated system. The ML model learns from the manual interventions on the annotation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment, the clinical data standards (CDS) automated system sorts, organizes, and uses the collected information, that is, the metadata extracted from the raw datasets as a raw dataset that in turn improves the raw to target mapping process. The CDS automated system maps <b>103</b> one or more of the raw datasets against a target study data tabulation model (SDTM) variable based on the extracted metadata available in the CDS automated system and the information acquired from the previous leanings. The metadata extracted from the raw datasets comprises the information collected from the user. The CDS automated system uses the raw dataset to map the appropriate target SDTM variable. The CDS automated system improves the mapping accuracy by utilizing the annotation information received from the annotated case report form (CRF) or an electronic CRF (eCRF) configured by the CDS automated system. In an embodiment, the CDS automated system automatically matches the raw dataset against the target SDTM variables based on the annotated metadata information available in the CDS automated system as well as from a knowledge base.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The clinical data standards (CDS) automated system generates <b>104</b> a study data tabulation model (SDTM) statistical analysis system (SAS) code based on the mapping. The CDS automated system also generates <b>105</b> a define package based on the annotated metadata information and the mappings available in the CDS automated system. In an embodiment, the CDS automated system extracts the metadata automatically based on the SDTM SAS code specification. The CDS automated system generates an SDTM SAS code based on the mapping predictions and derivations. The machine learning model is used to identify an appropriate derivation from a derivation repository. In an embodiment, the CDS automated system extracts the metadata from the raw dataset. In another embodiment, the raw metadata is directly imported into the CDS automated system. The CDS automated system performs preprocessing steps on the extracted metadata. The machine learning model identifies and maps the corresponding target variables based on the raw metadata information acquired by the CDS automated system from the previous step. In an embodiment, the CDS automated system allows a user to perform manual mapping for the unmapped raw metadata information and inappropriate mapping combinations generated by the CDS automated system. The CDS automated system learns from the manual intervention and applies the new learnings in subsequent studies.
