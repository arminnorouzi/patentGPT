The invention also relates to a process for preparing such a solid cosmetic composition and to a method for making up the skin or lips which makes use of it.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The formulations conventionally used for solid compositions are generally loose or compact powders. By way of illustration and without limitation to the solid formulations more particularly considered in the field of cosmetics, we can cite in particular powders for the complexion, blushes, or eye shadows.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The aforementioned powders primarily have the function of adding color, eliminating shine, or providing coverage. In general, powders combine a largely predominant pulverulent phase with an at least partly liquid fatty phase constituting the binder and making it possible, in the context of compact powders, to ensure good cohesion of the pulverulent phase.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A pulverulent phase is formed essentially of fillers and coloring agents, their amounts being modulated to provide the desired makeup effect: color, coverage, or shine elimination. When the percentage of pulverulent phase in the product becomes too high, its manufacture and its compaction become complicated or even impossible to carry out at an industrial scale given the quality and productivity requirements. In addition, such solid compositions with a high content of pulverulent phase can have the disadvantage of being uncomfortable, too dry, and too powdery, and for some, of being fragile, brittle, and with poor impact resistance. Lastly, large amounts of pulverulent phase in the compact powder do not provide satisfactory sensory properties, making them difficult to pick up when collecting the powder from its packaging (&#x201c;pick-up&#x201d;) and/or to spread when applied to the surface of the skin to be made up (&#x201c;pay-off&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To obtain a composition in solid form, it is known to implement a compaction process (&#x201c;dry process&#x201d;) consisting of mixing the pulverulent phase and the fatty phase and compacting the resulting composition under high pressure in a case. Alternatively, a process referred to as a &#x201c;wet process&#x201d; (or &#x201c;slurry&#x201d;) can be implemented to produce such compositions. In this type of process, the pulverulent phase and the fatty phase of said composition are exposed to a volatile solvent so as to form a suspension, which is then pressed and the volatile solvent eliminated.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regardless of the process considered, the amount of fatty phase, and in particular of oils, generally does not exceed 10% of the composition so as to obtain good compaction of the powder via mechanical means, and also to avoid any overflow of the composition from the case. For these reasons, these formulations often require the formulators to reduce the amount of fatty phase, and in particular of oil(s), so as to ensure proper compaction of the powder.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the amount of fatty binder is increased, shaping the solid composition by compaction therefore becomes complicated, if not impossible. In response to this industrial constraint, more pasty solid products, for example obtained by extrusion, have been proposed. However, in the presence of too high of a content of binder phase, the composition has a tendency to wax, meaning to harden during use, and become too dense to the point of preventing the collection of product and altering its spreading properties when applied.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The search continues for solid cosmetic compositions exhibiting good cohesion and good impact resistance, which in particular can be stored and transported freely by the user without crumbling or cracking, its texture allowing easy pick-up and application.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The Applicant has unexpectedly discovered that a composition exhibiting such properties, which in principle seem incompatible, could be obtained by using, in a solid composition, a specific content of a particular liquid fatty phase, and a pulverulent phase at least partly surface-treated with a metallic soap.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The object of the invention is thus, according to a first aspect, a solid cosmetic composition comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">12 to 50% by weight of a non-volatile liquid fatty phase, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">40 to 85% by weight of a pulverulent phase comprising spherical fillers surface-treated with a metallic soap,<br/>the percentages being expressed by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">In particular, the invention relates to a solid cosmetic composition comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0014">12 to 50% by weight of a pulverulent phase comprising spherical fillers surface-treated with a metallic soap and further comprising a lamellar filler surface-treated with a metallic soap,<br/>the percentages being expressed by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">In particular, the invention relates to a solid cosmetic composition comprising:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0016">13 to 35% by weight of non-volatile liquid fatty phase, and</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0017">50% to 80% by weight, preferably 60 to 75% by weight, of a pulverulent phase comprising spherical and/or lamellar fillers surface-treated with a metallic soap, the percentages being expressed by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">Another object of the invention, according to a second aspect, is a process for preparing such a composition, comprising:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0019">premixing the powders constituting the pulverulent phase</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0020">preparing a fatty binder comprising the non-volatile liquid fatty phase</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0021">mashing the powders in with the fatty binder by extrusion, and</li>        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0022">shaping the composition by pressing.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0023">Another object of the invention, according to a third aspect, is a method for making up the skin or lips, consisting of applying such a solid cosmetic composition to the skin or lips.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0024">Formulation</p><p id="p-0017" num="0025">The composition according to the invention is solid, in the sense that it does not flow under its own weight.

The texture analyzer is equipped with a Stable Micro System cylinder probe ref P/2 2 mm in diameter made of stainless steel moving at the measurement speed of 1 mm/s and penetrating the composition to a depth of 3 mm with a force of 3 mm. The hardness value is the measured compressive force divided by the surface area of the texture analyzer's cylinder probe in contact with the composition. The measurement is made in 15 ml perfume jars 40 mm in height and 38 mm in diameter, filled up to the neck with the composition at room temperature, i.e. to 20 mm in height.
