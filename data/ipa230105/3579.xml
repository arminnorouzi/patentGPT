id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an identification apparatus that identifies the properties of a specimen.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An identification apparatus is known that optically identifies the properties of a specimen using a spectroscopic analysis. Such an identification apparatus is placed in the middle of a conveying path on which a specimen is conveyed, and thereby is used to inspect a product or separate waste.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The spectroscopic analysis does not necessarily require a vacuum depressurization process that limits throughput, an atmosphere control process, a liquid immersion process, and an atmosphere management process related to a drying process, and can identify the properties of a specimen under the atmosphere. In this respect, in recent years, an attempt is made to apply the spectroscopic analysis to the separation of waste resin.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the spectroscopic analysis, absorption spectroscopy that acquires the absorption spectrum of a specimen with respect to incident light and scattering spectroscopy that acquires the scattering spectrum of a specimen with respect to incident light are known. The scattering spectroscopy does not use transmitted light, and therefore is less likely to be influenced by light attenuation. Thus, the scattering spectroscopy is used to identify waste in which specimens vary in size and transmittance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The properties of a specimen to be identified include characteristic information including the material and the physical property, and form information including the size, the shape, and the orientation. To identify the specimen with high throughput including screening, the properties included in both the characteristic information and the form information may be acquired in association with each other.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An identification apparatus is known that, to acquire the shape of a specimen, combines a camera that captures an image of the specimen and a spectral identification unit, thereby identifying the material and the size of the specimen. Patent literature 1 discusses a waste selection apparatus including a spectral unit that collects light in a predetermined region on a conveyor belt on which a plurality of specimens is placed, thereby acquiring spectral information, and a video camera that captures a predetermined region downstream of the light collection region of the spectral unit in a conveying direction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A sorting apparatus is known that references a predetermined target condition and sorts an identified specimen based on whether the properties of the specimen satisfy the predetermined target condition. Patent literature 2 discusses a waste bottle sorting apparatus including a conveying unit that conveys waste bottles placed in a line in a conveying direction, a camera that captures an image of the conveyed waste bottles, an image processing device that estimates the barycentric positions of the waste bottles, and a valve driving device that blows compressed air to the waste bottles. The sorting apparatus discussed in patent literature 2 identifies the types and the centers of gravity of the waste bottles based on the colors and the sizes of the waste bottles acquired from the camera image, discharges compressed air toward the centers of gravity of the waste bottles, and sorts out the waste bottles.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">PTL 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-540397</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">PTL 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H11-197609</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the sorting apparatus according to patent literature 2, depending on the size of an identified specimen, it is necessary to adjust the estimated values of the mass of the specimen and the time when the center of gravity of the specimen passes through a screening operation region. In the sorting apparatus according to patent literature 2, however, even if a specimen is strictly identified, and the mass and the time of passage of the specimen are estimated, and the specimen is sorted out based on the estimated mass and time of passage of the specimen, the specimen may not necessarily be able to be accurately sorted. It is confirmed that in such erroneous screening, in a case where a specimen is sorted out by discharging compressed air, and if the size or the specific gravity of the specimen is small, the accuracy of the screening may decrease.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is directed to providing an identification apparatus capable of generating a control signal that enables accurate selection based on the properties of a specimen including form information.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an aspect of the
