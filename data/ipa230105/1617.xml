Each of the reinforcement fibers <b>44</b> may include a plasticizer such as methylacrylate or vinyl acetate. In one embodiment, each reinforcement fiber <b>44</b> includes 90 mole % PAN and 10 mole % methylacrylate. Each reinforcement fiber <b>44</b> may include between 90-96 mole % PAN and between 4-10 mole % plasticizer. The resin matrix <b>46</b> may include a thermoset resin such as an epoxy resin, polyester resin, or a vinyl ester resin.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Each of the reinforcement fibers <b>44</b> has a dog-bone cross-sectional shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The dog-bone cross-sectional shape has two opposing, rounded ends having a first width and a central portion linking the two ends and having a second width less than the first width. In other embodiments, the reinforcement fibers <b>44</b> may have other suitable cross-sectional shapes such as round, oblong, etc.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the dog-bone cross sectional shape has a roundness value of less than or equal to 0.7. Roundness may be calculated using the following roundness formula: Roundness=4&#x3c0;S/L<sup>2</sup>, where S=cross sectional area and L=circumferential length.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one example, the roundness of each filament is calculated by approximating the cross section to a rectangle. Using a rectangle that is 4 microns wide multiplied by 10 microns long (about one filament <b>44</b> cross-sectional size) the roundness=0.64. However, the dog bone shape is not exactly a rectangle so the cross sectional area would be less than the rectangle and the circumference would be longer than the rectangle. Therefore, the exact roundness of a dog bone that would fit inside a 4&#xd7;10 rectangle would be less than 0.64, in one example.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each reinforcement fiber <b>44</b> is formed during a carbon-fiber forming process <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. The carbon-fiber forming process <b>100</b> includes a step <b>110</b> of providing precursor material <b>112</b> and extruding the precursor material to form filament strands <b>114</b>. The precursor material <b>112</b> may include the PAN and plasticizer described above.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The filament strands <b>114</b> are then dry spun in a dry spinning operation <b>116</b> at a step <b>120</b>. Dry-spinning the filament strands <b>114</b> causes the filament strands <b>114</b> to have a dog-bone shaped cross-section. In the illustrative embodiment, the filament strands <b>114</b> have no initiator added to them following step <b>120</b> of dry-spinning. The filaments <b>114</b> are approximately 3.4 deniers per filament after the step <b>120</b> of spinning.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The process <b>100</b> continues with a first stage stretching step <b>130</b>. The plurality of filaments <b>114</b> may be stretched by a plurality of rollers <b>132</b> during the step <b>130</b> of stretching. In the illustrative embodiment, the filaments <b>114</b> are stretched about 4&#xd7; to 5&#xd7; their length prior to the step <b>120</b> of spinning. In some embodiments, the step <b>130</b> of stretching occurs during the step <b>120</b> of spinning. The process <b>100</b> continues with an optional step <b>134</b> of spooling the stretched filaments into a spool or bobbin <b>136</b> for storage prior to further processing.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The process <b>100</b> further includes a step <b>140</b> of stabilizing the filaments <b>114</b>. During the step of stabilizing, the filaments <b>114</b> pass through heaters <b>142</b> and are heated at a first temperature <b>148</b>. The first temperature <b>148</b> may be any value within a range of about 200 degrees Celsius to about 300 degrees Celsius. The filaments <b>114</b> also undergo second stage stretching <b>144</b> during and/or after the step <b>140</b> of stabilizing. This is possible because no initiator is present on the filaments <b>114</b>. During the second stage stretching step <b>144</b> the filaments <b>114</b> may passed around rollers <b>146</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The process <b>100</b> further include a step <b>150</b> of carbonizing the filaments <b>114</b>. During the step <b>150</b> of carbonizing, the filaments pass through one or more heaters <b>152</b> and are heated to a second temperature <b>154</b> higher than the first temperature. The second temperature <b>154</b> may be any value within a range of about 1200 degrees Celsius to about 2000 degrees Celsius. Following the step <b>150</b> of carbonizing the plurality of reinforcement fibers <b>44</b> are formed and are ready to be mixed with resin matrix <b>46</b> to form a carbon fiber.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The process <b>100</b> may further include one or more post-forming processes at step <b>160</b> such as graphitization, spooling <b>162</b>, surface treating, weaving, molding into a particular carbon-fiber component, or any other suitable post-forming process. Resin matrix <b>46</b> may also be added to the reinforcement fibers <b>44</b> during the post-forming step <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the process may include three manufacturing operations or steps. The first step is the acrylic fiber spinning operation. Carbon fiber precursor or specialty acrylic fiber (SAF) spinning is different from textile acrylic fiber (TAF) spinning. Dog bone (DB) shaped polyacrylonitrile (PAN) filaments may be dry spun. Dry spinning may be a more efficient, cost effective and environmentally friendly spinning operation compared to wet spinning that produces round fibers. Some DB-TAF is wet spun and all carbon fiber precursor is wet spun, usually with an air gap of no more than 6 mm. In some embodiments using wet spinning PAN technology or methods, the filament cross section shape for commercial carbon fiber is round. The inventors unexpectedly found that they were able to produce high performance carbon fiber using DB-TAF as the precursor rather than SAF using process <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the second operation is the stabilization of the precursor, also commonly called oxidation. The precursor fiber mass load is maintained at an optimal oxygen diffusion rate and production efficiency level. The third operation is carbonization. In current carbon fiber line designs, the stabilization operation occurs sequentially prior to the carbonization operation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the cost metrics of SAF compared to DB-TAF may be unfavorable due to the comparatively low volume production in SAF spinning operations. In some embodiments, the spinning of DB-TAF has much higher productivity through advanced manufacturing technology and efficiency advantages over SAF. The present disclosure produces high performance carbon fiber from DB-TAF precursor using the proper post spinning process and conversion steps including one or more post-spinning stretching steps and one or more pre-heating steps before, during, or after the stretching steps.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the shape of the cross section is dog bone that is approximately 2.5&#xd7; longer than it is wide. The deci-tex (dtex) (i.e. grams per 10,000 meters of yarn) of each carbon fiber filament is approximately 1.0 but can be more or less depending on the starting dtex of the precursor. The dog bone shape allows a higher, more efficient starting dtex or denier filament than round filaments. In one example, the dog bone shaped filaments have up to 3.6 dtex due to the improved oxygen diffusion through the narrow dimension compared to round filaments that have a larger radius and less oxygen diffusion. For example, a round carbon fiber precursor filament may be 18 microns. In this example, the oxygen must penetrate or diffuse to the center of the circle with a radius of 9 microns. In the case of the dog-bone shaped filament of equivalent cross sectional area, the oxygen must only penetrate through the narrow dimension of approximately 4 microns making diffusion faster and more uniform.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the polyacrylonitrile precursor filaments may include between 90-96 mole % acrylonitrile with a comonomer of methylacrylate as a plasticizer. In some embodiments, there is no need for an initiator. The filaments are approximately 3.4 deniers per filament after spinning. The precursor fiber may be manufactured using a preferred textile acrylic fiber dry-spinning process that produces dog-bone shaped cross-section filaments. The precursor fiber mass load is maintained at an optimal oxygen diffusion rate and production efficiency level. The stabilization fiber loading is maintained at less than 140,000 deniers per inch width throughout the stabilization process by processing the fiber in multiple levels at low temperatures through the initial zones of thermal processing at a temperature that is lower than both the stabilization step and the carbonization step. This level of loading at the prescribed temperatures without an initiator present avoids fiber fusing as well as creating a skin beginning at the surface of the filaments that slows diffusion of oxygen into the filaments in the earliest stage of stabilization. This thorough diffusion provides higher performance carbon fiber.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, there may be some differences between how SAF is prepared in the spinning operation versus how DB-TAF is prepared. The DB-TAF PAN fibers may contain between 1% and 10% comonomer. DB-TAF may have vinyl acetate or methyl acrylate as its co-monomer. The source of PAN may be petroleum based, rapeseed oil based, or other biomass based.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the degree of orientation of carbon in the PAN molecular chain is difference between SAF and DB-TAF filaments due to the difference processes used to form each. SAF filaments may have a high stretch ratio provided by the SAF wet-spinning process. In one example, SAF filaments are stretched over 14&#xd7; in the wet-spinning operation. By contrast, the DB-TAF filaments are stretched only about 4 times to 5 times in the dry-spinning operation. Thus, a post spinning stretch step may be included in the process. In some embodiments, the filaments are re-stretched up to an additional 4 times in the post-spinning stretching step. In some embodiments, the filaments are stretched an additional amount within a range of about 1.1 times to about 3 times during the post-spinning stretching step. The post-spinning stretching step is performed at a temperature within a range of about 100 degrees Celsius to about 200 degrees Celsius. The post-spinning stretching step may also be used to properly orient the molecular chain for optimal mechanical performance.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, SAF filaments are produced using an initiator added to the PAN polymer. The initiator may be added to SAF filaments to reduce the onset temperature of cyclization and crosslinking in order to oxidize the fiber faster in the conventional conversion process. The onset temperature reduction caused by the initiator in SAF means that the SAF fiber polymer will start to crosslink at about 210 degrees Celsius before it reaches a high enough temperature to allow the fiber to become easily stretchable. The crosslinking begins on the surface of the filament where a skin is created around the filament by the initiator. This skin inhibits the rate of oxygen diffusion into the filament, slowing the oxidation process. In such a process, thermal management may need to be tightly controlled to block developing such a thin outer skin that the oxygen can't diffuse through it. Stretching the fiber in oxidation after crosslinking begins may damage the crosslinked bonds, cause fiber breakage, and reduce the mechanical performance of the resultant carbon fiber. SAF used in conventional carbon fiber conversion cannot be significantly stretched following the spinning step in stabilization, for example. In the illustrative embodiment, DB-TAF filaments are used and no initiator is applied so that post-spinning stretching is possible without damaging the filaments.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, two objectives in stabilization may be oxygen diffusion and cyclization. As mentioned earlier, with SAF, oxygen diffusion rate is slowed by the skin that develops on the surface of the filament due to early crosslinking. This is mitigated by the increased rate of cyclization caused by the initiator to help increase the line speed. Crosslinking may take place with cyclization and is optimally performed in later stages of stabilization after significant oxygen diffusion has taken place. It requires close thermal and fiber management of the precursor in order to diffuse the fiber with oxygen thoroughly before significant crosslinking takes place.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
