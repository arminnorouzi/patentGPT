However, it is necessary to form a closed loop with such a coil and to connect the superconducting wires in order to carry the permanent current.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a method of connecting superconducting wires, for example, Patent Document 1 proposes a technique using a MOD method (coating pyrolysis method: Metal Organic Deposition method). The connection of the superconducting wires by this MOD method joins by removing each protective layer of connection ends of the two superconducting wires, applying an MOD solution containing metal constituting the oxide superconducting layer on the surface of the exposed oxide superconducting layer by the spin coating method or the spray coating method to form the MOD coating film and allowing to dry, followed by heating to the crystallization temperature of the oxide superconducting layer, while pressurizing and contacting the above-mentioned MOD films of these two superconducting wires. As the above-mentioned MOD solution, for example, an acetyl acetonate-based MOD solution in which RE (rare-earth element such as Y (yttrium), Gd (gadolinium), Sm (samarium) and Ho (holmium)), Ba (barium) and Cu (copper) are contained in a proportion of about 1:2:3 can be used.
