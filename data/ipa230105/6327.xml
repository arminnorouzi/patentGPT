In the directional coupler, a main line is provided between an input terminal and an output terminal, a sub line is provided between a coupling terminal and a termination terminal, and the main line and the sub line are electromagnetically coupled to each other. In the directional coupler disclosed in Patent Document 1, when a signal is input to the input terminal, a coupling signal having a certain ratio of power to the power of the signal is output from the coupling terminal.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the directional coupler disclosed in Patent Document 1, there is an issue of an increase in the degree of coupling between the main line and the sub line with increasing frequency of a signal input from the input terminal. In other words, in the directional coupler disclosed in Patent Document 1, an amplitude characteristic (coupling characteristic) of the coupling signal is not flat.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A directional coupler that mitigates this issue is disclosed in Patent Document 2 (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2013-5076). In the directional coupler disclosed in Patent Document 2, a sub line is divided into a first sub line and a second sub line, and a low pass filter is connected, as a phase conversion unit, between the first sub line and the second sub line. In the directional coupler disclosed in Patent Document 2, the low pass filter is designed to cause a phase shift to be produced in a signal passing therethrough in such a manner that the absolute value of the phase shift monotonically increases within a range from 0 to 180 degrees inclusive as a frequency increases in a frequency band that is used.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, in the directional coupler disclosed in Patent Document 2, a coupling characteristic is flat to some degree.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 8-237012</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Document 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2013-5076</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the directional coupler disclosed in Patent Document 2, the phase conversion unit (low pass filter) has a frequency characteristic, and thus the coupling characteristic is not completely flat but is undulating.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For this reason, in the directional coupler disclosed in Patent Document 2, when the frequency band that is used is relatively narrow, a good coupling characteristic is exhibited. However, when the frequency band that is used is wide, there is an issue of an increase in the amplitude of an undulation, causing an error to occur in a coupling signal output from a coupling terminal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, the present disclosure provides a directional coupler in which a coupling characteristic is flat.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To solve the above-described existing issue, a non-reciprocal circuit device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes an input terminal, an output terminal, a coupling terminal, a termination terminal, a ground terminal, a main line connected between the input terminal and the output terminal, and a sub line connected between the coupling terminal and the termination terminal. The main line and the sub line are electromagnetically coupled to each other. The sub line includes at least a first sub line and at least a second sub line that are connected to each other. A phase conversion unit is connected between the first sub line and the second sub line. Between a point between the coupling terminal and the termination terminal, and the ground terminal, a resonant circuit is connected in which an inductor, a capacitor, and a resistor are connected in series. Incidentally, in the resonant circuit, as the order in which the inductor, the capacitor, and the resistor are connected, any order can be selected.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Since, in the directional coupler according to the present disclosure, the resonant circuit is provided in which the inductor, the capacitor, and the resistor are connected in series, the coupling characteristic is flat.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of a directional coupler according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the directional coupler according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the directional coupler according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> include graphs illustrating a coupling characteristic of the directional coupler according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure and that of a comparative example.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> includes a graph illustrating a phase characteristic of a sub line of the directional coupler according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> includes a graph illustrating a bandpass characteristic of a sub line of the directional coupler according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> includes a graph illustrating a phase characteristic of a subline of the comparative example, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref> includes a graph illustrating a bandpass characteristic of a sub line of the comparative example.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of a directional coupler according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of a directional coupler according to a third embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of a directional coupler according to a fourth embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a directional coupler according to a fifth embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments for implementing the present disclosure will be described below with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The embodiments for implementing the present disclosure are exemplified by the following embodiments, and the present disclosure is not limited to details of the embodiments.

Furthermore, the low pass filter can be a &#x3c0;-type filter. In this case, a good phase shift can be caused to be produced in a signal passing through the sub line.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Furthermore, the resonant circuit can be connected between a connection point between the first sub line and the phase conversion unit, and the ground terminal. Alternatively, the resonant circuit can be connected between a connection point between the coupling terminal and the first sub line, and the ground terminal. Alternatively, the resonant circuit can be connected between a connection point between the phase conversion unit and the second sub line, and the ground terminal. Alternatively, the resonant circuit can be connected between a connection point between the second sub line and the termination terminal, and the ground terminal.

In this case, the directional coupler according to the present disclosure can be readily constructed.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Furthermore, the input terminal, the output terminal, the coupling terminal, the termination terminal, and the ground terminal can be provided on one surface of the multilayer body, a coupler section including the main line and the sub line can be mostly disposed in a one-side portion in a lamination direction of the multilayer body, and the phase conversion unit and the resonant circuit can be mostly disposed in an other-side portion in the lamination direction of the multilayer body. In this case, electronic components can be efficiently disposed within the multilayer body. Furthermore, in this case, the ground electrode can be provided in an interlayer space of the multilayer body, which is a space between the one-side portion in the lamination direction of the multilayer body and the other-side portion in the lamination direction of the multilayer body. In this case, interference between the coupler section, and the phase conversion unit and the resonant circuit can be suppressed by the ground electrode.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Alternatively, the input terminal, the output terminal, the coupling terminal, the termination terminal, and the ground terminal can be provided on one surface of the multilayer body, and a coupler section including the main line and the sub line can be disposed laterally next to the phase conversion unit and the resonant circuit in the multilayer body.
