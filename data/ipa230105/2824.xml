For this reason, RNA molecules are excellent therapeutic targets. In this context, nearly all RNAs form hairpin secondary structures that are crucial for their function. Consequently, an understanding of these structures is necessary to facilitate the identification and design of therapeutic agents targeting these molecules. However, conventional methods of examining RNAs, such as RNA interference and antisense oligonucleotides, are limited and avoid strong structures.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While conventional technologies can provide some information on RNA structures, the limitations in these technologies make RNA hairpin loops underappreciated targets for therapeutic inhibitor designs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a strong need in this field of technology for new methods and materials useful for obtaining information on the three-dimensional structures of RNA hairpin loops.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As described in detail below, we have developed novel scaffold-directed crystallography methods that are useful for obtaining information on the three-dimensional structures of RNA hairpin loops. The RNA crystallization scaffold and associated methods that are disclosed herein can be used to determine three dimensional structures of RNA hairpin loops as well their associations with other agents (e.g. inhibitory agents) easily and quickly. The specific scaffold RNA used in the methods of the invention is the YdaO-type c-di-AMP riboswitch from <i>Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus</i>, an RNA that was discovered to readily form crystals with a large cavity over 60 &#x212b; in diameter. As discussed in detail below, we have determined that an RNA of interest can be engineered into the P2 stem of this scaffold RNA so that the hairpin is accommodated in the cavity. The resultant fusion RNA can then be then crystallized, under conditions either similar to or unrelated to that for crystallizing the scaffold alone. The three-dimensional structures of such molecules (e.g. these molecules alone and/or associated with other agents) can then be determined using X-ray or electron crystallography techniques or the like.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The RNA crystallization scaffold and associated methods disclosed herein can be used to identify compounds such as natural and chemically modified oligonucleotides, and small-molecule drugs, that interact with target RNA molecules with high affinity and specificity. This is significant because the interactions between such compounds and RNA hairpin loops can affect biological activities of these molecules in a manner that can modulate their activity in vivo in pathologies such as cancers and RNA viral infections. In addition, because RNAs are involved in nearly every aspect of biology and disease, the methods disclosed herein are widely applicable procedures that can provide information on how to specifically regulate almost any target RNAs. Consequently, the methods disclosed herein allow the observation and assessment of agents such as oligonucleotide analogs that target specific RNAs, including those that function in a wide variety of biological processes such as processes involved in viral replication (e.g. the replication of pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, Hepatitis C and Zika), processes involved in pathological conditions such as cancer or neurodegenerative diseases, as well as processes involved in the production of microRNAs for regulating protein-coding genes etc.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention disclosed herein has a number of embodiments. One embodiment of the invention is a composition of matter comprising a ribonucleic acid having an at least 90% sequence identity to: GGUUGCCGAAUCCGAAAGGUACGGAGGAACCGCUUUUUGGGGUUAAUC UGCAGUGAAGCUGCAGUAGGGAUACCUUCUGUCCCGCACCCGACAGCUA ACUCCGGAGGCAAUAAAGGAAGGAG (SEQ ID NO: 1). Typically, the polynucleotide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In this composition, residues 14-17 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (GAAA) of the ribonucleic are replaced with a heterologous segment of nucleic acids that is between 4 and 33 nucleotides in length (the at least 90% sequence identity noted above does not include the heterologous segments of nucleic acids that can be inserted in to this ribonucleic acid at residues 14-17). In these compositions, the heterologous segment of nucleic acids is typically one that forms a loop structure in a naturally occurring RNA molecule. In certain embodiments of the invention, the heterologous segment of nucleic acids includes a complete loop structure, and optionally between 0-5 base pairs of a stem structure in the naturally occurring RNA molecule. Optionally these compositions can further comprise an agent that binds to the ribonucleic acid, for example a polynucleotide that hybridizes to the ribonucleic acid.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another embodiment of the invention is a system or kit for observing RNA structures comprising a plasmid comprising a DNA sequence encoding a ribonucleic acid having an at least 90% (and optionally less than 100%) identity to: GGUUGCCGAAUCCGAAAGGUACGGAGGAACCGCUUUUUGGGGUUAAUC UGCAGUGAAGCUGCAGUAGGGAUACCUUCUGUCCCGCACCCGACAGCUA ACUCCGGAGGCAAUAAAGGAAGGAG (SEQ ID NO: 1). In certain embodiments, the plasmid further comprises a promoter for expressing or transcribing the ribonucleic acid, and/or the system or kit further comprises an RNA polymerase. Optionally the system or kit further comprises one or more primers that hybridize to a stretch of nucleic acids in the plasmid.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another embodiment of the invention is a method of obtaining information on a structure of a ribonucleic acid. This method comprises substituting residues 14-17 (GAAA) of SEQ ID NO: 1 (or a ribonucleic acid having an at least 90% to SEQ ID NO: 1) with a heterologous segment of nucleic acids that is between 4 and 33 nucleotides in length to so as to form a fusion ribonucleic acid molecule, crystallizing the fusion RNA, performing an X-ray or electron crystallographic technique on the fusion ribonucleic acid molecule, and then observing the results (e.g. electron density maps of a X-ray or electron crystallographic technique) to obtain information on the three-dimensional structure of the heterologous segment of nucleic acids. In certain embodiments of these methods, the fusion ribonucleic acid molecule is combined with an agent that binds to the ribonucleic acid prior to the crystallographic analysis (e.g. a polynucleotide that hybridizes to the ribonucleic acid) so that the structure of the RNA/agent complex can be observed. Typically in these methods, the crystallographic analysis includes a comparison to a control sample lacking the agent that binds to the ribonucleic acid. Optionally in these methods, a plurality of fusion ribonucleic acid molecules are combined with a plurality of agents that bind to the ribonucleic acid (e.g. in high throughput screening) prior to the X-ray or electron crystallographic technique. In some embodiments of the invention, at least two agents are combined with the fusion ribonucleic acid molecules.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In illustrative working embodiments of the invention, we examined nine structures of pri-miRNA hairpin loops. These studies determined that loops 4-8 nucleotides in length are more structured than previously thought, making these and moderately longer loops excellent targets for therapeutic agents. In embodiments of the invention, a target loop does not have to be of particular length, and can be longer or shorter than the available examples. This realization and our novel structural determination methods allow artisan to identify lead oligonucleotide compounds and go through iterative rounds of structure-based refinement quickly and cost effectively. The methods of the invention have broad applications because they target processes that are important for fighting infectious diseases and cancers, age related pathologies and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as genetic disorders such as the DiGeorge syndrome and the like.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description. It is to be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating some embodiments of the present invention, are given by way of illustration and not limitation. Many changes and modifications within the scope of the present invention may be made without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all such modifications.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Brief descriptions of the drawing are found in the text below.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A</figref>-IE.

Essential for this recognition, the apical junction that joins the hairpin stem and loop directs the DGCR8 RNA-binding heme domain (Rhed) to the apex of the hairpin. Here we describe a scaffold-directed crystallography method and report the structures of numerous human pri-miRNA apical junctions and loops. These structures reveal a consensus in which a non-canonical base pair and at least one 5&#x2032; loop residue stack on top of the hairpin stem. The non-canonical pairs contribute to thermodynamic stability in solution. U-U and G-A pairs are highly enriched at the apical junctions of human pri-miRNAs. We also find that the Rhed binds longer loops more tightly, biochemically explaining why pri-miRNAs with shorter loops are often poorly processed. Our disclosure provides a structural basis for understanding pri-miRNAs and relevant molecular mechanisms of microRNA maturation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As discussed below, we have developed methods and materials that are useful to determine three-dimensional structures of pri-miRNA apical junctions and loops for their important roles in miRNA maturation and regulation (7-10). These moieties are present in both pri-miRNAs and pre-miRNAs and thereby their structures affect both Drosha and Dicer cleavage steps (8). The apical junctions and loops are also targets for drug discovery (11). To date only two pri-miRNA apical stem-loops have been structurally characterized in ligand-free states, using NMR spectroscopy (6, 11, 12). The 13-nt pre-miR-20b apical loop folds to well-defined rigid structures (6), whereas weak signals suggest that the 14-nt pri-miR-21 loop is unstructured (11, 12). The human genome encodes 1,881 pri-miRNA hairpins that differ from each other greatly (13). Toward surveying the large number of pri-miRNA structures, we have developed a scaffold-directed crystallization technique that enables rapid determination of hairpin loop structures without interference from the crystal lattice. We report nine apical junction and loop structures from eight pri-miRNAs and biochemical characterization of their interactions with Rhed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Embodiments of the invention include compositions of matter comprising a ribonucleic acid having an at least 90% sequence identity to: GGUUGCCGAAUCCGAAAGGUACGGAGGAACCGCUUUUUGGGGUUAAUC UGCAGUGAAGCUGCAGUAGGGAUACCUUCUGUCCCGCACCCGACAGCUA ACUCCGGAGGCAAUAAAGGAAGGAG (SEQ ID NO: 1). Embodiments of the invention preferably exhibit at least about a 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity to the polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. The percent identity may be readily determined by comparing sequences of polynucleotide variants with the corresponding portion of a full-length polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO: 1 (wherein the sequence identity noted above does not include the heterologous segments of nucleic acids that can be inserted in to this ribonucleic acid in place of residues 14-17). Some techniques for sequence comparison include using computer algorithms well known to those having ordinary skill in the art, such as Align or the BLAST algorithm (Altschul, J. Mol. Biol. 219:555-565, 1991; Henikoff and Henikoff. PNAS USA 89:10915-10919, 1992)). Default parameters may be used.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Typically, the polynucleotide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In this composition, residues 14-17 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (GAAA) of the ribonucleic are replaced with a heterologous segment of nucleic acids that is between 4 and 33 nucleotides in length (the at least 90% sequence identity noted above does not include the heterologous segments of nucleic acids that can be inserted in to this ribonucleic acid at residues 14-17). In one illustrative embodiment, the polynucleotide comprises GGUUGCCGAAUCCXGGUACGGAGGAACCGCUUUUUGGGGUUAAUCUGC AGUGAAGCUGCAGUAGGGAUACCUUCUGUCCCGCACCCGACAGCUAACU CCGGAGGCAAUAAAGGAAGGAG (SEQ ID NO: 29), wherein X comprises between 4 and 33 heterologous nucleotides (e.g. those comprising a three-dimensional structure in a naturally occurring RNA molecule such as a human miRNA) selected from A, U, G and C. In these compositions, the heterologous segment of nucleic acids is typically one that forms a three-dimensional structure in a naturally occurring RNA molecule (e.g. a loop structure). In certain embodiments of the invention, the heterologous segment of nucleic acids includes a complete loop structure, and optionally between 0-5 base pairs of a stem structure in the naturally occurring RNA molecule. Optionally these compositions can further comprise an agent that binds to the ribonucleic acid, for example a polynucleotide that hybridizes to the ribonucleic acid.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Another embodiment of the invention is a system or kit for observing RNA structures comprising one or more plasmids comprising a DNA sequence encoding a ribonucleic acid having an at least 90% (and optionally less than 100%) identity to: GGUUGCCGAAUCCGAAAGGUACGGAGGAACCGCUUUUUGGGGUUAAUC UGCAGUGAAGCUGCAGUAGGGAUACCUUCUGUCCCGCACCCGACAGCUA ACUCCGGAGGCAAUAAAGGAAGGAG (SEQ ID NO. 1). In some embodiments of the invention, the one or more plasmids comprise a polynucleotide sequence having an at least 90% identity the sequence GGTTGCCGAATCC (SEQ ID NO: 27) and/or a polynucleotide sequence having an at least 90% identity the sequence GGTACGGAGGAACCGCTITMGGGGTTAATCTGCAGTGAAGCTGCAGTAG GGATACCTTCTGTCCCGCACCCGACAGCTAACTCCGGAGGCAATAAAGGA AGGAG (SEQ ID NO: 28). In certain embodiments, the one or more plasmids further comprises a promoter for expressing or transcribing the ribonucleic acid, and/or the system or kit further comprises an RNA polymerase. Optionally the system or kit further comprises one or more primers that hybridize to a stretch of nucleic acids in the plasmid.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Yet another embodiment of the invention is a method of obtaining information on a structure of a ribonucleic acid. This method comprises substituting residues homologous to residues 14-17 (GAAA) of SEQ ID NO: 1 (or a ribonucleic acid having an at least 90% to SEQ ID NO: 1) with a heterologous segment of nucleic acids that is between 4 and 33 nucleotides in length (e.g. a heterologous segment that is 4, 5, 6, or 7 nucleotides etc., up to 33 nucleotides in length) to so as to form a fusion ribonucleic acid molecule, crystallizing the fusion RNA, performing structural analysis such as one comprising an X-ray or electron crystallographic technique on the crystallized fusion ribonucleic acid molecule, and then observing the results so as to obtain information on the three-dimensional structure of the heterologous segment of nucleic acids. In certain embodiments of these methods, the fusion ribonucleic acid molecule is combined with an agent that binds to the ribonucleic acid prior to the crystallographic analysis (e.g. a polynucleotide or other agent that binds to the heterologous segment of the ribonucleic acid) so that the structure of the RNA/agent complex can be observed. Typically in these methods, the crystallographic analysis includes a comparison to a control sample lacking the agent that binds to the ribonucleic acid. Optionally in these methods, a plurality of fusion ribonucleic acid molecules are combined with a plurality of agents that bind to the ribonucleic acid (e.g. in a high throughput screening procedure) prior to the structural analysis (e.g. X-ray or electron crystallographic) technique. In some embodiments of the invention, at least two agents are combined with the fusion ribonucleic acid molecules.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A related embodiment of the invention includes methods of performing a crystallographic analysis on a polynucleotide. Typically these methods comprise: selecting a first polynucleotide, wherein the first polynucleotide comprises a polynucleotide sequence of a first miRNA; identifying a segment of polynucleotides that forms a first loop region in the first miRNA; selecting a second polynucleotide, wherein the second polynucleotide comprises the polynucleotide sequence of a second miRNA; identifying a segment of polynucleotides that forms a first loop region in the second miRNA; forming a fusion polynucleotide selected so that the segment of polynucleotides comprising the first loop region on the first polynucleotide is substituted or swapped with the segment of polynucleotides comprising the first loop region on the second polynucleotide; and then crystallographically analyzing the fusion polynucleotide so as to observe a three dimensional structure of the fusion polynucleotide; so that a crystallographic analysis of the polynucleotide is performed. In certain embodiments of these methods, the first miRNA is a miRNA having at least 90% sequence identity to: GGUUGCCGAAUCCGAAAGGUACGGAGGAACCGCUUUUUGGGGUUAAUC UGCAGUGAAGCUGCAGUAGGGAUACCUUCUGUCCCGCACCCGACAGCUA ACUCCGGAGGCAAUAAAGGAAGGAG (SEQ ID NO: 1), wherein: residues 14-17 (GAAA) of the ribonucleic acid are replaced with a heterologous segment of nucleic acids comprising the first loop region on the second polynucleotide that is between 4 and 33 nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments of the invention, the first polynucleotide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1; and/or the second miRNA comprises a human miRNA. Typically in these methods, the crystallographic analysis is an X-ray or electron crystallographic technique; and/or the crystallographic analysis is performed in the presence of agent that binds to the fusion polynucleotide (e.g. an antisense oligonucleotide having homology to a segment of nucleic acids comprising a first loop region on the second polynucleotide).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In illustrative working embodiments of the invention, we examined nine structures of pri-miRNA hairpin loops. These studies determined that loops 4-8 nucleotides in length are more structured than previously thought, making these and moderately longer loops excellent targets for therapeutic agents. In embodiments of the invention, a target loop does not have to be of particular length, and can be longer or shorter than the available examples. This realization and our novel structural determination methods allow artisan to identify lead oligonucleotide compounds and go through iterative rounds of structure-based refinement quickly and cost effectively. The methods of the invention have broad applications because they target processes that are important for fighting infectious diseases such as Coronavirus disease 2019, as well as cancers, age related pathologies and neurodegenerative diseases, and genetic disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the DiGeorge syndrome and the like. In one illustration of this, embodiments of the invention can be used to test and examine new antisense therapeutics that are designed to target genes that are associated with the pathogenesis of human cancers, especially those cancers that are not amenable to small-molecule or antibody inhibition.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As discussed below, we determined the three-dimensional structures of human primary transcripts of microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) (1). Briefly, pri-miRNAs are recognized and cleaved in the nucleus by the Microprocessor complex that contains the Drosha ribonuclease and its RNA-binding partner protein DGCR8. Pri-miRNA apical junctions and loops are also the binding sites for other RNA-binding proteins and metabolites that regulate microRNA maturation. More importantly, such pri-miRNA apical loops can then be observed when targeted by agents such as polynucleotides, small-molecules, and the like. In this way, mature, functional microRNAs and their structures can be observed when bound to or otherwise modulated by agents that, for example, have therapeutic potential.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further aspects and embodiments of the invention are discussed in the following sections.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Survey of Pri-miRNA Apical Loop Length</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A previous investigation showed that pri-miRNAs with short (&#x3c;10 nt) apical loops tend to be processed inefficiently by Microprocessor (7). Considering and building upon this, we compiled a list of human pri-miRNA apical loop sequences based on predicted secondary structures we produced using mfold (14) and similar ones provided by miRBase (13). Majority of them (1,314 out of 1,881, 70%) are less than 10 nt long, with the highest frequencies in the 4-6 nt range (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>). RNA secondary structure prediction programs tend to include base pairs in relatively long loops that are not necessarily stable (6, 11). We partially addressed this apparent bias by disregarding 1 or 2 base pairs that are isolated from the hairpin stem. Although the list might still underestimate the number of longer loops, it nevertheless reflects the best of our knowledge. Therefore, for most pri-miRNA recognition events, the Rhed must interact with a relatively short apical loop in order to access the apical junction.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Scaffold-Directed Crystallography</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">To determine the three-dimensional structures of pri-miRNA apical junctions and loops, we developed a scaffold-directed crystallization approach. The concept is to fuse the target (unknown) sequence onto a scaffold molecule known to crystallize well and with a crystal structure available. The fusion should crystallize under conditions similar to that for the scaffold alone. The crystal lattice should be able to accommodate the target moiety. The scaffold structure allows the structure of the fusion to be determined via molecular replacement.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">To identify a suitable scaffold, we mined the Protein Data Bank for RNA crystals fulfilling four criteria. For each RNA structure entry, we first identified the largest sphere that can be accommodated in the lattice cavity, as characterized by the radius R<sub>max </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>). We considered the diffraction resolution reported. To simplify the design, we limited the search to entries with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Finally, we manually reviewed the crystal lattices to find stem-loops that point toward the lattice cavity so that an NA hairpin can be fused to. Amongst hundreds of structures surveyed, we identified only one RNA meeting these requirements, the YdaO-type c-di-AMP riboswitch from <i>Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus </i>(abbreviated from here on as YdaO) (15).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The YdaO crystal lattice contains large solvent channels (R<sub>max</sub>&#x2248;30 &#x212b;) with the short P2 stem positioned inside the channel and away from neighboring molecules (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c,d</i></figref>). The riboswitch has a complex pseudo-two-fold symmetric &#x2018;cloverleaf&#x2019; fold (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>d</i></figref>). We replaced the GAAA tetraloop on the YdaO P2 stem with the 14-nt pri-miR-9-1 apical loop plus 0-3 additional base-pairs from the stem. All four fusion RNAs, after annealing in the presence of the c-di-AMP ligand, migrated as single bands on a native gel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>e</i></figref>), indicating that the engineered pri-mi-RNA sequences do not interfere with the scaffold folding.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For our representative set of short pri-miRNA loops, we generated fusions with the YdaO scaffold containing the loop plus a various number of base pairs from the stem, and screened for crystallization. We succeeded in obtaining crystals for constructs containing 0 or 1 base pair from the pri-miRNA stems. These crystals belong to the same space group, P3121, with similar cell dimensions (Table 1). We collected X-ray diffraction data and determined their structures with resolution ranging from 2.71 to 3.08 &#x212b; (Table 1). For three pri-miRNAs, we also collected single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) data with redundancy in the 79-115 range. These SAD data contributed to phasing and refinement. The refined native structures showed that the scaffold moieties are very similar to that of the wild type (WT), with C1&#x2032; root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values ranging from 0.22 to 1.18 &#x212b;. Below we describe the pri-miRNA moieties. Unlike most RNA loop structures in the PDB, our structures are free from crystal contacts and interactions with ligands, and thereby reflect their own folding propensities.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Structures of Pri-miRNA Apical Junctions and Loops</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Our series of pri-miRNA loop structures cover the most frequent loop lengths in humans, ranging from 4 to 8 nt. The longest loop was 8 nt, from pri-miR-378a (termed 378a+0 bp, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a</i></figref>). As RNA loops can be flexible, they are often not well resolved in the electron density. To our surprise, the 2F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c </sub>map of 378a+0 bp revealed a highly structured conformation with clear density for all residues. The 378a+0 bp structure clearly shows that outermost residues of the loop, C1 and A8, form a non-canonical pair, which creates a platform onto which bases from the remainder of the loop stack (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>). On the 5&#x2032; end, C2 and U3 stack above C1. From the 3&#x2032; side, A4, G5, A6, and A7 stack in four layers above A8. Across the two stacks of bases, hydrogen bonds between C2<sup>O2</sup>-A7<sup>N6 </sup>(3.3 &#x212b;) U3<sup>O4&#x2032;</sup>-A6<sup>N6 </sup>(3.1 &#x212b;), U3<sup>N3</sup>-A6<sup>OP2 </sup>(2.8 &#x212b;), U3<sup>O2</sup>-A6<sup>N7 </sup>(2.6 &#x212b;), and U3<sup>2&#x2032;OH</sup>-G5<sup>N7 </sup>(2.7 &#x212b;) further stabilize the loop (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>). Every loop nucleotide of pri-miR-378a is coordinated by H-bonding except A4.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">We also solved the structure of the pri-miR-378a apical loop with one base pair from the stem (378a+1 bp, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b</i></figref>). The models for both loops are in close agreement (1.4 &#x212b; RMSD over all non-hydrogen atoms in the loop, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref>). The 378a+1 bp structure confirms the non-canonical C1-A8 pair. Interestingly, the fact that 378a+0 bp and 378a+1 bp are nearly identical suggests that the loop conformation is not strongly influenced by the terminal A:U pair from the pri-miRNA stem.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The structures of pri-miR-340 (340+1 bp) and pri-miR-300 (300+0 bp) contain 7-nt loops. The 340+1 bp structure confirms the presence of the terminal A-U pair, which is capped by an unexpected U1-U7 pair (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>d </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>c</i></figref>). The G2 and U3 bases from the 5&#x2032; end of the loop stack on top of the U-U pair. This leaves just three residues (C4, G5, and U6) in a more flexible conformation at the top of the loop. In the 300+0 bp structure, the terminal C-G pair of the scaffold is identical to the last base pair of the pri-miR-300 stem, thus this structure is effectively 300+1 bp. As in the case of 378a and 340, we observe a non-canonical pairing between U1 and U7 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>e </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>d</i></figref>). Likewise, a chain of base-stacking interactions between U1, U2, U3 and A4 orders the 5&#x2032; end of the loop. U6 is within hydrogen bonding distance with the U2 base, almost forming another non-canonical pair. C5 is outside the density and appears to be more flexible.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the structure of pri-miR-202 (6-nt loop), we did not observe non-canonical base pairs. However, similar to other structures, the A1 base at the 5&#x2032; end of the loop stacks to the final G-C pair of the pri-miRNA stem (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>f </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>e</i></figref>). The rest of the loop shows continuous electron density at 1&#x3c3;, but we could not determine the conformation with high confidence. Overall, the structures of the relatively long (6-8-nt) pri-miRNA loops reveal extensive base stacking and non-canonical base pairing interactions, perhaps stabilizing the loops more than previously anticipated. As a consequence, fewer loop residues is conformationally flexible.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, we investigated the structures of shorter pri-miRNA terminal loops (4-5 nt. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The structure of pri-miR-208a (208a+1 bp) with a 5-nt loop revealed an unpredicted A1-U5 Hoogsteen pair positioned above the final G-C pair from the stem (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>f</i></figref>). The central 3 nt of the loop, U2, C4, and G3 base-stack together and onto the A1 base in the Hoogsteen pair. In addition, the non-canonical U-U pair from 340+1 bp is recapitulated between U1 and U5 in the structure of pri-miR-449c (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>g</i></figref>). Positions U1 and G2 stack together above the terminal base pair, leaving just A3 and U4 outside the density. The two pentaloops share a theme: the two outermost residues form non-canonical base pairs, whereas the central three residues are unpaired and some of their bases are stacked.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Similar to the structure of 202+1 bp above, for pri-miR-320b-2 (5-nt loop), the A1 residue of the loop sits atop the terminal A-U pair of the stem (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>h</i></figref>). Finally, in the tetraloop structure of pri-miR-19b-2 (19b-2+1 bp) the 5&#x2032; loop nucleotide U1 stacks above the terminal base pair and a partial stacking interaction of A2 on top of U1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>i</i></figref>). U3 and G4 are mostly outside the electron density, although there may be a contact between G4<sup>N7 </sup>and the 2&#x2032;-OH of A2 (&#x2dc;2.6 &#x212b;). These structures confirm that the non-canonical pairing and base stacking of the 5&#x2032; loop residues witnessed in longer loop structures also dominate the folding of the shorter loops.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">A Structural Consensus of Pri-miRNA Apical Junctions</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Our pri-miRNA stem-loop structures point toward a common set of structural features defining the terminal loop. To further illustrate these features, we generated a structural alignment of all eight pri-miRNA loops (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>). First, we always observe the mfold-predicted canonical base pair at the apical end of the pri-miRNA stem (5&#x2032;-1 paired with 3&#x2032;-1). Because the loops are of different sizes, here we use 5&#x2032;-1 to represent the first residue from the 5&#x2032;-end of the pri-miRNA sequence, and 3&#x2032;-1 to represent the first residue from the 3&#x2032;-end. Second, in all structures the first nucleotide on the 5&#x2032; end of the loop base-stacks with the terminal base pair (5&#x2032;-2 stacking with 5&#x2032;-1/3&#x2032;-1). Third, in five of the eight loops (378a, 340, 300, 208a, 449c), this base stacking is also accompanied by a non-canonical base pair (5&#x2032;-2 pairing with 3&#x2032;-2), effectively making the apical loop shorter than predicted by two nucleotides. Fourth, all eight structures reveal at least one additional level of base-stacking interactions on the 5&#x2032; side (5&#x2032;-3 stacked on 5&#x2032;-2). In contrast, only two structures indicate second-layer stacking on the 3&#x2032; side. Beyond these common features, other residues of the pri-miRNA loops appear to adopt quite different conformations or are flexible.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Non-Canonical Base Pairs Contribute to Thermodynamic Stability</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">To test if the structures of apical junctions and loops we observed contribute to their stability in solution, we fused the eight pri-miRNA sequences to a common 5-bp helical segment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a</i></figref>) and measured their thermodynamic parameters using optical melting. Like in the crystal structure, each pri-miRNA sequence contains the apical loop and an immediately neighboring canonical base pair from the stem so that a minimal apical junction is included. We expect that the canonical stem base pairs contribute differentially to the overall stability, with the G-C or C-G pairs in three pri-miRNAs being more stable than the A-U and U-A pairs in the others. However, this difference does not fully explain the free energy changes (&#x394;G) of folding we measured (Table 2). When we take into account the non-canonical pairs we revealed in the three-dimensional structures, a trend appears. The two pri-miRNAs that form non-canonical pairs and have G-C or C-G as terminal stem pairs (pri-mir-300 and pri-mir-208a) are the most stable, whereas the ones that do not form non-canonical base pairs and contain A-U or U-A canonical stem pairs (pri-mir-320b-2 and pri-mir-19b-2) are the least stable (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>). Most other pri-miRNA sequences that either contain non-canonical pairs but A-U/U-A stem pairs (pri-mir-340 and pri-mir-449c), or form no non-canonical pairs but with G-C/C-G stem pairs (pri-mir-202) are intermediate in stability. The pri-mir-378a apical junction/loop contains a C-A non-canonical pair that is defined by a single hydrogen bond and thereby displays a AG similar to those from the least stable group. Together, these data suggest that the non-canonical pairs at pri-miRNA apical junctions contribute to their structural stability in solution.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0000">Human Pri-miRNAs Favor U-U and G-A Pairs at their Apical Junctions</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">We next estimated the abundance of non-canonical pairs at pri-miRNA apical junctions by analyzing all human pri-miRNA loop sequences. Among 1,881 such sequences, 340 contain U residues at both the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends that are most likely to pair like in the pri-miR-340, pri-miR-300, and pri-miR-449c structures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c</i></figref>). The U-U pair is the most abundant among all possible combinations at these positions, whereas the expected occurrence by chance is 181. This enrichment is highly significant, as the probability of observing U-U 340 times by chance is 3&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;28 </sup>times lower than that for 181 times. The second most abundant combination is 5&#x2032;-G and 3&#x2032;-A, observed 245 times, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;16 </sup>fold less likely to occur by chance than the odd for most probable count of 139. The loop sequence counts of other terminal combinations such as C-A (observed 122 times) are less substantially different from that expected by chance (109 times, P<sub>122</sub>-P<sub>109</sub>=0.42). Therefore, we conclude that human pri-miRNAs favor U-U and G-A pairs immediately next to the hairpin stem.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">Intriguingly, U-U and G-A are known to stabilize hairpin loops when serving as the closing pairs (16). Our pri-miRNA loop library was constructed partially based on secondary structure predictions that have taken into consideration the stabilizing effects of U-U and G-A pairs. We do not think this small bonus energy term is responsible for the enrichment of U-U and G-A as closing pairs in pri-miRNA apical loops, as for most pri-miRNAs the loop sequences are defined by strong canonical base pairs as part of the pri-miRNA hairpin stem. Additionally, other non-canonical pairs, such as G-G, C-A and A-C, are also known to be stabilizing (although to slightly less extents), but they are not enriched in pri-miRNA apical junctions. This result suggests that U-U and G-A non-canonical pairs are favored by pri-miRNA apical junctions, possibly for their stabilizing effects and/or specific geometric features.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0000">Pri-miRNA Loops Share Structural Features with Other RNAs</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">We asked whether the loop conformations we uncovered were unique to pri-miRNAs or shared with other RNA stem-loops. To address this question, we threaded RNA hairpin sequences from the PDB onto our pri-miRNA structures and then calculated the RMSD between the threaded pose and the original PDB conformation (see Methods section). For pri-miR-378a we identified three loops that are slightly shorter (6- or 7-nt) and differ in sequence but retain a highly similar fold (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). Comparing these structures reveals a generalized loop motif, which we call 3&#x2032;-purine-rich stack (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>b</i></figref>). In a 3&#x2032;-purine-rich stack, 4-5 mostly purine bases on the 3&#x2032; side of the loop stack with each other, on top of the helical stem. One or two pyrimidines may be found in positions furthest from the stem. On the 5&#x2032; side of the loop, two or three pyrimidine residues, most often uridines, serve as linkers between the stacked residues and the stem. These linker pyrimidines form hydrogen bonds with stacked purines, sometimes non-canonical base pairs, which further stabilize the whole loop. More broadly, in the pri-miR-320b-2 structure the three purines in the UGAA tetraloop stack with each other and on top of the neighboring U-A pair, essentially forming a 3&#x2032; purine stack. Many pri-miRNA and other hairpin loops contain sequences consistent with a 3&#x2032; purine stack. Overall, these observations suggest that the pri-miRNA loop structures are not necessarily unique to pri-miRNAs, also consistent with the previous reports that DGCR8 and Drosha interact with many other cellular RNAs (17-21).</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Asymmetric Conformational Flexibility of Pri-miRNA Apical Loops</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0057">Structural stability and dynamics are likely to be important for pri-miRNA junctions and loops for at least two reasons. First, common conformational features are expected to be stable. Second, dynamic regions make it easier to avoid steric hindrance when binding processing proteins and to adopt conformations favorable for processing. To investigate this, we first reviewed the atomic displacement parameters (ADPs, also known as the temperature or B-factors) refined during structure determination. Not surprisingly, residues at the top of the loop have large ADPs, suggesting that they are highly dynamic; whereas residues close to the stems, which are involved in common structural features such as non-canonical pairs and base stacking, tend to have lower ADPs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). Importantly, most loops display a trend toward higher stability at the 5&#x2032; region of the loop and more flexibility in the 3&#x2032; region, with exception of pri-miR-378a. The stacked 5&#x2032; residues are consistently more stable than the 3&#x2032; nucleotides. To further compare ADPs between structures, we calculated the average ADP per residue and then plotted them on the same scale (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>). The peak in ADPs is consistently located near the middle to 3&#x2032; end of the loop across most structures. It is interesting to note that the UGU motif previous identified to be important for efficient processing (5, 10) is located in the 5&#x2032; region of the loop.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">For a more detailed view into the loop dynamics, we performed molecular dynamics simulation of the pri-miRNA junction and loop nucleotides in explicit solvent. For simplicity, the simulation included only the pri-miRNA residues plus two base pairs from the scaffold, and we restrained the position of the scaffold nucleotides to prevent unwinding of the strand (see Methods for details). We ran the simulations at 300 K for 1 &#x3bc;s and analyzed the resulting trajectories by calculating the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) for each residue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>e</i></figref>). These statistics support the trend more obvious that the center to 3&#x2032; loop residues sample a wider range of conformations.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Correlation Between Rhed-Binding Affinity and Apical Loop Length</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0059">We wondered how the Rhed recognizes all pri-miRNA apical junctions despite differences in loop length. We addressed this question by measuring the affinities of Rhed for pri-miRNA fragments containing the apical loop plus approximately 20 bp from the stem (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b</i>-<i>i</i></figref>). We used electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) to determine the Rhed dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for each RNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). The Rhed bound all pri-miRNA fragments with K<sub>d </sub>ranging from 1.9 to 9.2 &#x3bc;M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>h</i></figref>). Such differences could be important for the recognition, especially when pri-miRNAs compete for the processing machinery. We plotted the AG of binding versus the overall loop length (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>i</i></figref>) and noticed a trend toward tighter binding of the longer loops. This trend became more obvious when we corrected the loop length based on our 3D structures (length minus number of residues involved in non-canonical pairs, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>j</i></figref>). Our results provide a biochemical explanation for pri-miRNA loop length preference, although we cannot rule out the possibility that differences in the pri-miRNA stems also contribute to the range of Rhed affinities. We note that pri-miR-340, which contains the UGU motif at the 5&#x2032; side of the loop, binds the Rhed with similar affinity (K<sub>d</sub>=3.5 &#x3bc;M) to other constructs lacking this sequence.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Discussion</heading><p id="p-0063" num="0060">We provide working embodiments demonstrating a proof-of-concept that scaffold-directed crystallography can be a powerful tool for RNA structural biology. This method is largely analogous to the popular fixed-arm MBP fusion technique, in which a target protein is linked to MBP in a fixed orientation via a continuous alpha-helical linker (22). However, our engineering approach specifically positions the target RNA within a lattice void of the scaffold crystal. Such a design results in several additional advantages: (1) because the target moiety does not disrupt existing lattice contacts, the fusion molecule can be crystalized under the original conditions; (2) since rescreening of a broad array of conditions is unnecessary, a minimal amount of purified fusion RNA is required for crystallization; and (3) the target does not interact with neighboring molecules in the lattice, thereby allowing its structure to closely represent the conformation in solution.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">Applying this technique to the problem of pri-miRNA recognition provides an atomic-level survey of eight pri-miRNA apical junction and loop structures. These loops cover the most frequent loop lengths among human pri-miRNAs. These structures collectively reveal a structural consensus that involves a non-canonical base pair closing the apical loop and further base stacking at the 5&#x2032; end. This consensus is supported by the previously reported NMR structure for pre-miR-20b (6). The pre-miR-20b stem terminates in a G-U pair and the neighboring 5&#x2032; loop nucleotide (G) stacks on top of the pair (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). Comparison of the top 20 NMR solutions confirms these are stable features of the molecule. NMR study of pre-miR-21 revealed weak signals corresponding to two tandem U-G/G-U pairs at the apical junction and suggested that the 14-nt apical loop is otherwise unstructured (11). Beyond the apical junctions, the apical loops in our and NMR structures differ in three-dimensional conformation, suggesting that their conformations are not direct specificity determinants. These conformations are relevant to their individual functions. For example, the pri-miR-125a loop can function as an aptamer domain for binding folic acid (23).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">The observation of non-canonical pairs at pri-miRNA apical junctions in and of itself has important structural and functional implications. Our optical melting experiments indicate that these pairings contribute to thermodynamic stability of the RNA in solution (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>). In particular, U-U and G-A pairs are highly enriched at apical junctions in human pri-miRNAs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c</i></figref>). These pairs are often conserved. For example, the U-U pair in pri-miR-340 is nearly completely conserved, whereas nucleotide variation occurs in all other positions. The only variation of the U-U pair is a substitution by a U-G pair in <i>Pteropus alecto</i>. Therefore, these non-canonical pairs at the apical junction are likely to be important for miRNA maturation, although their exact functions remain to be determined. Microprocessor recognizes a pri-miRNA hairpin by clamping its stem at both ends (24, 25). The optimal pri-miRNA hairpin stem length is estimated to be 35&#xb1;1 bp, counting in internal non-canonical pairs (10). Our study suggests that terminal non-canonical pairs at apical junctions have to be considered. Previous high-throughput mutagenesis of pri-miR-16-1 indicates that due to the longer-than-optimal stem length and that disruption of canonical pairs at the apical end of the stem increases the Microprocessor cleavage efficiency (10). In pri-miR-16-1, a G-A pair is expected to form and stack at the end of the hairpin stem. In such a scenario, the G-A pair would need to be disrupted along with the neighboring canonical pairs. Such inhibitory effects make possible activation of miRNA maturation by RNA-binding proteins and RNA helicases (26). Conversely, we imagine that in cases where the pri-miRNA helical stem are shorter than optimal, the non-canonical pairs would help the hairpin fits in the Microprocessor complex.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">The conformation of the apical junction may also be preferentially recognized by Microprocessor. Indeed, Microprocessor prefers a U-G pair over Watson-Crick base pairs at the 35<sup>th</sup>-bp position of the pri-miR-30a stem (counting from the basal junction) (10). We re-analyzed another high-throughput mutagenesis data (5) and found that C-A pair is highly enriched at the apical junction among the Microprocessor cleavage products (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). Furthermore, the tendency of 5&#x2032; loop residues to stack and 3&#x2032; loop section to be more flexible allows the UGU motif to be positioned and exposed for recognition by the processing machinery. Further studies are required to test this idea.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">Our analysis of human pri-miRNA loop sequences suggests that most of them are shorter than the optimal &#x2265;10-nt. Among the eight pri-miRNAs with loop lengths between 4-8 nt, we observe a correlation between the loop length and free energy change of binding with Rhed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>i</i></figref>). The correlation is improved when residues involved in non-canonical pairs are excluded from the calculation of loop length (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>j</i></figref>). Preferential binding to Rhed would poise a pri-miRNA in an advantageous position for processing, thereby providing a biochemical explanation for the optimal loop length of &#x2265; 10 nt (7). The differences in &#x394;G<sub>binding </sub>to Rhed are within 1 kcal/mol.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">We believe such moderate differences can have substantial biological and pathological consequences, especially when Microprocessor becomes limited (in many cancer cells for example). Preferential binding to Microprocessor, as represented by the interaction of apical junctions with Rhed shown here, may generate a hierarchy of processing among pri-miRNAs and helps to determine miRNA expression profiles.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">Apical junctions and loops are also part of pre-miRNAs that are exported to the cytoplasm and cleaved by the Dicer ribonuclease in the miRNA maturation pathway. Previous studies have shown that the stem and loop lengths of pre-miRNAs can affect both the Drosha and Dicer cleavage efficiency (8). Further studies are required to understand how the apical junction and loop structures contribute to the Dicer processing step. Furthermore, there is a substantial interest of developing potential therapeutic agents that target pri-miRNA, mRNA and viral RNA hairpin loops (11, 26, 27). Our structures indicate that the pri-miRNA loops contain more structures than expected, which would reduce the entropy penalty for binding. Our crystallization method should allow structure-based design of inhibitors.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Methods</heading><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Pri-miRNA Apical Loop Analysis</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0067">To gauge the approximate size of the apical loops, we downloaded from miRBase (release 21) all annotated human &#x201c;hairpin&#x201d; sequences and their genomic coordinates.

For each hairpin, we used the genomic sequence to extend the RNA an equal number of nucleotides at the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends until the total length equaled 150 nt. This 150-nt window contained the full pri-miRNA hairpin, plus some single-stranded RNA on either side of the basal junction. We then generated predicted secondary structures for all pri-miRNA hairpins using MFOLD (14), and generally retained the top scoring structures (i.e. with the lowest predicted free energy of folding). We manually reviewed all the predictions to ensure they reflected the expected hairpin structure with mature miRNA sequences derived from either or both strands of the stem: in cases where mfold predicted alternative conformations, we selected the structure with the lowest free energy that contained a stem length of approximately three helical turns. We manually compared the secondary structures with those from the miRBase and also eliminated 1-2 base pairs in the hairpin that are isolated from the stem and thereby deemed to be unstable.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">PDB Mining and Identification of YdaO Crystallization Scaffold</heading><p id="p-0071" num="0068">We first filtered the PDB to obtain X-ray structures containing only RNA molecules (no protein or DNA).

The unit cell at the center of this block sees all possible lattice voids, either internally or between unit cells.

All reactions below contained the same reverse primer, 5&#x2032;-mCmUCCTTCCTTTATTGCCTCC-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO: 8), where &#x2018;m&#x2019; indicates 2&#x2032;-O-methylation.

The product was gel purified and 1 &#x3bc;L was used as template for the next round.

For all RNAs, additional density for the missing base-pair and loop could clearly be seen in the 2F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c </sub>and difference maps. We then modeled in the missing residues in Coot (31). In cases where the density was unclear, we stopped modeling with an incomplete loop and performed an additional round of coordinate, ADP, and TLS parameter refinement with Phenix. This typically revealed additional density for the missing residues.

However, for 300+0 bp, 300+1 bp and 378a+0 bp the default settings generated noisy maps with regions of broken density. To improve the quality of the maps, we reduced the annealing temperature to 1000&#xb0; C. and excluded the bulk solvent mask from the omitted regions.

The search pool was the same set of RNA structures used to identify crystallization scaffolds above. For each structure from the PDB set, we used DSSR to identify all hairpin loops. We extracted the RNA sequence from each hairpin loop, and eliminated loops shorter than the pri-miRNA sequence. For loops longer than the pri-miRNA, we used a sliding window to obtain all fragments of the loop with the same length. Each loop sequence was then threaded onto the pri-miRNA model using the &#x201c;ma_thread&#x201d; routine in Rosetta (33). Using a PyMOL script, we aligned the resulting threaded model to the original hairpin loop and calculated the RMSD between the two models.

Trajectories were analyzed using the rmsf and clustering functions in GROMACS.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="2">Reanalysis of Pri-miR-223 High-Throughput Processing Assays</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0089">Sequencing data from the previously reported processing assay for pri-miRNA-223 were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (accession number: SRA051323) (5). Reads corresponding to pri-miR-223 were aligned using Bowtie2 (37). Any reads containing unknown nucleotides were eliminated. Reads from the input or selection libraries were separated by their corresponding barcode and counted with Python.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table
