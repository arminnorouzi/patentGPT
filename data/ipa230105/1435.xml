Since the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> are formed in a vertical direction, rigidity against bending deformation of the connecting portion <b>133</b> connected thereto may be provided. The rigidity of the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> may act in a direction to limit the bending deformation of the connecting portion <b>133</b> and may prevent the connecting portion <b>133</b> from being easily and excessively bent. Further, when the connecting portion <b>133</b> is bent and deformed, the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> may assist the connecting portion <b>133</b> to restore to the original state. The fact that the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> are formed in the vertical direction may means that the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> (central axes of the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b>) are formed to have an angle of, for example, 70 to 110 degrees, 80 to 100 degrees, 85 to 95 degrees, or 90 degrees with respect to the upper support <b>110</b> and the lower support <b>120</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to these angle values.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an embodiment, the elastic force and the restoring force of the elastic member <b>100</b> may be adjusted by adjusting the rigidity of the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b>. For example, when the rigidity of the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> is relatively low, the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> are elastically deformed when the pressure is applied on the elastic member <b>100</b>, and the degree of deformation may be small (in particular, compared to the bending deformation of the connecting portion <b>133</b>). Further, for example, when the rigidity of the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> is relatively high, the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> do not elastically deform and may be fixed in shape even when the pressure is applied on the elastic member <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an embodiment, a thickness of the elastic part <b>130</b> and/or the connecting portion <b>133</b> may be adjusted so that the bending deformation of the elastic part <b>130</b> and/or the connecting portion <b>133</b> may be facilitated. That is, the bending may be easily performed in a region having a relatively thin thickness, and the bending may not be made or may be limitedly performed in a region having a relatively thick thickness. For example, the thickness of the connecting portion <b>133</b> may increase from the center of the connecting portion <b>133</b> toward the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b>. For example, the thickness of the elastic part <b>130</b> may increase from the center of the elastic part <b>130</b> toward the upper support <b>110</b> and the lower support <b>120</b>. For example, the elastic part <b>130</b> may have horizontal cross-sections having different areas, and the areas may increase from the center of the elastic part <b>130</b> toward the upper support <b>110</b> and the lower support <b>120</b>. For example, the connecting portion <b>133</b> may be bent in the connection regions <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> between the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> by making the thickness of the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> greater than the thickness of the connecting portion <b>133</b>. At this time, the thickness is gradually changed in a direction from the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> to the connecting portion <b>133</b>, so that bending and bending release can be naturally performed.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an embodiment, when pressure is applied on the elastic member <b>100</b>, the lower support <b>120</b> may rotate in a first direction while the upper support <b>110</b> moves down. Bending deformation of the elastic part <b>130</b> may be made in a narrow range compared to a moving-down length of the upper support <b>110</b> by the lower support portion <b>132</b> rotating in a state in which the upper support portion <b>131</b> is fixed. That is, it is possible to relieve some of a pressing force so that the elastic part <b>130</b> may be bent more gently and smoothly.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an embodiment, when the pressure on the elastic member <b>100</b> is released, the lower support <b>120</b> may be position-restored while rotating in a second direction opposite to the first direction. That is, in a process in which the pressure is applied on the elastic member <b>100</b> or releases, the upper support <b>110</b> is prevented from rotating, and only the lower support <b>120</b> can rotate. To this end, various configurations may be applied. For example, an anti-rotation protrusion <b>150</b> or an anti-rotation groove connected to the upper support <b>110</b> may be formed. The rotation of the upper support <b>110</b> may be prevented by the anti-rotation protrusion <b>150</b> or the anti-rotation groove being coupled to other component of the pump assembly <b>200</b> such as a sealing part <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In an embodiment, the elastic member <b>100</b> may further include the stem <b>140</b>. The stem <b>140</b> may be provided inside the upper support <b>110</b> and may be connected to the upper support <b>110</b>. The upper support <b>110</b> and the stem <b>140</b> may be integrally formed or may be separately formed to be assembled. The stem <b>140</b> and the upper support <b>110</b> may have the same material or different materials. In this case, the material may include, for example, at least one of polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polycarbonate (PC), polyoxymethylene (POM), polyketone (POK), or polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). For example, the stem <b>140</b> may be integrally formed of the same material as that of the upper support <b>110</b>. In an additional embodiment, the anti-rotation protrusion <b>150</b> or the anti-rotation groove may be formed at the stem <b>140</b>. For example, the anti-rotation protrusion <b>150</b> or the anti-rotation groove may be formed at an outer surface of a lower end of the stem <b>140</b>. For example, the stem <b>140</b> is inserted inside the sealing part <b>230</b> of the pump assembly <b>200</b>, and an outer surface of the stem <b>140</b> and an inner surface of the sealing part <b>230</b> may be in close contact with each other. At this time, the anti-rotation protrusion <b>150</b> or the anti-rotation groove of the stem <b>140</b> may be coupled to a coupling groove <b>231</b> or a coupling protrusion of the sealing part <b>230</b>, and thus, the rotation of the stem <b>140</b> and the upper support <b>110</b> can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an operation of the elastic member according to the embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates the elastic member <b>100</b> before pressure is applied, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates the elastic member <b>100</b> after pressure is applied.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As illustrated, when pressure is applied on the elastic member <b>100</b>, the upper support <b>110</b> may move downward.

The rigidity of the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> may provide a repulsive force to a user when the pressure is applied on the elastic member <b>100</b>, and may also prevent the upper support <b>110</b> from excessively moving down. May mainly occur at an upper end and a lower end of the connecting portion <b>133</b> (that is, the connection region <b>134</b> with the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the connection region <b>135</b> with the lower support portion <b>132</b> in the connecting portion <b>133</b>) due to rigidity. In addition, when the pressure is released, the rigidity may assist the bent and deformed connecting portion <b>133</b> to restore a shape thereof. Accordingly, the upper support <b>110</b> may stably move upward.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Meanwhile, unlike the upper support <b>110</b> which is rotationally fixed, the lower support <b>120</b> may relieve some of the pressing force while pressure is applied. By some of the pressing force being converted into a rotational force of the lower support <b>120</b>, it is possible to prevent the connecting portion <b>133</b> from being excessively bent or to prevent occurrence of damage to a portion between the upper support portion <b>131</b> and the lower support portion <b>132</b> that provide rigidity due to excessive force. When the pressure is released, as the shape of the elastically compressed connecting portion <b>133</b> is restored, the lower support <b>120</b> also rotates in the opposite direction to restore the original position.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the elastic member <b>100</b> is illustrated to include the stem <b>140</b> and the anti-rotation protrusion <b>150</b>, but this is just exemplary, and according to an embodiment, at least one of the stem <b>140</b> and the anti-rotation protrusion <b>150</b> may be excluded from the elastic member <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a pump assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an exploded view of the pump assembly according to the embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the pump assembly according to the embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>7</b></figref>, the pump assembly <b>200</b> receives an external force from a user, causes a pressure change therein, and introduces and discharges contents therethrough, and specifically, the pump assembly <b>200</b> may include a cylinder <b>210</b>, a seal cap <b>220</b>, a sealing part <b>230</b>, a piston rod <b>240</b>, and the elastic member <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The cylinder <b>210</b> may provide a space which vertically passes through the cylinder <b>210</b> and through which the contents are introduced or discharged.
