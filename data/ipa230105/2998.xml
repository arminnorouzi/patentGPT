For one, modular and prefabricated homes are often built indoors in climate-controlled factories rather than exposed to the elements. This keeps the materials dry as well as protecting them from theft and vandalism. It also avoids weather-related construction delays. Centralizing construction at one factory simplifies allows building materials to be delivered to a single location rather than to distributed jobsites. In addition, building inside a factory allows the use of jigs, templates, and computer-controlled machines, all of which result in structures that are built with far greater precision and consistency relative to ones that are built on-site with hand tools. Still another advantage is that an entire community or even a city may be constructed off-site, where ever resources are best utilized for this purpose and then components shipped to locations virtually anywhere in the world for final assembly.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modular and/or prefabricated structures do still require some on-site work, but this work is typically limited to site-preparation including grading, laying or running utilities and constructing the foundation. The structures themselves are trucked in, craned on to the foundation, and connected to the utilities and the foundation. The process of closing seams and completing utility hook-ups typically takes less than a week. In some cases, even internal fixtures (e.g., plumbing and electrical) are installed at the factory.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The most time-consuming and labor intensive of onsite activities is typically construction of the foundation. After the site is graded and compacted, the soil is excavated to make room for the foundation. In some cases, a continuous trench footer is dug around the entire outline of the structure. Rebar and wire are placed in the trench then it is filled with concrete. Anchor bolts are inserted into the drying concrete or drilled and placed after it has set, and the house is built on top of it the foundation and anchors.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In other cases, the entire footprint of the structure to be built is scraped, leveled, and compacted. Then, concrete is poured over the entire compacted footprint to create a slab on which the home is built. Still further foundations use a combination of these techniques or individual concrete pads and piers whereby individual piles are excavated and constructed and piers are built on top of the pile to establish a uniform building platform. Unfortunately, there is a disconnect between the distributed, inefficient, low-precision techniques used to construct foundations and the highly efficient, centralized, precise techniques and process used to build the prefabricated and/or modular structures themselves. This can result in poor connections between structures and foundations that result in additional on-site work to conform the foundation and loss of time and money. Also, prefabricated structure builders must contract with multiple regional contractors to construct their foundations rather than simply shipping foundation components with the rest of the modular and/or prefabricated structure. In recognition of these problems, the present disclosure provides foundation systems, components and related methods that greatly simplify the process of laying a foundation for prefabricated and modular building structures and ideally eliminate or at least minimize non-utility-related onsite work.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a conventional strip footing foundation for a building structure;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a cross sectional view of the strip footing foundation of <b>1</b>A;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a conventional pile and pier foundation for a building structure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a cross sectional view of the pile and pier foundation of <b>2</b>A;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a truss foundation according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a pre-cast slab section for prefabricated and modular homes according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a cross sectional view of the truss interface section of the pre-cast slab and truss foundation according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is a top view of the truss interface formed in the pre-cast slab of <b>3</b>C;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> is a top view of the pan covering the truss interface of <b>3</b>C;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart detailing steps of a method for installing a foundation such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-E</figref> according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of another pre-cast slab for prefabricated and modular structures according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a pre-cast slab and truss foundation interconnect system according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is a pre-cast slab and monopile foundation interconnect system according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is another pre-cast slab and truss foundation interconnect system according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is another pre-cast slab and monopile foundation interconnect system according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is an additional pre-cast slab and truss foundation interconnect system according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is an additional pre-cast slab and monopile foundation interconnect system according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is a lift plate for lifting a pre-cast slab according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> is a portion of a pre-cast slab with an integrated lift point;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a connector for joining adjacent pre-cast slabs according to various embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A</figref> and B show components of a grade block foundation according to various embodiments of the invention;

These advantages must be exploited to address the growing global shortage of quality, affordable homes. However, what is missing from the modular and/or prefabricated construction paradigm in a universal foundation that allows the structure to quickly and accurately secured to the building site regardless of soil type, without needing to excavate and pour a custom concrete foundation. Preferably such a foundation can be manufactured centrally and shipped with the other building components or at least delivered to the jobsite ready to be assembled ahead of the remaining modular and/or prefabricated components. To that end, the applicant of this disclosure has developed an A-frame-shaped truss foundation that is particularly well-suited to this application. The system is known commercially as EARTH TRUSS. The EARTH TRUSS system consists of a pair of screw anchors that are rotated into supporting ground at angles to one another and extended with above-ground upper legs that are joined with an adapter to form a unitary A-frame-shaped truss structure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">EARTH TRUSS was originally developed to support single-axis solar trackers. When wind strikes a tracker array, large lateral loads must be resisted by the foundation. With monopiles, these loads impart a bending moment onto the foundation components. By using A-frame-shaped trusses rather than monopiles, these lateral loads are instead translated into tension and compression in the legs. Because individual structural members are relatively good at resist axial loads, as opposed to resisting bending, less steel may be used to support the same size tracker.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The EARTH TRUSS relies on a specialized machine or attachment for a general-purpose machine that uses a combination of downward force and rotation to drive screw anchors into the earth. These components and machines are easily adapted to construct robust foundations for support other structures, including modular and prefabricated homes. They can be configured as a two-legged truss as with single-axis tracker foundations, or even as plumb piles depending on site conditions and sheering concerns. The present disclosure focuses on building systems and related methods that combine EARTH TRUSS components with pre-cast concrete slab sections to form fast, accurate, robust, and water-proof prefabricated foundations that can be constructed very quickly, shipped to the homesite as a kit, and assembled with minimal site preparation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">To that end, the present invention will now be described in the context of the drawing figures where like structures are referred to with like designations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A</figref> and B show conventional strip footing foundation <b>10</b>. Foundation <b>10</b> is constructed by excavating a trench around the perimeter of the intended structure (i.e., home, office, modular classroom, etc.), placing rebar, wireframe forms, and/or other reinforcing structures into the trench, and pouring concrete over them. Then concrete blocks are used to make above-ground foundation <b>14</b> on poured concrete footer <b>12</b>. Gravel <b>11</b> may also be poured inside the walls of foundation <b>14</b> and a concrete slab poured on top of the gravel to create a slab such as slab <b>13</b>. Anchors, ties, or other structures <b>15</b> are typically inserted into concrete block foundation <b>14</b> before it sets to provide attachment points for the rest of the structure. In the case of a modular or premanufactured homes, these anchors will serve as the points of attachment. Otherwise, if the house is built on-site, these anchors are received within wooden beams and/or floor joists, and the home is built up from there.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A</figref> and B show another conventional foundation <b>20</b> consisting of piers <b>24</b> and piles <b>22</b>. In such a foundation, individual pile portions <b>22</b> are excavated at strategic points around a site to support load bearing portions of the structure in accordance with a construction plan. A wood or cardboard form may be placed around the excavated opening and wire, rebar or other structural components placed inside before filling it with liquid concrete. After pile <b>22</b> has set, concrete, wooden or steel piers <b>24</b> are constructed on top to form a level, elevated mounting surface on which to set or construct the home. Piers <b>24</b> may have cap portion <b>26</b> with integral anchor <b>28</b> that serves as the mechanical interface between the home and foundation <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Though first developed hundreds if not thousands of years ago, prior art foundations <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A</figref>/B and <b>2</b>A/B continue to be used today. They require substantial onsite work with local components and labor that is completely disconnected from the manufacturing process of the modular or prefabricated structure that will be set on it other than knowing the necessary foundation dimensions. As a result, even if anchors <b>14</b>/<b>28</b> are positioned perfectly, something that rarely occurs, the foundation will be the least efficient or cost-effective portion of the project. Across a builder's or manufacturer's portfolio of development projects there will be varying quality and varying expense depending on many local conditions (e.g., labor rates, material availability, weather, etc.). To overcome these problems, the Applicant of this disclosure has proposed a system that allows foundation components to be centrally manufactured and shipped as a kit to the job site for rapid assembly. They may be shipped with other modular and/or prefabricated components or shipped separately beforehand, so that the entire structure, including the foundation, can be assembled on-site without pouring concrete, extensive site preparation, or excavation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> show the components of this novel foundation system according to various exemplary embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows exemplary truss foundation <b>50</b> according to various embodiments of the invention. Exemplary truss foundation <b>50</b> shown here consists of a pair of screw anchors <b>52</b> driven into the ground adjacent one another and in a substantially common plane. When used to support single-axis trackers, this plane is typically oriented East to West, however, for supporting modular and prefabricated homes, they may be oriented to match the orientation of the outer walls of the structure, that is, with some trusses oriented orthogonally or at 90-degrees relative to other foundations to insure that any shearing forces are translated into tension and compression as necessary. In various embodiments, and as shown, screw anchors <b>52</b> are driven until they are almost completely embedded into the ground.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown, screw anchors <b>52</b> are elongated metal tubes that may span one to two meters with a sub-100 mm outside diameter. External threads <b>53</b> are located at the lower end of each anchor <b>52</b> and driving couplers <b>54</b> are attached at the opposing upper end. Driving couplers <b>54</b> may be engaged by the chuck of a rotary driver to transfer torque and downforce to screw anchors <b>52</b> to drive them into the ground. Couplers <b>54</b> may also provide a mechanism for joining upper legs <b>55</b> to the end of each screw anchor <b>52</b> after the screw anchor is driven. Upper leg sections <b>55</b> are sleeved over respective ones of driving couplers <b>54</b> to extend the axis of each screw anchor <b>52</b> above ground. It should be appreciated that depending on the required height above grade, screw anchors <b>52</b> may be used alone, that is, without needing upper legs <b>52</b>. Then, an adapter or truss cap, such as adapter <b>60</b>, is used to join each upper leg <b>55</b> (or screw anchor <b>52</b>) to form a unitary A-frame-shaped truss foundation <b>50</b>. In various embodiments and as shown, adapter <b>60</b> provides support surface <b>62</b> and may include pedestal <b>64</b>, with threaded anchor bolt opening, an anchor protecting out of pedestal <b>64</b>, or other structure to mechanically couple adapter <b>60</b>, and by extension, foundation <b>50</b> to the structure it will support.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows pre-cast slab section <b>100</b> that makes up part of the foundation as well as the subfloor or base of the prefabricated structure according to various embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments, modular and prefabricated building components may be set directly on top of slab <b>100</b>. In other embodiments, finished surfaces (e.g., radiant heat, tile, hardwood, etc.) may be installed directly on top of the pre-cast slab without needing floor trusses or a sub-floor. In various embodiments, pre-cast slab <b>100</b> is formed in regular modular shapes (e.g., 10-feet&#xd7;20-feet rectangles) that can be interconnected in common or adjacent planes to form larger structures. In other embodiments, they may be formed in custom shapes to accommodate the footprint of the structure. In various embodiments, pre-cast slabs are constructed by pouring concrete into a form that has the correct outer dimensions, is filled with re-bar and/or wire, and that has protrusions that create through-holes or voids <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>130</b> at desired locations for the foundation interface, utility connections and/or lift points. In some embodiments, conventional concrete mixes may be used. Others may require stronger and/or more flexible formulations to accommodate the forces of cable-based post-tensioning.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the example of <b>3</b>B, a series of through holes <b>110</b> have been formed in pre-cast slab <b>100</b> at points where it will be supported by the foundations, such as, for example, foundation <b>50</b> shown in <b>3</b>A. Utility through-holes <b>130</b> may be separate formed in the center of each slap <b>100</b>, or elsewhere, to allow utility hookups (e.g., water, sewer, electricity, natural gas, etc. to pass through). Smaller though-holes such as holes <b>108</b> may be used as lift points to enable pre-cast sections <b>100</b> to be craned down onto an array of foundations. Perimeter cutouts <b>105</b> may be formed around the outside of each slab <b>100</b> at various points. Such cutouts <b>105</b> may be used to join one slab to an adjacent one. Cutouts <b>105</b> may also be used as lift points, obviating the need for separate holes <b>108</b>. One or several of through-holes <b>105</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>130</b>, may be reinforced with metal or preformed metal shapes that create voids as well as integral reinforced steel interface sections for mechanically interfacing the slab to the truss foundations or other structures. These shapes may be moved around within the mold before being locked into place and numbered to specifically match the foundation requirements of the particular site.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">When manufacturing slab <b>100</b>, a layer of PRECON or other suitable material may be laid down within the form used to make pre-cast section <b>100</b> to create a water barrier on the underside as well as up into the utility knockouts and foundation interface openings and lift points before the concrete is poured. PRECON is a composite sheet membrane manufactured and sold by W.R. Meadows of Hampshire, Ill. that forms a mechanical bond to poured concrete as the concrete cures. It should be appreciated that other products from other manufacturers that performs similarly may also be used. Once the concrete has set, these pre-cast sections can be loaded onto truck, train or into a shipping container with the truss members and can travel as a kit to the homesite be assembled.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, this figure shows cross section detail of one through-hole <b>110</b> for interfacing slap <b>100</b> with foundation <b>50</b> according to various embodiments of the invention. In this example, hole <b>110</b> consists of metal reinforced sidewalls <b>113</b> resting against walls <b>112</b>. Metal reinforced sidewalls <b>113</b> may consist of a box that sits in the mold used to create slab <b>100</b>. In the cross-sectional view of <b>3</b>C, walls <b>112</b> and box <b>113</b> define a two-sided ledge that houses slidable transfer bar <b>114</b>. In various embodiments, transfer bar <b>114</b> fits within the extended sides <b>112</b> to allow the bar to slide along the ledge in one direction (X or Y) in-plane (without movement in the Z-direction). This will enable bar <b>114</b> to be easily moved to compensate for any in-plane misalignment between the foundation through-hole <b>110</b> and adapter <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> provides an overhead view of opening <b>110</b>. As shown, transfer bar <b>114</b> may preferably have one or more long slots <b>115</b> formed in it to compensate for misalignment in the other planar direction orthogonal to the sliding direction of the bar. Slot <b>115</b> in transfer bar <b>114</b> as the bar's ability to move back in forth within the metal reinforced opening <b>113</b> allow compensation for up to several inches of misalignment in two direction between through-hole <b>110</b> and adapter <b>60</b> without any impact to the integrity of the connection. This will prevent foundation misalignment from propagating through the building supported by slab <b>100</b>. It should be appreciated that although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, slab <b>100</b> may also have a series of anchors around its perimeter that project above the surface of slab <b>100</b> for connecting to the prefabricated home, modular home or other structure lowered and/or built on top of it. Such anchors can be easily placed within the mold prior to pouring the concrete so that they are correctly located.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, anchor bolt <b>116</b> projects up through transfer bar <b>114</b> via slot <b>115</b>. In various embodiments, a pan such as pan <b>120</b> is placed in through-hole <b>110</b> above bar <b>114</b>. A nut such as nut <b>118</b> is used to secure pan <b>110</b> to adapter <b>60</b> via bolt <b>116</b>. It should be appreciated that in various embodiments, bolt <b>116</b> may pass down from above pan <b>120</b> into adapter <b>60</b> through slot <b>115</b> in transfer bar <b>114</b>. In various embodiments, after pan <b>120</b> is secured, a layer of PRECON <b>122</b> or other suitable material may be placed in pan <b>120</b> before filling it with concrete <b>124</b>, bentonite or other suitable filler to create a water proof seal.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> shows a portion of hole <b>110</b> looking down from above with transfer bar <b>114</b> and slot <b>115</b> visible from above. This view is consistent with the view after slab <b>100</b> has been lowered onto the foundation. Similarly, <b>3</b>E shows the same view after pan <b>120</b> has been dropped into hole <b>110</b>. As seen, pan <b>100</b> has a relatively large opening in its bottom to permit access to the bar at different positions.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, this figure is a flow chart detailing steps of method <b>160</b> for installing a foundation such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-E</figref> according to various embodiments of the invention. In various embodiments, installation begins in step <b>162</b> by installing multiple screw anchors into the ground at the intended building site. In various embodiments, this is done in accordance with a plan matched to the manufacturing of the pre-cast slab(s) so that they foundation pedestals will match up with corresponding openings in the slab. In various embodiments, this may be accomplished by unrolling a mat or other template that has the anchor locations marked on it. The mat may also serve a vapor barrier and/or insect barrier and may be staked into the ground or otherwise attached. As discussed in greater detail herein, the screw anchors may be installed in adjacent pairs, angled towards one another to form the base of an A-frame-shaped truss foundation, or in other embodiments shown herein, as plumb monopiles.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Once the screw anchors have been driven, then, in step <b>164</b>, apex hardware is installed. If necessary, this may include joining upper legs to their respective screw anchors, depending on the amount of above-ground elevation required for the particular site. If the screw anchors are installed in adjacent pairs, adapters are used to join the free end of each adjacent upper leg pair. Alternatively, if the screw anchors are driven as plumb monopiles, an upper leg is joined to each screw anchor, if necessary, and an adapter is joined to the upper end of the upper leg. In either case, in various embodiments, each adapter will include some leveling adjustment so that the adapters can be adjusted to be level to each other before being locked into place relative to the legs and/or anchors. In various embodiments, and as discussed and shown herein, the adapters may include a pedestal, anchor, or other mechanical features to mate with and secure the pre-cast slab. Then, in step <b>166</b>, a crane is used to place one or more pre-cast slab sections on top of the pedestals and/or adapters in accordance with the plan. Manual manipulation of the transfer bars may be performed as the slab is lowered to allow them to be properly aligned with their respective pedestals as the pre-cast slab is being lowered. This may be accomplished by simply sliding. Alternatively, a tool may turn a cam or gear that causes the transfer bar to slide in-plane. In various embodiments, the adapter may have an anchor bolt or other fastener projecting above it that engages a slot or opening in the transfer bar. Once alignment with the respective anchors has been achieved, the entire slab may be lowered to completely rest on the supported transfer bars which, in turn, are resting on the foundation via the adapter and pedestal (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In various embodiments, placement of the pre-cast slab sections on the truss or monopile foundations may open up a space between the bottom side of the transfer bars and the walls of the steel reinforcement in the truss interface openings. In various embodiments, in step <b>168</b>, the process is completed by securing the slab and sealing the through-holes. In various embodiments, to accomplish this an installer may reach from the top side of the slab to place a plug of bentonite clay in the gap between the transfer bar and the walls to prevent water from flowing past the transfer bar. Bentonite clay may be particular useful in this application because it remains pliable over long periods of time without losing its cohesion. It should be appreciated, however, that other materials may also be used in place or in addition to bentonite clay. For example, foam sheets or other suitable material may be placed on the ledges below the transfer bar since these lower ledges are not load bearing. Once the gap has been sealed, a pan may be dropped in each truss interface opening. The pan may have a large cutout in its bottom to account for the different positions of the transfer bar and anchor. Also, a large retaining nut may thread onto the anchor either before or after the pan is set. The nut will prevent uplift and secure the slab to the individual trusses. In various embodiments, the pan may be lined with a sheet of PRECON or other suitable material. In various embodiments, the anchor will be pressed through the layer of PRECON or an opening will be cut in it to allow the bolt to pass through. Then, a non-shrinking grout or other suitable material may be deposited in the pan. In various embodiments, this will make the truss interface watertight and prevent water and/or moisture from passing through the interface and contacting structures or components above.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be appreciated that in various embodiments, the pan may be omitted, and the concrete or non-shrinking grout may be poured directly on a layer of PRECON in the interface opening. In sites where water ingress is not a concern, this step may be omitted or replaced with a pest barrier to prevent bugs, termites, and/or rodents from passing through the foundation. Also, as shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the anchor bolt is shown as a static member that projects above the adapter. It should be appreciated that the anchor bolt may have a hexagonal or star-shaped opening in its top surface that can receive a tool to allow rotation of the bolt. In various embodiments, rotation may elevate or lower the pedestal relative to the adapter and provide a mechanism for micro-leveling the pre-cast slab after its set or to leveling the pedestal relative to surrounding pedestals before the pre-cast slab is set.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, this figure shows pre-cast slab <b>200</b> according to various other embodiments of the invention. Instead of the large truss interface opening in the slab of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B</figref>/C, such as openings <b>110</b> in slab <b>100</b>, foundation interface openings <b>210</b> in the slab <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> are formed recessed and specifically shaped to match the geometry of the pedestals supported by each foundation. In this example, the geometry of each opening is a tapered cuboid but it should be appreciated that other shapes, including pyramids, posts, cuboids, cones, etc. may be used instead. Like slab <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B</figref>/C, slab <b>200</b> also includes utility knock outs or openings <b>230</b> and several lift point openings <b>208</b>. Lift point openings <b>208</b> could contain a reinforced metal lining and bar, as shown for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> or, alternatively, could simply be openings that receive a removable lift plate such as lift plate <b>405</b> as shown in <b>9</b>A. Also, like slab <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B</figref>/C slab <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> includes several coupling joints <b>205</b> around its perimeter, which in the example, are shown as semi-circular openings with a metal bar across them. These may be used to join adjacent slabs to form a larger slab structure, such as, for example, with a connector such connector <b>425</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. In that case, flanges <b>426</b> will fit between the wall of the opening and the bar of adjacent slabs <b>200</b> locking them together. Alternatively, or in addition, these joints may be used to hang trim pieces, pipes, conduit, or other structures, to run communication lines, or for any other purpose. By having the foundation set back relative to the outer edge of each slab <b>200</b>, trim pieces may be hung flush with the outer wall via joints <b>205</b>. As with pre-cast slab <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B</figref>/C, slab <b>200</b> may also be formed with a layer of PRECON attached to its underside that extends around the sides and up into all the through-holes (e.g., lift points <b>208</b>, utility knockouts <b>230</b>, and truss interface openings <b>210</b>).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The remaining figures and corresponding discussion show interfaces that may be used to join pre-cast members to truss foundations or monopile screw anchors according to various exemplary embodiments of the invention. Starting with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, this figure shows a portion of pre-cast slab <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> with truss foundation <b>70</b> below it. Truss foundation <b>70</b> shown here consists of a pair of legs extending below and above ground that are angled towards one another and joined with adapter <b>74</b>. In this example, support plate <b>77</b> sits on top surface <b>75</b> of the adapter <b>74</b>. Support plate <b>77</b> may have a pair of holes <b>78</b> or other suitable features to enable it to be securely attached to adapter <b>74</b>. Plate <b>77</b> may also have integral pedestal <b>79</b> formed on top surface. In various embodiments, pedestal <b>79</b> is attached to the plate so that it can move or pivot around the surface of the plate at different positions to enable it to be matched to the position of the corresponding void in the interface opening of the slab to compensate for any misalignment when placing slab <b>200</b>. Alternatively, interface opening <b>210</b> may also be able to rotate or slide in-plane in a manner similar to the transfer bar shown in <b>3</b>C so that each opening may be positioned to be directly above at and at the correct rotational orientation to receive one of the pedestals. For example, as shown in the cutaway view of <b>6</b>A, the interface opening <b>210</b> may actually be constructed of a plate captured within the opening that can slide in X and Y directions and/or rotate in-plane to enable it to be oriented precisely so that opening <b>211</b> is directly above pedestal <b>79</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the example of <b>6</b>A, washer <b>212</b> sits above interface opening <b>210</b> after slab <b>200</b> has been lowered on to pedestals <b>79</b> to create a flat surface. An anchor bolt such as bolt <b>213</b> may pass down from above through washer <b>212</b> and into a threaded opening in the top surface of pedestal <b>79</b>. Alternatively, pedestal <b>79</b> may contain an anchor protruding up above it. In such embodiments, anchor bolt <b>213</b> shown in <b>6</b>A will be replaced with a retaining nut. Such modifications are within the spirit and scope of the invention. Though not shown, after slab <b>200</b> has been secured with the anchor bolt or other fastener, opening <b>210</b> containing the bolt and washer may be filled with non-shrinking grout or other suitable material to create a uniform, water resistant upper surface to slab <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows a slab and foundation interface like that of <b>5</b>A but the truss foundation <b>70</b> has been replaced with a single, plumb-oriented monopile foundation <b>80</b>. In various embodiments, monopile foundation <b>80</b> consists of a single screw anchor <b>82</b> driven substantially plumb into the supporting ground with an upper leg attached thereto, if necessary. Then, adapter <b>84</b>, similar to adapter <b>74</b> shown in <b>6</b>A is set on top of anchor or leg <b>82</b> and the remaining connections occur in the same manner as in the context of <b>6</b>A with the same modifications possible.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A</figref> and B, these figures show another exemplary interface between pre-cast slab <b>200</b> and screw anchor foundations according to various embodiments of the invention. Pre-cast slab portion <b>200</b> is substantially the same as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A</figref> and B with the same modifications possible. The differences lie in the adapter and pedestal used to support it. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A</figref>, adapters <b>93</b> has a cross shape with four anchor bolts <b>96</b> protruding upward towards slab <b>200</b>. Support plate <b>240</b> is attached to adapter <b>93</b> so that anchor bolts <b>96</b> pass through and are secured with corresponding nuts (not shown). Pedestal <b>244</b> is formed on or attached to support plate <b>240</b> with a tapered cuboid shape. In various embodiments, cuboid pedestal <b>244</b> may be rotatable about a pivot point around the surface of plate <b>240</b> in-plane to enable pedestal <b>240</b> to be aligned with the corresponding cuboid opening <b>231</b>. Alternatively, foundation interface opening <b>210</b> in the recess of slab <b>200</b> may include plate <b>230</b> that is trapped within the slab but able to rotate and/or move in the X and Y directions in-plane (without changing in the Z-direction) to ensure fitment between pedestal <b>244</b> and its corresponding opening <b>231</b>. In various embodiments, washer <b>212</b> under anchor bolt <b>213</b> may be dimensioned small enough to enable it to move around within recess <b>210</b> to account for adjustment between each pedestal <b>244</b> and its corresponding opening <b>231</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> shows substantially the same interface as <b>7</b>A except that truss foundation <b>90</b> has again been replaced with a plumb monopile foundation consist of single screw anchor driven <b>92</b> at a substantially plumb orientation. If necessary, an upper leg (not shown) may be attached to the above-ground end of screw anchor <b>92</b>. Pre-cast slab <b>200</b> and its interface components are otherwise identical to that shown in <b>7</b>A.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A</figref> and B, these figures show yet another simplified interface between pre-cast slab section <b>300</b> and foundations <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> respectively according to various embodiments of the invention. Starting with <b>8</b>A, the interface shown here consists of adapter <b>135</b> with single anchor bolt <b>138</b> projecting upward from its upper surface <b>137</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, anchor bolt <b>138</b> is received within interface opening <b>312</b> of recess <b>310</b> as slab <b>300</b> sits on adapter <b>135</b>. Large washer <b>315</b> fits over anchor bolt <b>138</b> and retaining nut <b>318</b> is attached to the head of anchor bolt <b>318</b>. Though not shown in this exemplary figure, a plate or other force spreading structure may sit atop adapter <b>135</b> to distribute the weight of pre-cast slab <b>300</b> over a larger surface area. Also, as discussed herein, anchor bolt <b>138</b> may have a hexagonal, star-shaped or other shaped opening at its head so that inserting a tool into that opening and rotating it will elevate top portion <b>137</b> of adapter <b>135</b> contacting the slab to raise (or lower) the level of the slab at that interface. This may be performed before, while, or after placing slab <b>300</b> on adapter <b>135</b>. In various embodiments, opening <b>312</b> will be much larger than the diameter of anchor bolt <b>138</b> to compensate for any misalignment between bolt <b>138</b> and opening <b>312</b>. Also, the size of recess <b>310</b> around opening <b>312</b> relative to the size of washer <b>315</b> will allow retaining nut <b>318</b> to be attached at multiple different X-Y locations without comprising the integrity of the connection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> shows a similar interface as <b>8</b>A but truss foundation <b>130</b> has again been replaced with a single, plumb monopile foundation <b>140</b>. The components above adapter <b>145</b> are substantially the same as that shown and discussed in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A</figref> and B, these figures show yet another foundation system according to various other embodiments of the invention. The components of system <b>450</b> include grade bar sections <b>460</b> and screw anchor members <b>470</b>. Grade bar sections <b>460</b> may be formed from concrete, reinforced concrete or other aggregate solution that is poured into a mold and hardened. In various embodiments, the sections are universal. In other embodiments, they may be formed to specific dimension and numbered or otherwise marked with indicia matching to foundation plan for the structure. Each section <b>460</b> may include on more through-holes that enable them to be securely connected to one another and to top end <b>474</b> of anchors <b>470</b>. In various embodiments, and as shown in <b>11</b>A, transition portion <b>466</b> of the bar may have a curved surface to enable the next adjacent section <b>460</b> to be oriented at an angle relative to that one so long as openings <b>464</b> on surface <b>462</b> line up.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In various embodiments, bolt or fastener passes through washer <b>472</b> into opening <b>464</b> is received in threaded opening <b>476</b> in head portion <b>474</b> of screw anchor <b>470</b>. The bottom side of section <b>460</b> will rest on support surface <b>475</b> to maintain level. In various embodiments, head portion <b>474</b> may be rotatable with a socket type tool to raise or lower head portion <b>474</b> including support <b>475</b> to adjust the level of section <b>460</b> after it has been placed on screw anchor <b>470</b>. Also, as seen in <b>11</b>B, after adjacent sections have been joined via bolt <b>470</b> to other means, an anchor such as anchor <b>482</b> may be inserted above bolt <b>470</b> in hole <b>464</b> and then remainder of the hole filled with grout <b>482</b> or other suitable material. In various embodiments, opening <b>464</b> will be large enough to enable anchor bolt <b>480</b> to be moved around to the proper orientation to mate with the remainder of the structure to be placed on or built above grade bars <b>460</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In various embodiments, grade bar sections <b>460</b> will be designed based on the specific plans for the structure to be erected so that anchor bolts are located at the desired locations. Also, it should be appreciated that adjacent sections of grade bar may be joined directly, that is, not via the ground penetrating screw anchor. In other words, each grade bar sections may be placed on top of one or more screw anchors but the connection between adjacent sections may be made with hardware that only penetrate the two overlapping sections and does not extend down into the supporting ground below.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a flow chart detailing the steps of a method for installing a foundation system such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A</figref> and B. Method <b>500</b> begins in step <b>505</b> where the various anchors used to make up the foundation are installed. As discussed herein, this may comprise rotating them into the ground with a rotary driver using a combination of downforce and torque at precise locations indicated in the foundation plan. The anchors may extend around the perimeter of the structure only, or alternatively may also intermittently pass through the middle connecting sections of the perimeter, as necessary. In various embodiments, anchors are driven at a plumb orientation or orthogonal to the desired placement of the grade bars so that the height of the top end of each anchor is very consistent relative to other anchors in the same foundation.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, in step <b>510</b>, after all the screw anchors have been consistent driven in accordance with the foundation plan, the grade bars are laid down above the anchors. In various embodiments, this is accomplished by hoisting each grade bar section with a crane and lowering is so that at least one opening formed in the bar aligns with the head a corresponding one of the screw anchors. The bar is lowered until it rests on the support portion in the head of the screw anchor. As discussed in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A</figref> and B, it may be possible to rotate the head of the anchor with tool to raise or lower the support portion, thereby raising or lowering the grade bar to be level. This process may be repeated until each grade bar making up the foundation has been placed on the screw anchors.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, in step <b>515</b>, each bar is secured to its adjacent bar. As discussed above, in some embodiments, screw anchors may pass through the grade bars at the overlap joint between each bar, obviating the need for this step. In other embodiments, however, separate hardware may be passed through the overlapping portions of each adjacent bar to lock them together. Then, each opening passing through the bars, whether to join two adjacent bars, connect the bars to their respective screw anchors, or both, are filled with grout or other suitable material to seal them. Joint between adjacent bars may also be grouted and/or insulated to prevent ingress of water, air, and insects. Then, the process is completed in step <b>520</b> by placing anchor bolts or other tie-in structures in the grouted openings to support the structure that will be set on or built above the foundation.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The various foundations and pre-cast slabs shown herein will provide a modular, transportable, precise, and easily installed system that will rapidly increase the deployment of modular and prefabricates homes and other structures.
