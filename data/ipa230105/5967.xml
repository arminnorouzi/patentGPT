id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of priority to Japanese Patent Application Number 2021-110112 filed on Jul. 1, 2021. The entire contents of the above-identified application are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to an active matrix substrate using an oxide semiconductor and a manufacturing method thereof.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An active matrix substrate provided with switching elements for respective pixels have been widely used for display devices such as a liquid crystal display device and image sensors such as an X-ray sensor, for example. An active matrix substrate provided with thin film transistors (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;TFTs&#x201d;) as the switching elements is referred to as a TFT substrate. Note that a part of the TFT substrate corresponding to pixels of the display device may also be referred to herein as pixels. The TFT provided as the switching element to each pixel of the active matrix substrate is referred to as a &#x201c;pixel TFT&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, there has been proposed use of an oxide semiconductor as a material of an active layer of the TFT, in place of amorphous silicon and polycrystalline silicon (for example, JP 2015-156482 A). Such a TFT is referred to as an &#x201c;oxide semiconductor TFT&#x201d;. The oxide semiconductor has mobility higher than that of amorphous silicon. Thus, the oxide semiconductor TFT can operate at a higher speed than an amorphous silicon TFT. Since an oxide semiconductor film is formed by a process simpler than that of a polycrystalline silicon film, the oxide semiconductor film can be applied to a device that requires a large region.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the oxide semiconductor TFT, it has been proposed to use a layered semiconductor layer formed by layering a plurality of oxide semiconductor layers having different compositions as an active layer (for example, JP 2015-156482 A). In the present specification, such a TFT structure is referred to as a &#x201c;layered channel structure&#x201d;.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the inventors of the disclosure have investigated, it has been found that in a known oxide semiconductor TFT having a layered channel structure, there is a possibility that a reduction reaction of the oxide semiconductor occurs at or near an edge (end portion) of the oxide semiconductor layer of a lower layer due to the manufacturing process, and the edge is subject to resistance reduction. In a case where the edge of the oxide semiconductor layer is subject to resistance reduction, stable TFT characteristics may not be obtained.

The TFT <b>900</b> includes a gate electrode GE disposed on a substrate <b>1</b>, a gate insulating layer <b>5</b> covering the gate electrode GE, an oxide semiconductor layer <b>97</b> disposed on the gate insulating layer <b>5</b> and including a channel region <b>97</b><i>c</i>, a source electrode SE, and a drain electrode DE. The channel region <b>97</b><i>c </i>overlaps with the gate electrode GE, across the gate insulating layer <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The oxide semiconductor layer <b>97</b> has a layered structure including, for example, a lower layer (hereinafter, &#x201c;high mobility layer&#x201d;) <b>97</b>A having a relatively high mobility and an upper layer (hereinafter &#x201c;low mobility layer&#x201d;) <b>97</b>B having a lower mobility than the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A. In such a layered structure, the channel is mainly formed in the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A. The oxide semiconductor layer <b>97</b> can be formed by, for example, forming a layered film including a plurality of oxide semiconductor films, and then patterning the layered film. Each of the source electrode SE and the drain electrode DE is in contact with a corresponding one of regions of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>97</b>, the regions being located on both sides of the channel region <b>97</b><i>c</i>. A protection film (for example, an inorganic insulating film) <b>99</b> is formed on the TFT <b>900</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In a channel etched type TFT, the source electrode SE and the drain electrode DE are typically formed by depositing a conductive film covering the oxide semiconductor layer <b>97</b>, and then patterning (for example, dry etching) the conductive film (source-drain separation step). At this time, a low mobility layer <b>97</b>B is formed on the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A, and thus damage to an upper surface of the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A can be suppressed. However, a side surface of the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A is exposed from the low mobility layer <b>97</b>B, and thus the side surface may be damaged. For example, there is a possibility that the oxide semiconductor is reduced by a plasma of an etching gas (chlorine-based gas) to be subject to resistance reduction in the side surface of the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A. Note that the low mobility layer <b>97</b>B serving as the upper layer, is also exposed to the plasma, but the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A is more likely to be reduced to be made conductive (that is, the specific resistance is more likely to be smaller).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the illustrated example, a part <b>97</b>E of the edge of the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A having a rectangular shape, the part <b>97</b>E being not covered with the source electrode SE and the drain electrode DE, may be reduced by the plasma of the chlorine-based gas to be subject to resistance reduction. Thus, a current is likely to flow from the source to the drain, and thus the threshold voltage of the TFT <b>900</b> may shift in the minus direction, and the desired TFT characteristics may not be obtained. The source electrode SE and the drain electrode DE may also be electrically connected to each other via the part <b>97</b>E of the edge of the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A made conductive interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Note that by using a layered film including a Ti film as a lower layer as a source conductive film, and by dry etching only an upper layer of the source conductive film in a state where the oxide semiconductor layer <b>97</b> is covered with the Ti film, resistance reduction of the edge of the high mobility layer in the source-drain separation step may be suppressed. However, even in this case, there is a possibility that when forming the protection film <b>99</b> covering the TFT <b>900</b>, the oxide semiconductor is reduced by the hydrogen plasma to be subject to resistance reduction in the exposed portion of the edge of the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Furthermore, the same problem may occur also in the oxide semiconductor TFT including the etch stop structure.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref> is a plan view illustrating a known oxide semiconductor TFT (hereinafter, simply abbreviated as a &#x201c;TFT&#x201d;) <b>901</b> having the etch stop structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>B and <b>25</b>C</figref> are cross-sectional views taken along a line B-B&#x2032; and a line C-C&#x2032; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The TFT <b>901</b> differs from the TFT <b>900</b> in that, an etch stop layer (for example, an inorganic insulating film) <b>96</b> is formed so as to cover the oxide semiconductor layer <b>97</b>, and the source electrode SE and the drain electrode DE are in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>97</b> in openings ps and pd provided in the etch stop layer <b>96</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In the TFT <b>901</b> having the etch stop structure, the source-drain separation step is performed in a state where the oxide semiconductor layer <b>97</b> is covered with the etch stop layer <b>96</b>. In this example, the edge of the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>97</b> is also covered with the etch stop layer <b>96</b>, and thus resistance reduction of the edge of the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A during the dry etching of the conductive film can be suppressed. However, in the subsequent manufacturing process, the edge of the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A may be subject to resistance reduction. For example, there is a possibility that when forming the protection film <b>99</b> covering the TFT <b>901</b> by CVD, the oxide semiconductor is reduced by the hydrogen plasma to be subject to resistance reduction in the part <b>97</b>E of the edge of the high mobility layer <b>97</b>A, the part <b>97</b>E being located at or near the channel region <b>97</b><i>c</i>. Although not illustrated, in a case where a PIN diode is formed above the TFT, a similar problem may occur when forming the a-Si film serving as the diode layer.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Furthermore, in the TFTs <b>900</b> and <b>901</b>, the source electrode SE and the drain electrode DE are connected to the upper surface of the low mobility layer <b>97</b>B. Thus, the contact property between the source electrode SE and the oxide semiconductor layer <b>7</b> and between the drain electrode DE and the oxide semiconductor layer <b>7</b> may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The inventors of the disclosure have investigated a novel structure of the oxide semiconductor layer based on the above discovery and conceived an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In an embodiment of the disclosure, when viewed from the normal direction of the substrate, the active layer of the TFT has a layered structure having an upper layer and a lower layer, and the oxide semiconductor layer of the upper layer is disposed so as to cross the oxide semiconductor layer of the lower layer in the channel width direction.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The structure as described above can suppress resistance reduction (being conductive) of a part of the edge (side surface) of the lower layer, the part being located between the source and the drain and covered with the upper layer, with damage by the plasma at the time of the source-drain separation process or the formation of the protection film. Thus, the depletion of the TFT characteristics such as leakage between the source and the drain and a minus shift of the threshold voltage due to resistance reduction of the edge can be suppressed, and thus the TFT characteristics can be further stabilized. By utilizing a part of the lower layer exposed from the upper layer as the contact region, more favorable contact can be formed between the source electrode and the oxide semiconductor layer and between the drain electrode and the oxide semiconductor layer.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Hereinafter, an active matrix substrate according to a first embodiment will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
