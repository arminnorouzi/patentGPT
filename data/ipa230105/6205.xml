In addition to such a trend, the development of high-capacity and high-output secondary batteries has been demanded.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Research on lithium secondary batteries has been conducted to increase a mixed density of a negative electrode so as to achieve a high capacity. When the mixed density of the negative electrode is increased, a content of a negative electrode active material in the same volume of the negative electrode may be increased, such that an energy density is increased. However, as the mixed density is increased, a porosity of the negative electrode is reduced, such that a diffusion rate of lithium ions is reduced, an intercalation/deintercalation reaction of lithium ions in the negative electrode is not smoothly carried out, and output performance is rather reduced. Such problems are particularly severe during a high-rate charging and discharging process, and thus, even when a content of the active material in the negative electrode is increased, a discharge capacity and cycle characteristics are significantly reduced during high-rate charging and discharging. Therefore, it is required to develop a negative electrode capable of implementing both a high mixed density and a high capacity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The importance of a high-output electrode and pores developed in the electrode has been recognized, and accordingly, efforts for developing an electrode pore structure advantageous for exhibiting high performance have been made. In the related art, in order to implement a pore structure advantageous for exhibiting high performance, a pore volume, an average pore size, and the like have been applied. However, the above factors are analyzed by filling the electrode with nitrogen gas, mercury, or the like, which is different from the actual electrode-electrolyte system. Therefore, it is difficult to say that it represents the actual system in which the battery is operated.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 10-2019-0042335, a situation when lithium ions diffuse into active material particles is disclosed, and a coefficient of diffusion due to the active material is described, but development of pores in an electrode active material layer is not described.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Pores in a lithium secondary battery electrode play an important role in exhibiting cell performance. Since the pore is a path for supplying lithium ions in the electrode, it is important to consider how the pores are formed in the electrode. Examples of factors involved in pore formation include electrode components such as an active material, a conductive material, and a binder, and structural elements such as a loading amount and a density. Among these factors, excluding the structural factors, it may be appreciated that the active material has the greatest effect on the pore formation in the electrode (electrode active material layer) except for factors, which are contained in the electrode in small amounts, such as the conductive material and the binder.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Meanwhile, a supply of lithium ions in the pores of the electrode is based on a diffusion mechanism. In particular, the diffusion of the lithium ions occurring in the electrode is a limited restrict diffusion with spatial constraints. Therefore, a coefficient of diffusion (that is, a diffusion rate) and a diffusion time reflect a diffusion space (the longer the diffusion space, the longer the diffusion time). Accordingly, when the time for the lithium ions to diffuse in the pores of the electrode is grasped, pore formation may be interpreted.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the present invention, an active material layer having an appropriate pore structure in an electrode is provided to improve the performance of the electrode. In particular, the electrode including the active material layer has a relatively long diffusion time. In general, it may be considered that the shorter the diffusion time, the better the diffusion structure. However, since the diffusion mechanism with spatial constraints occurs in the electrode, it may be interpreted in the opposite way. That is, it may be analyzed that the longer the diffusion time in the limited diffusion space, the narrower and longer the diffusion space (the length of the pore). The long diffusion space in the electrode means that pores are formed finely and uniformly in the electrode. Therefore, there is an advantage in that lithium ions may be uniformly supplied (diffused) to the entire space of the active material layer of the electrode.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An embodiment of the present invention is directed to providing a secondary battery having a pore structure advantageous for exhibiting high performance, and in particular, having high-rate charging and discharging performance by producing an active material and an electrode implementing the features described above.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one general aspect, a negative electrode for a secondary battery includes: a current collector; and a negative electrode active material layer formed on the current collector and containing a negative electrode active material, wherein the negative electrode satisfies the following Relational Expression 1:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>D&#x3c;</i>1.9&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;[Relational Expression 1]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">wherein D is a coefficient of diffusion of lithium ions in the negative electrode and is derived from the following expression:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>D=&#x3c3;</i><sup>2</sup>&#xb7;&#x3c4;<sub>d</sub><sup>&#x2212;&#x3b3;</sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0016" num="0000">wherein &#x3c3; is a thickness (cm) of the negative electrode active material layer, &#x3c4;<sub>d </sub>is a diffusion time (s), and &#x3b3; is a dispersion parameter and satisfies 0.8&#x2264;&#x3b3;&#x2264;0.95.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0013">The negative electrode may further satisfy the following Relational Expression 2,</p><p id="p-0018" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>1&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup><i>&#x2264;D&#x3c;</i>1.9&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;[Relational Expression 2]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0019" num="0014">wherein D is a coefficient of diffusion of lithium ions in the negative electrode and is derived from the following expression:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>D=&#x3c3;</i><sup>2</sup>&#xb7;&#x3c4;<sub>d</sub><sup>&#x2212;&#x3b3;</sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0021" num="0000">wherein &#x3c3; is a thickness (cm) of the negative electrode active material layer, &#x3c4;<sub>d </sub>is a diffusion time (s), and &#x3b3; is a dispersion parameter and satisfies 0.8&#x2264;&#x3b3;&#x2264;0.95.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0015">The negative electrode may have a diffusion time &#x3c4;<sub>d </sub>of the lithium ions of 0.020 seconds or longer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0016">The negative electrode may have a diffusion time &#x3c4;<sub>d </sub>of the lithium ions of 0.025 to 0.041 seconds.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0017">The negative electrode active material may include at least one carbon-based active material.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0018">The negative electrode active material layer may have a total pore volume of 0.20 to 0.23 cm<sup>3</sup>/g.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0019">The negative electrode active material layer may have a porosity of 20 to 30%.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0020">The negative electrode active material layer may have an average pore size (D50) of 550 to 800 nm.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0021">The negative electrode active material layer may have a loading amount of 6 to 15 g/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0022">The negative electrode active material layer may have a negative electrode density of 1.4 to 1.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0023">In another general aspect, a second battery includes: the negative electrode for a secondary battery; a positive electrode; a separator; and an electrolyte solution.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0024">Other features and aspects will be apparent from the following detailed description, the drawings, and the claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0025">The advantages and features of the present invention and methods accomplishing them will become apparent from exemplary embodiments described in detail with the accompanying drawings.

Throughout the present specification, unless explicitly described to the contrary, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; any components will be understood to imply further inclusion of other components rather than the exclusion of any other components.

The negative electrode includes: a current collector; and a negative electrode active material layer formed on the current collector and containing a negative electrode active material.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0029">The current collector may be selected from the group consisting of a copper foil, a nickel foil, a stainless steel foil, a titanium foil, a nickel foam, a copper foam, a polymer substrate coated with a conductive metal, and a combination thereof, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0030">The negative electrode active material layer may contain a negative electrode active material and a binder, and may further contain a conductive material.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0031">The negative electrode active material may include at least one carbon-based active material, and preferably may include at least two carbon-based active materials. For example, the negative electrode active material may be at least one carbon-based active material, and preferably may be at least two carbon-based active materials. Therefore, a coefficient of diffusion of lithium ions of the negative electrode of the present invention may be controlled.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0032">The carbon-based active material may include one or more selected from the group consisting of natural graphite, artificial graphite, graphitized carbon fibers, graphitized mesocarbon microbeads, and amorphous carbon, and may be preferably artificial graphite. In addition, the carbon-based active material may contain primary particles, and preferably may contain secondary particles formed by aggregation of two or more types of primary particles. Therefore, the coefficient of diffusion of lithium ions of the negative electrode of the present invention may be controlled in a preferred range.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0033">The carbon-based active material may have a coating layer formed on a surface of the particle and including amorphous carbon composed of soft carbon and/or hard carbon. Therefore, the coefficient of diffusion of lithium ions of the negative electrode of the present invention may be controlled in a preferred range.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0034">As an example, a method of producing the artificial graphite is as follows, but the present invention is not limited thereto. In general, artificial graphite particles may be obtained by mixing a graphitizable raw material (aggregate), a graphitization catalyst, and a binder for binding the graphitizable raw material and the graphitization catalyst, and performing pre-calcination and graphitization. As the graphitizable aggregate, various types of coke such as gold coke and needle coke may be used. In addition, natural graphite or artificial graphite that has already been graphitized may also be used. As the binder, petroleum, coal, artificial pitch, and tar may be used, and a material for graphitization like the aggregate is preferred. As the graphitization catalyst, carbide, oxide, and nitride of silicon, iron, nickel, titanium, boron, and the like may be used. It may be preferable that the pre-calcination and graphitization are performed in an atmosphere in which the aggregate and the binder are difficult to oxidize, for example, in a nitrogen atmosphere, an argon atmosphere, vacuum, or the like. It may be preferable that the pre-calcination is performed in a temperature range of 400 to 1,000&#xb0; C., and the graphitization is performed at a temperature of 2,000&#xb0; C. or higher. In the graphitization, as the graphitization catalyst is removed at a temperature of 2,000&#xb0; C. or higher, fine pores may be formed. In addition, it is more preferable that a graphitization temperature is 2,500&#xb0; C. or higher, and it is most preferable that the graphitization temperature is 2,800&#xb0; C. or higher because graphite having high crystallinity may be obtained. When the graphitization temperature is lower than 2,000&#xb0; C., development of graphite crystals is deteriorated and the graphitization catalyst remains in the produced graphite particles, such that a charge and discharge capacity tends to be reduced. In addition, it is preferable that the graphitization catalyst is added in an amount of 1 to 50 wt % with respect to the total weight of the graphitizable aggregate or the graphite and the binder. When the amount of graphitization catalyst added is less than 1 wt %, development of crystals of the artificial graphite particles is deteriorated, and the charge and discharge capacity tends to be reduced. Meanwhile, when the amount of graphitization catalyst added exceeds 50 wt %, it is difficult to uniformly mix the materials, and workability tends to be deteriorated. Since the artificial graphite obtained as described above is in a block state, it is preferable to pulverize the obtained artificial graphite. A pulverization method is not particularly limited, and devices such as a jet mill, a vibration mill, and a hammer mill may be used. It is preferable that an average particle size (D50) of the particles after the pulverization is 100 &#x3bc;m or less. In addition, when the average particle size is in a range of 10 to 50 &#x3bc;m, coatability is excellent, which may be more preferred. In addition, the powder after the pulverization may be subjected to cold isostatic pressing, if necessary, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0035">The negative electrode active material may further include a metal-based active material. The metal-based active material refers to an active material containing a metal, and in general, refers to an active material containing elements into which lithium may be inserted and having a theoretical electric capacity per unit mass of 500 mAh/g or more when lithium is inserted. Examples of the metal-based active material include lithium metal, a single metal capable of forming a lithium alloy (for example, Ag, Al, Ba, Bi, Cu, Ga, Ge, In, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, Si, Sn, Sr, Zn, Ti, or the like), and an alloy thereof, and oxide, sulfide, nitride, silicide, carbide, and phosphide of the metal or alloy.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0036">It is preferable that a silicon-based active material containing silicon is used as a metal-based negative electrode active material in terms of implementing a high capacity of the battery. Examples of the silicon-based active material include silicon (Si), an alloy of silicon and nickel, iron, aluminum, or the like, SiOx (0&#x3c;x&#x3c;2), a mixture of a Si-containing material and a carbon material, and a composite product of a Si-containing material and conductive carbon formed by coating or complexing a Si-containing material with conductive carbon.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0037">The binder may be a water-soluble binder. Specifically, the binder may be styrene-butadiene rubber, acrylated styrene-butadiene rubber, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate, a copolymer of propylene and an olefin having 2 to 8 carbon atoms, polyacrylamide, a copolymer of (meth)acrylic acid and (meth)acrylic acid alkyl ester, or a combination thereof. When the water-soluble binder is used as a negative electrode binder, the water-soluble binder may bind the electrode active material to the current collector well without affecting a viscosity of a slurry, which is preferred. However, the electrode slurry may be easily gelled due to the electrode active material and the conductive material that are fine particles. Therefore, the negative electrode active material layer may further contain a thickener for making a stable slurry by imparting the viscosity to the electrode slurry. As an example, a cellulose-based compound, specifically, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, or a mixture of one or more salts of alkali metals thereof may be used as the thickener. In this case, Na, K, or Li may be used as the alkali metal.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0038">The conductive material is used to impart conductivity to the negative electrode, and is not particularly limited as long as it is a conventional electronic conductive material that does not cause a chemical change in the battery. As an example, the conductive material may be natural graphite, artificial graphite, carbon black, acetylene black, Ketjen black, a carbon fiber, a carbon nanotube, and a combination thereof, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0039">The negative electrode may satisfy the following Relational Expression 1, and more preferably, may satisfy the following Relational Expression 2:</p><p id="p-0047" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>D&#x3c;</i>1.9&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;[Relational Expression 1]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0048" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>1&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup><i>&#x2264;D&#x3c;</i>1.9&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;[Relational Expression 2]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0049" num="0040">wherein D is a coefficient of diffusion of lithium ions in the negative electrode and may be derived from the following expression:</p><p id="p-0050" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>D=&#x3c3;</i><sup>2</sup>&#xb7;&#x3c4;<sub>d</sub><sup>&#x2212;&#x3b3;</sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0051" num="0000">wherein &#x3c3; is a thickness (cm) of the negative electrode active material layer, &#x3c4;<sub>d </sub>is a diffusion time constant (s), and &#x3b3; is a dispersion parameter and satisfies 0.8&#x2264;&#x3b3;&#x2264;0.95.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0041">In the negative electrode according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the coefficient of diffusion (D, cm<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;&#x3b3;</sup>) of Relational Expression 1 may represent a rate at which the lithium ions in the pores of the negative electrode are supplied based on a diffusion mechanism. The coefficient of diffusion is analyzed in a system (negative electrode/separator/negative electrode) in which charging and discharging are not performed.

A pore structure in a negative electrode may be more accurately evaluated through the coefficient of diffusion in comparison to the related art in which diffusion of lithium ions is evaluated in a chargeable and dischargeable system (a battery including a positive electrode/separator/negative electrode and an electrolyte solution).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0043">Specifically, the coefficient of diffusion (D) may be 1.1* 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2264;D&#x3c;1.9*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, 1.15*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2264;D&#x3c;1.9*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, 1.2*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2264;D&#x3c;1.9*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, or 1.5*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2264;D&#x3c;1.9*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, and specifically, may be 1*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2264;D&#x2264;1.85*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, 1*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2264;D&#x2264;1.8*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, 1*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2264;D&#x2264;1.5*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, 1*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2264;D&#x2264;1.4*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2264;D&#x2264;1.3*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, or 1*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>&#x2264;D&#x2264;1.2*10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. In the negative electrode implemented so that it has the same loading amount of the negative electrode active material layer and the same negative electrode density (the same pore volume) as the coefficient of diffusion is reduced to the above range, it is analyzed that as the diffusion time of the lithium ions is increased, the diffusion space (the length of the pore) is narrow and long. Accordingly, the pores are finely and uniformly formed in the electrode, such that the lithium ions may be uniformly supplied to the entire electrode, thereby improving high-output characteristics of the battery. The coefficient of diffusion is a value calculated in consideration of the diffusion time and the diffusion space, and it may be appreciated that in the case of the negative electrode having an appropriate range of the coefficient of diffusion as described above, the diffusion time is in a preferred range, and the pores are properly formed. However, a case where the coefficient of diffusion is excessively reduced may mean that the pores are too finely developed. In this case, since a path for diffusion of ions may be excessively long, diffusion resistance may be increased and output characteristics may be deteriorated.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0044">Various methods may be applied to produce the negative electrode active material layer having a coefficient of diffusion within the above range. For example, in a case where artificial graphite is used as an active material, a difference in physical properties such as hardness and strength of artificial graphite to be prepared may be implemented by changing the type of raw material, for example, coke. Therefore, pore characteristics of a negative electrode active material layer to be produced may be changed. For example, in a case of isotropic coke, a characteristic of relatively higher strength than that of needle coke may be considered. In addition, pore characteristics of a negative electrode active material layer to be produced may be changed by using a mixture of two or more types of active material particles having different average particle sizes (D50) or adjusting a mixing weight ratio of these active material particles. In addition, in a case where the surface of the active material includes a coating layer including amorphous carbon composed of soft carbon and/or hard carbon, the strength of the active material particle is increased, such that conditions advantageous for forming pores may be obtained. However, the present invention is not limited to the properties of the negative electrode active material and the method of producing the negative electrode active material.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0045">The thickness (&#x3c3;) of the negative electrode active material layer may refer to a thickness of the negative electrode active material layer measured after the produced negative electrode is immersed in an electrolyte solution and then stored at room temperature for 10 hours. As a thickness measurement method, the thickness of the negative electrode active material layer may be measured by subtracting a thickness of the foil from a thickness of the negative electrode using a thickness gauge, or a thickness of the negative electrode active material layer after peeling off the foil of the negative electrode may be measured, but the present invention is not limited thereto. In this case, as the electrolyte solution, for example, an electrolyte solution obtained by mixing a lithium salt (1.0 M LiPF<sub>6</sub>) with an organic solvent (ethylene carbonate (EC):ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)=1:4 vol %) and mixing 1 vol % of an electrolyte solution additive (fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)) may be used, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Meanwhile, in a case where the composition of the electrolyte solution is changed, although a movement speed of the ions may vary and the time for the ions to diffuse may vary due to the difference in electrolyte solution, it is analyzed that the tendency of the coefficient of diffusion (D) of the lithium ions shown in the present invention is not reversed or different results are not obtained. In this case, a degree of change in numerical range of the coefficient of diffusion (D) may be &#xb1;0.1 to 5%, which is the level of the error range.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0046">The diffusion time constant (&#x3c4;<sub>d</sub>) may be measured by Nyquist plotting and fitting data calculated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0047">The EIS may be performed with Biologic VMP3 device, and in this case, a frequency range from 500 Khz to 50 mhz may be applied, but the present invention is not limited thereto.

As the dispersion parameter (&#x3b3;) is close to 1, it means an ideal condition, and on the contrary, as the dispersion parameter (&#x3b3;) is close to 0, it means a non-ideal condition. In the case of the secondary battery system, it is limited only when the dispersion parameter has a value of 0.8 to 0.95. In the present invention, a value of 0.88 to 0.92 is applied as the dispersion parameter, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0049">The negative electrode according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may have a diffusion time (&#x3c4;<sub>d</sub>) of the lithium ions of 0.020 seconds (s) or longer, and more preferably may have a diffusion time (&#x3c4;<sub>d</sub>) of the lithium ions of 0.025 to 0.050 seconds (s). When the lithium ions diffuse in the electrode, the diffusion time is proportional to the volume (space or area formed by each pore structure in which the lithium ions may diffuse) formed in each pore structure path. When the diffusion time of the lithium ions is in the above range, it may be inferred that the pores are finely and densely formed. In a case where a negative electrode having the diffusion time of the lithium ions within the above range is produced, the effects described above may be implemented. On the other hand, when the diffusion time exceeds the above range, it means that the pores are excessively finely developed. Problems of deterioration of long-term performance that may occur due to an excessive reaction surface area may occur, and the diffusion resistance may be excessively increased.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0050">The negative electrode active material layer may have a total pore volume of 0.18 to 0.25 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, and preferably may have a total pore volume of 0.20 to 0.25 cm<sup>3</sup>/g or 0.20 to 0.23 cm<sup>3</sup>/g.

Similarly, as described above, the coefficient of diffusion may be different even when the standards of the active materials are the same. This is because the size, the shape (the spherical shape, the plate shape, the crushed shape, or the like), the density, the strength, and the properties of the raw material that comprehensively constitute the standard of the active material act in a complex manner to derive characteristics of the pores. Therefore, rather than defining the performance of the pores of the negative electrode active material layer with several factors of the active material, it is preferable to define the performance of the pores with the characteristics of the pores. In this case, it is more preferable to evaluate the characteristics of the pores by the coefficient of diffusion rather than the numerical range of each individual factor such as the total pore volume, the porosity, the average pore size, the specific surface area, the loading amount, or the negative electrode density of the negative electrode active material layer.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0057">Meanwhile, the total pore volume, the porosity, the average pore size, and the specific surface area of the negative electrode active material layer may be measured by a porosimeter method, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0058">Another exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a second battery including: the negative electrode; a positive electrode; a separator; and an electrolyte solution.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0059">The negative electrode is the same as described above.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0060">The positive electrode includes a current collector and a positive electrode active material layer formed by applying a positive electrode slurry containing a positive electrode active material to the current collector.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0061">The negative electrode current collector may be used as the current collector, and any material known in the art may be used.

Since the electrodes produced in Examples satisfied Relational Expression 1 of the present invention, it was analyzed that the rapid charging performance (high charge rate) was improved in the electrodes produced in Examples in comparison to the electrodes produced in Comparative Examples 1 to 4. On the other hand, in Comparative Examples 1 to 4 in which the pores having the same average pore size and pore volume were formed, the pores were non-uniformly formed, and thus, the negative electrodes did not satisfy Relational Expression 1 of the present invention.
