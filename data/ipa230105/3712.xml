id="p-0004" num="0003">The cannabinoids are a class of related C<sub>21 </sub>terpenophenolic chemical compounds that act on cannabinoid receptors. Chemically, cannabinoids as a class have tremendous structural variability and are divided into ten subclasses on the basis of shared structural features. The identifying structure of cannabinoids is a prenylated polyketide backbone resulting from the combination of a fatty acid with an isoprenoid. In many cases, this initial reaction involves olivetolic acid and geranyl diphosphate to produce cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) that serves as a precursor for cannabinoid subclasses. The subclasses are differentiated by cyclization by a specific oxidocyclase that acts on CBGA to form the resulting cannabinoid acid. At least one additional mechanism has been identified for biosynthesis of phytocannabinoids in <i>Cannabis</i>. The propyl cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), are identified by the presence of a C3 side chain instead of a C5 side chain and synthesized from a divarinic acid precursor. Unique varieties within the subclasses are identified by chemical group at certain side chains (Brenneisen, R., <i>Marijuana and the Cannabinoids Forensic Science and Medicine. </i>2007). While mammals naturally produce endocannabinoids, phytocannabinoids produced by plants of the genus <i>Cannabis </i>have been used for their medicinal and psychoactive properties for millennia. In concert with other <i>Cannabis </i>biomolecules, cannabinoids interact with receptors in the human body to produce an &#x201c;entourage effect&#x201d; with an immense variety of possible physiological outcomes (Russo, 2019). As an alternative to the whole-plant entourage effect, there has been much energy and effort placed upon isolating individual cannabinoids.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has received renewed interest as novel roles for individual cannabinoids in appetite, neurology, pain, inflammation, and other responses have been identified. Interest in the ECS has driven further investigation for novel cannabinoids isolated from <i>Cannabis</i>. There are differences in the effects of these cannabinoids, and most of these differences are not yet fully characterized, indicating a lack of understanding of their mechanisms of action and the pathways that regulate the ECS. The classical cannabinoid receptors are the G-protein couple receptors (GPCRs), CB1 and CB2, and have been studied in the greatest detail. Additional receptors having an affinity for cannabinoids have been identified including orphan GPCRs (GPR3, GPR6, GPR12 (Laun, 2019); GPR18, GPR55, GPR119 (Ramirez-Oroxco, 2019)) and the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel TRPV1 (Muller, et al. <i>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience </i>2019).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The most notable phytocannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in <i>Cannabis</i>, and cannabidiol (CBD). Each of these cannabinoids has already become an industry unto itself, as reflected by the variety of products incorporating them, the number of companies formed to commercialize these products, the investments in such products and companies have attracted, and the revenues they have yielded in competitive markets. A few other &#x201c;minor cannabinoids&#x201d; have been isolated and are being characterized in terms of their physiological effects, and each of them also promises to spawn further massive industrial activity and medical insights. The extensive cultivation of <i>Cannabis </i>has led to the development of numerous genetic variants (genovars) within the species. These genovars have been selected over time for specific phenotypic traits including cannabinoid production. The heredity of cannabinoids is attributable to the inheritance of specific cannabinoid acid synthases that catalyze the enzymatic processes for cannabinoid production. The primary known cannabinoid synthases are THCA synthase (THCAS) and CBDA synthase (CBDAS) producing the cannabinoid acid forms of THC and CBD, respectively. Genetic studies have suggested that additional genes may regulate the total cannabinoid production and specific chemovars produced (Weiblen, 2015). To date, there are at least 113 different known cannabinoids. However, only a small fraction of these have been isolated in sufficient amounts and with sufficient purity to permit their characterization in terms of their receptor activation and/or their physiological effects.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Methods of screening samples for cannabinoids are provided.

If multiple compositions are used in a method, the multiple compositions can be plant extracts, and each of the multiple compositions can be a plant extract from a different part of the same plant. The plant extract can be an extract from any plant tissue including, but not limited to, flower trichomes, root, young plant, seedling, trichomes from other parts of plant that are not flower, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the cannabinoid in the methods described can be a minor or an unknown cannabinoid. A cannabinoid not previously isolated, purified, and studied for its effects can be referred to as a &#x201c;new&#x201d; cannabinoid even if such cannabinoid had been previously identified, named and structurally characterized. The properties that define whether a cannabinoid is new or unknown are the properties of availability in some sort of commercial scale and understanding of the physiological, neurological, psychoactive, and/or pharmacological effects of the new cannabinoid, alone or in combination with other cannabinoids and/or other components of a plant such as, but not limited to, terpenes and flavonoids.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the cannabinoid-activated receptor in the methods described above can be CB1, CB2, GPR18, GPR55, GPR119, TRPV1 or any other receptor activated known to be activated by a cannabinoid. Receptors can also include non-CB1/CB2 receptors or orphan GPCRs with limited sequence homology to CB1/CB2 such as GPR3, GPR6, GPR12, GPR18, GPR35, and GPR55. Receptors can also include some well-established GPCRs like the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A, alph2-adrenoceptor, opioid receptors, transient receptor potential channels (TRPV1-4, TRPM8, TRPA1), and PPARg for testing possible cross-talks with CB1/CB2 receptors and off-target activity.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the measured characteristic in the methods described above can be a binding affinity of the composition to the receptor, a change in intracellular levels indicative of activation of the cannabinoid-activated receptor, a change in a secondary messenger indicative of activation of the cannabinoid receptor, phosphorylation of a molecule indicated of activation of the cannabinoid-activated receptor and/or the like. The characteristic is any cellular, physiological, genetic, regulatory, or chemical characteristic that is changed by the presence of a cannabinoid.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the characteristic is the intracellular concentration of cAMP, Ca2+, or any other molecule whose concentration is changed by the presence of a cannabinoid.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the characteristic is phosphorylation of a molecule that is changed by the presence of a cannabinoid.

A reporter gene can be synthesized in response to activation of a specific signaling cascade, followed by monitoring the activity of reporter gene expression. A luciferase reporter gene assay platform can be used as high throughput homogenous assay for screening GPCR targets due to its high sensitivity and reliability. The CB1/CB2 and related GPCRs and other orphan receptors couple to multiple G proteins that regulate respective downstream signaling pathways which eventually induce reporter gene transcription by various response elements such as CRE, NFAT, SRE, etc.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the extracting step can include purifying one or more cannabinoid-containing fractions obtained from plant tissue employing separations techniques known in the art such as, for example, chromatography, isoelectric separations, dialysis, filtration, ultrafiltration, salting-out, differential centrifugation, and the like; testing aliquots from fractionated samples to determine which fraction contains a cannabinoid; further isolation of cannabinoid and confirmation of signaling profile after extraction; and/or using an extracted portion verified to be containing cannabinoid for further fractionation and/or purification and/or characterization studies of properties of the cannabinoid.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the methods described above can include isolating the cannabinoid in purified or semi-purified form. After isolation, the method can include testing the isolated cannabinoid for activity. The testing can include receptor-binding assays, biochemical studies, and cellular and/or organism-level studies in any of a number of model systems including mammalian systems, or any other assay that can elucidate and/or confirm activity.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, the testing can include propagating a plant as a clone; preparing extracts in larger scale, wherein the extracts correspond to the fraction(s) originally found to contain receptor-activation activity; providing cells expressing at least one cannabinoid-activated receptor; adding the composition to the cells to verify that the signaling profile matches or corresponds to the initial result. The testing can also include performing DNA sequencing on the clone to identify a gene for unknown/minor/new cannabinoid.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, the testing can include administering the cannabinoid to mammalian cells; measuring characteristics of cells within organoid culture system relating to cannabinoid signal transduction; isolating total RNA from organoid culture to identify upregulated genes in response to cannabinoid administration. In some embodiments, the testing can include administering the novel cannabinoid to an animal model; measuring characteristics of cells within animal neural or other target tissue relating to cannabinoid signal transduction; isolating total RNA from animal tissues to identify upregulated genes in response to cannabinoid administration.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The testing can also include combining the cannabinoid with additional ingredients to screen for the potential of the cannabinoid and the one or more additional ingredients to work synergistically or as allosteric modulators. In such tests, one or more additional ingredients can be added to the composition and tested as described above.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the method described above can include further testing and/or characterization of the cannabinoid. The further characterization can include mass spectrometry or any other method to characterize structure.

The methods can include the establishment of high-throughput biochemical and molecular biology protocols for measuring the interaction with known cannabinoid receptors to generate a signal profile for individual cannabinoids, generation of a classification system for cannabinoids, identification of cannabinoids present in whole plants and specific tissues of plants, breeding and/or propagation of plants containing novel/minor cannabinoids for further characterization, and assays to establish the impact and physiological functions of cannabinoids interacting with mammalian cells expressing the target(s) of interest.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The cannabinoid in the methods described can be a minor or an unknown cannabinoid. A cannabinoid not previously isolated, purified, and studied for its effects can be referred to as a &#x201c;novel&#x201d; or &#x201c;new&#x201d; cannabinoid even if such cannabinoid had been previously identified, named and structurally characterized but had no any published biological effects at known cannabinoid-activated receptors. The properties that define whether a cannabinoid is new or unknown are the properties of availability in some sort of commercial scale and understanding of the physiological, neurological, psychoactive, and/or pharmacological effects of the new cannabinoid, alone or in combination with other cannabinoids and/or other components of a plant such as, but not limited to, terpenes and flavonoids.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The invention detailed herein relates to methodology to describe the individual interactions for cannabinoids and establish a system (an integrated database platform) for identification and classification of novel or minor cannabinoids extracted from plant material.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Methods of screening a composition for the presence of a cannabinoid are provided. The method can include contacting the composition or a fraction thereof to cells expressing at least one cannabinoid-activatable receptor or putative cannabinoid receptor or a related receptor, and measuring a characteristic of the cells in the presence of the composition, where the characteristic results from an interaction between the composition and at least one of the receptors and is indicative of the presence of a cannabinoid. The characteristics of the cells that are to be measured can be defined as cellular processes that are activated in response to the composition interacting with a cannabinoid receptor in an allosteric, inverse, agonistic or antagonistic manner. These can be intracellular processes. These include but are not limited to phosphorylation of intracellular secondary messenger proteins, release of intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) stores, or release or synthesis of intracellular secondary messenger proteins.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Using the method described above, some embodiments of the invention relate to a high-throughput method of screening a composition for the presence of a cannabinoid using multiple compositions with multiple groups of cells. For example, the method can include using 1, 2, 3, 4, or more groups of cells each expressing a different cannabinoid-activatable receptor. One or more multiple compositions can be tested at once with all the groups of cells. In other embodiments, the method can involve one or more single cell lines co-expressing multiple relevant receptors and can, for example, be run in multiplexed format.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Some embodiments of the invention relate to a method of isolating a cannabinoid from a plant or screening a plant for the presence of a cannabinoid. The method can include extracting a composition from the plant or from a selected plant tissue, optionally fractionating the extract thus produced to form one or more composition fractions, and contacting cells expressing at least one cannabinoid-activated receptor with the composition and/or fraction(s), and measuring a characteristic of the cells in the presence of the composition, where the characteristic results from or is indicative of an interaction between the composition and at least one of the receptors and is indicative of the presence of a cannabinoid. If the presence of a cannabinoid is indicated, then it can be determined that the extract or fraction contained a cannabinoid and further analysis and use of conventional biochemistry techniques can lead to isolation of the cannabinoid. The isolated cannabinoid can be further concentrated, purified, characterized and tested. Depending on the characterization and testing of the cannabinoid, the plant from which it was extracted may be selected for breeding purposes (i.e., to breed a plant that produces a novel or minor cannabinoid or any cannabinoid with a desired activity profile).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further testing can include testing the cannabinoid(s) for potential therapeutic application. For example, the cannabinoid(s) can be tested for anti-cancer activity on a panel of human cancer cell lines (endogenously expressing cannabinoid related receptors) by measuring cell viability and cytotoxicity or anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects on microglia and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Some embodiments of the invention relate to a method of breeding a new plant variety based on the finding of (a) cannabinoid(s) in the methods described above. The method can include extracting a composition or compositions from a potential plant suitable for breeding and analyzing the composition or compositions using the methods described above. The method can also include breeding to obtain additional genetic combinations related to the cultivar in which the new cannabinoid was found, and screening multiple individuals from the breeding to identify one or more individuals expressing a higher amount of the new cannabinoid. Such breeding, screening, and selection can be continued according to conventional plant-breeding protocols and/or guided by non-traditional methods as well as molecular-biology methods, with the goal being the development of one or more cultivars expressing quantities of the new cannabinoid that are sufficient to enable practical and cost-effective extraction and study of the new cannabinoid. In some embodiments, breeding can include the use of genetic markers associated with desirable traits. Such marker-assisted breeding is known in the art, and selection of appropriate markers based upon desired traits is within the level of those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In other embodiments, enhancement of expression and/or accumulation of a given minor or rare cannabinoid can require or be aided by molecular approaches. These include but are not limited to identification of a gene associated with expression level of a given cannabinoid and manipulating the expression of the gene by such approaches as increasing copy number, promoter modification, suppressor removal, elevation of expression of genes involved in accumulation of biosynthetic precursor molecules, depressing the expression of genes associated with biosynthesis of other cannabinoids that would otherwise act as a drain on precursor molecules, and the like. In still other embodiments, enhancement and/or accumulation of a given minor or rare cannabinoid can involve use of gene-editing tools such as, for example, CRISPR-Cas9 constructs, to directly elevate gene expression or otherwise facilitate biosynthesis and accumulation of the desired cannabinoid or group of cannabinoids.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Some embodiments of the invention relate to a method of classifying a cannabinoid or creating a classification system using the methods described above to create a signaling profile unique to the cannabinoid. The signaling profile can be used to create a reference library by assigning a reference value (e.g. the potency and/or efficacy) based on a known cannabinoid to the signaling profile and adding the reference value to a reference library. The reference library can be organized based on each signaling profile reference value to create a database of profiles of known cannabinoids.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With such an established library, a composition can be screened for cannabinoid-like activity by, for example, plotting relative signaling profiles to establish correlation. Correlation can be for pathway-specific or biased activation, etc. This database can be used to further facilitate identification and characterization of a heretofore unknown or uncharacterized cannabinoid. In some embodiments, this classification and organization of information can be enhanced with machine learning/artificial intelligence to generate predictive results as to the function, receptor targets, or other properties of a new/rare/unknown cannabinoid, as well as interactions between or among cannabinoids.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The methods disclosed herein can be oriented towards the discovery and molecular characterization of minor, unknown, or new cannabinoids and/or receptors. The methods disclosed herein can also be oriented towards selecting plants for breeding based on cannabinoid levels or cannabinoid activity. The methods disclosed herein further can be oriented towards establishing a way to classify cannabinoids, such as a library. The methods and/or the library can be useful for identifying and characterizing new or minor cannabinoids and/or identifying plants that produce new or minor cannabinoids and/or selecting plants for breeding based on cannabinoid levels, cannabinoid activity, cannabinoid activity profiles, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The methods and/or library can also be useful for identifying potential therapeutic applications of the new or minor cannabinoids. Examples of potential applications include, but are not limited to control of appetite, treatment/prevention of cancer, treatment/prevention of pain, treatment/prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, and/or the like.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Compositions</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The composition disclosed in this application can be any composition that can include a cannabinoid. The composition can be a plant extract. The plant extract can be an extract from a plant tissue such as whole flower, flower trichomes, root, young plant or portions thereof, leaves generally or certain types of leaves, meristems, seedling, trichomes from other parts of plant that are not flower, any tissue of the plant at any developmental stage, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The composition can also include the addition of one or more additional ingredients that may act as an allosteric modulator(s) or otherwise act synergistically with a cannabinoid in the composition. The one or more additional ingredients can include but are not limited to terpenes and flavonoids. Likewise, the receptor-based approach to detecting new ligands and characterizing the molecular and/or physiological effects of a given plant or extract from a plant can be extended to receptors for which terpenes, flavonoids, and other receptor ligands produced by the plant. As such, the techniques and approaches described herein can lead to numerous advances in understanding and characterizing the so-called &#x201c;entourage effect&#x201d; at molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. Any or all of these approaches can be combined with tools and techniques such as the use of organoids and/or machine learning to enhance the effectiveness and rate of progress toward the goal of fully understanding the function and potential of any given cannabinoid as well as the interactions of cannabinoids and other classes of plant molecules at the receptor level as well as in terms of gene regulation and downstream effects on cells and on organism physiology.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Receptors</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The receptors used in the methods disclosed herein can be any receptor that is activated by one or more cannabinoid, directly or indirectly. For example, the receptor can be CB1, CB2, GPR18, GPR55, GPR119, TRPV1, and/or any other cannabinoid-activatable receptor. For example, the receptor can be constitutively active orphan GRP3, GPR6 and GPR12 or some but not limited to functional heteromers of CB1/CB2, CB2/GPR18, and CB2/GPR55 (Morales, 2017). Some of the receptors can be tested simultaneously in multiplexed format and some form functional heteromers that can be tested as unique receptor complexes in the same way disclosed in the methods.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Receptor Activity</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Receptor activity can be based on any response in the cells that indicates receptor activation. For example, CB1, CB2 are GPCRs and their signaling pathways are known. Measurements of any of the known changes can be taken. Examples include changes in intracellular levels of various messengers or other components associated with messaging and/or receptor activation, changes in a secondary messenger activity, phosphorylation of a molecule, and/or the like. For example, intracellular levels of cAMP and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be measured. For example, p38-MAPK phosphorylation and pERK can also be measured. Likewise, reporter gene activation and related techniques can be employed to detect receptor activation and downstream signal transduction effects.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Binding Affinity</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Binding affinity of the cannabinoid or suspected cannabinoid can also be analyzed using methods and tools known in the art.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Extraction</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Compositions can be extracted from plants using methods known in the art. Extraction protocols can be selected that are suitable to the tissue from which the compositions are to be extracted. Extraction outcomes and extracts analyzed can range from crude extracts to extracts having passed through any of various separation and purification steps. In <i>Cannabis</i>, since cannabinoids are biosynthesized in the acid forms (THCA, CBDA etc.) which are usually less potent or inactive, suitable extraction protocols and efficient decarboxylation methods can be employed for optimal receptor responses (Lewis-Bakker, 2019). These conditions can differ for each <i>Cannabis </i>cultivar.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Purification</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Once a composition is identified as containing a cannabinoid, the cannabinoid can be further concentrated and purified by methods known in the art. Such methods can be adapted to the chemistry of a given cannabinoid. Separations and subfractionation techniques can employ any combination of chromatography, differential centrifugation, solvent/aqueous phase extraction, filtration, affinity extraction, and the like. One option is to separate an extract at any stage into aliquots containing molecular sub-populations having different properties, whether the differences be molecular weight, polarity, affinity, or the like. Testing aliquots from a fractionated extract can indicate which fraction contains a cannabinoid. After the cannabinoid is identified in a given aliquot, the properties of that aliquot can suggest further steps for larger-scale concentration or purification of the cannabinoid. In addition, further testing of receptor activation, chemical composition, chemical structure, and the like, can be done to confirm isolation and some of the properties of the isolated cannabinoid.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Characterization</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The structure of the cannabinoid can be determined by methods know in the art such as mass spectrometry, including MS techniques such as MALDI-TOF. The expression of cannabinoid synthases can also be assessed using DNA sequencing to compare gene expression at loci associated with production of specific cannabinoids. Cannabinoid synthases carry out the enzymatic processes to produce cannabinoids. The primary known cannabinoid synthases are THCA synthase (THCAS) and CBDA synthase (CBDAS) producing the cannabinoid acid forms of THC and CBD, respectively. Research has shown that genes associated with the cannabinoid synthesis pathway are distributed across the <i>Cannabis </i>genome. THCAS and CBDAS are differentially expressed in genovars with cannabinoid chemotype differences and there is evidence of gene duplication for cannabinoid synthase in the <i>Cannabis </i>lineage. The established genetic mapping of THCAS and CBDAS will allow for investigation of genetic variations at these loci associated production of novel or minor cannabinoids using similar sequencing methods. This sequence analysis allows identification of potential novel cannabinoid synthases with the identification of novel or minor cannabinoids. Other cannabinoid synthases and enzymes acting at other steps in cannabinoid biosynthesis are also known and are also available for use in these embodiments of the invention.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Mammalian Studies</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Known or new cannabinoids can be tested in mammalian cells, animal models, and volunteer human subjects to determine potential therapeutic and/or clinical uses. Notwithstanding the fact that no person has ever been documented to suffer a lethal overdose of <i>Cannabis</i>, appropriate safety and dosing protocols can be established at the outset of such testing in volunteer human subjects.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 1&#x2014;High-Throughput Screening of Cannabinoids and Establishment of Database of Cannabinoid-Response Profiles</heading><heading id="h-0017" level="2">A) Establishment of Cell Line Stably Expressing Cannabinoid Receptor(s).</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0048">HEK293 cells are cultured at 37&#xb0; C. 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Standard Growth Medium) for 7 days with regular passaging at 70% confluency.
