Inkjet printing is applied not only in a field of document printing in which ink is placed on paper, such as documents or flyers, but also in a process of manufacturing various articles. Specifically, the inkjet printing method is applied to a manufacturing process that requires a solution process for positioning a solution at a specific location.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, the application of inkjet printing is increased in a semiconductor or display field where a complex shape pattern is formed on a substrate or ink must be precisely discharged only at a specific location.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The inkjet printing is performed to spray ink in the form of droplets through nozzles, and when the number of nozzles included in an inkjet head where printing is performed is large, the solution process can be performed over a wide range at once. The conventional inkjet printer developed for a purpose of printing documents has a limited number of the nozzles and the amount of ink used is not large according to the purpose. Therefore, the conventional inkjet printer has a form of storing ink in the inkjet head discharging ink droplets.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, a large-sized document printer that continuously prints a large amount of documents or an industrial inkjet printer for performing the solution process has relatively more nozzles and uses a large amount of ink. Accordingly, a structure for storing ink in an ink reservoir provided separately from the inkjet head is applied to the inkjet printer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, it is important to discharge a correct amount of ink in the form of droplets at a correct location for the inkjet printer, and the discharge on a correct location is an important feature in the industrial inkjet printer and is treated as particularly important feature in the semiconductor and display field, where increasingly precise parts are required.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to discharge the correct amount of ink during the inkjet printing process, the ink in a ready state for discharge from the inkjet head should maintain the meniscus, which is a curved surface state in which the ink is concave inward by the capillary with respect to a nozzles inlet. For the meniscus, the ink reservoir is located higher than that of the inkjet head, but negative pressure is generated inside the ink reservoir, thereby preventing the ink from flowing from the inkjet head and maintaining the meniscus. However, due to a difference in viscosity of ink, it is insufficient to maintain the meniscus by simply generating the negative pressure inside the ink reservoir.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Specifically, the process of discharging ink in the form of droplets is affected by surface tension and viscosity of ink. The viscosity is related to how easily the ink flows through a head channel and is squeezed out of the nozzles, and the surface tension is related to how optimally the ink can form round droplets, so the viscosity and the surface tension are important in the inkjet printing. Ohnesorge number (Oh) is a dimensionless number that relates the viscosity to inertia and the surface tension as defined by Wolfgang von Ohnesorge, and is used by defining a constant Z, which determines a discharge property of ink, in the form of 1/Oh.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>O</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>h</mi>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <mi>&#x3bc;</mi>   <msqrt>    <mrow>     <mi>&#x3c1;&#x3c3;</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>L</mi>    </mrow>   </msqrt>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">&#x3bc; is dynamic viscosity of liquid, &#x3c1; is density of the liquid, &#x3c3; is the surface tension, and L is a characteristic length measure (typically, a diameter of a droplet). A window in which inkjet printing can be performed may be derived by reflecting the characteristics of the liquid as described above and a falling speed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram showing obtaining a liquid window applied to the inkjet printing by using Oh.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">In response to the characteristics of the liquid as described above and the falling speed, a position of a red circle is determined, and a window indicated in green in the drawing is the window that can be applied in the inkjet printing. When the position deviates from the green region, printing is not possible due to being too viscous or satellite droplets are formed with the droplets, resulting in poor quality.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">Therefore, it is desirable to consider Oh in the process of composing ink, but since ink of the industrial inkjet printer is mainly composed for the purpose of manufacturing, the position may deviate from the range shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.

However, the embodiment has the configuration of circulating ink between the inkjet head <b>100</b> and the ink reservoir <b>200</b> in the inkjet printer, so that ink is supplied to the inkjet head <b>100</b> while maintaining the dispersibility and homogeneity of the ink.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As the use of the inkjet printer is increasing in industrial fields such as manufacturing and the fields of application of the inkjet printer such as the manufacture of semiconductors and display products are recently diversifying, the case of using ink in which particles are dispersed, such as applying ink in which metal particles are dispersed for electrode patterns is increasing.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In particular, in the field of OLED display, inkjet printing has been attempted for the purpose of applying quantum dot materials only to a predetermined pattern or predetermined position while using the quantum dot materials. However, the dispersibility may be lowered, such as metal particles or quantum dot materials stored in the ink reservoir sink by their own weight. In the structure supplying ink in one direction from the ink reservoir <b>200</b> to the inkjet head <b>100</b>, the dispersibility of the ink is lowered as the amount of time the ink stays is increased. Therefore, ink is initially discharged in a state in which a relatively large number of particles are included in a droplet, and as time passes, the particles included in the droplet are decreased, so that the quality of inkjet printing may be lowered.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In order to solve the problems, the inkjet printer of the present disclosure is configured to have a circulation structure having a supply channel <b>110</b> supplying ink from the ink reservoir <b>200</b> to the inkjet head <b>100</b> and a recovery channel <b>120</b> recovering ink remaining in the inkjet head <b>100</b> to the ink reservoir <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The inkjet printer of the present disclosure is configured to move ink to prevent the ink from stagnating by the supply channel <b>110</b> and the recovery channel <b>120</b>, so that the dispersibility of ink can be maintained.

As the gravitational spontaneous filling is performed, generation of bubbles generated in the inkjet head <b>100</b> and the paths is reduced and the generated bubbles may be removed while being moved without stagnating. Herein, the check valve of the circulation pump has a problem of interfering with the spontaneous filling.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the embodiment, the bypass channel <b>140</b> is separately provided, so that ink may be moved without passing through the circulation pump <b>130</b> when the gravitational spontaneous filling is performed.
