level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to European patent application No. 19213035.9 filed on Dec. 3, 2019, the whole content of this application being incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electrolyte composition comprising a combination of a fluorinated acyclic ester compound, and a fluorinated cyclic carbonate compound.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This electrolyte composition is useful in electrochemical cells, such as lithium ion batteries, especially those containing silicon and its derivatives as an anode material.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lithium-ion batteries are a leading battery technology, since they offer efficient and high energy storage as well as high power density, and thus, they dominate the market for batteries used in portable electronic devices. However, large-scale applications like stationary energy storage and electric vehicles still require further improvement of the existing technology in terms of energy density, supplied power and cycle life.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of silicon as an anode material for lithium ion batteries has attracted tremendous attention because of its high theoretical specific capacity (3580 mAh/g, nearly ten times higher than the typical graphite anode material, 372 mAh/g), appropriate lithium intercalation voltage and cost competency. One drawback of silicon as anode material is its large volume expansion during cycling (more than 300%), which causes cracking and pulverization of silicon particles resulting in sluggish kinetics and a poor cycle life because of the loss of active material and poor electrical contact.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The use of silicon in a composite with other elements leads to a composite material showing lower anode capacity values than using pure silicon alone, but it shows better capacity retention with good cycle life. Representative silicon composite materials are silicon-carbon (Si/C) and silicon oxide-carbon (SiO<sub>a</sub>/C, wherein 0&#x3c;a&#x3c;2). Carbon can be regarded as a diluent/buffer which mitigates the total volume expansion of the silicon composite material. This solution has gained a lot of popularity among researchers and battery manufacturers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The use of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as an electrolyte component introduced to carbon coated porous Si anodes has been reported by Myung-Jin Chun, Hyungmin Park, Soojin Park and Nam-Soon Choi, RSC Adv., 2013, 3, 21320. Cycling performance at temperatures of 30&#xb0; C. and 60&#xb0; C. was improved. However, FEC decomposes more rapidly at temperatures above ambient temperature. The first consequence is that the addition of FEC is not efficient enough for improving high temperature cycling. The second consequence is that FEC generates gases when decomposing that could create a swelling issue.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, it is highly desirable to provide an electrolyte composition that will improve the cycle performance of a lithium ion battery, especially a lithium ion battery containing silicon carbon composite as an anode material. A technological need is the improvement of the cycle performance at high temperature (typically 45&#xb0; C.) while maintaining the cycle performance at ambient temperature (typically 25&#xb0; C.) should be maintained.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The international patent application WO 2013/033579 discloses electrolyte compositions containing 2,2-difluoroethyl acetate and ethylene carbonate, which are useful in electrochemical cells, such as lithium ion batteries. Said claimed electrolyte solvents may provide improved cycling performance at high temperature when used in a lithium ion battery, particularly such a battery that operates at high voltage. However, according to this application, all or at least a substantial part of the solvent should be replaced by the claimed solvent mixture comprising ethylene carbonate and 2,2-difluoroethyl acetate, which might not be possible.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Similarly, Japanese patent applications JP 2018-092785 and JP 2018-101612 both aim to provide an electrolytic solution that improves the life characteristics of a lithium ion secondary battery. While they both disclose the use of an electrolyte formulation containing a fluorinated carboxylic acid ester compound in combination with lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, the amount of fluorinated carboxylic acid ester compound should be high.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The patent application US 2014/017572 also aims to provide a lithium ion secondary battery which has an excellent cycle property and which has small volume increase, even in high-temperature environment. For this purpose, it discloses a lithium ion secondary battery, comprising a silicon-containing anode and an electrolyte liquid comprising a mixture of a certain chain-type fluorinated ester compound and a certain chain-type fluorinated ether compound. It is believed that further improvements are possible.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">One subject-matter of the invention is an electrochemical cell comprising an anode, a cathode and an electrolyte composition, wherein said anode comprises as an anode active material a combination of at least a carbon material and a silicon material; and said electrolyte composition comprises:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">a solvent;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0014">from 0.5 wt. % to 70 wt. %, based on the total weight of the electrolyte, of a fluorinated acyclic carboxylic acid ester compound of general formula</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>R<sup>1</sup>&#x2014;COO&#x2014;R<sup>2 </sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0015" num="0000">wherein R<sup>1 </sup>is a C1-C4 alkyl group, and R<sup>2 </sup>is C1-C4 fluoroalkyl group,<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0015">from 0.5 wt. % to 10 wt. %, based on the total weight of the electrolyte, of a fluorinated cyclic carbonate compound; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0016">an electrolyte salt.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">In another aspect, there is disclosed an electronic device, transportation device, or telecommunications device, comprising an electrochemical cell as defined above.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">In addition, another subject-matter of the present invention is the use of a combination of:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0019">from 0.5 wt. % to 70 wt. %, based on the total weight of the electrolyte, of a fluorinated acyclic carboxylic acid ester compound of general formula</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0018" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>R<sup>1</sup>&#x2014;COO&#x2014;R<sup>2 </sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0019" num="0000">wherein R<sup>1 </sup>is a C1-C4 alkyl group, and R<sup>2 </sup>is C1-C4 fluoroalkyl group,<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0020">from 0.5 wt. % to 10 wt. %, based on the total weight of the electrolyte, of a fluorinated cyclic carbonate compound,</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0021">as an additive in an electrolyte composition, to improve the cycling performance at high temperature of an electrochemical cell comprising, as an anode active material, a combination of at least a carbon material and a silicon material.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE(S)</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the cycling performance of the cells containing the electrolyte formulations of the examples at room temperature (25&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> show the cycling performance of the cells containing the electrolyte formulations of the examples at high temperature (45&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the thickness after storage at 60&#xb0; C. of the cells according to the examples.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows DC-IR (initial and after 4 weeks of storage at 60&#xb0; C.) of the cells according to the examples.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0026">The term &#x201c;alkyl group&#x201d;, as used herein and except otherwise specified, refers to linear or branched, straight or cyclic hydrocarbon groups containing from 1 to 20 carbons, preferably from 1 to 6 carbons, more preferably from 1 to 4 carbons, and containing no unsaturation. Examples of straight chain alkyl radicals include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, and dodecyl. Examples of branched chain isomers of straight chain alkyl groups include isopropyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl, sec-butyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, isohexyl, neohexyl, and isooctyl. Examples of cyclic alkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">The term &#x201c;fluoroalkyl group&#x201d;, as used herein and except otherwise specified, refers to an alkyl group wherein at least one hydrogen is replaced by fluorine.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">The term &#x201c;alkenyl group&#x201d;, as used herein and except otherwise specified, refers to linear or branched, straight or cyclic groups as described with respect to alkyl group as defined herein, except that at least one double bond exists between two carbon atoms. Examples of alkenyl groups include vinyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexadienyl, and butadienyl.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">The term &#x201c;alkynyl group&#x201d;, as used herein and except otherwise specified, refers to linear or branched, straight or cyclic groups as described with respect to alkyl group as defined herein, except that at least one triple bond exists between two carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">Unless otherwise specified, all percentages are percentages by weight and are based on the total weight of the electrolyte composition.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">The equilibrium potential between lithium and lithium ion is the potential of a reference electrode using lithium metal in contact with the electrolyte composition containing lithium salt at a concentration sufficient to give about 1 mole/liter of lithium ion concentration, and subjected to sufficiently small currents so that the potential of the reference electrode is not significantly altered from its equilibrium value (Li/Li<sup>+</sup>). The potential of such a Li/Li<sup>+</sup> reference electrode is assigned here the value of 0.0V. Potential of an anode or cathode means the potential difference between the anode or cathode and that of a Li/Li<sup>+</sup> reference electrode. Herein voltage means the voltage difference between the cathode and the anode of a cell, neither electrode of which may be operating at a potential of 0.0V.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">The term &#x201c;SEI&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a solid electrolyte interphase layer formed on the active material of an electrode. A lithium-ion secondary electrochemical cell is assembled in an uncharged state and must be charged (a process called formation) for use. During the first few charging events (battery formation) of a lithium-ion secondary electrochemical cell, components of the electrolyte are reduced or otherwise decomposed or incorporated onto the surface of the negative active material and oxidized or otherwise decomposed or incorporated onto the surface of the positive active material, electrochemically forming a solid-electrolyte interphase on the active materials. These layers, which are electrically insulating but ionically conducting, help prevent decomposition of the electrolyte and can extend the cycle life and improve the performance of the battery. On the anode, the SEI can suppress the reductive decomposition of the electrolyte; on the cathode, the SEI can suppress the oxidation of the electrolyte components.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033">One subject-matter of the invention is an electrochemical cell comprising an anode, a cathode and an electrolyte composition.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">The term &#x201c;electrochemical cell&#x201d; refers to the basic functional unit that is a source of electric energy obtained by direct conversion of chemical energy. Typically, the electrochemical cell may comprise or consist of a housing, an anode and a cathode disposed in the housing and in ionically conductive contact with one another, an electrolyte composition disposed in the housing and providing an ionically conductive pathway between the anode and the cathode; and a porous separator between the anode and the cathode.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">In a preferred embodiment, the electrochemical cell is a lithium ion battery.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">The term &#x201c;lithium ion battery&#x201d; refers to a type of rechargeable battery in which lithium ions move from the anode to the cathode during discharge and from the cathode to the anode during charge.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">The housing may be any suitable container to house the electrochemical cell components. Housing materials are well-known in the art and can include, for example, metal and polymeric housings. While the shape of the housings is not particularly important, suitable housings can be fabricated in the shape of a cylinder, a prismatic case or a pouch.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">The porous separator serves to prevent short circuiting between the anode and the cathode. The porous separator typically consists of a single-ply or multi-ply sheet of a microporous material such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, polyimide, glass fiber, non-woven cellulous or a combination thereof.
