All pieces of data operation information of the past are held by the plurality of servers. Specific examples of a data operation are data registration and data update. Hence, the distributed ledger has a characteristic that it enables servers to easily monitor data tampering and the like of each other. An example of the distributed ledger is a blockchain. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that generates a unit of data called a &#x201c;block&#x201d; and keeps data in a chronological order. Each block contains information that connects a preceding block and a following block to each other. Therefore, when a content of the preceding block is changed, all blocks following the changed block must be rewritten. Since it is difficult to change or delete data once recorded in the past block, the blockchain has high tamper resistance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a blockchain, all past data must be stored for verification.
