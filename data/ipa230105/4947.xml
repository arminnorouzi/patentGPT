It has application, by way of example, in assisting users in interacting with enterprise portals, e.g., in connection with commercial transactions.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">We are an information society and, perhaps more importantly, an information economy. We generate information. We store it. And, we are willing to pay to curate it and to consume it. The big question, though, is how do we find it? Perhaps the biggest single ready source of information, the Internet, has led the drive in answering that question.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the early popular information retrieval systems was Yahoo! Directory, a hierarchical category-based tool&#x2014;or &#x201c;web directory&#x201d;&#x2014;for finding web sites. A user interested in finding information about health care insurance, for example, might click through a hierarchy of categories on the Yahoo! Directory portal, beginning with &#x201c;business and economy&#x201d; and proceeding through &#x201c;business to business,&#x201d; &#x201c;financial services,&#x201d; &#x201c;insurance,&#x201d; and ending with &#x201c;health&#x201d; to find a listing of health insurers' websites of potential interest.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Exponential growth of the Internet, both in terms of the number of websites and number of users, rendered browsing on Yahoo! Directory, and like sites, obsolete. Not only did it prove impossible for human editors to categorize the myriad of sites coming online daily, increasingly large numbers of users lacked the expertise and fortitude to navigate the ever-growing hierarchical category directories.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a consequence, web &#x201c;searching&#x201d; (as opposed to &#x201c;browsing&#x201d;) has become the norm, through portals like Google, Bing, Baidu, and the like. Instead of requiring that users select among hierarchies of categories, the search engines locate individual web pages in response to user keyword and natural language requests. Some refer to this as the Ask-Tell model. Continuing the above example, the user interested in health care insurance can type that very term into a search portal and, with luck, will receive a listing of sites and pages of interest.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For those wishing information from a specific web site, say, of a health insurance provider, information retrieval has, to date, largely been through hierarchical category directories or, alternatively, through &#x201c;Ask-Tell&#x201d; searching hosted by the site owner and focused on content within that site. Just as with the Internet writ large, category browsing for specific information content on individual web sites has proven equally unworkable, except for all but those with a few, simple collections of content. Likewise, unless the content on a website is both focused and well architected, the Ask-Tell model is likely to return incomplete results, thereby, frustrating user requests.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a consequence, chat bots (or &#x201c;bots&#x201d;) have emerged as a next-generation search engine of choice for at least site-specific searches. For enterprises, the chat bot is viewed as one of the more effective additions to marketing and sales channels to conveniently and efficiently carry out two-way conversations with customers, potential customers, and other end users. In simple terms, chat bots are automated software conversational &#x201c;intelligent assistants,&#x201d; typically, powered by machine learning which at its core is a simple way of achieving Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Ideally, chat bots powered by AI would learn and improve from real conversations with real end users, Reality has proven otherwise. Today's bots fail to understand the open-ended questions asked by the users and often do not know what to do next&#x2014;no matter how much content the bots have been fed or random training they have been given.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the foregoing, an object of the invention is to provide improved methods and systems for digital data processing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A related object of the invention is to provide such improved methods and systems as can be adapted to improving communications with end users both for purposes of general communications and for purposes of site- or portal-specific communications, e.g., whether for marketing and sales of product offerings or other enterprise assets of value to customers.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A related object of the invention is to provide such methods and systems as are capable of constructing more contextually-aware intelligent assistants.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object is to provide such methods and systems as are suited for information retrieval.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A related object of the invention is to provide such methods and systems as are adept at discerning contextually-aware user intent.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Still another object is to provide such methods and systems as can be used to assist users in the retrieval of information from enterprise portals and other information sources.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A related object of the invention is to provide such methods and systems as can be used to assist users in the retrieval of a mix of disparate content, cataloged data and other digital assets that make up the more complete response to a user inquiry.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The foregoing are among the objects attained by the invention, which provides in some aspects a system for digital content retrieval and generation that includes one or more content management systems, an ontology manager and a chat bot, all executing and in communications coupling on a digital data processing system. Each content manager stores (or otherwise comprises), for each of a plurality of digital assets, an identifier of the respective digital asset and one or more associated tags (e.g., keywords or phrases) that characterize that asset. Those tags are selected from among two or more knowledge domains. The digital assets, themselves, may be maintained in stores local to the content management system or otherwise (e.g., remotely addressable by it).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The ontology manager stores a list of (or otherwise maintains) plural content facets, each corresponding to one or more tags of the content management system, where at least one of the content facets corresponds to two or more tags from differing respective ones of the knowledge domains (or, simply, &#x201c;domains&#x201d;). The facets too may be keywords or phrases and, indeed, each facet may be identical to the tag to which it corresponds, though, it need not be. One or more dialog segments (e.g., queries or portions of conversations) are stored or otherwise maintained in dialog facets by the ontology manager, each of which dialog facets is associated with one or more content facets, The ontology manager also keeps indicators, e.g., set and maintained through synchronization with the content management system, of facets whose corresponding tags are associated with digital assets in the content management system. Collectively, these lists, facets, indicators, domains, etc. are used to guide the chat bot system and user interaction through an ontology-specified dialog.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The chat bot drives a conversation with a user through a human machine interface (e.g., a special- or general-purpose software application such as a browser, a voice-activated device, or otherwise) using dialog segments that are expanded with content facets associated with the dialog facets in which those segments are included. The digital data processing system generates and transmits o the user digital assets identified through that conversation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Related aspects of the invention provide systems for content retrieval and generation, e.g., as described above, in which the digital assets are maintained in a digital store that is used in connection with retail, warehouse or other inventory control. At least one of those digital assets, according to related aspects of the invention, represents an item forming part of a commercial (or other) inventory.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to further related aspects of the invention, an inventory control system updates digital assets in the digital store to reflect the quantity and type of items contained in, added to and/or removed from inventory.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Still further related aspects of the invention provide systems for content retrieval and generation, e.g., as described above, in which at least one of the digital assets transmitted to the user facilitates purchase (or other acquisition) from inventory of an item represented by that asset.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further aspects of the invention provide a system for digital content retrieval and generation, e.g., as described above, in which the content management system and the ontology manager exchange facets and/or tags for synchronization, i.e., to establish correspondence between facets of the ontology manager and tags available for characterizing digital assets and/or potential digital assets in the content management system. During the sync, the content management system and ontology manager can also exchange information to identify tags (and, thereby, corresponding facets) that are associated with digital assets in the content management system.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Still further aspects of the invention provide a system for digital content retrieval and generation, e.g., as described above, in which the chat bot identifies tags associated with facets designated by the user during the conversation. And<sub>; </sub>in related aspects, the invention provides such a system in which the content management system retrieves digital assets associated with those tags, and the browser or other human machine interlace transmits those digital assets to the user.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Other aspects of the invention provide a system for digital content retrieval and generation, e.g., as described above, in which the ontology manager stores (or otherwise comprises) sequence numbers associated with the plural facets. The chat bot, according to these aspects of the invention, drives the conversation sequentially as an additional function of those sequence numbers.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Yet still further aspects of the invention provide a system for digital content retrieval and generation, e.g., as described above, in which the ontology manager stores (or otherwise comprises) one or more lexical indicators, each identifying one or more facets belonging to a common language, dialect or other lexicon, and in which the chat bot drives the conversation as an additional function of the lexical indicator associated with content and/or dialog facets, including those associated with a designated lexical indicator and excluding those which are not.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other aspects, the invention provides a system for digital content retrieval and generation, e.g., as described above, in which the chat bot drives conversations with any of text, radio boxes, check boxes and other user interface widgets. Format indicators that are associated with the facets and upon which the chat bot makes formatting selections are provided in the ontology.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Still further aspects of the invention provide a system for digital content retrieval and generation, e.g., as described above, in which the ontology comprises a hierarchy of facets including one or more main facets and, associated with each of at least one of them, plural other facets descendant in the hierarchy on that main facet and corresponding to one or more tags of the content management system, a sequence number and one or more dialog segments.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In related aspects of the invention, where a like facet is descendant from two different main facets in the ontology's hierarchy, the chat bot&#x2014;which normally drives the conversation based on sequence numbers&#x2014;disregards those numbers when driving the portion of the conversation involving that like facet.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Other aspects of the invention provide a system for digital content retrieval and generation, e.g., as described above, in which the chat bot drives the conversation as a stateless dialog with the user.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In related aspects of the invention, the chat bot searches the ontology hierarchy to identify a facet matching a user response during the conversation in order to determine how to further drive the conversation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The foregoing and other aspects of the invention are evident in the discussion that follows, as well as in the drawings and the claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A more complete understanding of the invention may be attained by reference to the drawings, in which</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a system and method for digital content retrieval and generation according to one practice of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Detailed Description of the Illustrated Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Architecture</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a system <b>10</b> for digital content retrieval and generation according to one practice of the invention.

By way of illustrative, non-limiting example, tags for digital assets pertaining to insurance might include, as main nodes or properties, the categories, AUDIENCE, CONTENT TYPE, HEALTH PLAN, OBJECTIVE and PROVIDER. Children of the AUDIENCE property might include, by way of further illustrative, nonlimiting example, the tags BROKER, EMPLOYER, GOVERNMENT AGENCY, and PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION, whereas those of the HEALTH PLAN main node might include, by way of further illustrative, nonlimiting example, the tags ACO, HMO and PPO.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">By way of further non-limiting example, tags for digital assets maintained in a store <b>12</b> by a beef wholesaler might reflect not only characteristics of its current inventory of goods, but also of recipes or other publications on their preparation. Thus, for example, tags <b>14</b><i>b </i>pertaining to the wholesaler's inventory might include, as main nodes or properties, terms or categories from a first knowledge domain (hereinafter, &#x201c;domain&#x201d;), to wit, cuts of beef, e.g., CHUCK PRIMAL, RIB PRIMAL, LOIN PRIMAL, PLATE PRIMAL, FLANK PRIMAL, and ROUND PRIMAL. Children of the ROUND PRIMAL category might include, by way of example, the tags STEAMSHIP ROUND, BOTTOM ROUND, EYE OF ROUND, SIRLOIN TIP, and TOP (INSIDE) ROUND, whereas those of the PLATE PRIMAL category might include, by way of further example, the tags HANGER STEAK, INSIDE SKIRT STEAK, OUTSIDE SKIRT STEAK AND PLATE SHORT RIBS. And, by way of still further example, tags <b>14</b><i>b </i>might include terms or categories from a second domain, to wit, cooking methods and recipes, such as ON A STOVETOP, IN THE OVEN and OUTDOOR GRILLING. Children of the ON A STOVETOP category may include, by way of example, the tags PAN-BROILING IN A SKILLET, BRAISING IN A POT, and STIR-FRYING, whereas those for the OUTDOOR GRILLING category may include, by way of example, the tags GRILLING ON A BARBEQUE, INDIRECT GRILLING and ROTISSERIE GRILLING. Of course, systems according to the invention are not limited to use of tags from only one or two domains: tags <b>14</b><i>b </i>from still other domains may be utilized as well.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Tags <b>14</b><i>b </i>in CMS <b>14</b> are created, managed and associated with digital assets via records <b>14</b><i>a </i>in the conventional manner of the art, as adapted in accord with the teachings hereof. Thus, for example, while such tags may be created in the CMS and placed in such records <b>14</b><i>a </i>in the first instance via an administrator or other operator directly or via a batch process, they may as well be created through invocation of an API, graphical user interface (GUI) or otherwise, e.g., as in the case of tags created by the synchronization module <b>26</b>, as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">One such GUI, by way of illustrative, non-limiting example, permits an end user-operator to select, from among drop-down widgets associated with each of the main nodes/categories (e.g., AUDIENCE, CONTENT TYPE, HEALTH PLAN, OBJECTIVE, in the example, above) specific child tags (e.g., BROKER, EMPLOYER, GOVERNMENT AGENCY, and PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION for the AUDIENCE category, in the example above).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition to tags <b>14</b><i>b </i>that are associated with digital assets currently in store <b>12</b>, the CMS <b>14</b> can store in records <b>14</b><i>a </i>or otherwise, tags <b>14</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; available for use in characterizing potential digital assets <b>12</b><i>a. </i>In the case of embodiments in which digital assets in store <b>12</b> represent physical or other assets, e.g., in a retail, warehouse or other inventory, tags <b>14</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; can be ones available for use in characterizing on-order goods and/or out-of-stock goods, by way of non-limiting example.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Ontology Manager <b>16</b></p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Ontology manager <b>16</b> is a conventional ontology manager of the type known in the art (as adapted in accord with the teachings hereof) that creates and manages an ontology <b>16</b><i>a, </i>that is, a list of hierarchy and/or knowledge graph categories, concepts, keywords or phrases (collectively, &#x201c;facets&#x201d; <b>16</b><i>b</i>) that, like tags, characterize actual or potential digital assets in store <b>12</b> (and CMS <b>14</b>). As above, those characteristics (or attributes) may pertain to format, content, language or otherwise, by way of illustrative, non-limiting example. Ontology manager <b>16</b> of the illustrated embodiment comprises Wordmap&#xae; of Earley Information Science, the assignee hereof, although other ontology managers of the type known in the art, whether commercially available in the marketplace or otherwise, may be used instead or in addition&#x2014;all, as adapted in accord with the teachings hereof.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although only a single ontology <b>16</b><i>a </i>is shown in the drawing and discussed below, it will be appreciated that multiple such ontologies (e.g., each constructed and utilized as described herein vis-&#xe0;-vis ontology <b>16</b><i>a</i>) can be utilized instead (e.g., each for an ontology of a respective domain, e.g., of the type discussed above) as is within the ken of those skilled in the art in view of the teachings hereof. Thus, for example, continuing the example above, one ontology <b>16</b><i>a </i>can be provided for terms pertaining to cuts of beef, and another ontology (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as element <b>16</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;; but discussed below with common reference to element <b>16</b><i>a </i>for sake of simplicity) can be provided for methods of cooking and recipes, all by way of non-limiting example. Ontology <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the illustrated embodiment is organized hierarchically, as shown in the drawing, with main facets <b>16</b><i>c </i>that correspond to main nodes of the tags discussed above, and sub-facets (or children)&#x2014;also known as &#x201c;categories,&#x201d; &#x201c;terms&#x201d; or &#x201c;concepts&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>16</b><i>d </i>that descend hierarchically from respective main facets and that correspond to child nodes or tags in the discussion above.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the illustrated embodiment, facets corresponding to tags in the CMS share the same name (or identifier) as the corresponding tag&#x2014;which corresponding tag is occasionally referred to herein as a &#x201c;required tag&#x201d; or &#x201c;corresponding required tag.&#x201d; Thus, continuing the insurance example above, ontology <b>16</b><i>a </i>may include, as main facets <b>16</b><i>c, </i>the terms AUDIENCE, CONTENT TYPE, HEALTH PLAN, OBJECTIVE, and PROVIDER; children or sub-facets <b>16</b><i>d </i>of the main facet AUDIENCE may include the sub-facets <b>16</b><i>d </i>BROKER, EMPLOYER, GOVERNMENT AGENCY, and PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION; and so forth, all in parallel to correspondingly named tags of CMS <b>14</b> and all by way of illustrative, non-limiting example. Likewise, continuing the beef wholesaler example above, ontology <b>16</b><i>a </i>may include, as main facets <b>16</b><i>c, </i>the terms CHUCK PRIMAL, RIB PRIMAL, LOIN PRIMAL, PLATE PRIMAL, FLANK PRIMAL, ROUND PRIMAL, ON A STOVETOP, IN THE OVEN, and OUTDOOR GRILLING; children or sub-facets <b>16</b><i>d </i>of the main facet ROUND PRIMAL category might include, by way of example, the facets STEAMSHIP ROUND, BOTTOM ROUND, EYE OF ROUND, SIRLOIN TIP, and TOP (INSIDE) ROUND; and so forth, again, in parallel to the correspondingly named tags of CMS <b>14</b> and all by way of non-limiting example.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Other embodiments may utilize facets <b>16</b><i>b </i>that, although corresponding to required tags of the CMS <b>14</b>, do not match them in name as in the example above.

Likewise, the sync module <b>26</b> queries the ontology manager to identify facets <b>16</b><i>b </i>in the ontology <b>16</b><i>a, </i>as well as metadata <b>16</b><i>e </i>for those assets.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0182">By comparing the tags and facets (and/or their respective metadata <b>16</b><i>e</i>), the sync module <b>26</b> can identify tags and/or facets that correspond with one another (e.g., by comparing the tag and facet names in embodiments that employ a like naming convention, by checking the values of metadata fields <b>16</b><i>f </i>or otherwise) and, upon making such identification, can test and set the metadata field <b>16</b><i>g </i>of the respective facet to properly reflect whether the respective tag is in use (i.e., whether it is associated with a record <b>14</b><i>a </i>that is associated with a digital asset <b>12</b><i>a </i>in store <b>12</b>) or whether that tag is merely maintained in the CMS <b>14</b> for potential use in characterizing such an asset. This can be done for each tag to which a facet corresponds, whether reflected by like facet and tag names, whether reflected in metadata fields, or otherwise. In the case of a facet <b>16</b><i>b </i>that corresponds with two tags, for example, this may&#x2014;depending on the content of the store <b>12</b>&#x2014;result in setting of the metadata for that facet to reflect that one of those tags in in use, but that the other is not.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0183">Upon identifying tags that do not have corresponding facets, or vice versa, the synchronization module <b>26</b> can, depending upon implementation specifics, effect creation of missing tags or facets in the CMS <b>14</b> or ontology manager <b>16</b>, as the case may be and/or can alert an operator of system <b>22</b> to do so.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0184">Synchronization module <b>26</b> of the illustrated embodiment effects the foregoing, i.e., &#x201c;synching&#x201d; of the CMS <b>14</b> and the ontology manager <b>16</b> upon operator request or automatically, e.g., periodically (hourly, daily, etc.) or episodically (e.g., whenever changes are made to the CMS records <b>14</b><i>a </i>and/or ontology <b>16</b><i>a</i>), depending on implementation requirements. Implementation of the synchronization module <b>26</b> to effect the foregoing is within the ken of those skilled in the art in view of the teachings hereof.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0185">Chat Bot <b>18</b></p><p id="p-0088" num="0186">Chat bot <b>18</b> is a conventional such software application for driving a conversation with an end user via general- or special-purpose human machine interface <b>20</b> (such as a web browser, chat app or otherwise) and via the user's device <b>24</b>, all per convention in the art as adapted in accord with the teachings hereof. Chat bot <b>18</b> of the illustrated embodiment utilizes Aspect Conversational Experience Platform (CxP), Google DialogFlow or other conventional chat bot framework(s) of the type known in the art, whether commercially available or otherwise, all as adapted in accord with the teachings hereof. Of course, it will be appreciated that, although, the term &#x201c;chat&#x201d; is associated with element <b>18</b>, the conversational technique need not be via text. It can be spoken (e.g., as where the HMI includes a text to voice feature), multi-media (e.g., as where the HMI includes graphical avatars), or otherwise, as per convention in the art as adapted in accord with the teachings hereof.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0187">To that end, the chat bot drives conversations with the end user (via HMI <b>20</b> and device <b>24</b>) utilizing scripts contained in dialog facets, as expanded using content sub-facets <b>16</b><i>d </i>as discussed above. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, step (D). Thus, for example, reiterating the example above, in an ontology <b>16</b><i>a </i>for generating digital content vis-a-vis digital assets pertaining to insurance, a dialog facet that contains the script WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE? IS IT TO &#x3c;FACET_CHILDREN&#x3e;? and that is a sibling of the sub-facets ASSESS, EDUCATE, INFLUENCE, and INFORM can be expanded to drive an outbound bot message (query) to the end user (via HMI <b>20</b> and device <b>24</b>) WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE? IS IT TO ASSESS EDUCATE, INFLUENCE or INFORM? via a variety of conversational techniques as part of a dialog to identify digital assets <b>12</b> in CMS <b>14</b> of potential interest to the user. And, by way of further example, in an ontology <b>16</b><i>a </i>for use with digital assets pertaining to beef wholesaling, a dialog facet that contains the script LET&#x2032;S FOCUS ON YOUR PREFERRED GRILLING METHOD. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY &#x3c;FACET_CHILDREN&#x3e;? and that is a sibling of the sub-facets GRILLING ON A BARBEQUE, INDIRECT GRILLING and ROTISSERIE GRILLING can be expanded to drive an outbound message (query) to the end user &#x201c;Let's focus on your preferred grilling method. Would you like to try grilling on a barbeque, indirect grilling or rotisserie grilling?&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0090" num="0188">To avoid dead-ends in the conversation&#x2014;that is, presenting options to the end user which, if selected, would not result in retrieval of digital assets <b>12</b><i>a </i>from the store <b>12</b>&#x2014;scripts are only expanded to include sibling facets <b>16</b><i>d </i>(i) all of whose corresponding (i.e., required) tags <b>14</b><i>b </i>are &#x201c;in use&#x201d; (i.e., correspond to digital assets <b>12</b><i>a </i>accessible via the CMS <b>14</b>) or (ii) that are direct ancestors (i.e., parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents, etc.) of one or more facets whose corresponding tags are all in use..</p><p id="p-0091" num="0189">Thus, continuing the examples above, in an ontology <b>16</b><i>a </i>for generating digital content vis-&#xe0;-vis digital assets pertaining to insurance, a dialog facet that contains the script WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE? IS IT TO &#x3c;FACET_CHILDREN&#x3e;? and that is a sibling of the sub-facets ASSESS, EDUCATE, INFLUENCE, and INFORM will expand to include only the facets ASSESS and INFLUENCE, by way of illustrative example, if only they (and not facets EDUCATE and INFORM) correspond to tags <b>14</b><i>b </i>that are in use, resulting in an outbound message (query) to the end user as follows: &#x201c;What is the objective? is it to assess or influence?&#x201d; Taking this to the extreme, if none of the facets ASSESS, EDUCATE, INFLUENCE, and INFORM correspond to in-use tags <b>14</b><i>b. </i>the chat bot will not present any variant of the script WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE? IS IT TO &#x3c;FACET CHILDREN&#x3e;?</p><p id="p-0092" num="0190">Likewise, in an ontology <b>16</b><i>a </i>for generating digital content vis-&#xe0;-vis assets pertaining to beef wholesale, a dialog facet that contains the script WHAT OUTDOOR GRILLING RECIPE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE? &#x3c;FACET_CHILDREN&#x3e;? and that is a sibling of the sub-facets GINGER-MAPLE STEAK, TANGY AVOCADO BURGERS, and HAWAIIAN SLIDERS, each of which correspond to both a recipe-related tag <b>14</b><i>b </i>and a sellable ingredient-related tag, will expand to include only the facets TANGY AVOCADO BURGERS and HAWAIIAN SLIDERS, by way of illustrative example, if only they (and not facet GINGER-MAPLE STEAK) correspond to both recipe-related and ingredient-related tags that are in-use in the CMS <b>14</b>. This is true even if the facet GINGER-MAPLE STEAK corresponds to a recipe-related tag that is in-use, but not an ingredient-related tag that is in-use, thereby avoiding the risk of presenting a recipe selection option to the end user during the conversation for which a necessary ingredient is not available for purchase.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0191">The aforesaid operations may be by action of the ontology manager <b>16</b> and/or the chat bot <b>18</b>, as is within the ken of those skilled in the art in view of the teachings hereof.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0192">In some embodiments, the ontology's metadata additionally includes lexical indicators, identifying a language, dialect or other lexicon with which each main facet <b>16</b><i>c </i>or sub-facet is associated. In such embodiments, localization of conversations driven by the chat bot <b>18</b> is achieved by retrieving and expanding only scripts associated with a given lexical indicator or indicators.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0193">By way of example, in an embodiment in which some facets <b>16</b><i>b </i>have meta-data identifying the respective facets as English-language and other facets have meta-data identifying the respective facts as French-language, only those scripts associated with the French-language metadata lexical indicator are retrieved and expanded (and, then, only with siblings associated with that same lexical indicator) in driving conversation with users in France or French-speaking countries. In another embodiment, user responses and thus, intent, can also be matched to a lexicon of synonyms or thesaurus identifiers associated with the respective facets. By way of example, a beef domain ontology might include &#x201c;Flap Meat&#x201d; as a colloquial synonym for &#x201c;Hanger Steak.&#x201d; Further, user responses received by chat bot <b>18</b> may be expanded, translated or otherwise normalized through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as stemming or lemmatization to enhance the likelihood of more accurate matching to facet <b>16</b><i>b </i>keywords, phrases or lexicon terms, with NLP processing performed by chat bot <b>16</b> or ontology manager <b>16</b>; use of such NLP processing techniques are readily apparent per convention in the art as adapted in accord with the teachings hereof.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0194">Referring to step (E) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, chat bot <b>18</b> can retrieve scripts from the ontology manager <b>16</b> via API, remote procedure call or otherwise, as per convention in the art as adapted in accord with the teachings hereof. In the illustrated embodiment, chat bot <b>18</b> retrieves, along with scripts, tags corresponding to the sub-facets <b>16</b><i>d </i>with which those scripts are expanded. As well, in embodiments in which the ontology's metadata additionally includes format indicators, identifying a format (e.g., text, radio box, check box or other user-interface widget) with which conversations are to be driven, those format indicators are retrieved, along with scripts and tags.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0195">Expansion of those scripts using siblings of the sub-facets <b>16</b><i>d </i>in which the scripts are contained (and using the user-interface widget specified in a format indicator, if any, retrieved with the script) can be performed by the ontology manager <b>16</b>, the chat bot <b>18</b>, or otherwise, all as is within the ken of those skilled in the art in view of the teachings hereof. Whether by action of the ontology manager <b>16</b> and/or the chat bot <b>18</b>, scripts are retrieved to drive the conversation in an order determined by the sequence indicator contained in the metadata field <b>16</b><i>h </i>of the main facet <b>16</b><i>c </i>with which that dialog facet and those sub-facets are associated.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0196">Thus, continuing the example above, in an ontology <b>16</b><i>a </i>in which one main facet <b>16</b><i>c</i>, e.g., the main facet AUDIENCE, is assigned a metadata sequence number of #1 and another main facet <b>16</b><i>c, </i>e.g., the main facet CONTENT TYPE, is assigned a metadata sequence number of #2, the chat bot <b>18</b> can drive the conversation with an outbound message (query) generated from expansion of the dialog facet associated with main facet AUDIENCE and, once that message is responded to by the user (via HMI <b>20</b> and device <b>24</b>), with a subsequent outbound message (query) generated from expansion of the dialog facet associated with the main facet CONTENT TYPE. The chat bot can drive successive messages and queries in the conversation with expanded scripts generated from the other branches (i.e.. main facets and related sub-facets)of the hierarchy associated with successively increasing sequence numbers.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0197">In the illustrated embodiment, with each user response to a message (query) generated as discussed above, the HMI returns to the chat bot <b>18</b> his/her response for matching to one or more sub-facets as designated by the user through interaction with the expanded script that made up that dialog exchange. The chat bot <b>18</b> of the illustrated embodiment saves away (e.g., in a store local to the chat bot, in cookies in the user device <b>24</b> browser or otherwise) the tag(s) associated with that/those designated sub-facets. The chat bot <b>18</b> can also save away, along with those tags, a fulsome representation of the queries posed during the confirmation and the user's responses. This facilitates implementation of the conversation in a stateless manner such that a late-received response from a given user can be matched against the record of prior responses, e.g., in cookies in that user's device <b>24</b> browser or otherwise, to pick up the conversation where it had left off. Alternatively, a facet returned in such a late-received response can be matched against the ontology <b>16</b><i>a </i>hierarchy to identify the sequence number of the main facet and sub-facets associated with the script in connection with which the response was made and, thereby, to drive the conversation with the script associated with the next sequence number.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0198">And, although, the chat bot <b>18</b> normally drives the conversation by generating outbound messages (queries) in accord with the sequence numbers associated with scripts and their main and sub-facets, the chat bot can deviate from that sequence in instances where a given term or expression is a sub-facet of two different main facets. In such an instance, a response by the user selecting that facet, when presented with it in connection with expansion of a script associated with one of those main facets, can cause the chat bot <b>18</b> to drive the conversation with the script associated with the next sequence number from that of the other main facet.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0199">Regardless, once the conversation has been completed, e.g., via querying the user with all of the scripts implicated by the ontology <b>16</b><i>a </i>in the order specified therewith, the chat bot <b>18</b> passes the saved-away compilation of tags designated in the user responses to the HMI <b>20</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, step (F).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0200">The HMI <b>20</b>, in turn, applies those tags to CMS <b>14</b> to retrieve assets characterized by those tags or links thereto, all per convention in the art as adapted in accord with the teachings hereof. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, steps (G) and (H). The HMI can, in turn, generate as digital content for the user the assets returned in step (H). See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, step (I). As a consequence, the HMI <b>20</b> and, more generally, the system <b>22</b> generates and returns to the user digital content meeting his/her responses to the outbound messages (queries) generated by the chat bot <b>18</b> based on the scripts contained therein.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0201">And, because of dead-end avoidance as discussed above, there is no risk that a user selection during the conversation will result in a null return (that is, in no content being returned to him/her in step (I)) or, in instances like those discussed above, in which a user selection will result in a return that is other than fulsome&#x2014;e.g., the return of a PDF or webpage containing a recipe selected by the user but no webpage or other asset via which the user may purchase an essential ingredient.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0202">In embodiments where store <b>12</b> includes digital assets representing physical or other assets (for example, as where the digital asset store <b>12</b> is used in connection with retail, warehouse or other inventory control and where items in the asset store <b>12</b> reflect actual items in such an inventory) and/or where the CMS <b>14</b> is integrated with an inventory control system, e.g., as discussed above, the generation of digital content can include offering the user an opportunity to purchase goods from inventory. Thus, for example, a result of querying a user as described above vis-a-vis digital assets maintained by a beef wholesaler, can be the following digital content: (a) one or more PDFs (or images or web pages) with recipes for cooking strip steak, (b) a banner advertising a sale on packages of strip steak currently in inventory and including a &#x201c;buy now&#x201d; button facilitating the user's purchase of same.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0203">Implementation of the chat bot <b>18</b>, HMI <b>20</b> and CMS <b>14</b> to effect the foregoing is within the ken of those skilled in the art in view of the teachings hereof.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0204">Described herein are systems and methods achieving the objects set forth above for generating dialog scripts and digital content based on retrieved assets.
