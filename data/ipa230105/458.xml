Such systems emit x-rays from an x-ray source which are detected by detectors. The system subsequently converts the analog signal from the detectors to a digital signal which may be read as data by computerized components of the system. Such data may be input into one or more algorithms which facilitate the identification of the scanned object and one or more of its physical or chemical characteristics.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Any algorithm attempting to determine any geometrical features based on the analysis of a set of dual-energy images acquired by a dual-energy x-ray scanning device requires the knowledge of the path followed by the neutral particles, such as photons or neutrons, for example, contributing to the signal of all pixels in each of the dual-energy images. This can be decomposed into two different types of information, namely the positions of the sources and the detectors emitting and receiving the neutral particles and the mapping of the detectors indexing to the pixels of the images. In order to ensure that the dual-energy x-ray images are reliable, it is advantageous to account for the real positions of the source and detectors in the x-ray scanning system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A path is considered as the orientation in 3D space of a vector linking the positions of a source, interpreted as a first point or &#x201c;point source&#x201d;, and a detector, interpreted as a second point or &#x201c;point detector&#x201d;. In operation, x-rays are emitted in all directions from the source and accordingly, portions of each detector will be encountered by a plurality of x-rays to generate a pixel. To accommodate algorithms working with this extended body of x-rays being sent from the source and received by the detector, the set of x-rays contributing to a pixel may be considered in unison or as a set of points. For point-source of neutral particles and detector arrays used in most imaging applications, it is common to neglect the contribution of the scattered particles to the transmission images and therefore, to assume that all particles contributing to the signal of a given pixel have travelled on the same path.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Usually, the designing process of an imaging device specifies the positions of the sources and detectors in such a way as to achieve certain specifications or performances. However, there are many sources of uncertainties during the manufacturing and fielding processes which may lead to significant differences between the expected and the actual positions of the sources and detectors. Mechanical tolerances, assembly techniques, shipping and handling of the device, for example, may all introduce uncertainties in the source and detector positions. Large position differences would cause sufficiently large losses of performance that they should be noticed during facility or commissioning tests. However, small differences between the expected and actual positions of the source and detectors may not be perceived by conventional procedures. In these cases, even if the imaging device may be able to produce good quality images, the uncertainties in the travel path of the particles may result in significant errors in the output of the aforementioned algorithms such as, for example, image artifacts or warping.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Measurement tools are available to determine with a degree of precision the position and orientation of each source and detector in a system. However, many x-ray scanning devices are assembled in a manner wherein either the source(s), the detector(s) or both are concealed. Therefore, it may be impossible to perform direct measurements with any suitable measuring devices to determine the actual path of the particles once the device is commissioned. In such situations, there are no reliable means to measure the differences between the expected and actual positions of the sources and detectors. Accordingly, the manufacturers of such imaging devices are unaware of how their quality assurance procedures actually perform with regard to the geometry of the assembled system, or equivalently, the manufacturers do not know the actual quality of the assembly of the devices being sold and guaranteed to clients.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore desirable to have means of compensating for image quality loss due to differences between the expected and actual positions of at least one of the source(s) and the detector(s) of an x-ray scanning device wherein such means do not rely on direct measurement of the source(s) and/or detector(s).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention relates to x-ray scanning devices and in particular to a device and method for determining calibration information for x-ray scanning devices. One aspect proposed herein is to determine estimates of the actual source positions and detector positions of the assembly and the orientation of fan beams extending therebetween by analyzing images of a geometric calibration tool acquired by a commissioned x-ray imaging device and some direct measurements performed on at least one of the calibration tool itself or the system formed by the tool and the imaging device, but not on the sources and detectors themselves.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the calibration tool is rigid and has geometric features that can be easily identified in the dual-energy images produced by the x-ray scanner and on the calibration tool itself.

The position and orientation of the at least one feature in the scanning chamber and the at least one x-ray scanning system property may be determined simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Determining the position of the at least one feature may further include the steps of determining an orientation of the at least one feature on the calibration device, in the at least one image, determining a length of a projection of pixels representing the at least one feature on an axis parallel with a direction of displacement through the scanning chamber, and using the orientation of the at least one feature and the length of the projection to determine an actual length of the at least one feature.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The method may further include the step of performing a least squares analysis to solve for the at least one x-ray scanning system property which, together with the orientation of the at least one feature, minimizes a difference between one of a distance, a position and an orientation of geometric features as represented in the at least one image of the calibration device and the geometric features of the calibration device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The at least one x-ray scanning system property may include at least one of an angle of the at least one fan beam and a distance between an x-ray emission source and an array of x-ray detectors between which the fan beam extends during a scanning operation. The angle of the fan beam and the distance between the x-ray emission source and the array of detectors may both be determined simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The pixels representing the at least one feature of the calibration device may be pixels representing one of a vertex and an edge. The vertex may include pixels representing an end point of a wire used to construct the calibration device and the edge includes pixels representing a length of wire extending from at least one end point of the wire used to construct the calibration device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect, the at least one fan beam includes two fan beams. The two fan beams may be spaced apart along a horizontal axis corresponding with a direction of displacement through the scanning chamber. One of the two fan beams may intersect the scanning chamber from beneath a displacement assembly extending through the scanning chamber and the other one of the two fan beams may intersect the scanning chamber from a first side of the displacement assembly toward a second side of the displacement assembly.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect, there is provided a calibration device for use with an x-ray scanning device.

The dual-energy data may be provided to any number of algorithms for processing. Preferably, the dual-energy data is provided, either directly or via retrieval from storage, to an object reconstruction algorithm which analyzes the raw data to reconstruct a representation of the scanned object. Further analysis at the raw data level may be undertaken or the representation of the object may provide a basis to generate one or more images of the object via reconstruction.

Accordingly, a set of x-rays may also be interpreted as following a path.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Acquisition of calibration data in order to determine actual x-ray scanning system geometry is performed by conducting a scanning operation on a calibration device. Preferably, the calibration device is rigid and presents a plurality of geometric features that can be easily identified both on the physical calibration device and in the dual-energy data images output by a scanning operation on the calibration device. The geometric features are used as reference points for positioning the calibration tool in the 3D space within the scanning chamber <b>106</b> of the scanning device <b>100</b> and in the images of the calibration device produced by the scanning operation. Measurements are performed on the geometric features using suitable measuring devices. The dimensions of the calibration device and its shape with respect to the geometric features are also measurable with suitable measuring devices. The actual position of the calibration device within the space of the scanning chamber <b>106</b> is estimated on the basis of those measurements.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">An exemplary calibration device or tool <b>200</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Preferably, the calibration device <b>200</b> includes a base portion <b>202</b> which is preferably rectangular and having an aperture or window <b>204</b>, preferably also rectangular in shape, passing therethrough. The window <b>204</b> permits uninterrupted passage of x-rays from beneath the calibration device <b>200</b> and thereby permits an unobstructed view of at least some of the other components of the calibration device <b>200</b> further described herein. The calibration device <b>200</b> also has a frame portion <b>206</b> coupled with an upper surface portion <b>208</b> of the base portion <b>202</b>. The calibration device <b>200</b> is preferably composed of a plastic and may be manufactured by any suitable means, such as additive manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The frame portion <b>206</b> includes a plurality of frame members <b>210</b>. In an exemplary aspect the frame members <b>210</b> are coupled together at a first end portion <b>212</b> thereof to form a central portion <b>214</b>. In said exemplary aspect each of the frame members <b>210</b> extend outwardly from the central portion <b>214</b> and away from one another to a second end portion <b>216</b> thereof. Each of the second end portions <b>216</b> preferably includes an attachment portion <b>218</b>. However, it should be understood that the attachment portions <b>218</b> may be found at other locations along the frame member <b>210</b>. The attachment portions <b>218</b> may include a slot <b>220</b>. The frame portion <b>206</b> is adapted as further described herein to support a system of wires <b>222</b>, each having wire end portions <b>224</b>. Preferably, the wires <b>222</b> are metallic.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an exemplary aspect, the metallic wires <b>222</b> are attached to the base portion <b>202</b> of the calibration device at attachment portions or anchor points <b>226</b> and extend in between the anchor points <b>226</b> through the slots <b>220</b> to form the system of wires <b>222</b> supported in tension by the frame portion <b>210</b>. The base portion <b>202</b> may include any suitable number of anchor points <b>226</b>. In an exemplary aspect, the anchor point <b>226</b> is a cylinder attached to the base portion <b>202</b> and is protruding therefrom.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should further be understood that although the wires <b>222</b> extend through slots <b>220</b> of attachment portions <b>218</b> and anchor points <b>226</b>, the wires <b>222</b> may be otherwise secured to attachment portions <b>218</b> and anchor points <b>226</b>, such as being inset on the attachment portions <b>218</b> or anchor points <b>226</b> or wound about the attachment portions <b>218</b> and anchor points <b>226</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The system of wires <b>222</b> provides straight edges <b>228</b> defined by the wires extending between wire end portions or vertices <b>230</b>. It is preferable to use metallic wires <b>222</b> for the purpose of providing the straight edges <b>228</b> because they produce a high-contrast image but which is only a few pixels in width.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The system of wires <b>222</b> may be configured to form any structure. It is preferable that the system of wires <b>222</b> form a structure in which at least two edges <b>228</b> are not parallel to each other. For example, diagonal edges allow good contrast on the dual energy images, which provides better identification of the edges while analyzing the data received by the scans performed on the calibration tool <b>200</b>. In an exemplary aspect, the system of wires <b>222</b> forms a tetrahedral structure in which the four edges <b>228</b> are not parallel to each other.

This allows the tetrahedral structure formed by the system of wires <b>222</b>, or more specifically the &#x201c;base&#x201d; of the tetrahedral structure, to be skewed or tilted to an orientation which is not perfectly horizontal. Skewing the tetrahedron positions the wires <b>222</b> at different relative positions to the detectors <b>120</b> of the detector array <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> thereby providing for different dual-energy output data from wire to wire during a scanning operation and a greater variety of dual-energy data which may be used to obtain calibration information.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The calibration tool <b>200</b> as described in accordance with the above preferred aspect includes a rectangular base portion <b>202</b> and frame members <b>210</b> and a system of wires <b>222</b> which form a tetrahedron or tetrahedral shape to provide the geometric features used for calibration.

The dimensions of the calibration device and its shape with respect to the geometric features may also be measured. These measurements may be taken prior to initiation of the method <b>400</b> or subsequent to providing step <b>402</b> as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> at step <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">At step <b>406</b>, the calibration device <b>200</b> is positioned within the scanning chamber <b>106</b> of the x-ray scanning device <b>100</b>.

To locate the vertices and edges, the image archive is searched for pixels which represent metal wire. Step <b>416</b> can be performed manually by a user or automatically, using any suitable algorithm.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Where the at least one image includes a dual-energy image, the identification of the features can be based on the analysis of the data of a low energy image, a high energy image or a combination of both.

In the vertical dimension of the image, lines may be skewed because of the fan beam. Since the fan beam is fan-shaped, some lines which should be straight may appear in the image as curved lines. Moreover, the fan beam depends on the geometry of the x-ray scanning device, including the position of the detector cards and the position of the source producing the fan beam.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The horizontal dimension of the image is controlled by the displacement assembly which displaces the calibration device <b>200</b> through the scanning chamber and across the fan beam.
