Gaming credits, for example, may provide a player a certain amount money that can be spent at a particular location, on a certain type of game(s), etc. Free play offers are similar and can allow a player a certain number of plays, attempts, turns, etc., for a particular game, event, betting event, and the like. Such incentives may be used to target certain customers, incentivize particular games, merchant locations, a time of play, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">As such, customers and players may be eligible for multiple offers, and various amounts of free play and/or gaming credit based on the merchant, a location, a day/time, a type of game, etc. Customers and gamers are therefore incentivized to weigh various offers and select the best one that aligns with their gaming interests and goals. However, it can be difficult and time consuming for players to identify available offers for which they qualify. In some scenarios, players may have to contact different casinos and merchants to identify any available offers. In others, players might be provided with the offer directly through a merchant's rewards program, player account, upon check in at a location, or other means. There is currently no efficient or convenient means to identify and weigh available offers.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">From the casino and gaming merchants' perspective, there is a similar challenge in efficiently and profitably providing offers and incentives, such as gaming credits and/or free play to eligible customers. This can lead to further challenges, even an inability, for casinos and merchants to efficiently compete with each other using offers and incentives, since customer visibility is limited. Accordingly, there is a need for an efficient, streamlined approach to optimize available opportunities and communicate such offers between gaming merchants and potential players.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disclosed herein are systems and methods for generating gaming offers. Embodiments can comprise a secure cloud database storing player information, including play preferences, for at least one user, and rules associated with one or more merchants; and a processor in communication with at least one memory, the memory comprising instructions that cause the processor to at least: receive player information, including a set of play preferences associated with a user; receive information indicative of a set of rules, each rule associated with at least one merchant; determine a subset of applicable rules based on the player information and the set of play preferences; generate an offer based on the subset of applicable rules, wherein the offer is redeemable at a merchant location; and output the at least one offer on a user interface.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In various embodiments, the offer provides a free play amount for redemption at the merchant location, such as a physical location or an online gaming platform. Play preferences can include but are not limited to a type of game, a frequency of play, a preferred type of play, a budget, a date of play, and a time of play. The preferred type of play can be based on a budget or a time range for play.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In other embodiments, a subset of the offer rules is defined by the merchant. In an example, at least one rule in the set of applicable rules provides a free play amount based on the anticipated budget. In another example, the player information includes a player rating, and at least one rule in the set of applicable rules provides a free play amount based on the player rating. The player rating can be based on at least one of: a player history, an offer redemption history, an amount spent, and criteria set by the merchant.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In additional embodiments, a determination regarding offer redemption is made, and the player information is updated with redemption information. Redemption information may be applicable to one or more rules in subsequent offers. Embodiments also include determining a player rating based on the player information and updating the subset of applicable rules based on the player rating. At least one rule can determine a free play amount based on player history with the merchant. At least one rule can determine a free play amount based on player history with the merchant.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In various embodiments, the offer is redeemable via at least one of: a QR code, an alphanumeric code, an email, a text message, a printable coupon, and an update to a player account associated with the merchant.

In embodiments, the display order of the offers can be changed based on user preference. Likewise, offers can be removed or hidden from view. Offers can further be customized with a picture or logo to be associated with the offer.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The offer dashboard can be dynamically updated as the user updates information, e.g., changes a desired location of play or a time of play, and the offers can be updated as well. In embodiments, users can select a location for play, e.g., by entering a city name or zip code. Other embodiments allow options for both online and land-based casinos. In other words, users can have the option to select a particular city/physical location or indicate that online play is desired. The systems and methods discussed herein, with respect to merchants fully apply to online merchants and online gaming platforms.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The user dashboard can further comprise a summary <b>610</b> regarding the user's activity. The user activity summary can indicate a total value amount redeemed by the user, such as a total cash value amount redeemed. A user rating, e.g., 3.4 Stars, and a user categorization, e.g., &#x201c;Explorer,&#x201d; can be listed to provide additional information about the user.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Selecting an offer <b>620</b> can provide additional information about the offer, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>. Additional offer details <b>640</b>, such as the value of the offer, the type of play associated with the offer, the location, date, valid time or time range for the offer, and a QR code <b>630</b> to redeem the offer, can be displayed on the user interface.

Such features can include an option for help in claiming the offer, and viewing disclaimers, terms, and/or conditions regarding the offer. Embodiments may include an option to save the offer in a separate application, such as an APPLE wallet, print the offer, email, text, or otherwise send the offer to a different application.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In various embodiments, players can only accept one offer per time period. Players may have multiple offers saved, but not multiple offers that overlap for any period of time. Players can switch offers by un-canceling an accepted offer and selecting a new offer.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Offers may be redeemed at their given location by presenting the offer on the user interface. At a redeemable location, an offer can be redeemed, for example, at a kiosk, at a player's club desk, at a particular casino location, or otherwise, by scanning a QR code, entering an alphanumeric code, or entering an identifier associated with offer. In some embodiments, the offer can be loaded to a player card or a player account for a specific location. The communication of the offer to the user account can occur, for example, automatically, upon acceptance of the offer, when verified at a particular location, and the like. Similarly, the offer can be removed from the player account if the player cancels the offer, e.g., to accept a different offer.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a flowchart illustrating an example method for offer generation.

Each rule in the set of rules is associated with at least one merchant. Then, a subset of applicable rules is determined based on the player information and the set of play preferences <b>730</b>. In embodiments, a rules engine <b>830</b> manages the data analysis and offer generation.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">An offer for play is generated <b>740</b>, <b>840</b> based on the received information, i.e., the subset of applicable rules, and output on a user interface <b>750</b>, e.g., an interface of a mobile computing device. In embodiments, the offer is redeemable at one or more merchant locations. Players can submit the play preferences and merchants can define one or more rules. Merchants can enter, edit, remove, and/or update requirements for offers, based on preference, business reasons, and the like.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In various embodiments, offers can be generated based on one or more play preferences. The play preferences can be submitted through a user interface on a computing device, such as a mobile computing device, as discussed herein. The play preferences can include, but are not limited to, a type of game, a frequency of play, a budget, a time range for play, and a date of play, and a time of play.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In other embodiments, player history and offer history <b>875</b> can contribute to additional player information <b>870</b> that can optionally be used by the rules engine <b>830</b> in the analysis for offer generation <b>840</b>. Redemption information <b>850</b>, including but not limited to the date of redemption, time of redemption, amount spent that visit, a location of redemption, and the like, can be stored as additional player information <b>870</b> for subsequent offer generations. Such redemption information <b>850</b> can also be used to determine a player rating <b>860</b>, as discussed further below, and optionally usable by the rules engine <b>830</b> to generate one or more offers.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">With regard to the set of rules <b>820</b>, merchants, such as gaming locations and casinos, can define one or more offers each having one or more rules to be satisfied for a player to qualify for the offer. In embodiments, the offers can be static offers, dynamic offers, or a combination. In a static offer, a value of the offer may be fixed, for example, if a certain offer rule is met. In a dynamic offer, the offer is adjusted based a combination of factors, a formula, a weighted calculation based on inputs, such as play preferences, a budgeted amount, a date of play, or time of play.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart regarding offer generation from a user perspective. On a user interface, such as an application on a mobile computing device, a user can determine one or more desired locations of play <b>910</b> as discussed herein. The user can further define a desired type of play <b>920</b>, based on a budget, a specific date, time, or generally indicate that time is the player's typical basis of play. User selections help determine applicable games <b>930</b> for the user, including but not limited to slots, poker, blackjack, bingo, and the like. Such preferences can, in some embodiments, assist in tailoring rules and generated offers to the user. Users can optionally upload any received, applicable offers <b>940</b>, as discussed herein and with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Then, generated offers can be presented on the user interface, and users can review and accept one or more offers for redemption <b>950</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an example, a player can enter an anticipated budget of money on a desired date. The rules engine can then generate offers based on at least one rule, e.g., a merchant-defined rule. For example, a rules engine can determine an offer value amount based on an anticipated budget provided by a player. The rule can determine the offered amount based on a percentage of the anticipated spending amount. The amount offered may be capped at a certain value, e.g., 10% of the player's anticipated spending amount, up to $100. The rule, e.g., one or more of the calculation, an amount offered, an offer cap, etc. may be adjusted based factors defined by the merchant, such as a date, time, or length of play, and/or a type of game, e.g., slots, blackjack, video poker, etc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an illustrative example, a player might indicate a budgeted or anticipated spending amount of $100 on May 1. A merchant's rule may assign 10% of the player's budgeted amount, i.e., $10, to be offered as a free play amount at the merchant's location. The rule&#x2014;or an additional rule&#x2014;can adjust the free play amount based on the day, e.g., offering 15% of the player's anticipated spending amount if the date falls on a Monday-Friday, if the time is a certain time of day, and any of a plurality of other factors that may be defined by the merchant. The rules engine may receive both the player and rule information and generate an offer.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Additional embodiments of the invention can provide a direct connection between the player and the merchant. The direct connection can be used, for example, to help the merchant verify player information, and assist in evaluating both the player and the offer. Such information can be used to identify player qualifications for certain offers, develop tailored offers, and gather data regarding one or more players.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In an example, an offer can be generated based on a rule that offers a certain amount of free play based on a predicted amount of money that the player is expected to win. An offer can be based on a percentage, e.g., 10%, of the user's theoretical net win, which can be based on the user's previous information, such as the actual amount or average amount of past wins within a time period, e.g., past 90 days. Again, the rules can be defined according to merchant preferences and settings. The rules engine can generate offers based on the received player information and rule information for a particular location.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In embodiments, the above offer calculations, which can use additional player information outside of the directly entered play preferences, can be implemented instead of or in addition to the examples and embodiments discussed above. The offer generation process can be fully customizable. Direct connections between merchants and players, e.g., to link a player account to receive play history and player information, as discussed herein may be optional. In embodiments, the information can be used in addition to the provided player information. Additional player information can be used to further tailor offers and identify one or more offers for which the player qualifies. In embodiments, players have the option to decide whether or not to link their accounts.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Embodiments of the present invention can further determine and utilize player ratings <b>860</b> for offer generation. This additional player information can help merchants better understand its players, identify player satisfaction, play history, and player practices. Such information can be helpful for merchants to further tailor its rules and offers to particular players, e.g., existing players or new players, certain types of players, promote certain games, dates, times of play, and the like.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In examples, players are given the option to evaluate their play experience at a particular location. Scoring can be quantitative, e.g., 1-10 rating, or qualitative, e.g., good, bad, satisfied, unsatisfied, with the requested information being fully customizable to merchants and locations. The information may be used to define one or more rules, which may, for example, be applicable only to players who rate a location a certain way, e.g., to target a subset of players, such as satisfied or unsatisfied players.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In other embodiments, merchants can also use player information and/or play history information to provide player ratings. In these examples, player ratings can be based, for example, on player history, including but not limited to whether the player showed up at the indicated time, an amount that the player spent, whether the player stayed longer or less than the assigned or anticipated play time, whether the player met his/her budget or spent more or less than anticipated, the types of games that were played, the overall profit made by the player, other offers saved, redeemed, or received by the player, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Such metrics and ratings information can be further utilized by the rules engine to help tailor offers, analyze player offers, determine an effectiveness of offers, and compare offers from various locations.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an example, a player's rating can be a numeral score, e.g., 1 to 5. A player's history can influence that rating, the effect being automatic and/or customizable based on one or more merchant preferences, rules, and the like. The player history can further be requested by merchant's and may be particularly useful for merchant's determining the rules to applied for offer generation.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one example, a player anticipating a spending budget of $450 and given a $90 free play offer at a particular location, played the $90 of free play and spent no additional money. The player's behavior can be taken into account during subsequent offer generations, and offered less or nothing in the future, since the player's behavior suggests that the player's actual spending will be less than the player's anticipated amount. Conversely, in the same situation, where the player anticipates spending a certain amount, and spends significantly more than anticipated amount, the player may be considered a very profitable guest. In subsequent offers, the more profitable player may receive an additional or increased offer amount, since the player's history suggests that that player's spending matches or exceeds the anticipated amount. Player history can further be used predictively, to anticipate player behavior, identify trends, and dynamically adjust offers.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Specific aspects of the player's history and player information can be requested as well. For example, information regarding a player's prior dates or times of play, games played, and demographic information. Information regarding previous offers sent to the player and offers redeemed by the player can be communicated as well, e.g., to further understand the player and the types of offers that the player is receptive to. Each of these methods can be used to better understand the player and develop tailored offers.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Embodiments can further allow individual merchants, including specific locations of each merchant to create their own player rating/score methodology. In examples, a merchant can request a summary of play information, can be obtained directly through the player, player history information recorded at the location, through prior application use, and any of a plurality of other means.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Examples of requested information can include dates, time, and locations of play, how closely the player followed their anticipated play (e.g., location, time, games, budget, etc.), whether the player followed through on their expected play or used their redeemed offers. Ratings of the players can be determined objectively, e.g., &#x201c;Did the player show up on X date?&#x201d; or subjectively, e.g., 1-10 rating based on merchant-defined factors. Such information can utilize location tracking or other methods to validate player behavior.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Player rating determinations can be fully customized, weighted, and the like, based on user/merchant preferences and factors. Likewise, such information can be useful to help understand player behavior and evaluate player response against offers that were made.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Future offers can further be adjusted based on one or more rules accounting for player ratings. For example, rules can be defined to reward frequent players with additional offers. Players may obtain increased offers based on numbers of times playing at a location, e.g., $X amount for 2-10 visits, $Y amount for 11-20 visits, and $Z amount for 20+ visits, with offer amounts optionally added on to any other offers. Likewise, player ratings and behaviors can be used to determine offer cap amounts, e.g., $50-100, based on whether a player meets certain criteria.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Since players are rated progressively, i.e., ratings can change and update as additional player and play information is collected, offers and offer rules can change in response.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In embodiments, a standardized rule system can be applied to all merchants and customers. Such standardized rules system can require a same set of information from both players and merchants and apply a same set of rules for offer generation, in order to generate a standardized set of offers to players. Embodiments can allow customization, by allowing merchants to set their own rules, define types of games for offers, set offer amounts, offer limits, and the like. As such, the standardization process provides methods for various scenarios and player information to be received, and systematically analyzes and applies applicable rules to generate consistent, tailored offers for users.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Connections between systems of the present invention and casinos can optionally be performed via an application specifically for merchants, and accessible on a computing device. The application can connect with merchants, e.g., casinos, via any of the systems and methods discussed herein. The application can optionally comprise a customer usage dashboard and/or and administrative dashboard, showing a custom set of information of interest. For example, the application can identify specific player and/or aggregate player activity with the past 30 days, or any desired range of time. The application can analyze player trends, such as time of play, games played, offers claimed, and offers used. In addition, a comparison of offers can be performed, e.g., indicating how one merchants offers compare to other merchants' offers, whether they are higher or lower than similar offers or an average offer being made for particular rules. The application can help analyze current rules and offers being presented to players, as well as to help create and tailor offers for players.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In embodiments, various aspects of the present invention, can utilize a cloud-based computing network. Information received from various parties, e.g., players, merchants, etc., can be uploaded to a cloud network, e.g., AZURE cloud, AWS cloud and the like, and stored in one or more cloud databases.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Databases can organize information in any of a plurality of methods. Information can be organized by category, for example. Such categories, can include but are not limited to: play pattern, create date, upload date, frequency of play (daily, monthly, etc.), a frequency number, a type of play, (budget, time, etc.), budget amount, user ID, favorite games, offer per month, address, casino name, location, and the like.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows example components of a cloud computing system <b>1000</b>. By way of example and without limitation, cloud computing system <b>1000</b> may be used to perform aspects of the disclosed subject matter. Cloud-based computing generally refers to networked computer architectures where application execution, service provision, and data storage may be divided, to some extent, between clients and cloud computing devices. The &#x201c;cloud&#x201d; may refer to a service or a group of services accessible over a network, e.g., the Internet, by clients, server devices, and by other cloud computing systems, for example.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one example, multiple computing devices connected to the cloud may access and use a common pool of computing power, services, applications, storage, and files. Thus, cloud computing enables a shared pool of configurable computing resources, e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services, that may be provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction by the cloud service provider.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As an example, a cloud-based application may store copies of data and/or executable program code in the cloud computing system, while allowing client devices to download at least some of this data and program code as needed for execution at the client devices. In some examples, downloaded data and program code may be tailored to the capabilities of specific client devices, e.g., a personal computer, tablet computer, mobile phone, and/or smartphone, accessing the cloud-based application. Additionally, dividing application execution and storage between client devices and the cloud computing system allows more processing to be performed by the cloud computing system, thereby taking advantage of the cloud computing system's processing power and capability, for example.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Cloud-based computing can also refer to distributed computing architectures where data and program code for cloud-based applications are shared between one or more client devices and/or cloud computing devices on a near real-time basis. Portions of this data and program code may be dynamically delivered, as needed or otherwise, to various clients accessing the cloud-based application. Details of the cloud-based computing architecture may be largely transparent to users of client devices. By way of example and without limitation, a PC user device accessing a cloud-based application may not be aware that the PC downloads program logic and/or data from the cloud computing system, or that the PC offloads processing or storage functions to the cloud computing system, for example.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, cloud computing system <b>1000</b> includes one or more cloud services <b>1004</b>, one or more cloud platforms <b>1006</b>, cloud infrastructure components <b>1008</b>, and cloud knowledge bases <b>1010</b>.
