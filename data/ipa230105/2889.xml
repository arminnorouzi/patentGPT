In particular, some embodiments of disclosure relate to blocking compounds comprising multiple reactive moieties and uses thereof. Some embodiments of the disclosure relate to fluorinated blocking compounds and uses thereof.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The semiconductor industry faces many challenges in the pursuit of device miniaturization including the rapid scaling of nanoscale features. Such challenges include the fabrication of complex devices, often using multiple lithography steps and etch processes. Furthermore, the semiconductor industry needs low cost alternatives to high cost EUV for patterning complex architectures. To maintain the cadence of device miniaturization and keep chip manufacturing costs down, selective deposition has shown promise. It has the potential to remove costly lithographic steps by simplifying integration schemes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Selective deposition can be achieved by blocking a surface with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) formed from a blocking compound. The head group(s) of the blocking compound plays a crucial role as it participates in the selective chemisorption of the blocking compound on one surface over the other surface. The tail group(s) of blocking compounds are typically alkyl or aryl chains which add spatial bulkiness to the blocking compound to physically and chemically protect the non-targeted surface from deposition precursors.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Selection of appropriate head group(s) enables a blocking compound to block different surfaces. In general, it is easier to enable the selective blocking of dielectrics as most dielectrics contain terminal Si&#x2014;OH or O&#x2014;H dangling bonds. In contrast, the blocking of metals requires different reactive groups for different metals as every metal has different electronic structures and behaves differently chemically.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Future integration schemes are becoming increasingly complex and different metal and dielectric materials are often exposed at the same time. To enable selective deposition in these complex environments, there is a need for a blocking compound to block multiple material surfaces at the same time.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, another major challenge of some selective deposition approaches is the instability of the SAM in plasma environments. As blocking compounds often contain carbonaceous chains as tail group, selective deposition by plasma-based processes can lead to the degradation of the alkyl/aryl chain thereby leading to a loss of selectivity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, the selective deposition of dielectric (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>, low-k) on dielectric surfaces can enable reduced patterning steps and reduce shorting in lower line space structures. These selective deposition processes can also enable fully landed via (FLV) schemes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, there is currently no thermal processes for the deposition of SiO<sub>2 </sub>or low-k which are feasible on a production scale. SiO<sub>2 </sub>and low-k are typically deposited in PEALD schemes using an O<sub>2 </sub>or other plasma. These plasmas ash the alkyl chains of the blocking compounds. Accordingly, there is a need for a new class of blocking compounds that are able to withstand the plasma environment and enable the plasma-based deposition of dielectric on dielectric (e.g., FAV scheme).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One or more embodiments of the disclosure are directed to a method of depositing a blocking layer. The method comprises exposing a substrate surface comprising an exposed first metallic material, an exposed second metallic material, and an exposed dielectric material to a blocking compound to selectively form a blocking layer on the first and second metallic materials over the dielectric material. The blocking compound comprises a first moiety and a second moiety which are different and selected from phosphonates, carbon-carbon double bonds, carbon-carbon triple bonds, amines, thiols and silanes.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional embodiments of the disclosure are directed to a method of substrate processing comprising exposing a substrate surface comprising an exposed metallic material having a first surface and an exposed dielectric material having a second surface to a fluorinated blocking compound to selectively form a blocking layer on either the first surface or the second surface.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further embodiments of the disclosure are directed to a selective deposition method comprising exposing a substrate surface comprising an exposed metallic material having a first surface and an exposed dielectric material having a second surface to a fluorinated blocking compound to selectively form a blocking layer on the first surface. A silicon oxide film is selectively deposited on the second surface over the blocking layer by a plasma-enhanced deposition process comprising an oxygenating plasma.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">So that the above recited features of the present disclosure can be understood in detail, a more particular description of the disclosure, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings.

The disclosure is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; refers to a surface, or portion of a surface, upon which a process acts. It will also be understood by those skilled in the art that reference to a substrate can also refer to only a portion of the substrate, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Additionally, reference to depositing on a substrate can mean both a bare substrate and a substrate with one or more films or features deposited or formed thereon</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; as used herein, refers to any substrate or material surface formed on a substrate upon which film processing is performed during a fabrication process. For example, a substrate surface on which processing can be performed include materials such as silicon, silicon oxide, strained silicon, silicon on insulator (SOI), carbon doped silicon oxides, amorphous silicon, doped silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, glass, sapphire, and any other materials such as metals, metal nitrides, metal alloys, and other conductive materials, depending on the application. Substrates include, without limitation, semiconductor wafers. Substrates may be exposed to a pretreatment process to polish, etch, reduce, oxidize, hydroxylate, anneal, UV cure, e-beam cure and/or bake the substrate surface. In addition to film processing directly on the surface of the substrate itself, in the present disclosure, any of the film processing steps disclosed may also be performed on an underlayer formed on the substrate as disclosed in more detail below, and the term &#x201c;substrate surface&#x201d; is intended to include such underlayer as the context indicates. Thus, for example, where a film/layer or partial film/layer has been deposited onto a substrate surface, the exposed surface of the newly deposited film/layer becomes the substrate surface.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one or more embodiments, the term &#x201c;on&#x201d;, with respect to a film or a layer of a film, includes the film or layer being directly on a surface, for example, a substrate surface, as well as there being one or more underlayers between the film or layer and the surface, for example the substrate surface. Thus, in one or more embodiments, the phrase &#x201c;on the substrate surface&#x201d; is intended to include one or more underlayers. In other embodiments, the phrase &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; refers to a layer or a film that is in contact with a surface, for example, a substrate surface, with no intervening layers. Thus, the phrase &#x201c;a layer directly on the substrate surface&#x201d; refers to a layer in direct contact with the substrate surface with no layers in between.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, a &#x201c;patterned substrate&#x201d; or &#x201c;multicolor substrate&#x201d; refers to a substrate with a plurality of different material surfaces. In some embodiments, a patterned substrate comprises at least a first surface and a second surface. In some embodiments, the first surface comprises a dielectric material and the second surface comprises a metallic material. In some embodiments, the first surface comprises a metallic material and the second surface comprises a dielectric material. In some embodiments, the metallic material may be comprised of several different metallic materials each with an exposed surface.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the terms &#x201c;reactive gas&#x201d;, &#x201c;process gas&#x201d;, &#x201c;precursor&#x201d;, &#x201c;reactant&#x201d;, and the like, are used interchangeably to mean a gas that includes a species which is reactive with a substrate surface. For example, a first &#x201c;reactive gas&#x201d; may simply adsorb onto the surface of a substrate and be available for further chemical reaction with a second reactive gas.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Some embodiments of the disclosure provide methods of selective deposition which utilize blocking compounds comprising different reactive moieties. Some embodiments of the disclosure provide methods of selective deposition which utilize fluorinated blocking compounds.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term &#x201c;selectively depositing on a first surface over a second surface&#x201d;, and the like, means that a first amount of a film or layer is deposited on the first surface and a second amount of film or layer is deposited on the second surface, where the second amount of film is less than the first amount of film, or no film is deposited on the second surface. The term &#x201c;over&#x201d; used in this regard does not imply a physical orientation of one surface on top of another surface but rather a relationship of the thermodynamic or kinetic properties of the chemical reaction with one surface relative to the other surface. For example, selectively depositing a cobalt film onto a copper surface over a dielectric surface means that the cobalt film deposits on the copper surface and less or no cobalt film deposits on the dielectric surface; or that the formation of the cobalt film on the copper surface is thermodynamically or kinetically favorable relative to the formation of a cobalt film on the dielectric surface.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, &#x201c;selectively&#x201d; means that the subject material forms on the target surface at a rate greater than or equal to about 5&#xd7;, 10&#xd7;, 15&#xd7;, 20&#xd7;, 25&#xd7;, 30&#xd7;, 35&#xd7;, 40&#xd7;, 45&#xd7; or 50&#xd7; the rate of formation on the non-selected surface. Stated differently, the selectivity for the target material surface relative to the non-selected surface is greater than or equal to about 5:1, 10:1, 15:1, 20:1, 25:1, 30:1, 35:1, 40:1, 45:1 or 50:1.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">One strategy to achieve selective deposition employs the use of blocking layers in which a blocking layer is formed on predetermined substrate materials upon which deposition is to be avoided with negligible impact to the substrate material on what deposition is to be achieved. A film can be deposited on the target substrate material while deposition on other substrate materials is &#x201c;blocked&#x201d; by the blocking layer. In some embodiments, the blocking layer can be optionally removed without net adverse effects to the deposited film.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Some embodiments of the disclosure incorporate a blocking layer typically referred to as a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) or SAM layer. A self-assembled monolayer (SAM) consists of an ordered arrangement of spontaneously assembled organic molecules (SAM molecules or blocking compounds) adsorbed on a surface. These molecules are typically comprised a moieties with an affinity for the substrate (head group) and a relatively long, inert, linear hydrocarbon moiety (tail group). Some SAM molecules are fundamentally a surfactant which has a hydrophilic functional head with a hydrophobic carbon chain tail.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Blocking layer or SAM formation occurs through the fast adsorption of reactive head groups at the surface and the slow association of tail groups through van der Waals interactions. SAM molecules are chosen such that the head group selectively reacts with the substrate materials to be blocked during deposition. Deposition is then performed, and in some embodiments, the SAMs can be removed, for example through a thermal decomposition (with desorption of any byproducts) or an integration-compatible ashing process.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A representative process flow for selective deposition may include a) providing a patterned substrate, b) growing a SAM (either by CVD, ALD, or immersion), and c) selective deposition (e.g. CVD or ALD) of a film. In the representative process flow, the SAM is used as a sacrificial layer to enable selective deposition.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Fundamentally the SAM growth on a surface is a chemisorption process. Determined by chemisorption kinetics, the coverage of a SAM layer follows the Elovich equation</p><p id="p-0030" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <msub>    <mi>d</mi>    <mi>q</mi>   </msub>   <msub>    <mi>d</mi>    <mi>t</mi>   </msub>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mi>&#x3b1;</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>exp</mi>    <mo>&#x2061;</mo>    <mo>(</mo>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mo>-</mo>      <mi>&#x3b2;</mi>     </mrow>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>q</mi>    </mrow>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0031" num="0000">where q is the amount of chemisorption, t is time, a is the initial rate of chemisorption (mmol/g-min) and &#x3b2; is the desorption constant (g/mmol). Accordingly, the coverage of a SAM layer as the function of time follows an asymptotic trend. As a result, the selectivity of SAM-based depositions follows a similar trend as well (i.e. as coverage increases, selectivity also increases).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one or more embodiment of the disclosure is directed to a processing method <b>100</b>.

In some embodiments, the metallic materials comprise or consist essentially of conductive metal nitrides (e.g., titanium nitride). As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term &#x201c;consists essentially of&#x201d; means that greater than or equal to about 95%, 98% or 99% of the specified material is the stated material.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">Without being bound by theory, the inventors have found that substrate surfaces which contain multiple metallic materials present a unique challenge. Each reactive moiety class reacts well with certain metals, but less effectively or not at all with other metals.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">Accordingly, some embodiments of the disclosure relate to blocking compounds which comprise multiple reactive moieties such that differing metallic surfaces can be effectively blocked with a single blocking compound exposure. In some embodiments, the blocking compound comprises a first moiety and a different second moiety. In some embodiments, the first moiety and the second moiety are selected from phosphonates (e.g., acids or esters), carbon-carbon double bonds, carbon-carbon triple bonds, amines, thiols and silanes.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">In some embodiments, the first moiety is a phosphonate.
