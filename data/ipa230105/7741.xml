For example, microwaves have been tested and applied in plasma processes (e.g., powder processing, chemical vapor infiltration, surface modification, etc.), chemical processing and synthesis, and waste remediation. Although significant effort has been made to expand the industrial use of microwave energy, little progress has been made.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disadvantages commonly associated with the deployment of microwave energy include (i) the difficulties faced when designing an apparatus or process, (ii) the need for expensive equipment, (iii) an overall limited number of uses, (iv) the change in dielectric properties that can occur as temperature increases, or (v) a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There remains a need for apparatuses, systems, and methods for heating with microwaves that overcome one or more of these disadvantages, including apparatuses and methods for producing a heated fluid that may be employed, for example, in further processes as a source of heat.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Provided herein are apparatuses, systems, and methods that address one or more of the foregoing disadvantages, including methods for heating that do not rely completely upon the dielectric properties of a fluid. As a result, embodiments of the methods provided herein are not material specific, and are applicable to a broad range of fluids, as described herein, including organic fluids, inorganic fluids, aqueous fluids, etc., each of which may be polar or non-polar. The apparatuses and methods provided herein may include or rely on, respectively, a fixed bed system in which a flow of fluid contacts a susceptor material irradiated with electromagnetic waves, such as microwaves. The electromagnetic waves may be converted to heat by the susceptor material, thereby heating the fluid in a process that may be continuous. A fluid may be passed through the fixed bed system once or two or more times until a desired temperature of the fluid is reached. The apparatuses and systems herein also may permit a pressure to be applied to at least a part of the apparatuses or systems, such as a pressure greater than the critical pressure of a fluid, which may keep all or at least a portion of the fluid in the liquid phase and/or the supercritical phase.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, apparatuses are provided herein. In some embodiments, the apparatuses include a tube; and an applicator, wherein (i) a first end of the tube is fixably mounted or spring mounted to the applicator, and (ii) at least a portion of the tube is arranged in the applicator. In some embodiments, the apparatuses include a tube; a susceptor material disposed in the tube; and an applicator, wherein (i) a first end of the tube is fixably mounted or spring mounted to the applicator, and (ii) at least a portion of the tube and at least a portion the susceptor material in the tube is arranged in the applicator. In some embodiments, a second end of the tube is fixably mounted or spring mounted to the applicator. The tube may include an inlet, an outlet, or an inlet and an outlet. The apparatuses also may include one or more microwave generators, wherein the one or more microwave generators are positioned to introduce a plurality of microwaves into an applicator to irradiate at least a portion of the susceptor material with the plurality of microwaves.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the apparatuses include a container defining an internal volume configured to receive the susceptor particles; at least one retention device disposed in or adjacent to the internal volume and configured to retain the susceptor particles in the internal volume while allowing a fluid to flow out of the internal volume; and an electromagnetic wave emission structure configured to introduce electromagnetic waves into the internal volume for irradiation of the susceptor particles contained in the internal volume. The electromagnetic wave emission structure may include an electromagnetic wave-transparent section of the container through which electromagnetic waves can pass from outside the container into the internal volume. The container may include a tubular section formed of an electromagnetic wave-transparent material that makes up the electromagnetic wave-transparent section of the container. The apparatus may include an applicator for directing electromagnetic waves through the electromagnetic wave-transparent section and into the internal volume. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic wave emission structure is at least partially disposed in the container.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, systems are provided herein. In some embodiments, the systems include a fluid source in which the fluid is disposed, wherein the fluid source is in fluid communication with the tube; and a pump configured to provide (i) the fluid to the tube and/or (ii) a pressure within the tube, wherein the pump is in fluid communication with the apparatus and the fluid source.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another aspect, methods of heating a material, such as a fluid, are provided.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the methods include contacting a fluid with a heated susceptor material, such as susceptor particles, to thereby heat the fluid at a rate of at least 100&#xb0; C./min, at least 200&#xb0; C./min, at least 300&#xb0; C./min, at least 400&#xb0; C./min, or at least 500&#xb0; C./min.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the methods include providing an apparatus or system as described herein; disposing a fluid in the inlet of the tube at a flow rate; introducing a plurality of electromagnetic waves into the applicator to irradiate at least a portion of the susceptor material with the plurality of electromagnetic waves to generate heat while the fluid is in the tube to produce a heated fluid; and collecting the heated fluid at the outlet of the tube. In some embodiments, the methods also include (i) disposing at least a portion of the heated fluid in the inlet of the tube; (ii) introducing the plurality of electromagnetic waves into the applicator to irradiate at least a portion of the susceptor material with the plurality of electromagnetic waves to generate heat while the heated fluid is in the tube to produce a further heated fluid; and (iii) collecting the further heated fluid at the outlet of the tube.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the methods include providing an apparatus or system as described herein; arranging a material adjacent the tube; introducing a plurality of electromagnetic waves into the applicator to irradiate at least a portion of the susceptor material with the plurality of electromagnetic waves to generate heat while the material is adjacent the tube to produce a heated material.

a fluid with electromagnetic energy, such as microwave energy. The apparatuses include a tube in which a susceptor material is disposed, and the tube may be at least partially arranged in an applicator.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Containers/Tubes</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The apparatuses herein may include a container. The container may define an internal volume configured to receive a susceptor material, such as particles of a susceptor material. The container may have an inlet, an outlet, or an inlet and an outlet. The inlet may be a fluid inlet for receiving the fluid in the internal volume, and the outlet may be a fluid outlet for discharging the fluid from the internal volume. An apparatus may include one container (e.g., tube) or more than one (e.g., two) containers (e.g., tube). If a tube is described herein as having a feature, then such feature may be a feature of a container; conversely, if a container is described herein as having a feature, then such feature may be a feature of a tube.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The container may be a tube. As used herein, the term &#x201c;tube&#x201d; refers to a container that (i) is elongated (e.g., a length:width ratio of at least 1.1:1, at least 1.5:1, or at least 2:1) or includes an elongated portion, (ii) defines an internal volume having, at any point, a cross-sectional shape that is non-polygonal (e.g., circular, elliptical, etc), or (iii) a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The internal reservoir of a container, such as a tube, may be in fluid connection with the inlet and the outlet, when an inlet and outlet are present. A container, such as a tube, may be (i) straight, curved (e.g., feature one or more coils), bent, or a combination thereof, (ii) have any outer or inner cross-sectional shape (e.g., polygonal, non-polygonal, etc.) or area, or (iii) have any outer or inner dimensions. The &#x201c;inner cross-sectional shape&#x201d; and the &#x201c;inner dimensions&#x201d; may refer to the cross-sectional shape, dimensions, and/or volume capacity of the internal reservoir. The &#x201c;outer or inner dimensions&#x201d; are outer or inner diameters, respectively, when the tube is substantially cylindrical or the internal reservoir has a substantially circular cross-sectional shape.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A container, such as a tube, may have any outer dimension(s) and any inner dimension(s). Since a difference between the outer dimension(s) and the inner dimension(s) determine the thickness of a container's wall, the outer dimension(s) and inner dimension(s) may be selected so that a container's wall can (i) withstand one or more parameters of the methods described herein, such as pressure, (ii) permit a susceptor material to be irradiated effectively or to a desired extent with microwaves (e.g., microwaves of a certain frequency and/or wavelength), (iii) retain at least a portion of a susceptor material at a desired location, or (iv) a combination thereof. A container, such as a tube, may have an outer dimension of about 5 mm to about 3 m, about 10 mm to about 3 m, about 20 mm to about 3 m, about 50 mm to about 3 m, about 100 mm to about 3 m, about 250 mm to about 3 m, about 500 mm to about 3 m, about 1 m to about 3 m, or about 2 m to about 3 m, and an inner dimension may be selected to provide a desired thickness of a container's (e.g., tube's) wall.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the tube, or at least a portion thereof, is substantially cylindrical, and has an internal reservoir having a substantially circular cross-sectional shape. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;substantially cylindrical&#x201d; refers to an object or portion thereof having a substantially circular outer cross-sectional shape, wherein the smallest outer diameter of the object at any point along its length is less than its largest outer diameter at any point along its length by no more than 20% (e.g., 100 and at least 80), 15% (e.g., 100 and at least 85), 10% (e.g., 100 and at least 90), 5% (e.g., 100 and at least 95), or 1% (e.g., 100 and at least 99). As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;substantially circular&#x201d; refers to a shape having a smallest diameter (e.g., outer diameter of tube, inner diameter of internal reservoir) that is less than its largest diameter (e.g., outer diameter of tube, inner diameter of internal reservoir) by no more than 20% (e.g., 10 and at least 8), 15% (e.g., 10 and at least 8.5), 10% (e.g., 10 and at least 9), 5% (e.g., 10 and at least 9.5), or 1% (e.g., 10 and at least 9.9).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, a portion of a container, such as a tube, formed of an electromagnetic wave-transparent material is substantially cylindrical, and has an outer diameter of about 3 mm to about 200 mm, and an inner diameter of about 2 mm to about 150 mm. In some embodiments, a portion of a container, such as a tube, formed of an electromagnetic wave-transparent material is substantially cylindrical, and has an outer diameter of about 3 mm to about 150 mm, and an inner diameter of about 2 mm to about 100 mm. In some embodiments, a portion of a container, such as a tube, formed of an electromagnetic wave-transparent material is substantially cylindrical, and has an outer diameter of about 3 mm to about 75 mm, and an inner diameter of about 2 mm to about 60 mm. In some embodiments, a portion of a container, such as a tube, formed of an electromagnetic wave-transparent material is substantially cylindrical, and has an outer diameter of about 15 mm to about 75 mm, and an inner diameter of about 10 mm to about 60 mm. In some embodiments, a portion of a container, such as a tube, formed of an electromagnetic wave-transparent material is substantially cylindrical, and has an outer diameter of about 45 mm to about 60 mm, and an inner diameter of about 30 mm to about 44 mm. In some embodiments, a portion of a container, such as a tube, formed of an electromagnetic wave-transparent material is substantially cylindrical, and has an outer diameter of about 50 mm to about 54 mm, and an inner diameter of about 40 mm to about 44 mm. Other dimensions are envisioned, however, as the apparatuses herein, including the containers (e.g., tubes), may be scaled to accommodate any fluid flow. For example, a portion of a container, such as a tube, formed of an electromagnetic wave-transparent material may be substantially cylindrical, and have an outer diameter of about 0.5 m to about 3 m, about 1 m to 3 m, or about 2 m to about 3 m, and an inner diameter of about 0.4 m to about 2.9 m, about 0.9 m to about 2.9 m, or about 1.9 m to about 2.9 m.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A container (e.g., tube) may be a pressure container. A &#x201c;pressure container&#x201d; refers to a container configured to withstand a pressure of at least 1 bar, at least 5 bar, at least 10 bar, at least 15 bar, at least 20 bar, or at least 25 bar.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The inlet and the outlet, when present, may include a shared opening or two openings of any size and at any location that permit a fluid to enter and exit a container (e.g., tube), respectively. When, for example, the container is a tube, the tube may have an inlet arranged at a first end or a second end of the tube, and a tube may have an outlet arranged at a second end or a first end, respectively, of the tube. Alternatively, a tube may have an inlet and an outlet arranged at the first end of a tube, or an inlet and an outlet arranged at a second end of a tube. As used herein, the phrases &#x201c;first end&#x201d;, &#x201c;at a first end&#x201d;, &#x201c;second end&#x201d;, &#x201c;at a second end&#x201d;, and the like refer to regions beginning at one of the terminal points of a container, such as a tube, and extending less than or equal to 50% of the length of the container (e.g., tube) towards the opposite end of the container (e.g., tube).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A container, such as a tube, may be arranged at any orientation when present in the apparatuses and systems described herein, or when used in the methods described herein. For example, a container, such as a tube, may be arranged so that a longitudinal axis of the container (e.g., tube) is parallel (0&#xb0;) to a surface (e.g., ground, floor, ceiling, wall, etc.) that supports an apparatus. As a further example, a container (e.g., tube) may be arranged so that its longitudinal axis is perpendicular (90&#xb0;) to a surface (e.g., ground, floor, ceiling, wall, etc.) that supports an apparatus. In some embodiments, a container (e.g., tube) is arranged at any angle from 0&#xb0; to 90&#xb0; relative to a surface (e.g., ground, floor, ceiling, wall, etc.) that supports an apparatus. For example, an angle between a longitudinal axis of the container (e.g., tube) and a surface (e.g., ground, floor, ceiling, wall, etc.) that supports the apparatus may be 0&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, 10&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, 20&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, 30&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, 40&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, 50&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, 60&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, 70&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, or 80&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;. Therefore, when a container (e.g., tube) includes an inlet and an outlet, the container's inlet and outlet may be arranged at the same or different heights relative to a surface (e.g., ground, floor, ceiling, etc.) that supports an apparatus. For example, an inlet of a tube may be arranged closer to a supporting surface than an outlet of the container, thereby allowing the container (e.g., tube) to operate in &#x201c;upflow&#x201d; mode. Alternatively, an outlet of a container (e.g., tube) may be arranged closer to a supporting surface than an inlet of the container (e.g., tube), thereby allowing the container (e.g., tube) to operate in &#x201c;downflow&#x201d; mode.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A container (e.g., tube) may be of any length, i.e., the distance of a straight line from a terminal point of the first end or, if present, first cap to the second end or, if present, second cap of the container (e.g., tube). A container (e.g., tube), for example, may have a length of about 0.1 m to about 5 m, about 0.1 m to about 4 m, about 0.1 m to about 3 m, about 0.5 m to about 3 m, about 0.5 m to about 2 m, about 0.5 m to about 1.5 m, or about 1 m to about 1.5 m. Other lengths are envisioned, however, as the apparatuses herein, including the containers, may be scaled to accommodate any fluid flow.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A container (e.g., tube) may include (e.g., be formed of) any material that permits a susceptor material in the container to be irradiated with electromagnetic waves, such as microwaves. In some embodiments, a container, at least in part, is formed of one or more materials that include an electromagnetic wave-transparent material. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;electromagnetic wave-transparent material&#x201d; refers to materials that remain substantially unheated (i.e., a temperature increase of less than or equal to 5%) when irradiated with one or more types of electromagnetic waves, such as those described herein, for a time sufficient to increase the temperature of 1 L of water (originally at ambient temperature) by at least 5%. In other words, the electromagnetic wave-transparent material is transparent with regard to the one or more types of electromagnetic waves selected for use, and not necessarily all electromagnetic waves. In some embodiments, a container (e.g., tube), at least in part, is formed of one or more materials that include a microwave-transparent material. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;microwave-transparent material&#x201d; refers to materials, typically low-loss dielectric materials, that remain substantially unheated (i.e., a temperature increase of less than or equal to 5%) when irradiated with microwaves for a time sufficient to increase the temperature of 1 L of water (originally at ambient temperature) by at least 5%. An electromagnetic wave-transparent material, such as a microwave-transparent material, may be selected from ceramic, polymer, glass, fiberglass, an inorganic compound (e.g., a mineral), or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the inorganic compound includes fused silica, which may be commonly referred to as quartz. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic wave-transparent material, such as a microwave-transparent material, includes silicon nitride. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic wave-transparent material, such as a microwave-transparent material, includes a ceramic. In some embodiments, the ceramic includes silicon, aluminum, nitrogen, and oxygen, which may be referred to as a &#x201c;SiAlON&#x201d; ceramic. In some embodiments, the ceramic includes alumina. The alumina may be a commercially available alumina, which may include up to 10%, by weight, up to 5%, by weight, or up to 1%, by weight, of impurities, such as silica, calcia, magnesia, iron oxide, sodium oxide, titania, chromic oxide, potassium oxide, boron oxide, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the alumina is 99.8% alumina (McDaniel Advanced Ceramic Technologies, Pennsylvania, USA).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A container (e.g., tube) may be formed from one or more materials. For example, at least a portion of tube that is arranged in an applicator may be formed of one or more electromagnetic wave-transparent materials, while one or more other materials may be used to form the remainder of the container. For example, a container may be formed of a ceramic and a metal.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, the container (e.g., tube) is a monolithic structure formed of one or more electromagnetic wave-transparent materials. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;monolithic structure&#x201d; refers to a structure formed of a single piece of a material (e.g., ceramic, metal, etc.). A container having a monolithic structure, for example, may be a tube that includes a single tube-shaped piece formed entirely of a ceramic. The ceramic monolithic structure may include an inlet and an outlet at a first end and second end, respectively. In some embodiments, a monolithic structure includes one or more structural features (e.g., a depression, groove, ridge, flange, etc.) to accommodate another part of the apparatuses provided herein, such as a clamp or other part of a head unit. A monolithic structure, however, may lack one or more structural features configured to accommodate another part of the apparatuses provided herein.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the container (e.g., tube) includes a first cap arranged at the first end of the container (e.g., tube), a second cap arranged at the second end of the container (e.g., tube), or a first cap and a second cap arranged at the first end and the second end of the container (e.g., tube), respectively. In some embodiments, the inlet of the container (e.g., tube) is provided by the first cap. In some embodiments, the outlet of the container (e.g., tube) is provided by the second cap. For example, the first cap and/or the second cap may define an aperture that permits fluid to enter or exit an internal reservoir of a container (e.g., tube), respectively. The first cap and/or second cap may be formed of any material. In some embodiments, the first cap and/or second cap is formed of a material having a coefficient of thermal expansion that is identical or similar (e.g., within 10%) to the coefficient of thermal expansion of an electromagnetic wave-transparent material, such as a microwave-transparent material, of a container (e.g., tube). In some embodiments, the first cap and/or the second cap are formed of a metal. The metal may be an alloy, such as an alloy including iron, cobalt, and nickel (e.g., a KOVAR&#xae; alloy). In some embodiments, the first cap and/or the second cap includes a metal, a portion of the tube includes a ceramic, and the first cap, the second cap, or both the first cap and the second cap are adjoined in any manner, including a manner that forms a seal between the tube and the first cap, second cap, or both the first cap and the second cap. For example, a container (e.g., tube) may be adjoined to a first cap, a second cap, or a first cap and a second cap by (i) a ceramic-to-metal braze, (ii) an adhesive, (iii) securing a threaded end of a tube into a first cap and/or second cap, which may also be threaded, or (iv) a combination thereof. The braze may result in a seal, which may be sufficient to withstand one or more parameters of the methods described herein, such as pressure. In some embodiments, a portion of the container (e.g., tube) includes alumina, and the first cap, the second cap, or both the first cap and the second cap includes KOVAR&#xae; alloy. The KOVAR&#xae; alloy may be adjoined to a ceramic, such as alumina, by (i) a ceramic-to-metal braze, (ii) threading on one or both of the ceramic and KOVAR&#xae; alloy, or (iii) a combination thereof. The adhesive may be a ceramic adhesive, such as those that are commercially available from Sauereisen, Inc. (PA, USA). The first cap and/or second cap generally may have any shape. For example, a first cap and/or a second cap may have a feature (e.g., a depression, groove, ridge, flange, etc.) that corresponds to another part of a container (e.g., tube), system, or apparatus herein. In some embodiments, a first cap and/or second cap includes one or more features (e.g., a depression, a groove, ridge, flange, etc. of any polygonal or non-polygonal shape), which may permit the first cap and/or the second cap to accommodate a clamp or other device, which may be used as, or as part of, a seal as described herein, such as a seal between the first cap and/or the second cap to another part (e.g., a head unit) of the apparatuses or systems herein.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">An embodiment of a tube is depicted at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> (side view), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> (end view), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> (end view).

In some embodiments (not shown), the inlet <b>175</b> is not present.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The outer dimensions of a container (e.g., tube) may be selected to conform with the dimensions of an applicator. An applicator, for example, may include a structure that defines one or more apertures in which a tube is arranged. The container (e.g., tube) may have an outer dimension that permits the container (e.g., tube) to contact at least a portion of one or more apertures of an applicator. The container (e.g., tube) may have an outer dimension that is about 0.1 mm to about 10 mm, about 0.1 mm to about 5 mm, about 2 mm to about 4 mm, or about 3 mm to about 3.5 mm less than a corresponding dimension of an aperture of an applicator. An applicator may include one or more chambers defined by walls, wherein each of the walls define an aperture in which a tube is arranged, and a relatively small difference between the outer dimension of the tube and the dimension of the aperture may reduce or eliminate microwave leakage.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">A container (e.g., tube) also may include a microwave disruptor. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;microwave disruptor&#x201d; refers to a device configured to reduce or eliminate the ability of microwaves to heat at least a part of one or more components of an apparatus. For example, a microwave disrupter may be configured to disrupt the resonance of microwaves. In some embodiments, a microwave disruptor is arranged inside a container (e.g., tube). A microwave disruptor may be mounted in any manner to any part of a container (e.g., tube). For example, a microwave disruptor may be fixably mounted to any part of a container (e.g., tube).

A microwave generator may be positioned to introduce a plurality of microwaves into a chamber. The number of chambers may be greater than, equal to, or less than the number of microwave generators. A plurality of electromagnetic waves, such as microwaves, may be introduced into a chamber (i) via an aperture defined by an outer wall of the vessel, (ii) by a component of a microwave generator disposed in a chamber, (iii) by a component of a microwave generator disposed in a waveguide, or (iv) a combination thereof. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;microwave generator&#x201d; refers to devices that generate microwaves, including the components of the devices, such as an antenna, coaxial cable, transmission lines, etc. In some embodiments, an electromagnetic wave emission structure includes one or more components of a microwave generator, such as an antenna, coaxial cable, etc. When the methods described herein are performed with electromagnetic waves other than microwaves, the &#x201c;microwave generators&#x201d; may be replaced with generators of the other types of electromagnetic waves provided herein.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;introduced into a chamber via an aperture defined by an outer wall of the vessel&#x201d; refers to and includes introducing microwaves with a microwave generator positioned outside of a chamber, and introducing the microwaves into a chamber via an aperture defined by an outer wall of the vessel. Prior to traversing the aperture, the microwave may pass through a waveguide, coaxial cable, or other transmission line.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;introduced into a chamber by a microwave generator disposed in a chamber&#x201d; refers to introducing microwaves in a chamber with a microwave generator having at least one component, such as an antenna, that is arranged in a chamber. Other components of such a microwave generator may be arranged outside of the chamber, and may be connected, via a cable, to the one or more components, such as an antenna, that are arranged in the chamber. When microwaves are introduced inside a chamber with an antenna or otherwise, the microwaves may not pass through a waveguide arranged outside of chamber, and the chamber, therefore, may not include a waveguide.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;introduced into a chamber by a microwave generator disposed in a waveguide&#x201d; refers to generating microwaves with a microwave generator having at least one component, such as an antenna, that is arranged in a waveguide. Other components of such a microwave generator may be arranged outside of the waveguide, and may be connected, via a cable, to the one or more components, such as an antenna, that are arranged in the waveguide. When microwaves are generated inside a waveguide with an antenna or otherwise, the microwaves, before entering the chamber via an aperture defined by an outer wall of the vessel, may traverse at least a portion of the waveguide, including the portion of the waveguide that exists between (i) the component of the microwave generator in the waveguide and (ii) the chamber or aperture of the chamber.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, at least one of the one or more microwave generators is positioned to introduce a plurality of microwaves into at least one of the chambers.

In some embodiments, a first, second, third, etc. microwave generator is positioned to introduce a plurality of microwaves into a first, second, third, etc. chamber, respectively. In some embodiments, the number of chambers exceeds the number of microwave generators. Therefore, a microwave generator may not be positioned at every chamber. In some embodiments, the apparatus includes three to six microwave generators, and four to six chambers. In some embodiments, the number of chambers is less than the number of microwave generators. Therefore, two or more microwave generators may be positioned at one or more of the chambers. The chambers of an applicator may be single mode chambers or multimode chambers.

A waveguide, therefore, may have any external shape, and the shape and dimensions of the passageway may be configured to reduce or eliminate energy loss of microwaves. When a waveguide is present, it may extend from and/or be attached at or near an aperture of a chamber. A microwave generator may be positioned and/or attached to the other end of the waveguide. The aperture of the chamber from which a waveguide extends and/or is attached may be at least partially covered with an electromagnetic-wave transparent material (e.g., a microwave-transparent material), such as a tile of alumina, TEFLON&#xae; polytetrafluoroethylene, fused silica, etc. In some embodiments, a waveguide is arranged between each chamber and microwave generator.

In some embodiments, the flow rate is at least 5 liters/minute, at least 10 liters/minute, at least 15 liters/minute, or at least 20 liters/minute. As used herein, the term &#x201c;flow rate&#x201d; refers to the rate at which a fluid is disposed in the inlet of a tube. As the temperature of a fluid increases, the viscosity of the fluid may decrease, thereby increasing the likelihood that the flow rate may increase. An apparatus or method may include one or more features that accommodates this phenomenon and/or counters the tendency of the flow rate to increase. Not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, a mass flow rate of a fluid may remain constant, even if a volume flow rate changes due to a change in viscosity and/or other reason.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">A fluid may be provided to a container (e.g., tube) by any known equipment. For example, a pump, such as a diaphragm pump or a centrifugal pump, may be used to dispose a fluid in a tube. In some embodiments, a pump, such as a positive displacement pump, is used to dispose a fluid in a tube at a flow rate. In some embodiments, a valve is used to impart a desired flow rate to a fluid disposed in a tube.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0168">Any pressure may be present inside a container (e.g., tube) during all or a portion of the methods provided herein. In some embodiments, the pressure inside the container (e.g., tube) is less than or equal to the critical pressure of the fluid. In some embodiments, the pressure inside the tube is greater than the critical pressure of the fluid. In some embodiments, the pressure inside the tube exceeds the critical pressure of the fluid by at least 1%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 25%, or at least 50%. In some embodiments, the pressure inside the container (e.g., tube) exceeds the critical pressure of the fluid by about 1% to about 50%, about 5% to about 50%, about 10% to about 50%, or about 25% to about 50%. This parameter may eliminate or reduce the likelihood that a liquid fluid converts to the gas phase. A fluid may be kept at a pressure above its critical pressure before, during, and after being disposed in a container (e.g., tube). In some embodiments, a fluid is pressurized (i) prior to being disposed in a container (e.g., tube), (ii) during and/or after its collection at the second end of the container (e.g., tube), or (iii) a combination thereof. Therefore, a heated fluid or further heated fluid may be kept at a pressure that exceeds the fluid's critical pressure after its collection for further use. For example, when a method includes flowing a fluid through a volume the heated susceptor particles, the flowing of the fluid through the volume of the heated susceptor particles can be carried out at an elevated pressure to prevent vaporization of the liquid. In some embodiments, a pressure inside a container (e.g., tube) during all or a portion of the methods provided herein is about 1 bar to about 250 bar, about 1.1 bar to about 250 bar, about 5 bar to about 250 bar, about 5 bar to about 225 bar, about 5 bar to about 200 bar, about 5 bar to about 150 bar, about 5 bar to about 100 bar, or about 10 bar to about 100 bar. In some embodiments, a pressure inside a container (e.g., tube) during all or a portion of the methods provided herein is at least 2 bar, at least 5 bar, at least 10 bar, at least 25 bar, at least 50 bar, at least 100 bar, at least 150 bar, or at least 200 bar.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0169">When disposed in a tube, a fluid may be at an ambient temperature that is greater than the freezing point of the fluid. In some embodiments, a fluid has a temperature of about 15&#xb0; C. to about 35&#xb0; C. when it is disposed for the first time in a tube. In some embodiments, a fluid has a temperature of about 20&#xb0; C. to about 30&#xb0; C. when it is disposed for the first time in a tube. In some embodiments, the heated fluid or the further heated fluid has a temperature of about 50&#xb0; C. to about 1,500&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 1,250&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 1,000&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 900&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 800&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 600&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C., about 200&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C., about 300&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C., or about 400&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C.

In some embodiments, the heated fluid or the further heated fluid has a temperature of about 100&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C., about 200&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C., about 300&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C., about 400&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C., about 500&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C., about 600&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0170">In some embodiments, the methods provided herein heat a fluid by at least 200&#xb0; C., at least 250&#xb0; C., at least 300&#xb0; C., at least 400&#xb0; C., or at least 500&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0171">In some embodiments, a susceptor material irradiated with electromagnetic radiation, as described herein, has a temperature of about 50&#xb0; C. to about 1,500&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 1,250&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 1,000&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 900&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 800&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 600&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C., about 200&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C., about 300&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C., about 400&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C. about 250&#xb0; C. to about 1,500&#xb0; C., about 350&#xb0; C. to about 1,500&#xb0; C., about 450&#xb0; C. to about 1,500&#xb0; C., about 300&#xb0; C. to about 1,000&#xb0; C., about 300&#xb0; C. to about 800&#xb0; C., or about 300&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0172">In some embodiments, the methods provided herein heat a fluid predominantly by direct heat exchange with a heated susceptor material. In other words, a majority (&#x3e;50%) of the heat or temperature increase imparted to a fluid results from the direct heat exchange with a heat susceptor material. In some embodiments, less than 25 percent, less than 20 percent, less than 15 percent, less than 10 percent, or less than 5 percent of the heating of the fluid is caused by direct absorption of the electromagnetic energy. The ability of a fluid to absorb electromagnetic energy directly may decrease as its temperature increases. A temperature increase, for example, may cause a fluid's dielectric constant to decrease, thereby increasing the percentage of heating achieved by an irradiated susceptor material.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0173">In some embodiments, the methods include providing an apparatus or system as described herein; arranging a material adjacent the tube; introducing a plurality of electromagnetic waves into the applicator to irradiate at least a portion of the susceptor material with the plurality of electromagnetic waves to generate heat while the material is adjacent the tube to produce a heated material. The material may include a fluid, a solid, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0174">The apparatuses and systems provided herein may be configured to accommodate the arranging of a material adjacent a tube. A tube, for example, may extend from an applicator a distance suitable to accommodate arranging a material adjacent a tube. An applicator may include a gap (e.g., a gap between chambers or modular units, a gap between a tube and an aperture, etc.) that permits a material to be arranged adjacent a tube. An applicator may include a chamber having one or more apertures that permits a material to be arranged adjacent a tube, and such a chamber may or may not be associated with a generator of electromagnetic waves.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0175">In some embodiments, the arranging of the material adjacent the tube includes contacting the tube with the material. For example, a liquid or a solid, such as a textile or other flexible material, may contact an outer surface of a tube. In some embodiments, all or a portion of a ribbon or strip of a solid, such as a textile or other flexible material, may be placed into contact with a tube. For example, a solid, such as a textile or other flexible material, may be brought into contact with a tube as the textile or other flexible material is pulled by one or more rollers or otherwise. As a further example, a liquid may be configured to pass a location that is adjacent a tube. A flowing liquid, in some embodiments, may contact an outer surface of a tube.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Systems</heading><p id="p-0178" num="0176">Also provided herein are systems that include the apparatuses described herein, including systems that may be used to perform the methods described herein.
