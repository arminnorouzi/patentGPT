level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0003">An organic light emission phenomenon generally refers to a phenomenon converting electrical energy to light energy using an organic material. An organic light emitting device using an organic light emission phenomenon normally has a structure including an anode, a cathode, and an organic material layer therebetween. Herein, the organic material layer is often formed in a multilayer structure formed with different materials in order to increase efficiency and stability of the organic light emitting device, and for example, can be formed with a hole injection layer, a hole transfer layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transfer layer, an electron injection layer and the like. When a voltage is applied between the two electrodes in such an organic light emitting device structure, holes and electrons are injected to the organic material layer from the anode and the cathode, respectively, and when the injected holes and electrons meet, excitons are formed, and light emits when these excitons fall back to the ground state.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0004">Development of new materials for such an organic light emitting device has been continuously required.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0005">The present specification is directed to providing an organic light emitting device.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0006">One embodiment of the present specification provides an organic light emitting device including an anode;

In addition, a LUMO energy level means a distance from a vacuum level to the LUMO. A determined structure is needed in order to understand electron distribution in a molecule and to understand optical properties. In addition, an electron structure has different structures in neutral, anionic and cationic states depending on the state of charge of the molecule. Although energy levels in neutral, cationic and anionic states are all important in order to drive a device, HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) in a neutral state are typically recognized as important properties. In order to determine a molecular structure of a chemical material, a density functional theory is used to optimize an input structure. For the DFT calculation, a BPW91 calculation method (Becke exchange and Perdew correlation-correlation functional) and a DNP (double numerical basis set including polarization functional) basis set are used. The BPW91 calculation method is described in the reference &#x2018;A. D. Becke, Phys. Rev. A, 38, 3098 (1988)&#x2019; and &#x2018;J. P. Perdew and Y. Wang, Phys. Rev.
