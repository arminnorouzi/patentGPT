The fixing member can surround the outer surface of the medical apparatus, or the medical apparatus can pass through the fixing member and be fixed, so that the fixing plate in the medical apparatus system has a simple structure and is easy to manufacture. In addition, the trajectory includes the starting end and the terminating end. The starting end and the terminating end respectively rotate outwardly or inwardly with respect to the fixing member to respectively form the first arc and the second arc. By designing the arcs respectively close to the starting end and the terminating end, stress can be dispersed, and concentration of the stress at a junction between the fixing member and the fixing plate is avoided, which effectively prevents tearing of the fixing member with respect to the fixing plate body caused by a high instantaneous momentum during transportation, thereby avoiding damage to the medical apparatus caused by shaking of the medical apparatus fixed on the fixing plate.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings

The terms used in the description of the disclosure herein are merely to describe the specific embodiments, not intended to limit the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">First of all, it needs to be emphasized here that a &#x201c;proximal end&#x201d; mentioned in the embodiments of the present invention refers to an end close to an operator during operation; a &#x201c;distal end&#x201d; refers to an end far away from the operator during operation; &#x201c;axial&#x201d; refers to a direction parallel to a connecting line between a center of a distal end and a center of a proximal end of a medical apparatus; and &#x201c;radial&#x201d; refers to a direction perpendicular to an axial direction.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this embodiment provides an adjustable curved sheath tube <b>100</b>, including a hand shank <b>1</b> and a tube body <b>2</b>. A proximal end of the tube body <b>2</b> is connected to the hand shank <b>1</b>. In this embodiment, the adjustable curved sheath tube <b>100</b> is a dual-adjustable curved sheath tube, that is, the tube body <b>2</b> includes two bendable positions.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In terms of the appearance, the hand shank <b>1</b> includes a housing <b>11</b>, a first curvature adjustment knob <b>12</b>, a second curvature adjustment knob <b>13</b>, a front end cover <b>17</b>, and a rear end cover <b>16</b>. The housing <b>11</b> is arranged between the first curvature adjustment knob <b>12</b> and the second curvature adjustment knob <b>13</b>. A distal end of the first curvature adjustment knob <b>12</b> resists against a proximal end of the housing <b>11</b>, and a proximal end of the first curvature adjustment knob <b>12</b> resists against the rear end cover <b>16</b>. A proximal end of the second curvature adjustment knob <b>13</b> resists against a distal end of the housing <b>11</b>, and a distal end of the second curvature adjustment knob <b>13</b> resists against the front end cover <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A distal end of the front end cover <b>17</b> is connected with a horn-type protective sleeve <b>171</b>. The material of the protective sleeve <b>171</b> is silica gel or rubber. The proximal end of the tube body <b>2</b> extends into a proximal end of the protective sleeve <b>171</b>. The protective sleeve <b>171</b> is used for avoiding breakage caused by an extremely large bending angle of part of the tube body <b>2</b> that is in contact with the protective sleeve <b>171</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this embodiment, the first curvature adjustment knob <b>12</b> and the second curvature adjustment knob <b>13</b> rotate respectively with respect to the housing <b>11</b>. An operator can hold the housing <b>11</b> with a hand and grasp the first curvature adjustment knob <b>12</b> or the second curvature adjustment knob <b>13</b> directly with the thumb and the index finger to rotate them, thus making the operation more convenient.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The first curvature adjustment knob <b>12</b> and/or the second curvature adjustment knob <b>13</b> will not directly resist against the housing <b>11</b>. A ring <b>111</b> may be arranged between the first curvature adjustment knob <b>12</b> and/or the second curvature adjustment knob <b>13</b> and the housing <b>11</b>. The ring <b>111</b> is fixedly connected to the housing <b>11</b>, and the first curvature adjustment knob <b>12</b> or the second curvature adjustment knob <b>13</b> resists against the ring <b>111</b>. Relative rotation between the first curvature adjustment knob <b>12</b> or the second curvature adjustment knob <b>13</b> and the ring <b>111</b> can be achieved. The fixed connection may be a fastened connection or glued fixation. Adding the ring <b>111</b> may increase the size of the hand shank <b>1</b> and also provides decoration.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In other embodiments, the first curvature adjustment knob <b>12</b> and/or the second curvature adjustment knob <b>13</b> are located in the middle part of the housing <b>11</b>. That is, the middle part of the housing <b>11</b> is cut off to form a plurality of housing portions. The first curvature adjustment knob <b>12</b> and the second curvature adjustment knob <b>13</b> respectively resist against the adjacent housing parts and may rotate relative to the housing parts.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The housing ills approximately of a columnar structure. The middle part of an outer wall of the housing <b>11</b> is sunken inwardly, and an outer diameter of the middle part of the outer wall of the housing <b>11</b> is less than that of two ends of the outer wall of the housing <b>11</b>, which is convenient for the operator to hold. Optionally, the outer wall of the housing <b>11</b> may be provided with an antiskid line <b>110</b> which is convenient for operation.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a plurality of groups of arc-shaped protrusions are arranged inside the housing <b>11</b>, each group of which includes two adjacent arc-shaped protrusions <b>101</b>, <b>103</b>. An arc-shaped groove <b>104</b> is formed between the two adjacent arc-shaped protrusions <b>101</b>, <b>103</b>. Two ends of the arc-shaped groove <b>104</b> are provided with two groove stop pieces <b>102</b>. In this embodiment, for facilitating machining and assembling, the housing <b>11</b> may be divided from the middle. That is, the housing includes a first housing and a second housing.

The inner-layer tube <b>701</b> and the outer-layer tube <b>703</b> are tube bodies made of high-molecular materials, and the intermediate layer is a woven net tube <b>702</b> or a bourdon tube <b>802</b>. The tube body <b>2</b> is of an integrated tubular structure formed by thermally melting the three layers of structures.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The inner-layer tube <b>701</b> adopts a high-molecular material with high lubricity and low friction, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE), an inner surface of which is smooth, which can ensure that other apparatuses smoothly extend through the inner surface.

That is, the movement trajectory of the first sliding block <b>143</b> and the movement trajectory of the second sliding block <b>153</b> are not along the same straight line. Meanwhile, the first pull wire and the second pull wire are parallel to each other in the tube body. As a whole, in addition to the above-mentioned description that the mutual interference between the first pull wire and the second pull wire can be avoided, it can be mainly implemented so that the bending directions of the first tube section <b>21</b> connected to the first pull wire and the second tube section <b>22</b> connected to the second pull wire are different, so that the tube body of the adjustable curved sheath tube <b>100</b> can bend in multiple directions and can be accurately released in a complex situation, which is convenient for operation.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">It can be understood that the first fixing ring does not need to be provided with a hole structure. One end of the first pull wire is connected to the first sliding block, and the other end of the first pull wire passes through the first fixing ring along the inner wall of the first fixing ring, reaches the distal end of the first fixing ring, and then extends along the outer wall of the first fixing ring until it is connected to the first sliding block again. The second fixing ring may also be disposed in this way, and descriptions thereof are not provided herein.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In order to further prolong the fatigue life cycle of the connection between the pull wire and the fixing ring, a high-strength pull wire material may be used, such as a carbon fiber wire, or a high-strength NiTi multi-strand wire. Compared to a NiTi single wire with an equal outer diameter, the NiTi multi-strand wire has lower fatigue stress, so that when it is connected to the fixing ring, breakage caused by a concentrated fatigue stress is unlikely to occur. Even if one wire is broken, other wires may also adjust the angle of the tube body, and the service life of the pull wire can be prolonged. Meanwhile, if one wire is broken, a pre-warning sound &#x201c;bang&#x201d; will be made to remind an operator that &#x201c;The pull wire of the adjustable curved conveying sheath tube has been broken.
