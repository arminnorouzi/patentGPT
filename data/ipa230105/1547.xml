Note that the embodiment to be described below is only an exemplary one of various embodiments of the present disclosure and should not be construed as limiting. Rather, the exemplary embodiment may be readily modified in various manners depending on a design choice or any other factor without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Also, the drawings to be referred to in the following description of embodiments are schematic representations. That is to say, the ratio of the dimensions (including thicknesses) of respective constituent elements illustrated on the drawings does not always reflect their actual dimensional ratio.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">(1) Overview</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The impact tool <b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may be used as, for example, an impact screwdriver, a hammer drill, an impact drill, an impact drill-screwdriver, or an impact wrench. In the following description of an exemplary embodiment, a situation where the impact tool <b>1</b> is used as an impact screwdriver for fastening a screw will be described as a typical application. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the impact tool <b>1</b> includes a motor <b>15</b>, a control unit <b>4</b>, an output shaft <b>21</b>, a transmission mechanism <b>18</b>, and an impact detection unit <b>49</b>. The control unit <b>4</b> performs vector control on the motor <b>15</b>. The output shaft <b>21</b> is to be coupled to a tip tool <b>28</b>. The transmission mechanism <b>18</b> transmits motive power of the motor <b>15</b> to the output shaft <b>21</b>. The transmission mechanism <b>18</b> includes an impact mechanism <b>17</b>. The impact mechanism <b>17</b> performs an impact operation according to the magnitude of torque applied to the output shaft <b>21</b>. The impact mechanism <b>17</b> applies impacting force to the output shaft <b>21</b> while performing the impact operation. The impact detection unit <b>49</b> determines, based on at least one of an excitation current (current measured value id<b>1</b>) to be supplied to the motor <b>15</b> or a torque current (current measured value iq<b>1</b>) to be supplied to the motor <b>15</b>, whether or not the impact operation is being performed. The control unit <b>4</b> places a limit on an increase in the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the motor <b>15</b> before the impact detection unit <b>49</b> detects the impact operation and removes the limit on the increase in the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> when the impact detection unit <b>49</b> detects the impact operation.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the impact tool <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, a limit is placed on an increase in the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> before the impact mechanism <b>17</b> starts performing the impact operation, thus reducing the chances of a work target such as a screw being tilted with respect to a workpiece such as a wall due to an excessive number N<b>1</b> of revolutions and thereby improving the work efficiency. In addition, this also allows the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> to be increased once the impact mechanism <b>17</b> has started performing the impact operation, thus contributing to improving the work efficiency compared to a situation where the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions cannot be increased.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Also, in a situation where at the beginning of an impact operation, a user attempts to increase the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> by operating the trigger switch <b>29</b> without depending on the control by the control unit <b>4</b>, if he or she lacks skills in operating the trigger switch <b>29</b>, then he or she may be unable to increase the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> to an appropriate level. In contrast, according to this embodiment, the control unit <b>4</b> removes the limit on the increase in the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> after the impact operation has started to be performed, thus making the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions controllable without depending on the user's skills.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The motor <b>15</b> may be a brushless motor. In particular, the motor <b>15</b> according to this embodiment is a synchronous motor. More specifically, the motor <b>15</b> may be a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The motor <b>15</b> includes a rotor <b>13</b> having a permanent magnet <b>131</b> and a stator <b>14</b> having a coil <b>141</b>. The rotor <b>13</b> includes a rotary shaft <b>16</b> which outputs rotational power. The rotor <b>13</b> rotates with respect to the stator <b>14</b> due to electromagnetic interaction between the coil <b>141</b> and the permanent magnet <b>131</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The vector control is a type of motor control method in which a current supplied to the coil <b>141</b> of the motor <b>15</b> is broken down into a current component (excitation current) that generates a magnetic flux and a current component (torque current) that generates a torque (rotational power) and in which these current components are controlled independently of each other.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At least one of the current measured values id<b>1</b>, iq<b>1</b> is used for both purposes of performing the vector control and determining whether or not any impact operation is being performed. This allows a part of a circuit for performing the vector control and a part of a circuit for determining whether or not any impact operation is being performed to be shared. This contributes to reducing the areas and dimensions of circuits provided for the impact tool <b>1</b> and cutting down the cost required for the circuits. In addition, this also improves the accuracy of detection compared to, for example, a situation where a measured value of the output current of the power supply unit <b>32</b> of the impact tool <b>1</b> is used to determine whether or not any impact operation is being performed.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">(2) Impact Tool</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the impact tool <b>1</b> includes a power supply unit <b>32</b>, the motor <b>15</b>, a motor rotation measuring unit <b>27</b>, the transmission mechanism <b>18</b>, the output shaft <b>21</b>, a socket <b>23</b>, and the tip tool <b>28</b>. In addition, the impact tool <b>1</b> further includes a trigger switch <b>29</b> and the control unit <b>4</b>. The control unit <b>4</b> includes the impact detection unit <b>49</b> for determining whether or not the impact mechanism <b>17</b> is performing any impact operation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The output shaft <b>21</b> is a part that rotates upon receiving the driving force transmitted from the motor <b>15</b> via the transmission mechanism <b>18</b>. The socket <b>23</b> is fixed to the output shaft <b>21</b>. The tip tool <b>28</b> is attached removably to the socket <b>23</b>. The tip tool <b>28</b> rotates along with the output shaft <b>21</b>. The impact tool <b>1</b> is designed to rotate the tip tool <b>28</b> by turning the output shaft <b>21</b> with the driving force applied by the motor <b>15</b>. That is to say, the impact tool <b>1</b> is a tool for driving the tip tool <b>28</b> with the driving force applied by the motor <b>15</b>. The tip tool <b>28</b> (also called a &#x201c;bit&#x201d;) may be a screwdriver bit or a drill bit, for example. One of various types of tip tools <b>28</b> is selected depending on the intended use and attached to the socket <b>23</b> for the intended use. Alternatively, the tip tool <b>28</b> may be directly attached to the output shaft <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The impact tool <b>1</b> according to this embodiment includes the socket <b>23</b>, thus making the tip tool <b>28</b> replaceable depending on the intended use. However, the tip tool <b>28</b> does not have to be replaceable. Alternatively, the impact tool <b>1</b> may also be an impact tool designed to allow the use of only a particular type of tip tool <b>28</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The tip tool <b>28</b> according to this embodiment is a screwdriver bit for tightening or loosening a fastening member <b>30</b> (screw). More specifically, the tip tool <b>28</b> is a plus screwdriver bit, of which a tip portion <b>280</b> is formed in a +(plus) shape. That is to say, the output shaft <b>21</b> holds the screwdriver bit for tightening or loosening a screw and rotates upon receiving motive power from the motor <b>15</b>. In the following description, a situation where the screw is tightened by the impact tool <b>1</b> will be described as an example. Note that any type of screw may be used without limitation. The screw may be a bolt, a screw, or a nut, for example. If the operation mode of the control unit <b>4</b> is the first mode (to be described later), a wood screw is particularly suitably used as the fastening member <b>30</b>. In the first mode, the control unit <b>4</b> places a limit on the increase in the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> before the impact detection unit <b>49</b> detects any impact operation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the fastening member <b>30</b> according to this embodiment is a wood screw. The fastening member <b>30</b> includes a head portion <b>301</b>, a cylindrical portion <b>302</b>, and a thread portion <b>303</b>. The head portion <b>301</b> is connected to a first end of the cylindrical portion <b>302</b>. The thread portion <b>303</b> is connected to a second end of the cylindrical portion <b>302</b>. The head portion <b>301</b> has a screw hole (such as a plus (+) hole) that fits the tip tool <b>28</b>. The thread portion <b>303</b> has a thread thereon.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The tip tool <b>28</b> fits the fastening member <b>30</b>. That is to say, the tip tool <b>28</b> is inserted into the screw hole on the head portion <b>301</b> of the fastening member <b>30</b>. In this state, the tip tool <b>28</b> is caused to rotate by being driven by the motor <b>15</b>, thereby turning the fastening member <b>30</b>. In this manner, the fastening member <b>30</b> (wood screw) is screwed into a target member (such as a wall member) of screwing while forming a hole and a thread groove in the workpiece of screwing. That is to say, the tip tool <b>28</b> applies tightening (or loosening) force to the fastening member <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The power supply unit <b>32</b> supplies a current for driving the motor <b>15</b>. The power supply unit <b>32</b> may be a battery pack, for example. The power supply unit <b>32</b> may include, for example, either a single secondary battery or a plurality of secondary batteries.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The transmission mechanism <b>18</b> includes a planetary gear mechanism <b>25</b>, a drive shaft <b>22</b>, and the impact mechanism <b>17</b>. The transmission mechanism <b>18</b> transmits the rotational power of the rotary shaft <b>16</b> of the motor <b>15</b> to the output shaft <b>21</b>. More specifically, the transmission mechanism <b>18</b> regulates the rotational power of the rotary shaft <b>16</b> of the motor <b>15</b> and outputs the rotational power thus regulated as the rotational power of the output shaft <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The rotary shaft <b>16</b> of the motor <b>15</b> is connected to the planetary gear mechanism <b>25</b>. The drive shaft <b>22</b> is connected to the planetary gear mechanism <b>25</b> and the impact mechanism <b>17</b>. The planetary gear mechanism <b>25</b> reduces the rotational power of the rotary shaft <b>16</b> of the motor <b>15</b> at a predetermined reduction ratio and outputs the rotational power thus reduced as the rotational power of the drive shaft <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The impact mechanism <b>17</b> is coupled to the output shaft <b>21</b>. The impact mechanism <b>17</b> transmits the rotational power (of the rotary shaft <b>16</b>) of the motor <b>15</b>, which has been received via the planetary gear mechanism <b>25</b> and the drive shaft <b>22</b>, to the output shaft <b>21</b>. In addition, the impact mechanism <b>17</b> also performs an impact operation of applying impacting force to the output shaft <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The impact mechanism <b>17</b> includes a hammer <b>19</b>, an anvil <b>20</b>, and a spring <b>24</b>. The hammer <b>19</b> is attached to the drive shaft <b>22</b> via a cam mechanism. The anvil <b>20</b> is in contact with, and rotates along with, the hammer <b>19</b>. The spring <b>24</b> biases the hammer <b>19</b> toward the anvil <b>20</b>. The anvil <b>20</b> is formed integrally with the output shaft <b>21</b>. Alternatively, the anvil <b>20</b> may also be formed separately from, and be fixed to, the output shaft <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Unless a load (torque) with a predetermined magnitude or more is applied to the output shaft <b>21</b>, the impact mechanism <b>17</b> causes the output shaft <b>21</b> to turn continuously with the rotational power of the motor <b>15</b>. That is to say, in that case, the drive shaft <b>22</b> and the hammer <b>19</b> that are coupled to each other via the cam mechanism rotate along with each other and the hammer <b>19</b> and the anvil <b>20</b> also rotate with each other. Thus, the output shaft <b>21</b> formed integrally with the anvil <b>20</b> rotates.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">On the other hand, upon the application of a load with the predetermined magnitude or more to the output shaft <b>21</b>, the impact mechanism <b>17</b> performs an impact operation. In performing the impact operation, the impact mechanism <b>17</b> generates impacting force by transforming the rotational power of the motor <b>15</b> into pulses of torque. That is to say, while the impact operation is being performed, the hammer <b>19</b> retreats by overcoming the biasing force applied by the spring <b>24</b> (i.e., goes away from the anvil <b>20</b>) while being regulated by the cam mechanism between the drive shaft <b>22</b> and the hammer <b>19</b> itself. At a point in time when the hammer <b>19</b> retreats to be decoupled from the anvil <b>20</b>, the hammer <b>19</b> starts advancing (i.e., toward the output shaft <b>21</b>) while rotating, thereby applying impacting force to the anvil <b>20</b> in the rotational direction and causing the output shaft <b>21</b> to rotate. That is to say, the impact mechanism <b>17</b> applies rotational impact around the axis (output shaft <b>21</b>) to the output shaft <b>21</b> via the anvil <b>20</b>. While the impact mechanism <b>17</b> is performing the impact operation, the hammer <b>19</b> repeatedly performs the operation of applying impacting force to the anvil <b>20</b> in the rotational direction.

This allows the control unit <b>4</b> to limit the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> to a predetermined upper limit value U<b>1</b> or less before the impact detection unit <b>49</b> detects the impact operation. That is to say, at this time, the control unit <b>4</b> places a limit on the increase in the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b>. As used herein, &#x201c;limiting the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> to the predetermined upper limit value U<b>1</b> or less&#x201d; only requires that the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions be equal to or less than the upper limit value U<b>1</b> at least in a steady state. Thus, the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions may temporarily exceed the upper limit value U<b>1</b>. For example, immediately after the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions increasing has reached the upper limit value U<b>1</b>, the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions may exceed the upper limit value U<b>1</b> just temporarily as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the impact detection unit <b>49</b> detects the impact operation, the control unit <b>4</b> allows the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> to exceed the upper limit value U<b>1</b> according to the manipulative variable of the trigger switch <b>29</b> (i.e., depending on how deep the trigger switch <b>29</b> has been pulled). Thus, the control unit <b>4</b> removes the limit on the increase in the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b>. More specifically, when the impact detection unit <b>49</b> detects the impact operation, the control unit <b>4</b> updates the state where the command value cN<b>1</b> of the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> is limited to the upper limit value U<b>1</b> or less into a state where the command value cN<b>1</b> of the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> is limited to another limit value U<b>2</b> or less, where the limit value U<b>2</b> is greater than the upper limit value U<b>1</b>. In this manner, the control unit <b>4</b> lifts the restriction that the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> should not increase to exceed the upper limit value U<b>1</b>. In the state where the control unit <b>4</b> limits the command value cN<b>1</b> to the limit value U<b>2</b> or less, when the user pulls the trigger switch <b>29</b> to the maximum depth, the command value cN<b>1</b> becomes equal to the limit value U<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Specifically, the upper limit value U<b>1</b> and the limit value U<b>2</b> may be 15000 rpm and 25000 rpm, respectively.

This makes it easier to stabilize the orientation of the fastening member <b>30</b> before the impact operation is started. If the fastening member <b>30</b> is a wood screw, for example, then the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions may be kept relatively low until a tip part of the fastening member <b>30</b> is screwed to a certain depth or more into a target member (such as a wall member) into which the fastening member <b>30</b> should be screwed. Consequently, this makes it easier to stabilize the orientation of the fastening member <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, keeping the number N<b>1</b> of revolutions of the motor <b>15</b> relatively low may also reduce the chances of causing a &#x201c;come out&#x201d; phenomenon. As used herein, the &#x201c;come out&#x201d; phenomenon refers to an unintentional disengagement of the tip tool <b>28</b> out of the fastening member <b>30</b> while the motor <b>15</b> is running (rotating).
