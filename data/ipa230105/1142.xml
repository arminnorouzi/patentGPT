No. 63/218,140, entitled &#x201c;Vascular Access System Having a Dynamically Expandable Probe&#x201d;, filed Jul. 2, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Vascular access systems are commonly used for a variety of infusion therapies. For example, a vascular access system may be used for infusing fluids, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments, and total parenteral nutrition, into a patient. Vascular access systems may also be used for withdrawing blood from the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A common type of vascular access system is an over-the-needle peripheral intravenous (&#x201c;IV&#x201d;) catheter (&#x201c;PIVC&#x201d;). As its name implies, the over-the-needle catheter may be mounted over a needle having a sharp distal tip. The catheter and the needle may be assembled so that the distal tip of the needle extends beyond the distal tip of the catheter with the bevel of the needle facing up away from skin of the patient. The catheter and needle are generally inserted at a shallow angle through the skin into the vasculature of the patient. Once the catheter is positioned within the vasculature, it may become occluded such as when a thrombus forms around the catheter's distal opening or the distal opening is positioned against a vessel wall.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When vascular access systems are not adequately maintained within the patient's vasculature, they are likely to become occluded. Once a vascular access system is occluded, it may no longer be possible to use the vascular access system to infuse fluids or withdraw blood. In such cases, the vascular access system may be replaced. Yet, replacing a vascular access system is burdensome for the patient and increases costs. To address such issues, some instruments have been developed that can be inserted through the indwelling catheter of the vascular access system to remove the occlusion. For example, some devices employ rigid tubing that can be inserted through the catheter and distally beyond the catheter's distal opening. With the rigid tubing inserted in this manner, such devices can obtain a blood sample through the rigid tubing even if the catheter had become occluded. In other words, the rigid tubing is employed to physically pass through any occlusion that may have formed in or around the catheter's distal opening and forms a separate fluid pathway from the catheter for collecting the blood sample. However, the single opening of the tubing may become occluded with thrombus as it is pushed through and beyond the occlusion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above. Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one example technology area where some implementations described herein may be practiced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates generally to vascular access systems having a dynamically expandable probe. The dynamically expandable probe can be inserted through a catheter while the catheter is positioned intravenously to facilitate fluid flow into or out from the catheter such as by moving an occlusion away from the catheter tip, removing an occlusion, accessing additional sources of blood and/or repositioning the catheter tip. Because it is dynamically expandable, the probe can minimize the likelihood that it will become occluded while it is inserted intravenously and may provide control over the rate of fluid flow into or out from the catheter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, a probe assembly may include a probe housing, a probe that extends within the probe housing and that has a dynamically expandable distal end and a probe actuator that is configured to advance the probe from a proximal position to a distal position. The probe actuator may also be configured to expand the dynamically expandable distal end.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the probe comprises a core segment, a braided segment and a displacement segment. In some embodiments, the braided segment forms the dynamically expandable distal end. In some embodiments, the probe actuator moves the displacement segment relative to the core segment to expand the braided segment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, a proximal end of the core segment is coupled to the probe actuator and a distal end of the core segment is coupled to a distal end of the braided segment, while a proximal end of the displacement segment is coupled to the probe actuator and a distal end of the displacement segment is coupled to a proximal end of the braided segment. In some embodiments, the probe actuator expands the dynamically expandable distal end by moving the displacement segment relative to the core segment. In some embodiments, the probe actuator expands the dynamically expandable distal end by moving the proximal end of the displacement segment distally relative to the proximal end of the core segment. In some embodiments, the probe actuator expands the dynamically expandable distal end by moving the proximal end of the displacement segment distally and moving the proximal end of the core segment proximally.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the probe actuator expands the dynamically expandable distal end via rotational or linear motion. In some embodiments, the dynamically expandable distal end comprises a braided segment and the probe actuator expands the dynamically expandable distal end by shortening the braided segment. In some embodiments, the probe actuator contracts the dynamically expandable distal end by lengthening the braided segment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, a vascular access system may include a catheter adapter from which a catheter extends distally and a probe assembly that is configured to couple to the catheter adapter. The probe assembly may include a probe housing, a probe that extends within the probe housing and that has a core segment, a braided segment and a displacement segment, and a probe actuator that is configured to extend the probe distally from the catheter while the braided segment is in a flow-reducing position and to transition the braided segment into an open position after the probe is extended distally from the catheter.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the braided segment has a distal end that is coupled to the core segment and a proximal end that is coupled to the displacement segment. In some embodiments, the core segment has a proximal end that is coupled to the probe actuator and the displacement segment has a proximal end that is coupled to the probe actuator. In some embodiments, the probe actuator transitions the braided segment into the open position by moving the displacement segment relative to the core segment. In some embodiments, the braided segment is transitioned into the open position by shortening the braided segment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, a method for accessing a vasculature may include accessing a probe assembly that is coupled to a catheter adapter having a catheter that is inserted into a patient's vasculature. The probe assembly may include a probe housing, a probe that extends within the probe housing and a probe actuator. The probe actuator can be slid in a distal direction to cause the distal end of the probe to extend distally from the catheter. After the distal end of the probe extends distally from the catheter, the probe actuator can be manipulated to cause the distal end of the probe to expand.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the probe has a core segment, a braided segment and a displacement segment. In some embodiments, manipulating the probe actuator causes the displacement segment to move relative to the core segment. In some embodiments, the braided segment has a distal end that is coupled to the core segment and a proximal end that is coupled to the displacement segment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are examples and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.

Vascular access system <b>100</b> includes a catheter adapter <b>110</b> (or other vascular access device) from which a catheter <b>111</b> extends distally. Although not shown, a needle assembly may oftentimes be secured to catheter adapter <b>110</b> and may be employed to insert catheter <b>111</b> into a patient's vasculature and subsequently detached from catheter adapter <b>110</b>. Vascular access system <b>100</b> also includes an adapter <b>114</b> that is connected to a side port <b>110</b><i>a </i>of catheter adapter <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Vascular access system <b>100</b> also includes a probe assembly <b>200</b> having a probe housing <b>210</b> which can house a probe <b>230</b> at least when probe <b>230</b> is not extended through catheter <b>111</b>. A connector <b>220</b> can be formed at a distal end of probe housing <b>210</b> and can function to connect probe assembly <b>200</b> to vascular access system <b>100</b> (e.g., via a port <b>114</b><i>a </i>of adapter <b>114</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In other embodiments, however, probe housing <b>210</b> may be integrated into adapter <b>114</b> or another component of catheter adapter <b>110</b>. In other words, how a probe assembly is connected to a catheter adapter is not essential to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Probe assembly <b>200</b> may also include a probe actuator <b>240</b> that extends out from probe housing <b>210</b> and slides along a channel <b>211</b> formed in probe housing <b>210</b>. Probe actuator <b>240</b> allows a clinician to move probe <b>230</b> relative to catheter <b>111</b> by sliding probe actuator <b>240</b> along the length of probe housing <b>210</b> within channel <b>211</b>. As described in detail below, a probe assembly configured in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure may include a dynamically expandable probe that a clinician can selectively control via probe actuator <b>240</b>. Through this selective control, the clinician can adjust the outer diameter and the permeability of the distal end of the probe. Probe assembly <b>200</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is only one example of how a probe assembly may be configured in embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Vascular access system <b>100</b> also includes extension tubing <b>115</b> that is coupled at one end to a port <b>114</b><i>b </i>of adapter <b>114</b> and includes an adapter <b>116</b> at the opposing end. A blood collection set <b>300</b> may be coupled to or integrated with adapter <b>116</b>. A clamp <b>115</b><i>a </i>may be positioned around extension tubing <b>115</b> to selectively block the flow of fluid through the extension tubing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows probe actuator <b>240</b> in its distal-most position and therefore the distal end of probe <b>230</b> is advanced distally out from the distal opening of catheter <b>111</b></p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A probe having a dynamically expandable distal end may be used to bypass, move or remove an occlusion that may have formed around the distal opening of a catheter and/or to reposition the catheter such as when its distal opening may be occluded by a vessel wall or other vasculature structure. For example, after inserting catheter <b>111</b> into the patient's vasculature but prior to advancing probe <b>230</b> through catheter <b>111</b>, a thrombus could form around catheter <b>111</b>'s opening and prevent blood or fluid from flowing through catheter <b>111</b>. In such a case, probe actuator <b>240</b> could be moved into the distal-most position to advance probe <b>230</b>, and particularly its dynamically expandable distal end, distally out through the distal opening of catheter <b>111</b>. The advancement of probe <b>230</b> through the distal opening would bypass, move or remove any occlusion that may have formed. Also, the dynamically expandable distal end would allow the probe to remain in a flow-reducing position while it passes through or by the thrombus and then transitioned into an open position to facilitate the collection of blood or the injection of fluid while probe <b>230</b> is positioned in and extends distally out through catheter <b>111</b>'s distal opening. This dynamic expandability can minimize the likelihood that probe <b>230</b> may become occluded.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> provide examples of probe <b>230</b> in a flow-reducing (or unexpanded) position and an open (or expanded) position respectively when the probe is extended distally out from a catheter <b>111</b>. As shown, probe <b>230</b> includes a core segment <b>231</b>, a braided segment <b>232</b> and a displacement segment <b>233</b>. In some embodiments, core segment <b>231</b> and displacement segment <b>233</b> may be in the form of two separate wires that couple to opposing ends of braided segment <b>232</b>. In other embodiments, core segment <b>231</b> and displacement segment <b>233</b> may be in the form of a single wire having ends that couple to opposing ends of braided segment <b>232</b>. In some embodiments, core segment <b>231</b> and displacement segment <b>233</b> may be made from a variety of materials including, for example, stainless steel, nickel titanium alloys such as Nitinol, and nickel, titanium and cobalt (NiTiCo) alloys. In some embodiments, braided segment <b>232</b> may be formed of stainless steel, nickel titanium alloys such as Nitinol, NiTiCo alloys, fibers, polymers, elastomers or any other suitable material that can be formed into a braid.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the depicted embodiment, a distal end <b>231</b><i>a </i>of core segment <b>231</b> may be connected to a distal end <b>232</b><i>a </i>of braided segment <b>232</b> at a distal end <b>230</b><i>a </i>of probe <b>230</b>. In some embodiments, distal end <b>230</b><i>a </i>can include an atraumatic tip <b>234</b>. Core segment <b>231</b> may be substantially straight with its distal portion extending within braided segment <b>232</b> and its proximal end <b>231</b><i>b </i>extending proximally to probe actuator <b>240</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>). In some embodiments, the length of braided segment <b>232</b> may be configured to cause proximal end <b>232</b><i>b </i>of braided segment <b>232</b> to be positioned within catheter <b>111</b> when probe <b>230</b> is in its distal-most position. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> can both represent an embodiment where probe <b>230</b> is in its distal-most position and proximal end <b>232</b><i>b </i>of braided segment <b>232</b> remains within catheter <b>111</b>. In other embodiments, however, braided segment <b>232</b> may be positioned entirely outside of catheter <b>111</b> when probe <b>230</b> is in its distal-most position.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Displacement segment <b>233</b> can include a distal end <b>233</b><i>a </i>that is coupled to proximal end <b>232</b><i>b </i>of braided segment <b>232</b> and a proximal end <b>233</b><i>b </i>that extends proximally to probe actuator <b>240</b>. In embodiments where core segment <b>231</b> and displacement segment <b>233</b> are formed by the same wire, proximal ends <b>231</b><i>b </i>and <b>233</b><i>b </i>could be viewed as a point on that same wire. Displacement segment <b>233</b> can be configured to move distally and proximally relative to core segment <b>231</b> to thereby change the distance between distal end <b>232</b><i>a </i>and proximal end <b>232</b><i>b </i>of braided segment <b>232</b>. In other words, core segment <b>231</b> and displacement segment <b>233</b> are configured to change the length of braided segment <b>232</b> which in turn changes the outside diameter of braided segment <b>232</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows braided segment <b>232</b> in a lengthened state which causes its outside diameter to be reduced such that the openings (or spaces) between braids are minimized. Braided segment <b>232</b> can be moved into this flow-reducing position by moving distal end <b>233</b><i>a </i>of displacement segment <b>233</b> away from distal end <b>231</b><i>a </i>of core segment <b>231</b>. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows braided segment <b>232</b> in a shortened state which causes its outside diameter to be expanded such that the openings between braids are increased. Braided segment <b>232</b> can be moved into this open position by moving distal end <b>233</b><i>a </i>of displacement segment <b>233</b> towards distal end <b>231</b><i>a </i>of core segment <b>231</b>. In addition to increasing the size of the openings, the expansion of braided segment <b>232</b> can also cause a thrombus to be pushed outwardly away from the opening of catheter <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">When probe <b>230</b> is in the flow-reducing (or unexpanded) position, such as is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the outside diameter of braided segment <b>232</b> may substantially match or be nominally less than the diameter of catheter <b>111</b>'s distal opening. Accordingly, braided segment <b>232</b> can be advanced or withdrawn through the distal opening of catheter <b>111</b> to position braided segment <b>232</b> in a desired location within a patient's vasculature. A clinician could then attempt to draw blood through probe <b>230</b> while it remains in the flow-reducing position. If the blood collection is not successful, or if blood flow is insufficient, the clinician may cause relative displacement between core segment <b>231</b> and displacement segment <b>233</b> to thereby transition probe into (or towards) the open position such as is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. In this open position, the expansion of braided segment <b>232</b> will enable blood to flow more freely through braided segment <b>232</b> and into catheter <b>111</b>. In some embodiments, catheter <b>111</b> may include additional openings (e.g., on the sides of catheter <b>111</b> towards the distal opening) through which blood may also be collected.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Notably, if a thrombus is present on, over or near the distal opening of catheter <b>111</b> when probe <b>230</b> is advanced distally through the distal opening, braided segment <b>232</b> can function to move the thrombus away from the distal opening. Given that braided segment <b>232</b> can be in the unexpanded position while moving or otherwise contacting the thrombus, the smaller openings formed between the braids will reduce the likelihood that the thrombus will pass into the interior of probe <b>230</b> or catheter <b>111</b>. Also, because the openings extend along and around the length of braided segment <b>232</b>, braided segment <b>232</b> can enhance blood or fluid flow even if the thrombus blocks some of the openings.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Probe assembly <b>200</b> can be configured in a variety of ways to enable this dynamic expansion of braided segment <b>232</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> provide one example. As shown, proximal ends <b>231</b><i>b </i>and <b>233</b><i>b </i>of core segment <b>231</b> and displacement segment <b>233</b> respectively can be connected to a base portion <b>241</b> of probe actuator <b>240</b>. Base portion <b>241</b> may have a rounded shape with core segment <b>231</b> and displacement segment <b>233</b> being routed around opposing sides of the rounded shape. Probe actuator <b>240</b> may also include a tab <b>242</b> to enable a clinician to rotate probe actuator <b>240</b>. As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, probe actuator <b>240</b> could be configured to cause probe <b>230</b> to be in the flow-reducing position by default. For example, braided segment <b>232</b> could be configured to not be expanded absent an external force, or probe actuator <b>240</b> could otherwise be biased into the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the rotation of probe actuator <b>240</b> can pull core segment <b>231</b> proximally relative to displacement segment <b>233</b> thereby shortening braided segment <b>232</b> and causing its outside diameter to expand. More specifically, the rotation pulls distal end <b>232</b><i>a </i>of braided segment <b>232</b> proximally while pushing proximal end <b>232</b><i>b </i>of braided segment <b>232</b> distally (or otherwise causes relative movement of distal end <b>232</b><i>a </i>towards proximal end <b>232</b><i>b</i>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, probe actuator <b>240</b> can be configured to slide distally and proximally within channel <b>211</b> to thereby move distal end <b>230</b><i>a </i>of probe <b>230</b> distally and proximally respectively relative to catheter <b>111</b>. For example, probe actuator <b>240</b> could be moved distally to extend probe <b>230</b> from catheter <b>111</b> and moved proximally to retract probe <b>230</b> into catheter <b>111</b>. Once probe <b>230</b> is moved into a desired position (e.g., once extended from catheter <b>111</b>), probe actuator <b>240</b> can be rotated to dynamically expand and contract probe <b>230</b> as described above.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, which are similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, provide another example of how probe actuator <b>240</b> may be configured to enable a clinician to dynamically expand probe <b>230</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, probe actuator <b>240</b> is in its distal-most position, and therefore, probe <b>230</b> extends distally out from catheter <b>111</b>. Although not visible, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, probe <b>230</b> is in the flow-reducing position, whereas in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, probe <b>230</b> is in the open position. Probe actuator <b>240</b> can include a sliding tab <b>243</b> that can be coupled to proximal end <b>231</b><i>b </i>of core segment <b>231</b>. With sliding tab <b>243</b> in the distal position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, core segment <b>231</b> will not be pulled proximally relative to displacement segment <b>233</b> thereby causing probe <b>230</b> to be in the flow-reducing (unexpanded) position. In contrast, when sliding tab <b>243</b> is slid proximally relative to tab <b>242</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, it will pull core segment <b>231</b> proximally thereby shortening the distance between distal end <b>232</b><i>a </i>and proximal end <b>232</b><i>b </i>of braided segment <b>232</b>. As stated above, in some embodiments, this proximal movement of core segment <b>231</b> alone may transition probe <b>230</b> from the flow-reducing position to or towards the open position. However, in some embodiments, probe actuator <b>240</b> may also include a second sliding tab (e.g., on the opposite side of probe actuator <b>240</b> from sliding tab <b>243</b>) to which proximal end <b>233</b><i>b </i>of displacement segment <b>233</b> is connected. In such cases, this second sliding tab can be moved distally to move proximal end <b>232</b><i>b </i>distally while tab <b>243</b> is moved proximally to move distal end <b>232</b><i>a </i>proximally to thereby transition probe <b>230</b> from the flow-reducing position to or towards the open position. Accordingly, a variety of configurations and techniques can be employed to cause relative movement between distal end <b>232</b><i>a </i>and proximal end <b>232</b><i>b </i>of braided segment <b>232</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> also represent embodiments where probe assembly <b>200</b> forms a fluid pathway. For example, probe housing <b>210</b> is shown as including a port <b>410</b> from which extension tubing <b>411</b> extends. Blood collection set <b>300</b> can be connected to an adapter <b>412</b> at the end of extension tubing <b>411</b>. In such embodiments, a needle-less connector <b>400</b> or other device can be coupled to adapter <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Probe <b>230</b> has been described as having two positions: an open position and a flow-reducing position. However, in any embodiment, probe <b>230</b> could have a flow-reducing position and variable open positions. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, probe actuator <b>240</b> could be rotated to open probe <b>230</b> to a desired amount. Likewise, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, sliding tab <b>243</b> could be slid to open probe <b>230</b> to a desired amount. Accordingly, probe actuator <b>240</b> could be configured in a wide variety of ways to cause probe <b>230</b> to have a single open position or many open positions. In some embodiments, this variability in the permeability of braided segment <b>232</b> can enable the clinician to control the rate of fluid or blood flow through probe <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> provide a more detailed example of how braided segment <b>232</b> enables the permeability of probe <b>230</b> to be controlled in one or more embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, braided segment <b>232</b> is in the unexpanded configuration and therefore the strands <b>501</b> that form braided segment <b>232</b> create smaller openings <b>502</b>. In contrast, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, braided segment <b>232</b> is in the expanded configuration and therefore the strands <b>501</b> create larger openings <b>502</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, probe <b>230</b> can be configured to enable braided segment <b>232</b> to be constricted to the point where it contacts core segment <b>231</b>. For example, distal end <b>233</b><i>a </i>of displacement segment <b>233</b> can be pulled sufficiently away from distal end <b>231</b><i>a </i>of core segment <b>231</b> (and/or vice versa) to cause braid section <b>232</b> to squeeze core segment <b>231</b>. In such cases, this may be viewed as a closed position in which probe <b>230</b> prevents or severely limits the amount of blood that may flow into catheter <b>111</b> or fluid that may flow out of catheter <b>111</b>. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a probe may be transitionable from a closed position to an increasing degree of open positions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, a variety of braid patterns may be used to form braided segment <b>232</b>. For example, the strands <b>501</b> that form braided segment <b>232</b> can have a varying angle and/or spacing to thereby cause the size and/or shape of openings <b>502</b> to vary. In some embodiments, strands <b>501</b> can be configured to cause openings <b>502</b> to have any of a variety of shapes including diamond, trapezoidal, triangular, rectangular, square, oval, oblong, etc. In some embodiments, the effective width of openings <b>502</b> may be between 0.000 inches and 0.015 inches. In some embodiments, the effective width of openings <b>502</b> may exceed 0.015 inches.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In summary, a probe configured in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure can be dynamically expanded to thereby increase the permeability of the probe and to move thrombus away from the catheter's opening. The expansion of the probe can also cause the catheter's opening to be positioned towards the center of the patient's vasculature thereby reducing the risk that the opening will be occluded by the vasculature wall.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a typical use case, the probe can be in the flow-reducing position while it is advanced distally from a catheter to a desired location within the patient's vasculature. By advancing the probe in the flow-reducing state as opposed to in the open state, the probe can provide greater stiffness to the catheter. Once positioned, the clinician can open the probe to better collect a blood sample and/or to inject a fluid through the catheter. By inserting the probe in the flow-reducing position, the risk of a thrombus occluding the probe is minimized. Also, the clinician can control the degree to which the probe is opened (or more particularly, the size of openings between braids) to thereby minimize the likelihood of a thrombus entering the probe while drawing blood.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">All examples and conditional language recited herein are intended for pedagogical objects to aid the reader in understanding the invention and the concepts contributed by the inventor to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.
