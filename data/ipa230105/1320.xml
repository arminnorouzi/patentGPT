This is a preferred method of drying of many thermally-sensitive materials such as foods and pharmaceuticals. Corresponding industry sectors (including food, pharma, chemicals, and painting) are in need of more energy efficient spray dryers to accommodate different products with reduced waste. This will benefit from an atomizer that is capable of handling liquids with a wide range of viscosity and a higher flowrate.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An atomizing spray dryer employs one or more stages defined by ultrasonic transducers in close proximity to a liquid feed opening forming a path of an atomization flow for producing uniform droplets from a close tolerance with the transducer. The atomization flow exits a gap between the transducer and an outer edge of the opening, such that the passed liquid is responsive to an oscillation of the transducer for forming the droplets. A conical or other suitably shaped transducer engages a substantially round liquid feed opening. Subsequent stages may include a circular, ring, or other suitable shape aligned to receive the atomization flow from a circumference of the conical base, or may also take any suitable shape, preferably to receive droplets directed by the first stage.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Configurations herein are based, in part, on the observation that spray drying is convenient for generating a powder form of various substances for industrial, manufacturing and food preparation environments. Unfortunately, conventional approaches to spray drying suffer from the shortcoming of low flow rates and volume and an ability to generate a consistent particle size, particularly for viscous substances. Accordingly, configurations herein present a multi-stage transducer based spray drying approach for a serial atomization treatment of a liquid stream using a shaped nozzle and transducer surface for directing the atomized fluid stream through multiple stages. Transducer oscillation is controlled based on a desired atomized particle size and flow rate, and generates a high volume of consistent particle output.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Ultrasonic atomization is based on the response of the liquid-air interface to incident oscillations by a transducer, which break the bulk liquid into fine droplets. A transducer is the device which could convert one form of energy into another. Piezoelectricity, the fundamental theory behind ultrasonics, describes the phenomenon the electric charge generation proportion to the applied mechanical stress and vice versa. One conventional application is a commercially available ultrasonic humidifiers. Vibrating plate transducers (usually in disc shape) are commonly used due to its superior performance. With this type of transducer immersed into a reservoir of water at a certain depth under the water surface, the alternative current (AC) signal is converted to mechanical vibration towards the water-air interface by creating a mist of water. This conventional example does not exhibit performance consistent with high volume or viscous materials, as often required in industrial applications.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosed spray drying atomizer is based on the ultrasound mechanism applied to the flow generated by nozzles such as a radial jet reattachment (RJR) and slot jet reattachment (SJR) nozzles. Specifically, the ultrasonic vibration is applied to the liquid feed at the nozzle exit by installing the transducer either on the bottom plate of the nozzle, or alternatively the bottom plate of the nozzle will be the ultrasound transducer itself. Either way, the bottom plate, shaped at any desired exit angle of the RJR or SJR nozzle, will be the source of ultrasound vibration generating uniform droplets at a desired diameter. The nozzle exit opening size and its exit angle will influence the droplet size. It is important to recognize that the unique structure of RJR and SJR nozzles will allow for a higher throughput of liquid feed which is very desirable.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description of particular embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which like reference characters refer to the same parts throughout the different views.

The most common of these are rotary disk and single-fluid high pressure swirl nozzles. Atomizer wheels are known to provide broader particle size distribution, but both methods allow for consistent distribution of particle size. Alternatively, for some applications, two-fluid or ultrasonic nozzles are used. Depending on the process requirements, drop sizes from 10 to 500 &#x3bc;m can be achieved with the appropriate choices. The most common applications are in the 100 to 200 &#x3bc;m diameter range. The resulting dry powder is typically free-flowing, and is transported away by the gaseous flow around the nozzles and transducers to a dry particle collector or storage.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a context diagram of a spray drying apparatus suitable for use with configurations herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an atomizing spray dryer <b>100</b> performs spray drying of a liquid <b>101</b> for forming a dry powder <b>103</b> collected in a particulate form. A drying gas <b>116</b>, heated from inline heating elements <b>118</b>, passes through or along an atomizer <b>150</b> for dispersing and agitating the liquid <b>101</b> into droplets <b>102</b>. Once dried into a particulate form in a drying chamber <b>124</b>, a cyclone <b>126</b> separates the drying gas <b>116</b> as an exhaust gas flow <b>127</b> and allows the particles resulting from the now dried droplets <b>102</b> to accumulate as a dry powder in a collector <b>128</b> or hopper.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The atomizing spray dryer <b>100</b> employs one or more stages, each defined by ultrasonic transducers <b>120</b> in close proximity to a liquid feed opening joining a path <b>104</b> of an atomization flow for producing uniform droplets <b>102</b> from a close tolerance with the transducer <b>120</b>. The atomization flow <b>106</b> exits a gap <b>110</b> between the transducer <b>120</b> and an outer edge <b>114</b> of the opening to form an exit for the liquid <b>101</b>, such that the passed liquid is responsive to an oscillation of the transducer <b>120</b> for forming the droplets <b>102</b>. In an example configuration, a conical or other suitably shaped transducer <b>120</b> engages a substantially round liquid feed opening. The conical or tapered shape has a profile for dispersing a drying gas for forming a uniform spray formed from the atomization flow <b>106</b>. Subsequent stages may include a circular or ring shape aligned to receive the atomization flow from a circumference of the conical base, or may also take any suitable shape, preferably to receive droplets directed by the first stage.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a configuration disclosed herein, the atomizing spray dryer <b>100</b> includes a liquid feed vessel <b>107</b> having a source of the liquid <b>101</b> and an atomization exit <b>115</b>. The transducer <b>120</b> in close proximity to the atomization exit is disposed to define an opening between a liquid feed vessel <b>107</b> and the transducer. A driver circuit <b>156</b> connects to the transducer <b>120</b> and is configured for driving the transducer at an ultrasonic oscillation rates and amplitude, such that the atomization liquid <b>101</b> delivered via the liquid feed vessel <b>107</b> passes between the atomization exit <b>115</b> opening in communication with the transducer <b>120</b>. Oscillation rates may be determined based on a viscosity of the liquid <b>101</b>, a desired size of the droplets <b>102</b>, and a speed or rate at which the liquid <b>101</b> is atomized. The drying gas <b>116</b> imposes a gaseous flow <b>130</b> adjacent to the transducer <b>120</b>, such that the gaseous flow receives the atomized liquid <b>101</b> for transporting the droplets <b>102</b> for forming the atomization flow <b>106</b> of propelled particles during drying of the particles into a dry powder.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> show a lower perspective, side elevation and upper perspective views of an atomizer <b>150</b> in the environment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, the atomizer <b>150</b> includes a nozzle <b>152</b> and the transducer <b>120</b>. The nozzle may, for example, be a radial jet reattachment (RJR) or slot jet reattachment (SJR) nozzle. Specifically, the ultrasound vibration will be applied to the liquid feed at the nozzle exit by installing the transducer <b>120</b> either on the bottom plate of the nozzle or the bottom plate of the nozzle will be the ultrasound transducer itself. Either way, the bottom plate, shaped at any desired exit angle of the RJR or SJR nozzle, will be the source of ultrasound vibration generating uniform droplets at a desired diameter. The nozzle exit opening size and its exit angle will influence the droplet size. It is important to recognize that the structure of RJR and SJR nozzles will allow for a higher throughput of liquid feed which is generally desirable.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The atomizer <b>150</b> generally disposes the transducer <b>120</b> adjacent a gap <b>110</b> where the drying gas <b>116</b> meets the liquid <b>101</b> to form an atomization flow <b>106</b> in the path <b>104</b> defined from the pressurized flow of the gas <b>116</b>. The liquid <b>101</b> forms a film on the transducer <b>120</b> in close proximity to the outer edge <b>114</b> or opening where the gas <b>116</b> passes, liberating droplets <b>102</b> in an atomization flow <b>106</b> from the transducer oscillations as the transducer sheds droplets of the liquid <b>101</b> that meet the gaseous flow <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The nozzle thus forms a vessel with an opening defining the atomization exit; and an exit angle defined by a surface of the opening and a surface of the first transducer <b>120</b>. The nozzle <b>152</b> forms the terminus and exit of the liquid vessel <b>107</b>, and has a bore <b>108</b> or channel for delivering the liquid <b>101</b> to the gap <b>110</b> for communication with the transducer <b>120</b>. The transducer <b>120</b> is of a generally conical shape, having a linear, concave or convex annular surface <b>125</b>, and engages the exit by insertion of a conical vertex into the exit of the vessel, such that a conical base <b>124</b> is disposed downstream of the atomizing flow from the gas. The annular surface <b>125</b> of the conical transducer defines an exit angle <b>126</b> with the atomization exit <b>115</b> defined by the outer edge <b>114</b> of the nozzle <b>152</b> where the liquid <b>101</b> becomes liberated into the gaseous flow. The annular exit of the opening allows a large area for the liquid stream to atomize, based on a diameter of the conical base <b>124</b> and the size or diameter of the nozzle <b>152</b>, as the atomization exit <b>115</b> extends circumferentially around an orifice of the nozzle. Other slopes, curves and patterns may define the liquid exit from the nozzle <b>152</b>. The opening size is defined by an engagement of the transducer with the exit, and a particle size of particles in the atomization flow <b>106</b> results from the opening size and an oscillation rate of the transducer, typically an ultrasonic rate. Ambient air may provide the heated drying medium; however, if the liquid includes a flammable solvent such as ethanol or the product is oxygen-sensitive then nitrogen or other inert gas may define the drying gas <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The driver circuit <b>156</b> includes oscillation logic <b>157</b> for driving the transducer <b>120</b> at an oscillation rate based on the viscosity, flow rate and intended droplet size. A charge circuit <b>158</b> may also be in electrical communication with the liquid for applying an electrical charge to the droplets <b>102</b> in the atomized liquid formed by the transducer oscillations. The charge circuit <b>158</b> may be part of an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) mechanism for establishing an electrical field upstream or at the exit of the nozzle <b>152</b>. The instability imposed by the application of electrical field will promote rapid atomization of the liquid film. By electrically charging the liquid feed <b>107</b>, and thus the droplets <b>102</b>, the droplets will repel each other and will avoid coalescence.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> show a multi-stage atomizer for use with the configurations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b>B</figref>.

The second transducer <b>220</b> is generally disposed based on the exit angle <b>126</b> or position of the first transducer <b>120</b> so as to intercept the stream of atomized liquid droplets.

Ultrasonic atomization is based on the response of the liquid-air interface to incident oscillations, which break the bulk liquid into fine droplets. Vibrating plate transducers (usually in disc shape) are commonly used due to its superior performance. With this type of transducer immersed into a reservoir of water at a certain depth under the water surface, the alternative current (AC) signal is converted to mechanical vibration towards the water-air interface by creating a mist of water droplets. According to capillary wave theory, the capillary wave is formed at the water-air interface as the sound waves propagate, with the sufficient acoustic intensity, the instability of the surface wave would undergo rupture to form fine mist, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref>. The droplet size is in proportional to the excitation wavelength which, can be predicted by Kelvin's equation:</p><p id="p-0030" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <msup>   <mrow>    <mo>(</mo>    <mfrac>     <mrow>      <mn>8</mn>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mi>&#x3c0;</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mi>&#x3c3;</mi>     </mrow>     <mrow>      <mi>&#x3c1;</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <msup>       <mi>f</mi>       <mn>2</mn>      </msup>     </mrow>    </mfrac>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>   <mfrac>    <mn>1</mn>    <mn>3</mn>   </mfrac>  </msup> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0031" num="0000">Where &#x3bb;, &#x3c3;, &#x3c1;, and &#x192; represent the wavelength, surface tension, fluid density and the excitation frequency, respectively.

Even though cavitation becomes a competing theory for explaining some ultrasound phenomena, the capillary wave theory is still widely accepted for droplet size prediction. It is noted that the electrochemical properties of the liquid, such as viscosity, density, surface tension, as well as the liquid film thickness, also behave a significant impact on the droplet size and atomization rate,</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b>B</figref>, the edge <b>114</b> of the nozzle <b>152</b> defines the atomization exit <b>115</b> for droplet formation.
