Such moving enables that the workpiece is machined by a stationary machining station at various desired positions along the workpiece. In particular, the workpiece is generally moved over a roller conveyor or similar supporting structure which traverses the machining station in a main transport direction and which supports the workpiece so as to be movable in the main transport direction.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A known gripper truck assembly comprises a gripper truck including a drive unit for driving the gripper truck with respect to the machining station along the main transport direction, and a gripper which is configured for gripping the workpiece so that a gripped workpiece is moved along with the gripper truck. The gripper truck is for example drivable along a track which extends parallel to the roller conveyor on which the workpiece is supported, wherein the gripper is suspended from the gripper truck to be positioned above the roller conveyor. To enable effective gripping of various shapes and sizes of workpieces, a position of the gripper is preferably adjustable with respect to the gripper truck.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For accurate and fast machining, a known machining station is provided with a clamping mechanism for fixating the workpiece at the machining station after the workpiece has been moved into a desired position by the gripper truck assembly. When active, the clamping mechanism fixates the workpiece by constricting a passage for the workpiece along a predetermined constriction length along the main transport direction to a constriction width which corresponds to a width of the workpiece. In a particularly economic machining station, the constriction length is a fixed length, wherein a machining position of the machining station is arranged centrally with respect to the fixed constriction length.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A disadvantage of the fixed constriction length is that the known gripper truck assembly must remain outside the constriction length during the clamping, at least when the workpiece has a small width compared to the gripper truck assembly. As a result, end sections of the workpiece cannot be machined by the machining station while the gripper truck assembly continues to grip the workpiece.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to overcome the above mentioned disadvantage while maintaining the above mentioned advantages. An object is to provide a versatile gripper truck assembly with improved usability in combination with machining station clamping mechanisms with fixed constriction lengths. An object is to enable accurate and fast machining of elongate workpieces along substantially their entire length.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To that end, a first aspect of the invention provides a gripper truck assembly for moving a workpiece with respect to a machining station. The gripper truck assembly comprises a gripper truck including a drive unit for driving the gripper truck with respect to the machining station along a main transport direction. The gripper truck assembly further comprises a gripper arm extending along a gripper arm length of at least 2000 mm in the main transport direction from a proximal end, which is connected to the gripper truck, to an opposite distal end. The gripper arm has a width and a height when viewed in the main transport direction, the width being less than 150 mm.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the width is less than 140 mm, more preferably less than 130 mm, more preferably less than 120 mm, more preferably less than 110 mm, more preferably less than 100 mm, more preferably less than 90 mm, more preferably less than 80, for example about 70 mm or less.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The gripper truck assembly further comprises a gripper comprising at least one jaw which is configured to be moveable between a closed position for gripping the workpiece and an open position for releasing the workpiece. The gripper is connected to the distal end of the gripper arm by a joint which is configured to permit a rotation of the gripper with respect to the distal end of the gripper arm about a gripper rotation axis which is substantially parallel to the main transport direction.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The gripper truck assembly further comprises a hydraulic gripper actuator accommodated in the gripper arm and operatively connected to the gripper for actuating the at least one jaw of the gripper between the open position and the closed position for selectively gripping or releasing the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The gripper truck assembly further comprises a gripper rotation actuator which is operatively connected to the joint for actuating the rotation of the gripper with respect to the gripper arm about the gripper rotation axis.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Advantageously, the relatively large length and small width of the gripper arm enable that the gripper truck assembly can grip a workpiece which has a relatively small width, while a gripped end of the workpiece is positioned centrally with respect to a constriction length of a clamping mechanism of the machining station. In this way, substantially any section of the elongate workpiece may be machined at the machining position of the machining station, as desired, in particular while the workpiece remains gripped by the gripper of the gripper truck assembly.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The joint which rotatably connects the gripper to the distal end of the gripper arm can provide a desired versatility of the gripper in terms of adjustability of its gripping position or orientation, wherein the gripper rotation actuator can advantageously effect a corresponding rotational adjustment of the gripper, as desired.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The relatively long gripper arm can be sufficiently stiff in a vertical direction, in particular due to its height being allowed to be relatively large, for example larger than its width. Meanwhile, since the joint is arranged at the distal end of the gripper arm, the gripper arm can be particularly stiffly connected to the gripper truck. Thus the gripper arm can be suspended from the gripper truck in a particularly stable way, thereby enabling accurate positioning of the gripper.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">By accommodating the hydraulic gripper actuator in the gripper arm, for example at a distal end thereof, an actuation path from the hydraulic gripper actuator to the gripper can be relatively short, to enable sufficiently forceful and stable gripping.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The gripper truck assembly is thus relatively versatile, in particular with improved usability in combination with machining station clamping mechanism with fixed constriction lengths. The gripper truck assembly is also relatively reliable, durable and economic compared to one or more known gripper truck assemblies.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A further aspect provides a machining system comprising a machining station and a gripper truck assembly as described herein for moving a workpiece with respect to the machining station.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Such a machining system provides above mentioned advantages.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The machining station of the machining system may comprise a clamping mechanism for clamping the workpiece, wherein the clamping mechanism may be configured to impose a corresponding constriction to a width of the workpiece, the constriction having a fixed length along the transport direction, for example a length of at least 50 cm.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Such a machining station is known as such and is advantageously relatively economic. The present combination with the improved gripper truck assembly advantageously provides, as explained, that the machining system can nevertheless perform machining at end sections of elongate workpieces.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A further aspect provides a method of moving a workpiece with respect to a machining station. The method comprises: providing a gripper truck assembly as described herein at a machining station. The method further comprises, using the gripper rotation actuator, rotating the gripper with respect to the gripper arm to align the gripper with a grippable section of the workpiece. The method further comprises: using the hydraulic gripper actuator, causing the aligned gripper to grip the grippable section of the workpiece; and, using the drive unit of the gripper truck, driving the gripper truck with respect to the machining station, while maintaining the gripping, thereby moving the workpiece with respect to the machining station.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Such a method provides above mentioned advantages.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further advantageous elaborations of the invention are provided by the features of the dependent claims, as will be explained further in the following detailed description.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following, the invention will be explained further using exemplary embodiments and drawings.
