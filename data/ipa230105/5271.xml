The method for detecting a traffic anomaly includes the following steps:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Step <b>201</b>, acquiring a traffic video stream.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In this embodiment, an executing body (e.g., the server <b>103</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the method for detecting a traffic anomaly may acquire the traffic video stream from a video collection device (e.g., the video collection device <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Generally, the video collection device is fixedly mounted to collect video streams within the range of its camera. For example, an electronic eye mounted on a signal light pole or a monitoring light pole can collect a traffic video stream and can be applied to the field of intelligent transportation. Here, the video collection device may continuously collect still images at intervals of a certain time length (e.g., 40 milliseconds), and thus can obtain a traffic video stream. The traffic video stream may record a passing process of a vehicle, a pedestrian, or the like.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Step <b>202</b>, performing vehicle detection tracking on the traffic video stream to determine whether there is an abnormally stopped vehicle.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this embodiment, the above executing body may perform the vehicle detection tracking on the traffic video stream to determine whether there is the abnormally stopped vehicle.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Generally, during the passing of a vehicle, a normal vehicle that stops normally (e.g., waits for a traffic light) has a short stop time, and an abnormal vehicle that stops abnormally (e.g., forced to stop or stops in violation of regulations) has a long stop time. Therefore, a vehicle having a stop time exceeding a preset time length (e.g., 10 minutes) can be determined as an abnormally stopped vehicle.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For any vehicle in the traffic video stream, the above executing body may detect a position of the vehicle on a video frame in the traffic video stream. If the positions of the vehicle on a number (e.g., 1500 frames) of consecutive video frames are unchanged, it is determined that the vehicle is an abnormally stopped vehicle. Since the video collection device collects one video frame at intervals of a certain time length (e.g., 40 milliseconds), the stop time of the vehicle can be obtained by calculating the product of the time length and the number of video frames on which the positions are unchanged.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Step <b>203</b>, performing a traffic anomaly classification on a video frame corresponding to an abnormal stop using a decision tree to obtain a traffic anomaly type, if there is the abnormally stopped vehicle.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this embodiment, if there is the abnormally stopped vehicle, the above executing body may perform the traffic anomaly classification on the video frame corresponding to the abnormal stop using the decision tree, to obtain the traffic anomaly type. Here, the traffic anomaly type may include, but not limited to, a vehicle-vehicle collision type, a vehicle-human collision type, an illegal parking type, a break-down type, and the like.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Here, the decision tree may be generated based on features for a traffic anomaly detection. Different traffic anomaly types correspond to different features, and thus, decision trees may be constructed based on the features of the different traffic anomaly types here. The decision tree is a tree, in which a root node and an internal node are decision conditions of the inputted feature and a leaf node is a final result.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For ease of understanding, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a decision tree. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the input of training data has a total of six features: whether there is an abnormally stopped vehicle, whether a number of abnormally stopped vehicles is more than one, whether there is a contact between the abnormally stopped vehicles, whether there is an abnormal human body, whether a stop position of the abnormally stopped vehicle is on a side of a road, and whether there is a warning sign. According to these training data, a decision tree can be constructed.

First, the detection tracking is performed on the traffic video stream to determine the abnormally stopped vehicle. Then, the decision tree is used to perform the traffic anomaly classification. Accordingly, the method can be integrated into an intelligent transportation system to troubleshoot problems as soon as possible to resume normal traffic. Moreover, the abnormally stopped vehicle is determined through the detection tracking, which will not be affected by a change of a shooting angle, a high-density traffic flow, a target vehicle gear, a weather condition (e.g., rain, and snow), a light change (e.g., day and night), low resolution of collected data, a lack of real scenario data and other factors, thus improving the robustness of traffic anomaly detection. The traffic anomaly classification is performed through the decision tree. Since the decision tree is generated based on the features for the traffic anomaly detection, and thus can provide more comprehensive traffic information, which makes the traffic anomaly detection result more comprehensive.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a flow <b>400</b> of another embodiment of the method for detecting a traffic anomaly according to the present disclosure.

Here, the vehicle detection tracking result may include a vehicle travel trajectory. The vehicle travel trajectory may represent a change of a vehicle position over time. If the vehicle position in the vehicle travel trajectory does not change over a predetermined period of time, it indicates that the vehicle is an abnormally stopped vehicle. The vehicle detection tracking model can be used to perform detection tracking on vehicles, and is obtained by training a neural network using a training sample set. Here, a training sample in the training sample set may include a sample traffic video stream and a sample vehicle travel trajectory. By performing detection tracking on the vehicle based on a deep learning method, the efficiency and accuracy of the detection tracking are improved.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Step <b>403</b>, counting a number of abnormally stopped vehicles to determine whether the number is more than one.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In this embodiment, if there is the abnormally stopped vehicle, the above executing body can count the number of the abnormally stopped vehicles to determine whether the number is more than one.

If there is an intersection between the bounding boxes of at least two abnormally stopped vehicles, the intersection-over-union is not equal to 0, indicating that there is a contact between the abnormally stopped vehicles.

If there is the abnormal human body, step <b>407</b> is performed. If there is no abnormal human body, step <b>408</b> is performed.

Here, the human behavior result is used to record a human behavior. If the human behavior refers to sitting on the ground or lying on the ground, the corresponding human body is an abnormal human body.
