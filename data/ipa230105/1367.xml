A classical configuration of heat exchange is the tube and shell type, where one gas flowing on the tube side heat exchanges with another gas on the shell side to thereby heat the first gas and cool the second gas, or vice versa. It is desirable to develop a heating system, specifically a gas preheater, which allows for heating gas systems to very high temperatures. It is also desirable to develop a heating system which is compact and simple to operate. Another advantage of the present technology is that the overall emission of carbon dioxide and other emissions detrimental to the climate may be reduced considerably, in particular if the power used in the heating system is from renewable energy resources.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Preheating of gas is needed in many aspects of chemical process design. Examples of gas preheaters includes preheating for reduction gas used for activation of catalyst beds. Another use of a gas preheater is the example of a CO<sub>2 </sub>preheater to an Adiabatic POst Convertor (APOC). The APOC reactor is described in WO 2019/110267. In both cases, it can be desirable to have a very high gas preheating temperature to enable the interplay of the downstream unit operation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present technology thus provides a heating system for heating of a feed gas, said heating system comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">a supply of feed gas;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">a structured body arranged for heating of said feed gas, said structured body comprising a macroscopic structure of electrically conductive material;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0007">a pressure shell housing said structured body, said pressure shell comprising an inlet for letting in said feed gas and an outlet for letting out heated gas, wherein said inlet is positioned so that said feed gas enters said structured body in a first end of said structured body and said heated gas exits said structured body from a second end of said structured body;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0008">a heat insulation layer between said structured body and said pressure shell;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0009">at least two conductors electrically connected to said structured body and to an electrical power supply placed outside said pressure shell, wherein said electrical power supply is dimensioned to heat at least part of said structured body to a temperature of at least 400&#xb0;

The heated gas from the heated structured body is led to the heating system outlet.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0038">An important feature of the resistance heating process is thus that the energy is supplied inside the object itself, instead of being supplied from an external heat source via heat conduction, convection and radiation. Moreover, the hottest part of the heating system will be within the pressure shell of the heating system. Preferably, the electrical power supply and the structured body are dimensioned so that at least part of the structured body reaches a temperature of at least 700&#xb0; C., preferably at least 900&#xb0; C., more preferably at least 1000&#xb0; C.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;macroscopic structure&#x201d; is meant to denote a structure that is large enough to be visible with the naked eye, without magnifying devices. The dimensions of the macroscopic structure are typically in the range of centimeters or even meters. Dimensions of the macroscopic structure are advantageously made to correspond at least partly to the inner dimensions of the pressure shell housing the structured body, saving room for the heat insulation layer and conductors. Two or more macroscopic structures may be connected in order to provide an array of macroscopic structures having at least one of the outer dimensions in the range of meters, such as 2 m or 5 m. Such two or more macroscopic structures may be denoted &#x201c;an array of macroscopic structures&#x201d;. In this case the dimensions of an array of macroscopic structures are advantageously made to correspond at least partly to the inner dimension of the pressure shell housing the structured body (saving room for the heat insulation layer). A conceivable array of macroscopic structures could take up a volume of 0.1 to 10 m<sup>3 </sup>or even larger. The structured body may comprise a single macroscopic structure or an array of macroscopic structures, where the macroscopic structure(s) support(s) an optional ceramic coating. In an array of macroscopic structures, the macroscopic structures may be electrically connected to each other; however, alternatively, the macroscopic structures are not electrically connected to each other. Thus, the structured body may comprise two or more macroscopic structures positioned adjacent to each other. The macroscopic structure(s) may be extruded and sintered structures or 3D printed structures. A 3D printed macroscopic structure can be provided with or without subsequent sintering. In the heating system described herein, the ceramic coating does not support a catalytically active material. The ceramic coating may be applied to maintain a chemical inert environment to thereby limit or even avoid surface reactions on the metal surfaces of the macroscopic structure(s).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0042">The physical dimensions of the macroscopic structure may be any appropriate dimensions; thus, the height may be smaller than the width of the macroscopic structure or vice versa. The macroscopic structure may support a ceramic coating, which can provide a protective layer on the macroscopic structure. The term &#x201c;macroscopic structure supporting a ceramic coating&#x201d; is meant to denote that the macroscopic structure is coated by the ceramic coating at, at least, a part of the surface of the macroscopic structure. Thus, the term does not imply that all the surface of the macroscopic structure is coated by the ceramic coating; in particular, at least the parts of the macroscopic structure which are electrically connected to the conductors do not have a coating thereon. The coating is a ceramic material with pores in the structure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0043">Preferably, the macroscopic structure has been manufactured by extrusion of a mixture of powdered metallic particles and a binder to an extruded structure and subsequent sintering of the extruded structure, thereby providing a material with a high geometric surface area per volume. Preferably, the extruded structure is sintered in a reducing atmosphere to provide the macroscopic structure. Alternatively, the macroscopic structure is 3D printed a metal additive manufacturing melting process, viz. a 3D printing processes, which do not require subsequent sintering, such as powder bed fusion or direct energy deposition processes. Examples of such powder bed fusion or direct energy deposition processes are laser beam, electron beam or plasma 3D printing processes.

The effect of the structured body being a coherent or consistently intra-connected material is that a control over the connectivity within the material of the structured body and thus the conductivity of the electrically conductive material is obtained.

The presence of heat insulating layer between the pressure shell and the structured body assists in avoiding excessive heating of the pressure shell, and assists in reducing thermal losses to the surroundings. The temperatures of the structured body may reach up to about 1300&#xb0; C., at least at some parts thereof, but by using the heat insulation layer between the structured body and the pressure shell the temperature of the pressure shell can be kept at significantly lower temperatures of say 500&#xb0; C. or even 100&#xb0; C., which is advantageous as typical construction steel materials typically are unsuitable for pressure bearing application at temperatures above 1000&#xb0; C. Moreover, a heat insulating layer between the pressure shell and the structured body assists in control of the electrical current within the heating system, since heat insulation layer is also electrically insulating. The heat insulation layer could be one or more layers of solid material, such as ceramics, inert material, fiber material, bricks or a gas barrier or a combination thereof. Thus, it is also conceivable that a purge gas or a confined gas constitutes or forms part of the heat insulation layer.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0063">Moreover, it should be noted that the term &#x201c;heat insulating material&#x201d; is meant to denote materials having a thermal conductivity of about 10 W&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#xb7;K<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or below.

Such gaps are e.g. a gap between the lower side of the structured body and the bottom of the pressure shell and a gap between the sides of the structured body and the insulation layer covering the inner sides of the pressure shell. The inert material may e.g. be a ceramic material in the form of pellets or tiles. The inert material assists in controlling the gas distribution through the heating system and in controlling the flow of the gas through the structured body. Moreover, the inert material typically has a heat insulating effect.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0065">The pressure shell suitably has a design pressure of between 2 bar and 30 bar. The actual operating pressure will be determined by the size of the plants, among other aspects. As the hottest part of the heating system is the electrically conductive material, which will be surrounded by heat insulation layer and within the pressure shell of the heating system, the temperature of the pressure shell can be kept significantly lower than the maximum process temperature. This allows for having a relative low design temperature of the pressure shell of e.g. 700&#xb0; C. or 500&#xb0; C. or preferably 300&#xb0; C. or 100&#xb0; C. of the pressure shell whilst having maximum process temperatures of 400&#xb0; C., or even 900, or even 1100&#xb0; C., or even up to 1300&#xb0; C. on the structured body. Material strength is higher at the lower of these temperatures (corresponding to the design temperature of the pressure shell as indicated above). This offers advantages when designing the heating system. Suitably, the pressure shell has a design pressure of between 2 bar and 30 bar, or between 30 and 200 bar. Around 30 bar is preferable as a compromise between process economy and thermodynamic limitations.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0066">The resistivity of the electrically conductive material is suitably between 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>&#x3a9;&#xb7;m and 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>&#x3a9;&#xb7;m.

Hereby, the at least two conductors can be placed in the substantially colder part of the heating system as the inlet gas will have lower temperature than the product gas, the electrically conductive material will be colder in the most upstream part of the material due to the heat consumed by the progress of the heating, and the feed gas fed through the inlet may cool the at least two conductors before being heated by the heated structured body further along the path of the gas over the heated structured body. It is an advantage that the temperature of all electrically conducting elements except the electrically conductive material is kept down in order to protect the connections between the conductors and the structured body. When the temperature of the conductors and other electrically conducting elements, except the electrically conductive material, is relatively low, less limitations on materials suitable for the conductors and other electrically conducting elements, except the electrically conductive material, exists. When the temperature of the electrically conducting elements increase, the resistivity thereof increases; therefore, it is desirable to avoid unnecessary heating of all other parts than the electrically conductive materials within the heating system. The term &#x201c;electrically conducting elements, except the electrically conductive material&#x201d; is meant to cover the relevant electrically conducting elements arranged to connect the power supply to the structured body, except the electrically conductive structured body itself.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0068">It should be noted, that the system of the invention may include any appropriate number of power supplies and any appropriate number of conductors connecting the power supply/supplies and the electrically conductive material(s) of the structured body.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0069">Suitably, the at least two conductors are led through a pressure shell in a fitting so that the at least two conductors are electrically insulated from the pressure shell.

Thereby, the pressure within the pressure shell may be maintained even though the at least two conductors are lead through it. Non-limiting examples of the fittings may be an electrically insulating fitting, a dielectric fitting, a power compression seal, a compression fitting or a flange. The pressure shell typically comprises side walls, end walls, flanges and possibly further parts.

The connection between the two or more electrically conductive materials may be by mechanical connection, clamping, soldering, welding or any combination of these connection methods. Each electrically conductive material may comprise terminals in order to facilitate the electrical connections. The two or more electrically conductive materials may be connected to the power supply in serial or parallel connection. The electrical connection between the two or more electrically conductive materials is advantageously coherent and uniform along the connection surface between the two or more electrically conductive materials, so that the two or more electrically conductive materials act as a single coherent or consistently intra-connected material; hereby, uniform electrical conductivity throughout the two or more electrically conductive materials is facilitated. Alternatively, or additionally, the structured body may comprise an array of electrically conductive materials that are not electrically connected to each other. Instead, two or more electrically conductive materials are placed together within the pressure shell, but not connected electrically to each other. In this case, the structured body thus comprises electrically conductive materials connected in parallel to the power supply.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0072">A ceramic coating may be added directly to a metal surface of the electrically conductive material by wash coating. The wash coating of a metal surface is a well-known process; a description is given in e.g. Cybulski, A., and Moulijn, J.

The ceramic coating may for example be an oxide comprising Al, Zr, Mg, Ce and/or Ca. Exemplary coatings are calcium aluminate or a magnesium aluminum spinel. Such a ceramic coating may comprise further elements, such as La, Y, Ti, K or combinations thereof. The ceramic coating is an electrically insulating material and will typically have a thickness in the range of around 100 &#x3bc;m, say 10-500 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0073">Extruding and sintering or 3D printing a macroscopic structure results in a uniformly and coherently shaped macroscopic structure, which can afterwards be coated with the ceramic coating.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0074">The electrically conductive material and the ceramic coating may have been sintered in an oxidizing atmosphere in order to form chemical bonds between the ceramic coating and the electrically conductive material; this provides for an especially high heat conductivity between the electrically conductive material and the ceramic coating. Thereby, the structured body is compact in terms of heat transfer, and a heating system housing the structured body may be compact and limited mainly by the rate of the heating.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0075">In an embodiment, the structured body has at least one electrically insulating part arranged to increase the current path between the conductors to a length larger than the largest dimension of the structured body. The provision of a current path between the conductors larger than the largest dimension of the structured body may be by provision of electrically insulating part(s) positioned between the conductors and preventing the current running through some part of the structured body. Such electrically insulating parts are arranged to increase the current path and thus increase the resistance through the structured body. Hereby, the current path through the structured body can be e.g. more than 50%, 100%, 200%, 1000%, or even 10000% longer than the largest dimension of the structured body.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0076">Moreover, such electrically insulating parts are arranged to direct the current from one conductor, which is closer to the first end of the structured body than to the second end, towards the second end of the structured body and back to a second conductor closer to the first end of the structured body than to the second end. Preferably, the current is arranged to run from the first end of the structured body to the second and back to the first end. As seen in the figures, the first end of the structured body is the top end thereof. The arrow indicated &#x201c;z&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref> indicates a z-axis along the length of the structured body. The principal current path throughout the structured body will have a positive or negative value of z-coordinate of the accompanied current density vector along most of the length of the current path. By principal current path is meant the path of the electrons through a macroscopic structure of the structured body with the highest current density. The principal current path can also be understood as the path having the minimum length through the macroscopic structure of the structured body. Seen geometrically, the principal current path can be quantified as the largest current density vector within a plane perpendicular to the gas flow direction of a coherent section of the macroscopic structure. At the bottom of the structured body, as shown in the figures, the current will turn, and here the z-coordinate of the accompanied current density vector will be zero.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0077">As used herein, the term coherent section is meant to denote a cross-section area of the macroscopic structure wherein all walls of the coherent section are geometrically connected to one or more other walls of the coherent section within the same plane.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0078">In an embodiment, the structured body has at least one electrically insulating part arranged to direct a current through the structured body in order to ensure that for at least 70% of the length of said structured body, a current density vector of a principal current path has a non-zero component value parallel to the length of said structured body. Thus, for at least 70% of the length of the structured body, the current density vector will have a positive or negative component value parallel to the length of the structured body. Thus, for at least 70%, e.g. for 90% or 95%, of the length of structured body, viz. along the z-axis of the structured body as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>10</b></figref>, the current density vector of a principal current path will have a positive or negative value along the z-axis. This means that the current is forced from the first end of the structured body towards the second end, and subsequently is forced towards the first end again. The gas entering the first end of the structured body absorbs heat from the structured body. For this reason, the first end of the structured body remains colder than the second end, and by ensuring that the current density vector of the principal current path has a non-zero component value parallel to the length of said structured body, this takes place with a substantially continuously increasing temperature profile, which gives a controllable reaction front. In an embodiment the current density vector has a non-zero component value parallel to the length of said structured body in 70% of the length of said structured body, preferably 80%, more preferably 90%, and even more preferably 95%. It should be noted that the term &#x201c;the length of the structured body&#x201d; is meant to denote the dimension of the structured body in the direction of the gas flow. In the structured bodies as shown in the figures, the length is the longitudinal direction, viz. the longest dimension thereof. This is indicated by the arrow denote z in some of the figures.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0079">Non-limiting examples of insulating parts are cuts, slits, or holes in the structure. Optionally, a solid insulating material such as ceramics in cuts or slits in the structure can be used. A solid insulating material within a cut or slit assists in keeping the parts of the structured body on the sides of the cut or slit from each other. As used herein, the term &#x201c;largest dimension of the structured body&#x201d; is meant to denote the largest inner dimension of the geometrical form taken up by the structured body. If the structured body is box-formed, the largest dimension would be the diagonal from one corner to the farthest corner, also denoted the space diagonal.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0080">It should be noted that even though the current through the structured body may be arranged to twist or wind its way through the structured body due to the electrically insulating parts arranged to increase the current path, the gas passing through the heating system is inlet at one end of the heating system, passes over the structured body once before being outlet from the heating system. Inert material is advantageously present in relevant gaps between the structured body and the rest of the heating system to ensure that the gas within the heating system passes over the structured body.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0081">The length of the gas passage through the structured body is suitably less than the length of the passage of current from one electrode through the structured body and to the next electrode. The ratio of the length of the gas passage to the length of the current passage may be less than 0.6, or 0.3, 0.1, or even down to 0.002.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0082">Typically, the structured body has electrically insulating parts arranged to make the current path through the structured body a zigzag path. Here, the terms &#x201c;zigzag path&#x201d; and &#x201c;zigzag route&#x201d; is meant to denote a path that has corners at variable angles tracing a path from one conductor to another. A zigzag path is for example a path going upwards, turning, and subsequently going downwards. A zigzag path may have many turns, going upwards and subsequently downwards many times through the structured body, even though one turn is enough to make the path a zigzag path.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0083">It should be noted that the insulating parts arranged to increase the current path are not necessarily related to the ceramic coating on the electrically conductive material; even though this ceramic coating is also considered electrically insulating, it does not change the length of the current path between the conductors connected to the electrically conductive material.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0084">The macroscopic structure may have a plurality of parallel channels, a plurality of non-parallel channels and/or a plurality of labyrinthine channels, where the channels have walls defining the channels. Thereby, several different forms of the macroscopic structure can be used as long as the surface area of the structured body exposed to the gas is as large as possible. In a preferred embodiment, the macroscopic structure has parallel channels, since such parallel channels render a structured body with a very small pressure drop. In a preferred embodiment, parallel longitudinal channels are skewed in the longitudinal direction of the macroscopic structure. In this way, molecules of the gas flowing through the macroscopic structure will mostly tend to hit a wall inside the channels instead of just flowing straight through a channel without being in contact with a wall. The dimension of the channels should be appropriate in order to provide a macroscopic structure with a sufficient resistivity. For example, the channels could be quadratic (as seen in cross section perpendicular to the channels) and have a side length of the squares of between 1 and 3 mm; however, channels having a maximum extent in the cross section of up to about 4 cm are conceivable. The walls may e.g. have a thickness of between 0.2 and 2 mm, such as about 0.5 mm, and the ceramic coating supported by the walls has a thickness of between 10 &#x3bc;m and 500 &#x3bc;m, such as between 50 &#x3bc;m and 200 &#x3bc;m, such as 100 &#x3bc;m.

Typically, the material of the macroscopic structure is chosen as a material arranged to supply a heat flux of 500 W/m<sup>2 </sup>to 50000 W/m<sup>2 </sup>by resistance heating of the material. Preferably, resistance heating of the material supplies a heat flux of between 5 kW/m<sup>2 </sup>and 12 kW/m<sup>2</sup>, for example between 8 kW/m<sup>2 </sup>and 10 kW/m<sup>2</sup>. The heat flux is given as heat per geometric surface area of the surface exposed to the gas.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0087">The predetermined temperature range of the gas exiting the pressure shell/the heating system is the range from 200 to 1300&#xb0; C. The heated gas outlet temperature from the structured body is measured directly beneath or on the most downstream surface of the structured body. Measuring technology can be thermocouples (by voltage drop), resistance temperature detectors or infrared detection. The measuring point can be separated from the structured body and be embedded in downstream inert, or be directly on the surface with an insulating surface coverage.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0088">The structured body within said heating system suitably has a ratio between the area equivalent diameter of a horizontal cross section through the structured body and the height of the structured body in the range from 0.1 to 2.0. The area equivalent diameter of the cross section through the heating system is defined as the diameter of a circle of equivalent area as the area of the cross section. When the ratio between the area equivalent diameter and the height of the structured body is between 0.1 and 2.0, the pressure shell housing the structured body may be relatively small compared to other heating systems.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0089">Typically, the gas flows through the heating system in an upflow or downflow direction, so that the gas flows through channels in the structured body along the height thereof. When the structured body comprises a number of or an array of macroscopic structures, the individual macroscopic structures within the array may be placed side by side, on top of each other or in a combination thereof. It is stressed that, when the structured body comprises more than one macroscopic structures, the dimensions of the structured body are the dimensions of the more than one macroscopic structures. Thus, as an example, if the structured body comprises two macroscopic structures, each having the height h, put on top of each other, the height of the structured body is 2h.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0090">The volume of the structured body is chosen in consideration of the desired temperature out of the heating system correlated to the heat generation capacity of the electrically conductive material.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0091">Suitably, the height of the heating system is between 0.5 and 7 m, more preferably between 0.5 and 3 m.

In this way, the heated gas composition can be held almost constant also during the transition stage. In an embodiment, the gradual changes are made in such a way where the flow is increased in small steps while increasing the electrical power to maintain an almost constant heated gas outlet temperature from the structured body.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0128">In an embodiment the structured body comprises a first part arranged to generate a first heat flux and a second part arranged to generate a second heat flux, where the first heat flux is lower than the second heat flux, and where the first part is upstream the second part. Here, the term &#x201c;the first part is upstream the second part&#x201d; is meant to denote, that the gas fed into the heating system reaches the first part before the gas reaches the second part. The first part and second part of the structured body may be two different macroscopic structures supporting ceramic coating, where the two different macroscopic structures may be arranged to generate different heat fluxes for a given electrical current and voltage. For instance, the first part of the structured body may have a large surface area, whilst the second part of the structured body has a smaller surface area. This may be accomplished by providing a structured body in the second part having a smaller cross sectional area than the cross sectional area of the first part. Alternatively, the current path through the first part of the structured body may be more straight than the current path through the second part of the structured body, thus making the current twist and wind more through the second part than through the first part of the structured body, whereby the current generates more heat in the second part of the structured body than in the first part. As mentioned before, slits or cuts in the macroscopic structure may make the current path zigzag through the macroscopic structure. It should be noted, that the first and second part of the structured body may experience different electrical currents and voltages in order to be able to supply different heat fluxes. However, the different heat fluxes of the first and second part may also be achieved by supplying the same electrical current and voltage through/over the first and second part, due to different physical properties of the first and second part as indicated above. In a further embodiment, the structured body comprises a third part arranged to generate a third heat flux, where the third heat flux is lower than the first and/or the second heat flux, and where the third part is downstream the first and/or second part.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0129">In an embodiment, the heating system further comprises a control system arranged to control the electrical power supply to ensure that the temperature of the gas exiting the pressure shell lies in a predetermined range. The control of the electrical power supply is the control of the electrical output from the power supply. The control of the electrical power supply may e.g. be carried out as a control of the voltage and/or current from the electrical power supply, as a control of whether the electrical power supply is turned on or off or as a combination hereof. The power supplied to the structured body can be in the form of alternating current or direct current.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0130">According to one embodiment, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller controls the electrical potential based on feedback reading of the process value of heated gas outlet temperature from the structured body.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0131">The method described herein allows rapid switching between conditions A and B.

Therefore, the current runs in a direction downwards as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> in the part of the structured body along the slit <b>60</b>, subsequently it runs transversely to the longitudinal direction below the slit <b>60</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and finally the current runs upwards in the longitudinal direction of the structured body to the other connector <b>7</b>. The connectors <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> are mechanically fastened to the structured body by means of inter alia mechanical fastening means such as screws and bolts. However, additional or alternative fastening means are conceivable. In an embodiment, the electrical power supply generates a voltage of 3V and a current of 400 A.

For instance, the feed gas entering into such a heating system could have a temperature of 200&#xb0; C. or 400&#xb0; C. and would thus keep the connectors <b>7</b> and conductors <b>40</b> from reaching temperatures much higher than this temperature.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows another embodiment of a structured body <b>10</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; with connectors <b>7</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;.
