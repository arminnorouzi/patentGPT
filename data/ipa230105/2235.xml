Generally, silicon metal is manufactured using a carbo-thermic reaction between carbon or coke and silica or quartz in vacuum arc furnaces or in direct arc furnaces. Such systems and methods are exemplified in PCT publication WO 2017/024378 to Pyrogenesis Canada Inc. filed Aug. 8, 2016, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Known systems and methods require an initial reactive heating process of feed materials comprising both silica or quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and a carbon-based reducing agent such as carbon (C) in some form (e.g., graphite, carbon black, coke, etc.).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The heating of feed materials, including a mixture of silica sand or quartz granules and the carbon-based reducing agent (e.g. carbon granules), is typically performed in a crucible where the feed materials are reactively heated by a direct carbon arc system using one or more electrodes arcing through the feed materials (e.g., submerged arc). Reactive heating means that heat is applied to the mixture of silica sand or quartz granules and some form of carbon. There is a chemical reaction with the carbon-based reducing agent (e.g. carbon granules) such that silica can be reduced into a Si product.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The high temperature reaction between the carbon and the silica or quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>) in the crucible results in Si and CO or CO<sub>2 </sub>as well as many other possible compounds being produced. The desired liquid silicon metal and many undesirable compounds will drain to the bottom of the crucible. Some of these undesirable compounds include various metallic and other elements that are originally a part of the feed materials and in some cases and under specific conditions some of these elements/compounds can be evaporated. Furthermore, some of the carbon itself, which was a reactant, can also remain in the produced material as undesirable silicon-carbon compounds (SiC). The molten silicon collected in the bottom of the crucible is tapped off or drained periodically.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Known systems and methods of producing silicon metal using a carbo-thermic reaction between carbon or coke and silica or quartz in vacuum arc furnaces or in direct arc furnaces will produce, as a primary byproduct, various greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) or carbon monoxide gas (CO) from the furnace. Therefore, the known carbo-thermic reactions used to manufacture silicon are not very green or environmentally friendly.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">If the silicon produced in such a process is to be used for solar panel applications, where a purity of level of at least 99.999% Si (i.e. <b>5</b>N) may be a minimal requirement, then the tapped off liquid silicon metal requires further refinement or upgrading to remove various contaminants.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some conventional processes and schemes are used for the upgrading of silicon metal produced by the carbo-thermic processes to increase the purity of the silicon metal so that it can be used in the manufacture of polycrystalline silicon (or polysilicon or poly-Si) used for solar panel manufacture. While the basic carbo-thermic processes can produce 98.5% to 99.5% Si, these purity levels, however, depend significantly on the level of purity of the feed materials being at or above 99.9%. Moreover, it would be understood by those skilled in the art that polysilicon requires very high silicon purity but it is also a requirement to provide for particularly low levels of boron (B), phosphorous (P), copper (Cu), titanium (Ti), iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al), which are contaminants commonly found in the feed materials (quartz and carbon).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Research and development efforts, with the target of upgrading of metal grade silicon metal to solar grade silicon metal have been ongoing since the 1980's. The higher the purity of the silicon produced, the greater the value.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Vacuum refinement of molten metal grade silicon is one process that has been used to attempt to evaporate impurities out of the molten silicon metal. This has been implemented both in the reaction furnace and after the molten silicon is removed from the reaction furnace where treatment is performed in ladles of molten silicon by exposing them to a vacuum while in a molten state. This process has limited effectiveness when the depth of the molten silicon is more than a few millimeters because of hydrostatic pressure effects resulting in relatively high pressures at depths beyond a few millimeters in the molten silicon, requiring extensive vertical stirring of the liquid for surface exposure of the contaminants.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other separate processes may be required to remove boron, titanium and possibly other contaminants, which have very low vapor pressures at the temperature of molten silicon. And in fact boron and titanium have vapor pressures below that of molten silicon, making removal of these important contaminants difficult using vacuum refinement alone. These and other contaminants are generally in the feed materials at various concentrations. Some contaminants can be removed to yield a more pure feed material. However, this adds steps and increases the overall cost.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, the existing process for manufacturing silicon metal requires reactive heating and results in silicon products that may include many contaminants. The contaminants make it not suitable in its produced state for high purity solid state types of applications like solar cells, without additional significant refinement thereafter.

Broadly, silica-containing material <b>12</b> comprising quartz or silica (SiO<sub>2 </sub>or silicon dioxide) is the feedstock for the process <b>100</b>. The silica-containing material <b>12</b> and inert gas <b>48</b> are fed into the first section <b>24</b>. In other examples, the entire chamber <b>20</b> of vacuum furnace <b>10</b> is fed. The quartz or silica, in the presence of the inert gas <b>48</b>, is then non-reactively heated in the first section <b>24</b> at standard pressure or greater than standard pressure. At this step, the heating is non-reactive because the heating of the silica-containing material <b>12</b> is performed in the absence of reducing agents and therefore, no reduction reaction takes place at this time.

In some example embodiments, the first temperature is above the melting point (the melting point of SiO<sub>2 </sub>is about 1983 K (1710 C)) but below the boiling point (the boiling point of SiO<sub>2 </sub>at standard pressure is about 2500 K (2227 C)) of SiO<sub>2 </sub>at atmospheric pressure or higher. In some embodiments, the first temperature is about 2100K (&#x2dc;1827 C), for example. The first temperature in the first section <b>24</b> may depend on the chosen operating pressures used in the conversion of the liquid SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>14</b> into gaseous SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>16</b> in the second section <b>26</b>. For instance, if a relatively high operating pressure (e.g. 3500 Pa to 4000 Pa) is used to convert the liquid SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>14</b> into gaseous SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>16</b>, then a relatively higher first temperature in the first section <b>24</b> (e.g. 2100 K) would be used. A relatively high operating pressure may be expected to increase the rate of silicon production because this will allow for an increased density of the gases (e.g. gaseous SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>16</b> and one or more process gases <b>50</b>, e.g. H<sub>2</sub>) that participate in the reduction reaction in the second section <b>26</b>.

A relatively higher operating pressure in the range of about 3500 Pa to about 4000 Pa can be used to achieve a higher production rate. This is because the density of the process gas (e.g. H<sub>2</sub>) increases as the pressure increases, which allows more gaseous SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>16</b> to be generated and then processed (reduced) in a given time period by also increasing the heat input to section one 24. In some example embodiments, the subatmospheric pressure is on or about 3500 Pa (the boiling point of SiO<sub>2 </sub>at about 3500 Pa is about 2100 K).</p><p id="p-0127" num="0147">In an example embodiment, during the heating of the silica-containing material <b>12</b> and/or gradual and controlled reduction of the pressure to the subatmospheric pressure sufficient to convert the liquid SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>14</b> into gaseous SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>16</b>, there may be an evaporation of one or more contaminants <b>34</b> in the silica-containing material <b>12</b> before the SiO<sub>2 </sub>becomes vaporized due to one or more interim subatmospheric pressures.

For example, P, Zn, Na and Mg are expected to be some of the first elements to evaporate since their vapor pressure is above standard pressure at the first temperature (e.g. 2100 K). As the pressure is reduced further to just below standard pressure, other contaminants such as Ca, Sb, Bi and Pb will begin to evaporate.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0149">In some embodiments, a specific pressure is held for a period of time, or two or more different pressures may be cycled back-and-forth, if the off gassing components <b>34</b> are to be segregated for different treatment after being extracted.

According to one embodiment, closure of the first section vacuum outlet <b>32</b> and opening of the second vacuum outlets <b>52</b> is approximately below the vapor pressure of Ga and approximately above the vapor pressure of Al, to prevent incorporating these contaminants in the silicon <b>18</b> product or contaminating the reduction section (i.e. the second section <b>26</b>) of the reaction vessel <b>22</b>. The timing of the closure of the first section vacuum outlet <b>32</b> and opening of the second vacuum outlets <b>52</b> can be controlled by one or more control systems (not shown). The control system can include one or more controllers (hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software). The control system can include one or more processors, and memory for storing instructions executable by the one or more processors. The control system can be configured to detect the flow rate of specific gases from the first section vacuum outlet <b>32</b> and, when this specific gas is detected, the control system will close the first section vacuum outlet <b>32</b>, open gas inlets <b>46</b> to introduce process gas <b>50</b> in the second section, and/or open the second vacuum outlets <b>52</b> to begin expelling byproducts <b>54</b>.

The vacuum outflow in the vacuum furnace <b>10</b> can be adjusted in order to compensate for the introduction of the process gas or plasma <b>50</b> and the resulting H<sub>2</sub>O vapor or other gas byproducts <b>54</b>. For example, in a situation where there is an unintended increase in the evaporation rate (due to too much heat input for example), the increased evaporation rate can be quickly reduced by increasing the control point pressure.

In one embodiment, the temperature in the second section <b>26</b> is higher (i.e. above 2100K) than the temperature in the first section <b>24</b>.

Electrolytic production of hydrogen for use in the reduction process would simply use electrical power and distilled water, which can be provided by cooling the H<sub>2</sub>O product from the reactor. In one embodiment hydrogen gas for the reducing reaction can be provided by employing the Kvearner process or some similar Plasma Pyrolysis of natural gas (methane or CH<sub>4</sub>) process in a separate system which produces hydrogen and captured carbon black, which is a useful product of value that can be used by other industries, while capturing the carbon which maintains the present process of silicon production as a green process.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0172">Many contaminants in the original feedstock never reach their vapor point during the initial heating step and as such remain un-evaporated contaminants <b>38</b> in the first section <b>24</b>.

This increases the time it takes for the gas mixtures to propagate through the reaction section <b>126</b>, which may result in a more complete reaction process at any given flow rate. The area (as opposed to the volume which is related to path length) determines the flow velocity at any given volumetric flow. The intent of diffusion (increasing the gas path area) is to maintain a constant velocity, by adjusting the area of the flow path to compensate for increased volume resulting from adding gas (i.e. process gas) and increased volume due to temperature rise of the process gas due to the reaction heat release (raising the temperature of the resultant mixture temperature of the cold process gas and hot vapor from the vaporizer).

For example, if the process gas <b>50</b> is H<sub>2</sub>, ratio of H<sub>2 </sub>to SiO<sub>2 </sub>can be about 14:1.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0183">The temperature of the process gas <b>50</b> can be adjusted and/or maintained by an external system (not shown) to suit the particular needs. In one embodiment, the temperature of process gas <b>50</b> is significantly lower than the vaporization temperature of the gaseous SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>16</b> entering the second section <b>126</b>. While not being limited to any particular embodiment, product yields can be increased as a consequence of the promotion of certain favourable thermodynamic conditions. For example, process gas <b>50</b> could be cooled to (or maintained at) temperatures of around 300K, whereby such a temperature would mean a relatively low entropy value and a Gibbs free energy condition that promotes the production of the liquid silicon <b>18</b> product. Additionally, the lower peak reaction temperatures will at least minimize, if not avoid, losses of the resultant silicon <b>18</b> product due to unintended product vaporization and subsequent removal. In an embodiment where the process gas <b>50</b> is a cooled process gas <b>50</b>, the entire system for delivering process gas <b>50</b> can be insulated to keep the temperatures low to promote favourable conditions. For example, the gas inlets <b>146</b>, gas chamber <b>147</b>, and all associated piping can be insulated.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0184">The initial mixing and reducing reactions can take place in a mixing region <b>131</b> of the second section <b>126</b>. The mixing region <b>131</b> comprises the outside wall of the second section <b>126</b>, the wall <b>127</b>, the channel <b>129</b>, and gas inlet <b>146</b> and gas chamber <b>147</b>. Mixing region <b>131</b> is configured to accommodate expansion of the gases when the process gas <b>50</b> is initially reacted with gaseous SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>16</b> flowing through the channel <b>129</b> and into the second section <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0185">Without being limited to any particular embodiment, if the process gas <b>50</b> is set at an initially low temperature relative to the gaseous SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>16</b>, it is expected that there will be expansion of the process gas <b>50</b> (and a contraction of the gaseous SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>14</b>) requiring that the mixing region <b>131</b> to be dimensioned to accommodate such expansion. The mixing region <b>131</b> is configured to avoid back pressurizing of the vaporization section (i.e. the first section <b>124</b>) which may cause vaporization instability by altering the back pressure on the vaporization section directly affecting vaporization from the liquid SiO<sub>2 </sub>(since the temperature of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>defines its vapor pressure, momentary increases in the back pressure will momentarily prevent the vaporization process which may result in oscillatory instability in the vapor flow and process).</p><p id="p-0166" num="0186">According to an embodiment, the one or more channels <b>129</b> have an interior diameter which increases in the direction moving towards the second section <b>126</b> from the first section <b>124</b> such that a vapor flow area for gases proximal the second section <b>126</b> is greater than a vapor flow area for gas proximal the first section <b>124</b> in order to accommodate expansion of the gases moving from the first section <b>124</b> to the second section <b>124</b> through the one or more channels <b>129</b>.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0187">According to an embodiment, the channel <b>129</b> is an annular channel <b>129</b> which substantially encircles the first section <b>124</b>.

The flow area increases because both the diameter of the annulus and the vertical extent of the annulus are increasing, based on the geometry. The reduction process can be expected to begin in region <b>131</b>, and therefore this where the temperature of the mixture of the vapor and process gas <b>50</b> will begin to increase causing expansion. The expansion is accommodated by the increasing area (and volume) due to the increasing radius and geometry of the annulus, that the gases are being sucked through by the vacuum system pulling the products out of second vacuum outlet <b>52</b> further along the second section <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0188">According to an embodiment, the annular channel <b>129</b> is configured to allow unobstructed outward radial flow of gaseous SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>16</b> from the first section <b>124</b> to the second section <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0189">In an embodiment where the cooled process gas <b>50</b> is cooled H<sub>2</sub>, the produced H<sub>2</sub>O vapor exhaust temperature can be expected to be about 1660 degrees C.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0190">Furthermore, the reduction reactions in the area of the mixing region <b>131</b> can be facilitated with additional activation energy in the form of a plasma arc from electrodes <b>266</b> and wires <b>268</b> for providing current to the electrodes <b>266</b> routed into the second section <b>126</b> through the gas inlets <b>146</b>.
