These defects of cotton fabrics can be solved by effective technological methods such as durable press finishing and liquid ammonia finishing. Pre-cure durable press, wet-state durable press, post-cure durable press, durable press for ready-made clothes, and the like are representative finishing methods in durable press finishing. Among them, the delayed-cure method is a durable press finishing technology that is conducive to obtaining a more favorable setting effect for garments, but low stability of delayed-cure sensitized fabrics prepared by the technology has always been a crucial problem in technological development. The specific manifestation is that a partial cross-linking reaction occurs between cotton fabrics and resin during storage and transportation, resulting in wrinkles that are difficult to remove, and reducing the whiteness of the delayed-cure sensitized fabrics.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the prior art, people mostly improve the storage stability of delayed-cure sensitized fabrics by designing and optimizing resin finishing agents and catalytic systems, and there is no report any literature that optimizes the finishing technology to achieve the aforementioned improvement effect.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The objective of this section is to outline some aspects of examples of the disclosure and to briefly introduce some preferred examples.

Specifically, a liquid ammonia finishing and mercerizing combined process (i.e. singeing, desizing, liquid ammonia finishing, mercerizing, liquid ammonia finishing and post-cure finishing) in a specific sequence is designed before a post-cure finishing process, and on the premise of not changing the technological parameters of individual processes, the storage stability of the treated delayed-cure sensitized fabric is significantly improved. The disclosure overcomes the technical bias in the field of cotton fabric finishing in the prior art that, to improve the storage stability of delayed-cure sensitized fabrics, often the technical means of resin finishing agents and catalytic systems are designed and optimized, while the influence of the relative sequence of processes in the pretreatment technology of post-cure finishing is hardly considered on the storage stability of delayed-cure sensitized fabrics. The disclosure solves the aforementioned technical problem just by the technical means abandoned due to technical bias.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">(2) The disclosure achieves unexpected technical effects. The disclosure combines the pretreatment technology of &#x201c;singeing, desizing, liquid ammonia finishing, mercerizing and liquid ammonia finishing&#x201d; in a specific sequence with &#x201c;post-cure finishing&#x201d; (excluding storage and cure steps), significantly enhances the storage stability of delayed-cure sensitized fabrics, relieves the problems such as wrinkles that are difficult to remove and whiteness reduction caused by a slow reaction of the delayed-cure sensitized fabrics during storage, and is favorable for improving the product quality. The specific manifestation is that the delayed-cure sensitized fabric prepared by the disclosure has a relatively slowly changing overall breaking strength after 5 d of storage, a relatively slowly increasing overall wrinkle recovery angle, and always the highest whiteness. The pretreatment technology of &#x201c;singeing, desizing, liquid ammonia finishing, mercerizing and liquid ammonia finishing&#x201d; and &#x201c;post-cure finishing&#x201d; provided by the disclosure are well combined. When one process is omitted or the pretreatment technology sequence is changed, the stability of the prepared delayed-cure sensitized fabric obviously decreases.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">(3) After the pretreatment technology of &#x201c;singeing, desizing, liquid ammonia finishing, mercerizing and liquid ammonia finishing&#x201d; and &#x201c;post-cure finishing&#x201d; (including storage and cure steps) as described in the disclosure are combined, compared with the single pretreatment technology of &#x201c;singeing, desizing, liquid ammonia finishing, mercerizing, liquid ammonia finishing, tentering and preshrinking&#x201d;, the wrinkle recovery angle of the prepared cotton fabric increases by 32.5%, the wrinkle recovery performance is greatly improved, the breaking strength retention rate can reach 87.8%, and the durable press effect is more favorable.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">(4) The treatment technology of the disclosure is relatively simple and feasible, and is suitable for industrialized large-scale production.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">To make the objectives, features and advantages of the disclosure more obvious and easier to understand, the disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to the examples in the specification.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description to facilitate a full understanding of the disclosure, but the disclosure may also be practiced in other ways than those described herein.
