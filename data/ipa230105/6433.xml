detection in a system including one or more photovoltaic generators, one or more photovoltaic power devices and a system power device and/or a load connectible to the photovoltaic generators and/or the photovoltaic power devices. The methods may measure voltage, current, and/or power delivered to the load or system power device, and the methods may measure voltage noise or current noise within the photovoltaic system. The methods may periodically, and/or in response to detecting noise, reduce an electrical parameter such as current or voltage in order to extinguish an arc. The methods may compare one or more measurements to one or more thresholds to detect arcing, and upon a comparison indicating that arcing is or was present, an alarm condition may be set.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="163.58mm" wi="146.05mm" file="US20230006434A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image"

The inverter typically converts the direct current (DC) power from the photovoltaic panels to alternating current (AC) power.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Arcing may occur in switches, circuit breakers, relay contacts, fuses and poor cable terminations. When a circuit is switched off or a bad connection occurs in a connector, an arc discharge may form across the contacts of the connector. An arc discharge is an electrical breakdown of a gas, which produces an ongoing plasma discharge, resulting from a current flowing through a medium such as air, which is normally non-conducting. At the beginning of a disconnection, the separation distance between the two contacts is very small. As a result, the voltage across the air gap between the contacts produces a very large electrical field in terms of volts per millimeter. This large electrical field causes the ignition of an electrical arc between the two sides of the disconnection. If a circuit has enough current and voltage to sustain an arc, the arc can cause damage to equipment such as melting of conductors, destruction of insulation, and fire. The zero crossing of alternating current (AC) power systems may cause an arc not to reignite. A direct current system may be more prone to arcing than AC systems because of the absence of zero crossing in DC power systems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electric arcing can have detrimental effects on electric power distribution systems and electronic equipment, and in particular, photovoltaic systems, which are often arranged in a manner that increases the risk of arching. For example, photovoltaic panels often operate at extreme temperatures due to their necessary exposure to the sun. Such conditions cause accelerated deterioration in insulation and other equipment that can lead to exposed wires. Such systems are also exposed to environmental conditions, such as rain, snow, and high humidity. Further, typical residential and/or industrial photovoltaic applications often utilize several panels connected in series to produce high voltage. Exposed conductors with high voltage in wet/humid conditions create an environment in which the probability of arching increases.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This problem of arching raises system maintenance cost and reduces the lifespan of photovoltaic panels, because photovoltaic panels and other related equipment will need to be repaired and/or replaced more frequently. Arching in photovoltaic systems also increases the risk of fire, thereby increasing operating and/or insurance cost on facilities having photovoltaic systems. The net effect of arching in photovoltaic systems is to increase the threshold at which a photovoltaic system becomes cost competitive with nonrenewable sources of energy, such as natural gas, oil, and coal.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As newly described herein, systems and methods are presented to address the problem of arching in photovoltaic systems, thereby reducing the overall cost, and extending the useful lifespan of such systems. The embodiments described herein, therefore, make deployment of photovoltaic systems in residential and industrial application more competitive with nonrenewable energy alternatives.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Methods are provided for arc detection in a photovoltaic panel system, which may include a load connectible to the photovoltaic panel with one or more mechanisms such as a power line, e.g. a DC power line. An exemplary method may measure power delivered to the load and power produced by the photovoltaic panel. These measurements may be analyzed using a suitable technique. One example of a suitable technique includes a comparison to generate, for example, a differential power measurement result. The differential power measurement result may be further analyzed using, for example, one or more static and/or dynamic threshold values. The analysis may trigger, for example, an alarm condition when the differential power measurement results deviate from one or more threshold values, either at an instant in time or over a time period when the signal is integrated or smoothed. One or more of the measurements (e.g., the second measurement), the static and/or dynamic thresholds, and/or the power measurements may be converted to a suitable format and/or modulation scheme and transmitted to a remote location. In one exemplary method, one or more of the foregoing items (e.g., the second measurement) may be modulated and transmitted (e.g., over the DC power line) to a remote location.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to further aspects, a device for arc detection in a system may include a photovoltaic panel and a load connectible to the photovoltaic panel using, for example, a power line (e.g. a DC power line). In this aspect, the device may be variously configured to include one or more electronic modules adapted for measuring power produced by one or more photovoltaic panels and/or a distributed and/or centralized controller adapted for measuring power delivered to, for example, the load. Aspects may be variously configured to include one or more mechanisms to analyze power associated with the photovoltaic panel and/or power delivered to the load, dynamically and/or statically, in an instantaneous and/or integrated manner. The analysis may be variously configured to include, for example, dynamic and/or static comparisons of an instantaneous and/or integrated signal. Suitable comparisons may or may not include one or more thresholds. The analysis may collect historical data and determine variations from this historical data. Additionally, the analysis may include predetermined threshold values based on prior test data. Based on the dynamic and/or static comparison, one or more of the mechanisms may be operable to detect arcing when the power output of one or more photovoltaic panels is greater than the power delivered to the load.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to further aspects, a method for arc detection may be performed in a system having, for example, a photovoltaic string and a load connectible to the photovoltaic string using, for example, a DC power line. The method for arc detection measurement may be variously configured, for example, to quantify a value associated with a noise voltage of the load and/or a noise voltage of one or more of the photovoltaic panels in the photovoltaic string. The quantities associated with the various measured noise voltages may be analyzed using a suitable technique. In one technique, a dynamic and/or static comparison is made between the various noise voltages e.g., (the noise voltage of the load compared with the noise voltage of one or more (e.g. all) of the photovoltaic panels in the photovoltaic string) producing a quantitative value such as a differential noise voltage value(s). The differential noise voltage value(s) may then be analyzed either statically and/or dynamically. In one embodiment, the differential noise voltage values(s) may be compared against one or more threshold values, statically and/or dynamically, instantaneously and/or integrated over time and then compared. Where a threshold is utilized, an alarm condition may be triggered where one or more of the aforementioned values exceed a threshold. For example, upon the differential noise voltage result being more than a threshold value then an alarm condition may be set; upon the alarm condition being set, the photovoltaic string may be disconnected. The various parameters discussed above may be analyzed locally and/or transmitted to a remote location. In one embodiment, one or more of the values may be modulated and transmitted over a DC power line. Upon the power of one or more or all of the photovoltaic panels or the power of photovoltaic string(s) being greater than the power as delivered to the load, then an alarm condition is set according to a previously defined static and/or dynamic criterion.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to further aspects, one of the methods for arc detection may include software and/or circuits for measuring power delivered to the load and/or power produced by the photovoltaic string.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The measurement of the power of the photovoltaic string may be variously configured. In one example, the measurement involves sending instructions to measure the power output of each photovoltaic panel. The power value of each photovoltaic panel may then be transmitted and received. The power value of each photovoltaic panel may be added, thereby giving the second measurement result. The second measurement result may then be subsequently modulated and transmitted over the DC power line.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The load impedance may be changed according to a predetermined value. The power of the photovoltaic string, in this example, may then be measured again, thereby producing a third measurement result of the power of the photovoltaic string. Followed by the power of the load being measured, thereby producing a measurement result of the power of the load. The various measurements may be compared, thereby producing another differential power result. The various differential power results may thereby produce a total differential power result. In this example, upon the total differential power result being more than a threshold value, an alarm condition may be set. Upon the alarm condition being set, the photovoltaic string may be disconnected in the example. The third measurement result may be modulated and transmitted over the DC power line.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this example, the measuring of the power of the photovoltaic string may involve sending one or more instruction to measure the power of each photovoltaic panel. The power value of each photovoltaic panel may then be transmitted and received. The power value of each photovoltaic panel may be added, thereby giving the third measurement result. The third measurement result may then be subsequently modulated and transmitted over the DC power line.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further example, the sending of instructions to measure power in the string may be to a master module connected to one of the panels of the string. Embodiments may also include slave modules respectively connected to other panels of the string, which may be instructed to measure power. Power measurement results may then be transmitted from the slave modules to the master module. The power measurement results may then be received by the master module, added up by the master module to produce a string power result, which may be transmitted to a central and/or distributed controller in this example.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments disclosed herein, a plurality of photovoltaic power devices may be configured to measure voltages in a synchronized manner, which may provide increased accuracy of a summed voltage measurement. In some embodiments, both the voltage measurements and the transmission of associated voltage measurements may be synchronized (e.g., time-synchronized, etc.). The voltage measurements may be taken at input and/or at output terminals of photovoltaic generators (e.g., photovoltaic panels, cells, substrings, etc.), in serial or in parallel photovoltaic strings. According to some aspects, the voltage measurements may be retransmitted in response to a transmission error and/or as a redundancy feature, which may prevent transmission errors or may address other issues.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, photovoltaic power devices may feature multiple output voltage terminals. In some embodiments, photovoltaic generators and photovoltaic power devices may be coupled together and/or may be arranged to provide a plurality of lower-impedance voltage loops. Designing photovoltaic string to have lower-impedance voltage loops may, in some embodiments, provide certain advantages. These advantages may include increasing a voltage sensor's ability to detect high-frequency voltage components, which may indicate an arcing condition. According to some aspects, a lower-impedance voltage loop may also provide a way of determining a location of an arcing condition.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The disclosure herein makes reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates an example of a circuit showing serial arcing.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates the circuit of Fig.la showing an example of parallel or shunt arcing.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a power generation system including an arc detection feature.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a method for detecting serial and/or parallel arcing.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a method for detecting serial and/or parallel arcing.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a power generation circuit.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a method for comparing a load power to a string power.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a method for measuring power of a string.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>d </i></figref>shows a method for serial arc detection.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a method of detecting an electrical arc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a method for measuring an output voltage.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>c </i></figref>shows an example data packet.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>d </i></figref>shows a method for detecting an electrical arc.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>e </i></figref>shows a method for estimating voltages in a photovoltaic system.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>f </i></figref>shows a method for detecting an electrical arc.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a power generation system including an arc detection feature.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a method for detecting an arc.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a photovoltaic power device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a power generation system including an arc detection feature.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a power generation system including an arc detection feature.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>d </i></figref>shows a method for detecting an arc.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a photovoltaic system configuration.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a method for extinguishing an electrical arc.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a method for detecting and extinguishing an electrical arc.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a first example result of carrying out the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a second example result of carrying out the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref><i>b. </i></p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout.

The current flowing in string <b>520</b> may be related to the level of irradiation of panels <b>200</b>, e.g., the more irradiation, the more current in string <b>520</b>, and the output power of a module <b>202</b> is more.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">In a second case, modules <b>202</b> may be operating to convert powers on the input to be the same powers on the output; so for example if 200 watts is on the input of a module <b>202</b>, module <b>202</b> may endeavor to have 200 watts on the output. However, because modules <b>202</b> may be connected serially in a string <b>520</b>, the current flowing in string <b>520</b> may be the same by virtue of Kirchhoff s law. The current flowing in string <b>520</b> being the same means that the output voltage (V<sub>i</sub>) of a module should vary in order to establish that the power on the output of a module <b>202</b> may be the same as the power on the input of a module <b>202</b>. Therefore, in this example, as string <b>520</b> current increases, the output voltage (V<sub>i</sub>) of modules <b>202</b> decreases or as string <b>520</b> current decreases, the output voltage (V<sub>i</sub>) of modules <b>202</b> increases to a maximum value.

Voltage V<b>850</b> may be monitored (e.g., measured), and the input and output voltage of PV power devices (i.e., V<sub>out,802 </sub>and V<sub>in,802</sub>) may be similarly monitored. Under normal (i.e., non-arcing) operating conditions, connection-point voltages may be about zero and voltages V<b>850</b>, V<sub>out,802 </sub>and V<sub>in,802i </sub>may change at low-frequency or not at all (i.e., DC voltages). Under arcing conditions, an arc may inject high-frequency voltage components into a component of first voltage loop <b>881</b> (for example, if an arc is present at CP<b>2</b>, the voltage Vcp<b>2</b> may include high-frequency components). To maintain a total voltage of zero across first voltage loop <b>881</b> (i.e., as to not violate Eq. 10), the remaining voltages featured in Eq. 10 may (e.g., the voltages across one or more of PV power devices <b>802</b> and/or system power device <b>850</b>) may comprise negative high-frequency components, i.e., high-frequency voltage components having the opposite polarity compared to the high-frequency voltage components across the arc). The negative high-frequency voltage components may be detectable by sensors coupled to PV power devices <b>802</b>, PV generators <b>800</b> and/or system power device <b>850</b>. For example, a voltage sensor coupled to the inputs of system power device <b>850</b> may measure V<b>850</b>, and may be configured to raise an alarm or take corrective action in response to a V<b>850</b> voltage measurement including high-frequency components (e.g., above 1 kHz) at an amplitude of over 10 mV, which may indicate an arcing condition.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0169">In some embodiments, voltage sensors coupled to PV power devices <b>802</b> and/or system power device <b>850</b> may be dual-purpose. For example, communication device <b>806</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a </i></figref>may be a Power Line Communications (PLC) device configured to carry out Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) and may comprise a voltage sensor configured to measure high-frequency voltage components. Voltage components measured at certain information bands of high frequencies may be decoded for information, and voltage components measured at noise bands of high frequencies may be determined to be indicative of an arcing condition. For example, a first frequency band between 55 kHz-65 kHz, a second frequency band between 75 kHz-80 kHz and a third frequency band between 85 kHz-91 kHz may all be monitored for information signals. A fourth frequency band between 100 kHz-120 kHz may be monitored for voltage noise indicating an arcing condition.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0170">In some embodiments, certain frequency bands may be associated with or may correspond to voltage noise that might not be indicative of an arcing condition. For example, an arc detection circuit (such as disclosed herein) may be coupled to a DC/DC converter or a DC/AC converter which may comprise one or more switches that may switch (i.e., operate, etc.) at a high frequency. The switching of the switches at a high frequency may cause voltage noise at the switching frequency and multiples thereof. For example, a converter switching one or more switches at 19 kHz may generate voltage noise at 19 kHz, 38 kHz, 57 kHz, etc. To reduce the risk of determining a false-positive arcing condition, in some embodiments, a frequency band for monitoring for an arcing condition or that may indicate an arcing condition may be selected or identified. Doing this may avoid one or more frequencies that may contain voltage noise which might not be indicative of an arcing condition (e.g., a switching frequency, etc.).</p><p id="p-0177" num="0171">In some embodiments, a select frequency or group of select frequencies may be used for monitoring voltage noise indicating an arcing condition. The select frequency or selected frequencies may correspond to a frequency at which an impedance of a voltage loop may be reduced. For example, the total impedance of voltage loop <b>881</b> may be lowest (due to resonating capacitive and inductive elements comprising voltage loop <b>881</b>) at 10 kHz. In this case, a voltage component corresponding to 10 kHz may be measured for an arc indication, or a voltage component corresponding to between 5 kHz and 20 kHz (i.e., twice and half of the low-impedance frequency) may be measured for an arc indication. In some embodiments, a loop impedance may be adjusted (e.g., by connecting adjustable capacitive and/or inductive elements) to resonate at a selected frequency, thereby improving detection of a voltage component corresponding to the selected frequency.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0172">In some embodiments, additional voltage (or other parameter) sensing circuits may be added and configured for measuring high-frequency voltage components. For example, voltage-sensing circuits (e.g., voltage-sensing inductor circuits) may be serially coupled to input or output terminals of PV power devices, system power devices and/or photovoltaic generators, and may be configured to measure high-frequency voltage components at the input or output terminals.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0173">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>c</i></figref>, a second voltage loop <b>880</b> may comprise a voltage across a PV generator (e.g., <b>800</b><i>b</i>), voltages across two MCPs (e.g., CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b>), a voltage across a connection point between two PV power devices (e.g., <b>802</b><i>a </i>and <b>802</b><i>b</i>), and a voltage between two terminals of a PV power device (e.g., the Vin-to-common voltage of PV power device <b>802</b><i>b</i>). A plurality of voltage loops similar to voltage loop <b>880</b> may exist in a PV string <b>820</b>; a similar voltage loop may be defined with regard to each PV generator in PV string <b>820</b>.

In case of an arc at one of the connection points within voltage loop <b>880</b>, high frequency voltage components may be measured at the input of a PV power device <b>802</b> (e.g., <b>802</b><i>b</i>), and in response, an alarm may be raised. In some embodiments, a voltage may be monitored across a communication device disposed at an input or output terminal of a PV power device <b>802</b>. Under normal operating conditions, a sensor may detect and/or decode voltage components at one or more frequencies that may correspond to information signal frequencies. According to some aspects, a sensor may detect and/or decode voltage components at one or more frequencies that might not corresponding to information signal frequencies, which may be indicative of an arcing condition.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0175">An advantage which may be realized in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein may be a reduced loop impedance of second voltage loop <b>880</b>. According to some aspects, voltage sensors may be disposed at, near, or between one or more terminals of PV power devices <b>802</b> and may be configured to detect high-frequency voltage components which may be substantially larger (i.e., have a higher magnitude) than high-frequency voltage components measured within a larger loop comprising a higher loop impedance. The increased magnitude of high-frequency voltage components may facilitate early detection of arcing condition, and may enable a faster response and increased safety.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0176">An additional advantage may include fast localization of the arc. For example, if an arc occurs at CP<b>1</b>, high-frequency voltage components may be detected at a first, high magnitude at PV power device <b>802</b><i>b </i>(which may be part of voltage loop <b>880</b>), and at a second, reduced magnitude by additional PV power devices (e.g., PV power devices <b>802</b><i>a</i>, <b>802</b><i>n</i>, which may be part of voltage loop <b>881</b>). Comparing magnitudes of measured high-frequency voltage components may indicate that PV power device may have measured larger high-frequency voltage components, which may indicate that an arc may have occurred at or in close proximity to PV power device <b>802</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0187" num="0177">Yet another advantage of the arrangement of string <b>820</b> may be provision of a reduced-impedance loop for one or more or all connection points. In some conventional power systems, a substantial number of connection points associated with PV power devices might not be part of reduced-impedance voltage loops, potentially increasing detection time of arcing conditions. In an arrangement according to string <b>820</b>, a portion of or all connection points (e.g., with the exception of connection point CP<b>5</b>) may be part of at least one reduced-impedance voltage loop, which may reduce the time to detect an arc at any given connection point, and may provide a method for determining a location of an arcing condition.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0178">According to some aspects, if an arc occurs at a location other than a connection point (e.g., at the power bus, the ground bus or at conductors disposed in PV string <b>820</b>, etc.), the arc may inject high-frequency voltage components which may affect voltage measurements taken at locations within first voltage loop <b>881</b> and/or within second voltage loop <b>880</b>. Depending on the location of the arc, an increased magnitude of high-frequency voltage components may be measured. For example, if an arc occurs at a conductor disposed between CP<b>1</b> and PV generator <b>800</b><i>b</i>, an increased high-frequency voltage magnitude may be measured by PV power device <b>802</b><i>b</i>. As another example, if an arc occurs at CP<b>4</b>, an increased high-frequency voltage magnitude may be measured by PV power device <b>802</b><i>a</i>. High frequency voltage magnitudes may include voltage magnitudes at a frequency substantially above a grid frequency, for example, 200 Hz, 1 kHz, 5 kHz, 20 kHz, 100 kHz or higher. As yet another example, if an arc occurs at the ground bus, at the power bus, or at CP<b>4</b>, an increased high-frequency voltage magnitude might not be measured by any PV power device.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0179">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>d</i></figref>, which illustrates a process <b>840</b> for detecting an arc according to some aspects. Process <b>840</b> may be carried out by one or more devices (e.g., controller <b>704</b>, etc.) coupled to a PV power device (e.g., controller <b>804</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a</i></figref>, coupled to PV power device <b>802</b>) and/or a controller coupled to a system power device (e.g., system power device <b>850</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>c</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0180">At step <b>841</b>, a voltage may be measured at an input to the power device comprising the controller.

The threshold may correspond to a voltage level which is above a voltage level which likely corresponds to &#x201c;normal&#x201d; or typical (e.g. non-arcing) system operation. The threshold may be, as illustrative numerical examples, 10 mV or 100 mV, or some other value. As another example, the threshold may be a voltage measured at another frequency band, or at another point in coupled circuity. For example, a group of voltage measurements may be measured at a plurality of high frequencies, with the threshold being set as the difference in voltage between the greatest two of the voltage measurements. As another example, the threshold may be a ratio of voltage differences. For example, if a voltage level at a first high frequency is twice the magnitude of a voltage level at a second high frequency (corresponding to a threshold ratio of two), or one hundred thousand times the magnitude of a voltage level at a second high frequency (corresponding to a threshold ratio of one hundred thousand), the voltage difference may be considered to be greater than the threshold. As yet another example, a threshold may be set with respect to a low frequency voltage. For example, a DC voltage may be measured, and a threshold for high-frequency voltage components may be set at, for example, 2% of the value of the DC voltage.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0182">If no such voltage components above a threshold are detected, the controller may return to step <b>841</b>, and after a period of time has elapsed (e.g., seconds or minutes), restart process <b>840</b> or may return to a previous step.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0183">If, at step <b>842</b>, high-frequency voltage components above the threshold are detected, the process <b>840</b> may proceed to step <b>843</b> and determine whether the voltage components are located at frequency bands which may be used for communication.

For example, the control device may operate the power device to reduce the voltage across and/or the current flowing to the power device input. At step <b>1017</b>, the control device may wait a predetermined time period (e.g., to allow the electrical parameter to settle at the reduced level and/or for an arc to extinguish).

At step <b>1023</b>, the control device may compare the difference to a second threshold. If the difference is above the second threshold, the control device may determine that an arc may have been present in the electrical system prior to the reduction of the electrical parameter and may therefore set an alarm condition at step <b>1025</b> (e.g., similar to or the same as the alarm condition of step <b>845</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>d</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0217" num="0207">If the difference is not above the second threshold, the control device may determine that there was no arcing (e.g., the noise may have been due to interference from another source, rather than an electrical arc).

After extinguishing the arc, some safety regulations may require manual inspection of the electrical system before returning to normal operation. Accordingly, even though the arc was extinguished, the control device may set the alarm condition at step <b>1025</b>. Some safety regulations may allow a system to resume normal operation automatically after an arc is extinguished. Therefore, the control device can also be configured to cause the power device to resume normal operation at step <b>1027</b> without setting an alarm condition after an arc is extinguished. Additionally, some parameters used in implementation of process <b>1010</b> (e.g., the first threshold, or parameters used to measure the noise for the first measurement) might be calibrated in a manner that may generate potential false alarms at step <b>1015</b>, with steps <b>1019</b>-<b>1023</b> providing an added verification layer to a determination that an arc is present.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0210">The two-stage method illustrated by process <b>1010</b> may provide an accurate and robust manner of detecting arcs while reducing a risk of false alarms.
