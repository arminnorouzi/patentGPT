id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119(a) the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0086658, filed on Jul. 1, 2021, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a parked vehicle charging method and system, and more particularly to a parked vehicle charging method and system configured such that charging equipment, including a mobile charging robot, charges a vehicle that is parked in a state of being interlocked with parking space information of the vehicle while controlling charging intensity, an amount of money charged to a user of the vehicle is calculated, charging concession of a previous charger, among parked vehicles, is induced, a charging service combined with parking is provided, whereby it is possible to improve user convenience, and limited charging equipment and charging capacity are redistributed, whereby it is possible to improve charging service quality.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Types of vehicles can include gasoline/diesel vehicles configured to store and generate energy using fossil fuel, fuel cell vehicles configured to store and generate energy using hydrogen, and electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles configured to generate driving force using a battery configured to store electricity. A charging mode of the electric vehicle is mainly classified into fast charging and slow charging. It is also possible to switch between charging methods. Typically, a place for charging the electric vehicle that provides the above charging mode is a road-side electric charging station similar to a gas station for a gasoline or diesel engine vehicle, an electric charging station installed at homes or offices that are capable of supply electricity, or a mobile electric charging robot configured to move to a place at which the electric vehicle is parked in order to charge the electric vehicle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unlike a gas station for fossil fuel vehicles having no energy generation time except for fuel supply time, an electric charging apparatus has limitations in the maximum charging speed at which a battery for electric vehicles is charged with electricity and a charging amount that can be simultaneously charged. In the case where it is necessary to rapidly charge a plurality of vehicles at the same time, therefore, a problem in that a queue of fast charging consumers must be solved comes to the fore. In order to avoid dissatisfaction and provide fast charging for consumers, there is a necessity for reorganizing a charging service, e.g., collecting information about fast charging demand and substituting for fast charging of a previous vehicle that is being charged based thereon.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The matters disclosed in this section are merely for enhancement of understanding of the general background of the disclosure and should not be taken as an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that the matters form the related art already known to a person skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a parked vehicle charging method and system configured such that charging equipment, including a mobile charging robot, charges a vehicle that is parked in a state of being interlocked with parking space information of the vehicle while controlling charging intensity, an amount of money charged to a user of the vehicle is calculated, charging concession of a previous charger, among parked vehicles, is induced, a charging service combined with parking is provided, whereby it is possible to improve user convenience, and limited charging equipment and charging capacity are redistributed, whereby it is possible to improve charging service quality.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, the above and other objects can be accomplished by a vehicle charging method including inputting vehicle information for a vehicle that is parked, parking space information, charging information requested by the vehicle, and necessary time information received by the vehicle to a management server, scheduling, by the management server, charging of the vehicle based on the requested charging information and the necessary time information of the vehicle, controlling, by the management server, charging intensity of charging equipment based on the vehicle information, the parking space information, and a charging schedule, receiving, by the management server, charging result information from the charging equipment after charging of the vehicle is completed, and calculating an amount of money to be charged to a user of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the step of inputting the information to the management server, the requested charging information may include at least one of a current charging amount, a requested target charging amount, or a requested minimum charging amount of the vehicle. In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, a possible charging service time for slow charging from the current charging amount to the requested target charging amount and/or the requested minimum charging amount during parking of the vehicle may be scheduled.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the step of inputting the information to the management server, the requested charging information may include at least one of information about an emergency charging intention for charging while having priority over charging of another vehicle having different parking space information or expected emergency charging time, In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, the necessary time information of a vehicle to be urgently charged and the necessary time information of the other vehicle having different parking space information may be compared with each other to schedule charging of the other vehicle.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, charging of a vehicle having highest charging capacity may be scheduled in the case in which there is a plurality of vehicles having different parking space information, and a vehicle having longest waiting time until completion may be scheduled in the case in which the vehicles have identical charging amounts.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the step of inputting the information to the management server, the necessary time information may include at least one of expected parking time, expected charging time within the expected parking time, or expected fast charging time within the expected charging time. In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, the necessary time information of a vehicle to be scheduled and the necessary time information of another vehicle having different parking space information may be compared with each other to schedule a possible charging service time for fast charging.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the step of inputting the information to the management server, the request charging information of the vehicle may include at least one of a current charging amount of the vehicle or a requested minimum charging amount of the vehicle. In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, in the case where fast charging is impossible as a result of comparison in the necessary time information of the vehicles, information about a charging intention up to the requested minimum charging amount of the other vehicle having different parking space information may be input and a possible charging service time for fast charging may be scheduled.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the step of calculating the amount of money to be charged, a predetermined discount rate based on charging up to the requested minimum charging amount of the other vehicle having different parking area information may be applied to the amount of money to be charged based on charging result information to calculate the amount of money to be charged.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the step of inputting the information to the management server, the requested charging information of the vehicle may include at least one of a current charging amount, a requested target charging amount, or a requested minimum charging amount of the vehicle. In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, necessary time information of the vehicles may be compared. When fast charging is impossible, information about a charging release intention of a vehicle having a current charging amount equal to or greater than a first charging amount, among vehicles having different parking space information, may be input and a possible charging service time for fast charging may be scheduled.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the step of calculating the amount of money to be charged, a predetermined charging rate, differently set with respect to a plurality of sections divided by the current charging amounts of the vehicles, may be applied to the amount of money to be charged based on charging result information to calculate the amount of money to be charged.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, information about a charging release intention of another vehicle having a current charging amount equal to or greater than a first charging amount and having a highest charging amount may be input and a possible charging service time for fast charging may be scheduled.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, in the case in which there are a plurality of other vehicles having highest charging amounts, information about a charging release intention of a vehicle having a lowest amount of money to be charged to the user of the vehicle based on charging result information may be input and a possible charging service time for fast charging may be scheduled.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the control step, the charging equipment may be a mobile charging robot.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The parked vehicle charging method may further include, after the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, comparing necessary time information of a vehicle to be scheduled and necessary time information of another vehicle having different parking space information with each other to schedule charging of the other vehicle. The management server may transmit scheduling information and information about a predetermined discount rate based thereon to a user terminal of the other vehicle in the step of scheduling charging of the other vehicle.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the step of scheduling charging, information included in scheduling of charging may include at least one selected from the group consisting of: whether slow charging is possible, whether fast charging is possible, a charging fee based on slow charging or fast charging, an additional fee at the time of emergency charging, an additional fee at the time of fast charging, charging schedule information scheduled at the time of fast charging in the same time zone as another vehicle having different parking space information, charging release information based on emergency charging of the other vehicle having different parking space information, a discounted fee at the time of charging release or scheduling, or expected time taken until charging is completed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure, a parked vehicle charging system is provided and includes a management server configured to schedule charging of a vehicle that is parked based on charging information requested by the vehicle and necessary time information preliminarily secured by the vehicle, to control charging intensity of charging equipment based on vehicle information, parking space information, and a charging schedule of the vehicle, to receive charging result information from the charging equipment after charging of the vehicle is completed, and to calculate an amount of money to be charged to a user of the vehicle.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The above and other objects, features and other advantages of the present disclosure will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a parked vehicle charging method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> are views showing an input step of the parked vehicle charging method according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view showing the mechanism of a parked vehicle charging method according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a view showing the mechanism of a parked vehicle charging method according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view showing the mechanism of a parked vehicle charging method according to a third embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a view showing the construction of a parked vehicle charging system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a view showing an output step of the parked vehicle charging method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure based on rescheduling of another parked vehicle.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is understood that the term &#x201c;vehicle&#x201d; or &#x201c;vehicular&#x201d; or other similar term as used herein is inclusive of motor vehicles in general such as passenger automobiles including sports utility vehicles (SUV), buses, trucks, various commercial vehicles, watercraft including a variety of boats and ships, aircraft, and the like, and includes hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, hydrogen-powered vehicles and other alternative fuel vehicles (e.g. fuels derived from resources other than petroleum).

The parked vehicle charging method includes a step (S<b>100</b> and S<b>200</b>) of inputting vehicle information of a vehicle that is parked, parking space information, charging information requested by the vehicle, and necessary time information preliminarily secured by the vehicle to a management server. The parked vehicle charging method also includes a step (S<b>202</b>, S<b>204</b>, and S<b>300</b> to S<b>500</b>) of scheduling, by the management server, charging of the vehicle based on the requested charging information and the necessary time information of the vehicle. The parked vehicle charging method further includes a step (S<b>600</b> to S<b>608</b>) of controlling, by the management server, charging start, charging end, and charging intensity of charging equipment based on the vehicle information of a vehicle, the parking space information, and a charging schedule. The parked vehicle charging method additionally includes and a step of receiving, by the management server, charging result information from the charging equipment after charging end of the vehicle and calculating an amount of money to be charged to a user of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a first step is a step (S<b>100</b> and S<b>200</b>) of inputting or transmitting vehicle information/parking space information/requested charging information/necessary time information to a management server. Here, a vehicle that is parked may be an electric vehicle. Vehicle information of the electric vehicle may be at least one of a specific type of the electric vehicle, information about a battery configured to drive a motor mounted in the specific type of electric vehicle, or information about a second battery configured to charge the battery, a charging mode, or a charging port.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The parking space information includes at least one of a parking area, a portion of the parking area designated as a charging sector, a charging area for each parking fee, parking area information of another vehicle that is parked, or a distance between charging sectors. The charging information requested by the vehicle may include at least one of a requested target charging amount, a requested minimum charging amount, or a requested emergency charging amount based on emergency charging (preferential charging irrespective of charging order) in comparison to a charging gauge, e.g., the current charging amount, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The necessary time information preliminarily secured by the vehicle may include at least one of expected parking time of the vehicle, expected charging time within the expected parking time, expected fast/slow charging time within the expected charging time, expected time of another vehicle that conflicts with a time zone of the vehicle, or waiting time until charging is completed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the next step, the management server schedules charging of the vehicle based on the above information (S<b>202</b>, S<b>204</b>, and S<b>300</b> to S<b>500</b>). Here, scheduling is determining whether charging is possible based on at least a portion of the above information, determining whether to provide a charging service, such as a charging mode, a charging start point, a charging end point, and/or charging speed based thereon, a charging fee, and/or whether another vehicle that waits or is being charged has an intention of charging concession, determining a mode in which the charging service is provided in the case in which the charging service is capable of being provided, and/or providing a scheduled charging service to a person who wishes to charge the parked vehicle. Specifically, as part of a step of determining whether slow charging is possible, scheduling may include a step of determining whether charging to a desired level (e.g., a target or requested minimum charging amount) is possible through slow charging during parking (S<b>202</b>). As a step of determining whether fast charging is possible, scheduling may include a step of determining whether there is an available fast charging time zone through comparison with a charging schedule of another vehicle (S<b>204</b>).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the case in which there is an available fast charging time zone, a step of inputting information can include requesting information about whether the vehicle is a vehicle to be urgently charged that wishes to use fast charging prior to the time zone, e.g., an emergency vehicle (S<b>300</b>). In the case where the input information indicates that the vehicle is an emergency vehicle, charging of a previous vehicle under fast charging may be released or may be converted into slow charging.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the case in which fast charging is impossible, the method may include a step of retrieving, by the management server, whether there is a substitution vehicle having a charging gauge in which a (predicted) charging amount is the requested minimum charging amount, the requested target charging amount, or a first charging amount, which is a predetermined charging amount (e.g. 80%), or more based on a start point of expected fast charging time, among other fast-charged vehicles allocated to the time (S<b>400</b>). In the case in which there is no substitution vehicle, the method may include a step of retrieving, by the management server, whether there is a vehicle having an intention of substitution, e.g., a vehicle that satisfies a charging gauge equal to or greater than a second charging amount including the requested minimum charging amount and that gets a discount (S<b>500</b>).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A parked vehicle charging method according to another embodiment of the present disclosure may include a step of retrieving, by the management server, whether there is a vehicle that satisfies a charging gauge equal to or greater than a third charging amount, which is a necessary requested charging amount of a vehicle that inputs an intention to switch from fast charging to slow charging and that gets a discount (S<b>500</b>).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">After the step of determining whether charging based on charging scheduling is possible, embodiments of the parked vehicle charging method may include a step of determining possible slow charging (S<b>602</b>)/emergency charging (S<b>604</b>)/fast charging time (S<b>606</b> and S<b>610</b>), interruption/switching time of a charging service of another vehicle having the same time zone based thereon, whether charging of the other vehicle is released, calculating a charging fee based on pre-stored data or data about charging and fee information input to the management server, or a step (S<b>608</b>) of rejecting parking and charging accompanied thereby.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A conventional parked vehicle charging method provides only a charging service requested by a user without utilization of parking information. Particularly, in an electric charging service in which the maximum charging speed, the number of vehicles that can be simultaneously charged, and the charging amount of the vehicles are limited, the charging service is provided in order requested by users without utilization of parking information, whereby user inconvenience increases due to delay of the charging service caused by waiting time. That is, in the case in which parking information or charging information is not shared without charging concession or parking concession of the users, waiting vehicles are congested. Particularly, for a charging station in which a parking area and a charging area are divided from each other or in the case in which a mobile charging robot approaches a parked vehicle that wishes to use a charging service to charge the vehicle, conflict becomes more serious.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In contrast, embodiments of the disclosed parked vehicle charging method according to the embodiment of the present disclosure provide the ability to rapidly determine whether a charging service is usable simultaneously with parking by scheduling charging of a parked vehicle based on parking area information and vehicle information and requested charging information generated by the vehicle. Although a user may provide charging service request information through a terminal, a parked vehicle is recognized during a parking process, a parking start point and a parking end point based thereon are recognized, and a charging start point and a charging end point corresponding thereto are calculated in advance, whereby such a service is possible. In addition, information about which of charging services is usable, in which parking area the vehicle can be parked, and how different fees are may be shared only by parking. That is, information in which the parking area, the kind of charging service, and a fee are visualized together based on a charging schedule may be shared only by parking.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">This functionality may be provided by the management server through a user terminal. To this end, identification information of the user terminal (e.g., phone number, terminal ID, and ID of a parking application or a charging application) may be input and stored in advance. Alternatively, the identification information may be provided by the management server through a terminal installed at a place at which the parking service is provided or a terminal installed at a mobile charging apparatus. That is, charging service information may be processed and provided together with a parking space through vehicle information and parking area information input when the parking service is used or input through a camera.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In embodiments of the parked vehicle charging method, an option for selecting charging concession of a previous charger, among the parked vehicles, may be provided simultaneously with parking in order to induce charging concession. In this manner, limited charging equipment and charging capacity may be redistributed, and therefore it is possible to improve charging service quality. As a result, the parked vehicle charging method is optimized to provide a vehicle charging service synchronized with parking information.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view showing an input step of an embodiment of the parked vehicle charging method. In the step of inputting the information to the management server, requested charging information may include at least one of the current charging amount, requested target charging amount, or requested minimum charging amount of the vehicle. In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, a possible charging service time for slow charging from the current charging amount to the requested target charging amount or the requested minimum charging amount during parking of the vehicle may be scheduled.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the step of inputting the information to the management server, at least one of expected parking time, expected charging time within the expected parking time, expected fast charging time, minimum/maximum (target) requested charging gauge, or a discount option based on minimum charging concession or emergency charging concession may be input. In this manner, a possible charging service time may be scheduled, such as whether slow charging is possible may be scheduled. Since whether slow charging is possible is scheduled while having priority over other services that charge higher fees than slow charging, the parked vehicle charging method according to the embodiment of the present disclosure is capable of improving user satisfaction.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view showing an input step of an embodiment of the parked vehicle charging method. In the step of inputting the information to the management server, requested charging information includes at least one of information about an emergency charging intention for charging while having priority over charging of another vehicle having different parking space information or expected emergency charging time. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, information about an emergency charging intention may be output to a terminal of a consumer who cannot perform, or does not desire, slow charging after designating or inputting a parking space. Of course, emergency charging may be fast charging, and charging intensity, such as ultra-fast charging or accelerated charging faster than the fast charging, and charging completion time based thereon may be selected. Charging of a vehicle that is being charged may be released, and an amount of money to be charged including a charge rate may be calculated (not shown) and output to the terminal. Consequently, the parked vehicle charging method according to the embodiment of the present disclosure is capable of satisfying emergency charging demand of the consumer and at the same time providing an option.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view showing the mechanism of a parked vehicle charging method according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure. In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, necessary time information of a vehicle to be urgently charged and necessary time information of another vehicle having different parking space information may be compared with each other to schedule charging of the other vehicle.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Also, in the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, it is possible to schedule charging of a vehicle having highest charging capacity in the case in which there is a plurality of vehicles having different parking space information and to schedule a vehicle having the longest waiting time until completion in the case in which the vehicles have the same charging amounts. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an emergency vehicle is a vehicle that requests emergency charging from a starting point of parking time (4:00 pm). At this time, it is possible to reschedule fast charging of vehicles having time overlapping fast charging time and having different parking space information (electric vehicle <b>2</b> and electric vehicle <b>3</b>). That is, rescheduling may be performed to switch from fast charging to slow charging or to release charging. At this time, electric vehicle <b>2</b>, which is a vehicle having the highest charging capacity, may be rescheduled. As a result, rapid charging service redistribution may be achieved, and, in this redistribution process, a charged fee/charge rate of the emergency vehicle and a discounted fee/discount rate of the concession vehicle may be applied to a billing calculation step. Of course, a discount may be provided in the form of a voucher or a coupon. Consequently, the parked vehicle charging method according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure is capable of smoothly providing an emergency charging service of an emergency vehicle and at the same time to reschedule another vehicle having overlapping necessary time information, whereby it is possible to appropriately solve an emergency vehicle queue.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a view showing the mechanism of a parked vehicle charging method according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure. In the step of inputting the information to the management server, necessary time information may include at least one of expected parking time, expected charging time within the expected parking time, or expected fast charging time within the expected charging time. In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, necessary time information of a vehicle to be scheduled, and necessary time information of another vehicle having different parking space information, may be compared with each other to schedule a possible charging service time for fast charging.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, requested fast charging time (4:00 to 6:00) of electric vehicle <b>4</b>, which newly entered, and requested fast charging times (4:00 to 5:00 and 4:00 to 6:00) of electric vehicles <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> having different parking space information conflict with each other. At this time, the requested fast charging time of electric vehicle <b>3</b>, which has a higher charging rate based on 4:00, may be rescheduled. In another embodiment, it may be determined that the charging rate based on 4:00 is equal to or greater than the requested target/minimum charging amount of electric vehicle <b>3</b>, and the requested fast charging time of electric vehicle <b>3</b> may be rescheduled. In a further embodiment, in the case in which electric vehicle <b>3</b> and electric vehicle <b>2</b> have the same charging amounts, charging of electric vehicle <b>2</b>, which is a vehicle having the longest waiting time until charging is completed, may be scheduled. As a result, the parked vehicle charging method according to the second embodiment or the other embodiment of the present disclosure is capable of appropriately solving a fast charging queue.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view showing the mechanism of a parked vehicle charging method according to a third embodiment of the present disclosure. In the step of inputting the information to the management server, the requested charging information of the vehicle may include at least one of the current charging amount of the vehicle or the requested minimum charging amount of the vehicle. In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, when fast charging is impossible as the result of comparison in the necessary time information of the vehicles, information about a charging intention up to the requested minimum charging amount of another vehicle having different parking space information may be input, and a possible charging service time for fast charging may be scheduled.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, electric vehicle <b>1</b> and electric vehicle <b>2</b> can be slowly charged during parking, and thus are scheduled to be slow-charged with the exception of rapid charging time. On the other hand, it is determined that electric vehicle <b>3</b> and electric vehicle <b>4</b> cannot be slowly charged during parking, and therefore fast charging is scheduled. However, expected fast charging time of electric vehicle <b>4</b>, which newly entered, conflicts with expected fast charging time of each of electric vehicle <b>2</b> and electric vehicle <b>3</b>. Expected fast charging time of electric vehicle <b>4</b> does not conflict with expected fast charging time of electric vehicle <b>1</b> (8:00 to 9:00). In the case in which the minimum charging discount option, i.e. the required minimum charging amount in the conflicting fast charging time zone, is satisfied, rescheduling may be performed such that electric vehicles <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> that select a fast charging concession option concede fast charging. In the case in which electric vehicle <b>1</b> concedes, rescheduling may be performed such that slow charging of electric vehicle <b>1</b> performed in the expected fast charging time (4:00 to 6:00) of electric vehicle <b>4</b> is stopped or charging speed is further reduced, whereby fast charging time (8:00 to 9:00) of electric vehicle <b>1</b> is increased. In the case in which electric vehicle <b>3</b> concedes, unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, rescheduling may be performed such that electric vehicle <b>3</b> is fast-charged up to the requested minimum charging amount (e.g. 50%), fast charging of electric vehicle <b>3</b> is stopped, and fast charging is conceded to electric vehicle <b>4</b>. Of course, in the case in which options as in electric vehicle <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> are not selected, unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, scheduling to deny parking and charging of the electric vehicles may be performed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the third embodiment and the other embodiments of the present disclosure, the necessary time information including the expected fast charging time is compared, and the minimum charging discount option is further considered to schedule whether a fast charging service is possible, unlike the second embodiment of the present disclosure. Consequently, the second embodiment is capable of more appropriately solving a fast charging queue.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a view showing an output step of an embodiment of the parked vehicle charging method based on rescheduling of another parked vehicle. In the step of calculating an amount of money to be charged, a predetermined discount rate based on charging up to the requested minimum charging amount of another vehicle having different parking area information may be applied to an amount of money to be charged based on charging result information to calculate the amount of money to be charged. In other words, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the requested minimum charging amount (50%)/discount rate (30%) may be applied to calculate an amount of money to be charged in order to induce selection of a minimum charging discount option. In this case, it is also possible to more appropriately solve a fast charging queue.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In embodiments of the vehicle charging method, in the step of inputting the information to the management server, requested charging information of the vehicle may include at least one of the current charging amount, requested target charging amount, or requested minimum charging amount of the vehicle. In the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, necessary time information of the vehicles is compared. When fast charging is impossible, information about a charging release intention of a vehicle having a current charging amount equal to or greater than a first charging amount, among vehicles having different parking space information, may be input, and a possible charging service time for fast charging may be scheduled. Also, in the step of calculating the amount of money to be charged, a predetermined charging rate differently set with respect to a plurality of sections divided by the current charging amounts of the vehicles may be applied to the amount of money to be charged based on charging result information to calculate the amount of money to be charged. That is, in embodiments of the present disclosure, when fast charging is impossible, it is possible to substitute for fast charging of a vehicle in which a (predicted) charging amount is the requested minimum charging amount, the requested target charging amount, or a first charging amount, which is a predetermined charging amount (e.g. 80%), or more based on a start point of the expected fast charging time, among other fast-charged vehicles allocated to the time. Consequently, it is possible to appropriately solve a fast charging user queue.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Also, in the vehicle charging method according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, in the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, information about a charging release intention of another vehicle having a current charging amount equal to or greater than a first charging amount and having the highest charging amount may be input, and a possible charging service time for fast charging may be scheduled. Also, in the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle, in the case in which there is a plurality of other vehicles having the highest charging amounts, information about a charging release intention of a vehicle having the lowest amount of money to be charged to the user of the vehicle based on charging result information may be input, and a possible charging service time for fast charging may be scheduled. That is, priority may be provided to a plurality of fast-charged substitution vehicles, whereby it is possible to appropriately solve a fast charging user queue.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Meanwhile, in embodiments of the vehicle charging method, in the control step, the charging equipment may be a mobile charging robot. It is possible to provide a charging service combined with parking therethrough without any help of the user, and therefore a mobile charging robot that finds an optimum charging sequence and movement route based on parking space information may perform a charging service and fee charging in a state of setting charging scheduling and a billing system based on charging completion. Consequently, it is possible to further improve convenience of a charging service user who must manually charge and manually pay a parking fee and charging fee in the conventional art.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Embodiments of the vehicle charging method may further include comparing necessary time information of a vehicle to be scheduled and necessary time information of another vehicle having different parking space information with each other to schedule charging of the other vehicle after the step of scheduling charging of the vehicle. Additionally, the management server may transmit scheduling information and information about a predetermined discount rate based thereon to a user terminal of the other vehicle in the step of scheduling charging of the other vehicle. That is, information may be transmitted and received through an application or an interface installed in the user terminal, whereby the user may more smoothly receive a billing system including discount information and charge rate information or charging information not only at the time of parking but also after parking, and therefore it is possible to provide a service capable of enhancing user experience.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In embodiments of the vehicle charging method, in the step of scheduling charging, information included in scheduling of charging may include at least one selected from the group consisting of: whether slow charging is possible, whether fast charging is possible, a charging fee based on slow charging or fast charging, an additional fee at the time of emergency charging, an additional fee at the time of fast charging, charging schedule information scheduled at the time of fast charging in the same time zone as another vehicle having different parking space information, charging release information based on emergency charging of the other vehicle having different parking space information, a discounted fee at the time of charging release or scheduling, or expected time taken until charging is completed.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In embodiments of the vehicle charging method, an agent that performs the step of inputting vehicle information of a vehicle to be parked, parking space information, charging information requested by the vehicle, and necessary time information preliminarily secured by the vehicle may include a terminal.
