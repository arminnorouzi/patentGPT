This fact is undesirable from a structural point of view.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One object of the present invention is to provide a device to compensate for tolerances of the heat exchanger and ensure proper contact between the side plate and the manifold.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For this object, according to the present invention, a corner assembly arrangement for a heat exchanger is provided, comprising</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">a manifold comprising a tubular metal vessel, and</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">a side plate consisting of a flat metal plate that extends orthogonally to the manifold and is attached to an end thereof,</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">wherein the side plate comprises an end tab having a width that is less than the width of the remaining part of the side plate, wherein the end tab extends in a zigzag pattern from a respective end of the side plate and comprises a support end that is in contact with a wall of the manifold, the support end having, according to a plan view, a concavity configured to fit the wall of the manifold, wherein the end tab comprises a descending part extending from the side plate and an ascending part that is connected to the descending part by a bend and provides the support end.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With the arrangement according to the present invention, the end tab acts as an adapter for the tolerance of the pack in press-fit. Moreover, the contour on the circumference of the manifold, cooperating with the support end of the end tab, prevents the side plate from moving during the production process. Advantageously, the arrangement according to the present invention is also an improvement for bursting pressures.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferred embodiments of the present invention are also described.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other features and advantages of the arrangement according to the present invention will become clearer from the following detailed description of an embodiment of the invention, made with reference to the accompanying drawings, provided purely for illustrative and non-limiting purposes, in which:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front elevation view of a corner portion of a heat exchanger according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged scale view of another corner portion of the heat exchanger in</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> are a perspective view and a plan view of a manifold/side plate assembly, respectively; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref> are a perspective view, a plan view, and a cross-sectional view (taken along the line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) of a side plate, respectively.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a heat exchanger for automotive applications is depicted, denoted collectively as <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The heat exchanger <b>1</b> comprises a plurality of parallel tubes <b>11</b> extending between two opposite sides of the heat exchanger (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, respectively), and a first manifold and second manifold <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> respectively arranged at each of the two opposite sides of the heat exchanger. The tubes <b>11</b> are fluidly connected to the manifolds <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> for transporting a refrigerant fluid to allow the refrigerant fluid to exchange thermal energy with a gaseous fluid, specifically air, which passes between the tubes <b>11</b> in a direction substantially perpendicular to the plane defined by the bundle of tubes <b>11</b>.
