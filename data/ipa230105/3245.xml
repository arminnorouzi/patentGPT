An example threaded screw fastener includes a sheet-metal fastener. Sheet-metal fasteners are typically used to fasten one metal object (e.g., sheet metal) with another metal object, although sheet-metal fasteners can be also be used to attach metal object with a wooden, plastic, or any other kind of surface. Sheet-metal fastener are usually represented by a series of 3 unique numbers, which specify the diameter, length, and thread count of the sheet-metal fastener. By way of illustrated, a fastener listed as #10-16&#xd7;1&#x2033; specifies that the sheet-metal fastener's diameter is of 10 and is 1 inch long and that it consists of 16 threads; though other diameters and thread counts are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some examples, a sheet-metal fastener configured to join two components (e.g., sheet-metal) comprises a head defining an undercut region and a shank extending from the undercut region. The head comprises a serrated region at an outer perimeter of the head, while the shank comprises threads. The serrated region may comprise a plurality of knurls. The head may further comprise a flange portion, the serrated region being formed on an underside of the flange portion. In some examples, the sheet-metal fastener is a self-tapping fastener. For example, the shank may include a notched tip. In some examples, the shank includes threads of different dimensions positioned along a length of the shank. In some examples, the head comprises one or engagement features to enable an operator to drive the sheet-metal fastener. The head may be a hex washer head. In some examples, each of the plurality of knurls comprises a curvature (C) that is about 0.025 Rad. In some examples, the plurality of knurls are formed via a cold-forming process. In some examples, each of the plurality of knurls defines a back wall that is angled with an underside surface of the flange portion at an angle that is greater than 90 degrees (e.g., about 100 degrees). In some examples, each of the plurality of knurls defines a back wall that is angled with an underside surface of the flange portion at an angle that is 90 degrees. In some examples, when driven about the axis of rotation, each of the plurality of knurls are configured to pull material from a first one of the components beyond an opening formed in a second one of the component and into the undercut region.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>is a front perspective view of an example sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> in accordance with an aspect of this disclosure, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>b </i>through <b>1</b><i>e </i></figref>illustrate, respectively, side, top, bottom, and rear perspective views of the example sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b>. As illustrated, the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> generally comprises a head <b>102</b> and a shank <b>104</b>, wherein the shank <b>104</b> includes threads <b>106</b> and a tip <b>120</b> (e.g., a sharp point or tip). While the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> is illustrated with a tip <b>120</b> that is pointed, the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> may be configured with a thread-cutting or self-tapping fastener that features a notched tip, which can cut into a metallic surface without pre-drilling.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> may be fabricated using a cold forging technique, though other techniques are contemplated. In some examples, the head <b>102</b> is progressively formed by forcing a piece of metal into various dies at high pressure, after which the threads <b>106</b> are formed on the shank <b>104</b> by a rolling or cutting process. The sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> may be fabricated from one or more materials, including, for example, steel (including stainless steel and steel alloy), brass, bronze, etc. The threads <b>106</b> may be distributed evenly along the entire length of the shank <b>104</b>, or a just a portion thereof. In some examples, the shank <b>104</b> may include threads <b>106</b> of different dimensions along the length (e.g., a different thread count per inch).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A sharp point or tip aids in cutting into the metal surface. In operation, the shank <b>104</b> is rotated about its axis of rotation <b>116</b> in rotational direction <b>118</b> via a rotational force imparted at the head <b>102</b>. The head <b>102</b> may be a flat head, oval head, truss head, pan head, hex head, or hex washer head (as illustrated). In some examples, the head <b>102</b> may be shaped to include one or engagement features to enable an operator to drive the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> using a power tool (e.g., an electric drill or driver) or manual tool (e.g., a screw driver, socket set, etc.).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As illustrated, the head <b>102</b> itself may be shaped to define the engagement feature. For example, the outer perimeter of the head <b>102</b> may be a hexagonal shape with a circular flange portion <b>114</b> as illustrated, though other head shapes are contemplated, such as round, oval, square, etc. Additionally or alternatively, the head <b>102</b> may include one or more recesses <b>122</b> that are configured to receive a driver or driving bit. The one or more recesses <b>122</b> may be Phillips-style (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>), flat slots, square, star, or the like.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference to Detail A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>, the knurls <b>110</b> may have a curvature (C) that is 0.025 Rad, whereas the first distance (D<sub>1</sub>) may be 0.04 inches and the second distance (D<sub>2</sub>) may be 0.05 inches. One of skill in the art would appreciate that these dimensions are approximated and can deviate based on natural flow of cold formed material in knurling process. Further, the dimensions of the knurls <b>110</b> are based on 12 TPI knurling criteria; however, the dimensions will change based on the count of knurls <b>110</b> (e.g., a <b>24</b> TPI would half most dimensions). With reference to Detail B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>d</i></figref>, the first and second edges (E<sub>1</sub>) and (E<sub>2</sub>) will follow a break edge of the knurl tool of 0.005 inches in that radial corner from the curvature (C) dimension of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The head <b>102</b> may further comprise an undercut region <b>112</b> on the underside of the head <b>102</b>. The undercut region <b>112</b> may be positioned on the surface of the head <b>102</b> that is opposite the one or more recesses <b>122</b>. As illustrated, the shank <b>104</b> extends perpendicularly away from the undercut region <b>112</b>. The undercut region <b>112</b> enables the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> to maximize engagement between the threads <b>106</b> and the material to be fastened. The head <b>102</b> includes a serrated region <b>108</b>, which is composed of a plurality of knurls <b>110</b>. The sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> is manufactured with the serrated region <b>108</b> along the exterior perimeter of the flange portion <b>114</b>. In one example, the serrated region <b>108</b> may be formed on the flange portion <b>114</b>; however, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>e</i></figref>, the flange portion <b>114</b> may be omitted whereby the serrated region <b>108</b> is formed elsewhere on the head <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates two pieces of sheet metal (e.g., a first sheet <b>202</b> and a second sheet <b>204</b>) joined via the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> to form a joint <b>200</b>. As illustrated, the first sheet <b>202</b> (e.g., a top panel) defines a first opening <b>210</b> and the second sheet <b>204</b> (e.g., a lower panel) defines a second opening <b>208</b>. In some examples, the diameter of the second opening <b>208</b> is less than the diameter of the second opening <b>208</b>. In operation, the first and second openings <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> are arranged coaxially relative to one another to define a tapped hole or pass through. During assembly, the tip <b>120</b> of the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> is inserted through the tapped hole set. In some examples, the first and second openings <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> are pre-drilled into the material; however, in other examples, the first and/or second openings <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> may be formed by the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> when driven into the material. For example, in the case of a sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> with a self-tapping tip <b>120</b>. In the illustrated example, the shank <b>104</b> of the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> can be entirely threaded along its entire length. The tip <b>120</b> and the threads <b>106</b> are sharp, thereby enabling the sheet-metal fastener to easily cut or pierce through the hard metal surface or other type of surface.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference to Detail C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the lower end of the back wall <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the knurl <b>110</b> may be tapered inward (toward the axis of rotation <b>116</b>). For example, the first angle (A<sub>1</sub>) between the back wall <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the knurl <b>110</b> and vertical axis (e.g., that is parallel to the axis of rotation <b>116</b>) may be about 10 degrees (+/&#x2212;5 degrees), while the second angle (A<sub>2</sub>) between the back wall <b>110</b><i>a </i>and the underside surface <b>114</b><i>a </i>of the flange portion <b>114</b> may be the first angle (A<sub>1</sub>) plus 90 degrees. Therefore, each of the plurality of knurls <b>110</b> can defines a second angle (A<sub>2</sub>) with the underside surface of the flange portion <b>114</b> that is greater than 90 degrees, in the illustrated example, about 100 degrees.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> is driven about the axis of rotation <b>116</b> in the rotational direction <b>118</b> through the first and second openings <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, the threads <b>106</b> engage the second sheet <b>204</b> at the perimeter of the second opening <b>208</b>. Torqueing the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> causes the threads <b>106</b> to engage the perimeter of the second opening <b>208</b> and bend material upward through the first opening <b>210</b> and into the undercut region <b>112</b>, as indicated by arrow <b>206</b>. Therefore, when driven about the axis of rotation <b>116</b>, the plurality of knurls <b>110</b> are configured to pull material from one of the components (e.g., second sheet <b>204</b>) beyond the first opening <b>210</b> formed in the other one of the components (e.g., first sheet <b>202</b>) and into the undercut region <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The knurls <b>110</b> of the serrated region <b>108</b> act as a torque reducer or torque break, against the top plane <b>212</b> of the first sheet <b>202</b> (or other component). These knurls <b>110</b> create a force in the direction indicated by arrow <b>214</b>, while also acting as a reference plane <b>216</b> to which the second sheet <b>204</b> will pull past due to the knurls <b>110</b> being below the bottom of the flange portion <b>114</b> of the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b>, and the helix of the threads <b>106</b> manufactured above the plane of the knurls <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Placing the serrated region <b>108</b> at the outer perimeter of the head <b>102</b> increases the torque required to cause failure between the threads <b>106</b> and the tapped hole. Existing fasteners do not pull in material with the threads <b>106</b> beyond the reference plane <b>216</b> of the flange portion <b>114</b>. Pulling the material with the threads <b>106</b> beyond the reference plane <b>216</b> of the flange portion <b>114</b> increases the overall effectiveness of the threaded portion of the joint <b>200</b> by fully forming threads in this area. Thus, placing the serrated region <b>108</b> at the outer perimeter of the head <b>102</b> not only increases the thread <b>106</b> engagement to the mating part, but also gives a higher torque to strip window for a more effective threaded joint <b>200</b>. Another advantage of the disclosed sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> is that it is field reusable. In other words, the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> can be torqued down repeatedly without continuous degradation to the joint <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>is a front perspective view of an example sheet-metal fastener <b>300</b> in accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>b </i>through <b>3</b><i>e </i></figref>illustrate, respectively, side, top, bottom, and rear perspective views of the example sheet-metal fastener <b>300</b>. The sheet-metal fastener <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>through <b>3</b><i>e </i></figref>is substantially the same as the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i>through <b>1</b><i>e</i></figref>, except the sheet-metal fastener <b>300</b> omits the circular flange portion <b>114</b> and employs knurls <b>110</b> having a different profile. For example, the knurls <b>110</b> of the sheet-metal fastener <b>300</b> have a rear wall <b>124</b> that is generally vertical (i.e., parallel to the axis of rotation <b>116</b>), whereas the knurls <b>110</b> of the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> have a rear wall <b>124</b> that is angled relative to the axis of rotation <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">An advantage of the sheet-metal fastener <b>300</b> over the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> is the sheet-metal fastener <b>300</b> requires less material and is easier to manufacture; however, the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> provides a more attractive visual appearance when the joist is completed. Therefore, a user may choose between the sheet-metal fastener <b>100</b> and the sheet-metal fastener <b>300</b> based on the location of the joint <b>200</b> and application type.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">While the present method and/or system has been described with reference to certain implementations, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the scope of the present method and/or system.
