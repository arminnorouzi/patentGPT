id="p-0004" num="0003">An integrated circuit (IC) is a network of electronic components connected by metal lines and vias in a monolithic structure formed by depositing and patterning layers of insulating and conducting materials over a semiconductor wafer. The wafer is processed through a sequence of patterning levels where, at each level, a matrix of identical copies of a pattern is printed on the wafer using photolithography, whereby many ICs are fabricated in one wafer. However, only the fully functional units may be sold as the IC product. Defects caused by particles, voids, cracks etc., reduce the yield of saleable units. Some defects in patterning are traced to edge effects during spin coating resist on top of the wafer. One example is contamination due to resist from the top side encroaching onto the backside of the wafer. The encroachment occurs when the rapidly spinning wafer forces liquid to flow radially beyond the edge and down the sides of the wafer. The technique of spinning a wafer during processing, or spin processing, is used in multiple process modules. In lithography, spin processing is used for centrifugal coating and drying (spin coat and spin-dry) of liquid films, such as resists, organic bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC), and planarizing layers such as spin-on glass (SOG) and spin-on carbon (SOC). Advances in spin processing are desired for enhancing the yield of IC fabrication and reducing the unit cost of ICs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Equipment for coating a wafer, where the equipment includes a wafer holder configured to spin the wafer while holding the wafer, a rotary drive configured to spin the wafer holder;

Spin processing has been applied to various semiconductor processes, including spin rinse, spray etch, tilted ion implantation, spin-dry, and spin coating. In addition, the wafer is rotated during some thermal and plasma processes to even out angular non-uniformities in reactant density and temperature profiles across the wafer. This disclosure describes embodiments of equipment and methods for coating a wafer with a liquid film using spin coating, where the equipment includes an air knife that blows an air curtain toward the wafer. Generally, in the spin coating process, the liquid film is formed on a surface to be coated by pouring a controlled amount of liquid onto a central region of the surface and spreading the liquid approximately uniformly across the wafer by spinning the wafer at a high rotational speed about its central axis perpendicular to the wafer surface. Centrifugal forces that result from the spinning push the liquid to flow radially outward across the substantially planar surface. As the liquid flow reaches the edge, some of the excess liquid may be ejected off the edge while some may flow down the sides and encroach onto a backside of the wafer. If not removed, undesired liquid residue along the sides and the backside could be a source of particles and chemical contamination during subsequent processing.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the embodiments described in this disclosure, an air knife is positioned in close proximity of the edge to blow an air curtain toward the backside and create a radially outward gas-flow along the backside and away from the wafer. The gas-flow is designed to block the encroaching liquid from flowing down the sides and confines the liquid film to the top side of the wafer. An example embodiment of equipment for coating a liquid film on a surface to be coated of a semiconductor wafer is described with respect to a cross-sectional view, illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>. A magnified view of the region within a dashed rectangle, A, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. The air knife and associated gas-flow are described with reference to the magnified cross-sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, and another magnified cross-sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>. The view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates some example values of dimensions related to the gas-flow and a grazing angle of incidence, &#x3b8;, at which the air curtain is incident on the backside. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> illustrates a planar view of another example embodiment, where the air knife is shaped like a ring positioned below an edge region of the wafer.

An example method for coating the wafer is described with reference to the flow diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a lithography system comprising a track system that incorporates various aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An example embodiment of equipment for coating a wafer, referred to here as spin-coater <b>100</b>, is illustrated in a cross-sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The spin-coater <b>100</b> may be housed in a box (not shown) and is coupled to a liquid supply system <b>150</b> outside. The liquid supply system <b>150</b> is configured to provide various process solutions to the spin-coater <b>100</b> through liquid supply lines, such as a first liquid supply line <b>151</b> and a second liquid supply line <b>152</b>, of the liquid supply system <b>150</b>. Although not shown, the liquid flow in each liquid supply line may be controlled using a supply valve and a suck back valve. The supply valve may be operated to pass or stop liquid selectively from a supply tank of the liquid supply system <b>150</b> to the spin-coater <b>100</b>. The suck back valve is operated when liquid has to be retracted in order to prevent unwanted dripping inside the spin-coater <b>100</b>. The retraction may be achieved, for example, by inflating a suction chamber of the suck back valve. The valves may be operated by a controller (not shown) that governs the operation of both the liquid supply system <b>150</b> and the spin-coater <b>100</b> with command signals to synchronously execute the coating process.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The spin-coater <b>100</b> has a rotatable wafer holder <b>110</b> holding a wafer <b>120</b>. In the example embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the wafer holder <b>110</b> is a spin chuck holding the backside <b>124</b> of the wafer <b>120</b>. In some other embodiment, a different wafer holder design, for example, clamps contacting a circumference of the wafer <b>120</b> may be used. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the wafer holder <b>110</b> and the wafer <b>120</b> have been aligned to place the wafer <b>120</b> concentrically on the wafer holder <b>110</b>. The concentric placement ensures that spinning the wafer holder <b>110</b> spins the wafer <b>120</b> about its center along with the wafer holder <b>110</b>. A rotary drive <b>130</b> such as an electric motor may be configured to rotate the wafer holder <b>110</b> about its central axis. The rotary drive <b>130</b>, in this embodiment, is coupled to the wafer holder <b>110</b> by a drive shaft <b>132</b> disposed along the central axis of the wafer holder <b>110</b> and the wafer <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a diameter of the wafer holder <b>110</b> is less than a diameter of the wafer <b>120</b>, thereby exposing both sides of the edge region of the wafer <b>120</b>, in addition to exposing the entire top side (the side opposite the backside <b>124</b>). The top side is the surface to be coated <b>122</b>. A movable nozzle arm <b>144</b> comprising a nozzle holder <b>146</b> holding a nozzle <b>140</b> is seen disposed above the wafer <b>120</b>. Here, nozzle, such as nozzle <b>140</b>, refers to any number of individual pouring nozzles held in one nozzle holder. In this example, the nozzle <b>140</b> comprises two pouring nozzles, a first nozzle <b>141</b> and a second nozzle <b>142</b>, each shaped like a tube with a tapered tip and a base attached to the nozzle holder <b>146</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the nozzle holder <b>146</b> has been positioned at a pouring location above a central region of the surface to be coated <b>122</b> by sliding the nozzle arm <b>144</b> along a rail <b>148</b>. The first nozzle <b>141</b> is coupled to the first liquid supply line <b>151</b> supplying the first liquid, and the second nozzle <b>142</b> is coupled to the second liquid supply line <b>152</b> supplying the second liquid, as illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The second liquid may be different from the first liquid.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The spin coating process in the example embodiment is for forming a liquid coating that is a composite of the first liquid and the second liquid. The composite coating is formed by first coating the surface to be coated <b>122</b> with the first liquid. After forming the first liquid coating, the second liquid is poured through the second nozzle <b>142</b> on the first liquid coating and spread over the surface to be coated <b>122</b> to form a second liquid coating, which is the final composite coating. Generally, each liquid is supplied through a dedicated supply line to a dedicated individual pouring nozzle. Accordingly, in an embodiment where the nozzle holder is not configured to hold several individual nozzles, a nozzle changing operation may have to be performed prior to pouring the second liquid. By using nozzle holder <b>146</b> holding the first nozzle <b>141</b> and the second nozzle <b>142</b>, the nozzle changing operation may be eliminated from the spin coating process for this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is common practice to pour a process solution, such as the first liquid and the second liquid, while the wafer (e.g., wafer <b>120</b>) is spun at a relatively low speed. However, in some embodiments, the wafer may be static when the liquid is poured onto the surface. The spin speed is then ramped up to rotate the wafer at a high speed to spread the liquid rapidly (e.g., in about 3 seconds to about 10 seconds) over the surface to be coated (e.g., the surface to be coated <b>122</b>). In the embodiments described in this disclosure, the rotational speeds selected for spreading the first liquid and the second liquid are between about 500 rpm to 2000 rpm, as explained in further detail below. When not in use, the nozzle <b>140</b> may be moved by the nozzle arm <b>144</b> to a home position in a nozzle bath containing a solvent to prevent the nozzle tips from being clogged by residue from dried liquid.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, below the wafer <b>120</b>, an air knife <b>160</b> is shown blowing an air curtain at the backside <b>124</b> at a grazing angle of incidence to create a gas-flow radially outward along the backside <b>124</b> toward an annular duct <b>170</b> disposed circumferentially around the wafer <b>120</b>. The construction of the example air knife <b>160</b> is understood from the cross-sectional and perspective views illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The air knife <b>160</b> has been positioned proximate the backside <b>124</b> and adjusted for the air curtain to be blown through a slot <b>162</b> at a desired grazing angle of incidence toward the backside <b>124</b>. The position of the slot <b>162</b> and the grazing angle of incidence, &#x3b8;, of the air curtain are described in further detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>. The air curtain is generated by blowing gas through a gas inlet <b>164</b> into a plenum <b>166</b> of the air knife <b>160</b>. Prior to pouring the first liquid onto the surface to be coated <b>122</b>, the air curtain is started and the nozzle holder <b>146</b> is positioned at the pouring location. The air curtain may be started by operating a gas blower (e.g., a centrifugal blower or a screw type blower) to supply gas to the gas inlet <b>164</b>. After the nozzle holder <b>146</b> has been positioned at the pouring location, a supply valve in the liquid supply line <b>151</b> may be actuated to release a controlled amount of the first liquid that flows through the first nozzle <b>141</b> and pours onto the surface to be coated <b>122</b> (indicated by a vertical arrow), where it is seen as a first liquid layer <b>153</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">After pouring the liquid, the spin speed is ramped up to about 500 rpm to 2000 rpm and, with the wafer spinning at a high rotational speed, the liquid spreads out to the edge <b>120</b><i>a </i>of the wafer <b>120</b> within a few seconds, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> in a magnified view of a region A.

The duct <b>170</b> has a top rim <b>170</b><i>a </i>and a bottom rim <b>170</b><i>b </i>above and below the wafer <b>120</b>, respectively. The top rim <b>170</b><i>a </i>and the bottom rim <b>170</b><i>b </i>have been designed to guide the gas-flow near the edge <b>120</b><i>a </i>and position the duct <b>170</b> such that most of the solid and liquid particles ejected off the wafer <b>120</b> during spinning is captured.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The gas-flow near the edge <b>120</b><i>a </i>is directed into the annular duct <b>170</b> from both sides of the wafer <b>120</b>.

A plenum chamber (or, simply plenum) is a pressurized container for gas at a positive pressure. The plenum of an air knife has a narrow side that looks like a thin knife edge, a shape formed from two blades joined to have the appearance of a &#x201c;knife-edge&#x201d;. The two blades are typically two opposite sides of the plenum. The spacing between the two blades of the knife is referred to here as the plenum width. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, the spacing is in the vertical direction, which is the Z-direction. Generally, the plenum width narrows down smoothly toward the knife edge. Along its knife-edge, each air knife has a long continuous slot (or multiple slots) having a slot-width that is about the same as the plenum width. The air curtain is achieved when pressurized gas in the plenum exits through the slot(s) along the knife-edge. Typically, a plenum pressure and slot-width may be adjusted to modify the gas speed and gas flow rate in the air curtain as it exits the air knife. The blades forming the knife edge are often shaped as smooth curves in order to avoid turbulence in the path of the gas-flow in the plenum. Depending on the shape of the curves, the plenums may be diversely shaped prisms, for example, chevron shaped, circular, tear-drop shaped, or asymmetrically shaped.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The example air knife <b>160</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, has an asymmetric shape that is suitable for creating a radially flowing air curtain along the planar backside <b>124</b> toward the wafer edge <b>120</b><i>a </i>and into the duct <b>170</b>.

The top of the plenum <b>166</b> (the side facing the backside <b>124</b> of the wafer <b>120</b>) is flat, and the bottom of the plenum <b>166</b> curves smoothly upward to form a knife edge having a continuous slot <b>162</b> along the Y-direction, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As illustrated in the perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the plenum <b>166</b> of the example air knife <b>160</b> has a longitudinal axis oriented along the Y-direction. A continuous slot <b>162</b> in the side of the plenum <b>166</b> facing the edge <b>120</b><i>a </i>runs parallel to the longitudinal axis. A gas inlet <b>164</b> is situated in the opposite side. Several horizontal arrows entering the plenum <b>166</b> indicate an incoming gas-flow from the gas blower (not shown) coupled to the gas inlet <b>164</b>. Except for a pressure gradient that pushes the gas away from the gas inlet <b>164</b> toward the slot <b>162</b>, the use of a plenum, such as plenum <b>166</b>, helps maintain a gas pressure that is roughly uniform inside the air knife <b>160</b>. The gas in the plenum <b>166</b> exits through the continuous slot <b>162</b> creating an air curtain with a high gas speed directed at the backside <b>124</b> at a grazing angle of incidence to flow substantially radially outward.

Accordingly, a suitable gas speed and flow rate for the air curtain may be determined during process development by a design of experiments using slot-width and plenum pressure as factors.

The method <b>400</b> is an example embodiment where the liquid coating is a composite of two liquids, a first liquid and a second liquid. The first liquid may be, for example, a resist solvent used to wet the surface to be coated (e.g., the surface to be coated <b>122</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and the second liquid may be the resist. Forming a first liquid coating with the resist solvent helps to form a second liquid coating that includes the resist. Having the solvent coated on the surface to be coated decreases the contact angle between the resist and the interfacial surface adjacent below the resist. The reduced contact angle helps the resist to spread more easily across the wafer.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As indicated in box <b>410</b> of the flow diagram, the method <b>400</b> comprises holding a wafer with a rotatable wafer holder, where the wafer is held such that an edge region is exposed, similar to the wafer <b>120</b> being held by the wafer holder <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As indicated in box <b>412</b> of the flow diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the method <b>400</b> includes positioning a slot of an air knife (e.g., the slot <b>162</b> of the air knife <b>160</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>). The positioning includes positioning the slot vertically below the backside (the backside being opposite the surface to be coated) and laterally at a radial location between the center and the edge, in the exposed edge region. The slot is located in close proximity to both the backside and the edge of the wafer, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>.

As explained above, the factors that may be adjusted to adjust the air curtain include the grazing angle of incidence, &#x3b8;, the slot-width, and the plenum pressure. Accordingly, before starting blowing the air curtain, the air knife and the blower are configured to adjust the air curtain to achieve the selected values of the direction, speed and flow rate of gas in the air curtain for a specific process. Adjusting the grazing angle of incidence, &#x3b8;, is indicated in box <b>414</b> of the flow diagram of the method <b>400</b>, adjusting the slot-width is indicated in box <b>416</b>, and adjusting the plenum pressure is indicated in box <b>418</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Blowing the air curtain through the slot of the air knife is indicated in box <b>420</b>. As shown in the flow diagram of the method <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the air curtain is started prior to pouring liquid on the surface to be coated. The air curtain may be started by operating a gas blower to blow gas into a plenum of the air knife through a gas inlet of the plenum. The air curtain exiting through the slot reaches the backside of the wafer at a grazing angle of incidence, &#x3b8;, thereby creating a radially outward gas-flow away from the wafer.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The steps in the method <b>400</b> for forming the liquid coating on the surface to be coated are listed in boxes <b>422</b>, <b>424</b>, and <b>426</b>. In the example method <b>400</b>, the liquid coating being formed is a composite liquid coating comprising two liquids, for example, a resist solvent and a resist, as mentioned above. Hence, forming the liquid coating comprises forming a first liquid coating and, after forming the first liquid coating, forming a second liquid coating, the second liquid coating being the composite liquid coating. In forming the liquid coating, a nozzle (e.g., nozzle <b>140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is positioned above a central region of the surface to be coated (box <b>422</b>). In this example, the nozzle comprises two individual nozzles, a first nozzle and a second nozzle. A controlled amount of first liquid (e.g., a resist solvent) is poured through the first nozzle onto the central region of the surface to be coated (box <b>424</b>). In the method <b>400</b>, spinning the wafer holder holding the wafer is initiated prior to pouring the first liquid. Thus, in this example, the wafer is spinning, typically, at a low rotational speed during the pouring. In some other embodiment, liquid may be poured on a static wafer. The first liquid that is poured onto the wafer is spread across the wafer by ramping up the spinning to a selected high rotational speed, as described above. Spreading the first liquid by spinning the wafer at the selected rotational speed is indicated in box <b>426</b>. With the wafer spinning at the high rotational speed, the first liquid coating is formed within a few seconds. It is noted that the air curtain is continuously blowing while the liquid is being poured and spread across the wafer by spinning.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The method <b>400</b> includes collecting excess liquid and solid particles dislodged by centrifugal forces and the gas blown from the air knife positioned below the wafer near its edge. The liquid and solid ejected off the wafer are collected in a duct (e.g. the duct <b>170</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) positioned circumferentially around the edge of the wafer. The collecting of ejected material off the wafer edge may include operating a suction pump coupled to the annular duct, wherein operating the suction pump guides a gas-flow at the edge of the wafer into the duct. Collecting the ejected material into the circumferential duct is indicated in box <b>428</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this example spin-coating process, after forming the first liquid coating, the method further includes forming the second liquid coating (box <b>430</b>) using steps similar to the steps for forming the first liquid coating. Forming the second liquid coating (which is the final composite liquid coating) comprises positioning the nozzle and pouring a second liquid (e.g., resist) from the second individual nozzle onto the central region of the first liquid coating, while spinning the wafer. The spinning wafer spreads the second liquid across the wafer to form the second liquid coating on the surface to be coated. As before, excess liquid and dislodged solid particles are collected in the duct that is positioned circumferentially surrounding the wafer.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">After the liquid coating (e.g., the liquid coating comprising the resist solvent and the resist) has been formed, the method <b>400</b> may be performing a dry-spin step. Dry-spin is a centrifugal drying process where the wafer is spun at a very high rotational speed, typically higher than the rotational speed with which the wafer is spun to spread liquid to form a liquid coating. The dry-spin may be performed without blowing the air curtain. Hence, the method <b>400</b> may include terminating blowing the air curtain once forming the final liquid coating has been completed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a of a lithography system <b>600</b>.

The process modules of the track system <b>610</b>, as shown in the block diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, includes a spin-coating module <b>601</b>, a pre-exposure bake module <b>603</b>, a post-exposure bake module <b>604</b>, and a developing module <b>605</b> for developing the exposed resist. The spin-coating module <b>601</b> comprises a spin-coater with air knives, such as the spin-coater <b>100</b>, described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>. Resists and solvents are connected from a liquid supply system (e.g., the liquid supply system <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to each process module (e.g., the spin-coating module <b>60</b><i>i</i>) via pipelines, filters, valves, and pumps.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition to process modules, the track system <b>610</b> includes an imaging module <b>602</b> and an inspection and metrology module <b>606</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The inspection and metrology module <b>606</b> receives wafers after a resist layer has been exposed to a pattern of actinic radiation in the scanner <b>620</b>, and the pattern has been transferred to the resist in the developing module <b>605</b>, where the exposed resist is developed to form a patterned resist layer. The quality of the resist pattern is evaluated by inspecting and measuring various images of the resist pattern in the inspection and metrology module <b>606</b>. Thus, the inspection and metrology module <b>606</b> may include, for example, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for measuring critical dimensions in the resist pattern. Wafers may fail inspection because of patterning defects or if the measurements are not within specified limits. Failed wafers may be discarded, or, in some instances, reworked by stripping the resist and repeating the resist patterning process steps.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The optical imaging module <b>602</b> in the track system <b>610</b> may be used to identify defects prior to exposing the resist to a radiation pattern in the scanner <b>620</b>. Wafers coated with resist are received from the spin-coating module <b>601</b> and imaged in the optical imaging module <b>602</b> using an imaging system comprising light sources and cameras. The light sources are configured to illuminate the wafer, while the cameras create photographic images of the surfaces. In some embodiments, the imaging system of the optical imaging module <b>602</b> includes a plurality of cameras to image the wafer from various directions. For example, in one embodiment, separate cameras are used to image the wafer from the top, bottom, and side. The camera on the top images the side coated with resist, the bottom camera images the backside, and the camera at the side images the beveled edges of the wafer. The cameras may be coupled to a controller of the imaging system that acquires and transmits the images to an inspection device for image analysis. The inspection device may identify defects using, for example, a processor of the inspection device configured to execute instructions stored in an electronic memory of the inspection device to perform appropriate image analysis. Many metal based resist (MBR) and organic resist compositions exhibit fluorescence when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. This property may be utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the air curtain in constraining the resist coating to the top side of the wafer by illuminating the backside and the beveled edges of the wafer with UV light and inspecting the respective optical image for presence of fluorescing resist residue. Hence, in some embodiments, the optical imaging module <b>602</b> may include an UV light source to detect presence of resist encroachment or residue on the backside. The wavelength of the UV light from the UV light source may be in the range of about 300 nm to about 400 nm to avoid photochemical reactions in the resist layer. If the air curtain from the air knife had failed to suppress resist from encroaching onto the backside then the defect may be detected from an UV image of the backside. The defective wafer may be reworked or scrapped, as needed.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Example 1.
