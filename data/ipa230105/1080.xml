A pump is a type of drug administration device that can administer a liquid drug to the patient. Some pumps are wearable by a patient and can include a reservoir, such as a vial or a cartridge, that contains the liquid drug therein for delivery to the patient through a needle inserted into the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The drug can be removed from the reservoir through a conduit and delivered to the patient through the needle. However, if the conduit is not in complete communication with the liquid drug in the reservoir, air can enter the conduit with the drug or instead of the drug. Air is undesirable to deliver to the patient because of, e.g., patient discomfort. If the conduit is not in complete communication with the liquid drug in the reservoir, the patient's desired treatment is interrupted by the pump delivering only air to the patient instead of the drug, by the pump delivering air to the patient with only a partial intended dose of the drug, or by the pump not delivering any air or any drug to the patient due to a detected error of air entering the conduit from the reservoir. Interrupting the patient's treatment may adversely affect the patient's health and may cause patient frustration with the pump and thereby reduce the patient's willingness to use the pump in the future as recommended by the patient's health care provider.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The conduit may not be in complete communication with the liquid drug in the reservoir for a variety of reasons. For example, the conduit may not be in complete communication with the liquid drug in the reservoir due to the patient's orientation when the drug is being pumped out of the reservoir and into the patient via the needle. Liquid in the reservoir naturally settles at a location therein due to gravity, so depending on the patient's orientation, the liquid drug may not settle within the reservoir at a location where the conduit is in complete communication with the liquid drug. Additionally, for pumps that deliver multiple doses of the drug over time, it becomes more likely over time that the patient's orientation will adversely affect the conduit's accessibility of the drug within the reservoir. As the amount of the drug in the reservoir decreases, there is less drug present in the reservoir to be in complete communication with the conduit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For another example, the conduit may not be in complete communication with the liquid drug in the reservoir due to the pump not being positioned properly on the patient. The pump will typically come with instructions indicating how the pump should be attached to the patient, including a recommended orientation of the pump relative to the patient. The recommended orientation may help maximize the conduit's ability to be in complete communication with the drug in the reservoir for every delivery of the drug to the patient. However, the pump may not be attached to the patient at the recommended orientation due to unintentional user error.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there remains a need for pumps with improved liquid drug accessibility.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, pumps with orientation independent liquid drug accessibility are provided.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, a pump configured to deliver a drug to a patient is provided that in one embodiment includes a reservoir configured to contain a liquid drug therein, and a conduit configured to receive the drug therein from the reservoir.

One or more examples of these embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. A person skilled in the art will understand that the devices, systems, and methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the present invention is defined solely by the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one exemplary embodiment may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, in the present disclosure, like-named components of the embodiments generally have similar features, and thus within a particular embodiment each feature of each like-named component is not necessarily fully elaborated upon. Additionally, to the extent that linear or circular dimensions are used in the description of the disclosed systems, devices, and methods, such dimensions are not intended to limit the types of shapes that can be used in conjunction with such systems, devices, and methods. A person skilled in the art will recognize that an equivalent to such linear and circular dimensions can easily be determined for any geometric shape. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that a dimension may not be a precise value but nevertheless be considered to be at about that value due to any number of factors such as manufacturing tolerances and sensitivity of measurement equipment. Sizes and shapes of the systems and devices, and the components thereof, can depend at least on the size and shape of components with which the systems and devices will be used.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Various exemplary pumps with orientation independent liquid drug accessibility are provided. In general, a pump includes a reservoir configured to contain a liquid drug therein, a conduit configured to receive the drug therein from the reservoir, and a needle in fluid communication with the conduit and configured to deliver the drug therethrough to a patient wearing the pump. The conduit includes a mechanism configured to ensure that the conduit is in complete communication with the drug in the reservoir at least when the conduit is receiving the drug therein from the reservoir regardless of the pump's orientation on the patient or the patient's orientation, e.g., whether the patient is standing, sitting, lying down, bent over, etc. The mechanism is thus configured to ensure that the conduit receives therein only drug from the reservoir for delivery to the patient and that the conduit does not receive therein any air contained in the reservoir. The patient may thereby be ensured to receive only drug through the needle and not any air through the needle, and the patient's drug dose(s) can therefore be fully delivered at a desired schedule without interruption since drug, and not any air, will be provided to the needle via the conduit.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The mechanism can have a variety of configurations. In an exemplary embodiment, the mechanism includes a weight attached to the conduit. The weight can be attached to the conduit by being integrally formed with the conduit or by being a separate member fixedly attached to the conduit by being adhered thereto with adhesive, by being embedded within material forming the conduit, or by being attached to the conduit using another attachment mechanism. The weight is positioned at a free (or distal) end of the conduit that is located within the reservoir. The free end of the conduit has an opening therein into which the liquid drug enters a passageway of the conduit for delivery to the needle. The pump can be assembled with the weighted free end of the conduit located within the reservoir, or the weighted free end of the conduit can be movable after pump assembly from an initial position located outside of the reservoir to a delivery position located inside of the reservoir. In this exemplary embodiment, the conduit is formed of a flexible material that allows the conduit to flex or bend within the reservoir. The weighted conduit is therefore configured to flex or bend within the reservoir as the pump's orientation changes, with the weight facilitating the flexing or bending of the conduit by the weight being urged in a downward direction due to gravity (where &#x201c;downward&#x201d; indicates a direction toward the ground). Since liquid in the reservoir naturally settles at a location in the reservoir due to gravity, the weighted conduit is configured to maintain complete communication with the liquid drug regardless of the patient's orientation. In other words, the weighted conduit is configured to &#x201c;follow&#x201d; the liquid drug in the reservoir to the liquid drug's settled location regardless of the patient's orientation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another exemplary embodiment, the mechanism includes a fork at a free (or distal) end of the conduit that is located in the reservoir. The pump can be assembled with the forked free end of the conduit located within the reservoir, or the forked free end of the conduit can be movable after pump assembly from an initial position located outside of the reservoir to a delivery position located inside of the reservoir. The conduit includes a primary (or proximal) passageway in which the liquid drug flows from the conduit to the needle. The fork includes a plurality of prongs that each includes a secondary (or distal) passageway in fluid communication with the primary passageway. Each of the secondary passageways includes a distal opening into which the liquid drug enters before entering the primary passageway for delivery to the needle. The liquid drug in the reservoir can thus enter the primary passageway through any of the secondary passageways. The forked conduit thus helps ensure that at least one of the prongs is in complete communication with the liquid drug regardless of the patient's orientation and regardless of where the liquid drug has settled within the reservoir under the force of gravity.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another exemplary embodiment, the mechanism includes a telescoping cannula attached to the conduit. The telescoping cannula includes at least one tubular member freely slidably disposed within the conduit. The one or more tubular members are each configured to freely slide in and out of a free (or distal) end of the conduit that is located within the reservoir. In embodiments with at least two tubular members, the two or more tubular members are telescoped with each other. In other words, the tubular members are nested in the conduit in telescoping fashion. A free (or distal) end of the innermost one of the tubular members (or the sole tubular member if the mechanism includes only one tubular member) has an opening therein into which the liquid drug enters for delivery from the reservoir to the needle. The pump can be assembled with the free end of the conduit and the free end of each of the one or more tubular members located within the reservoir, or the free end of the conduit and the free end of each of the one or more tubular members can be movable after pump assembly from an initial position located outside of the reservoir to a delivery position located inside of the reservoir. In this exemplary embodiment, the conduit and each of the one or more tubular members is formed of a rigid material, which may facilitate smooth sliding of the one or more tubular members in and out of the conduit. The one or more tubular members are configured to freely slide in and out of the conduit as the pump's orientation changes, with the movement of the tubular member(s) being caused by gravity. Since liquid in the reservoir naturally settles at a location in the reservoir due to gravity, the one or more tubular members are configured to maintain complete communication with the liquid drug regardless of the patient's orientation.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The drug to be delivered using a pump as described herein can be any of a variety of drugs. Examples of drugs that can be delivered using a pump as described herein include antibodies (such as monoclonal antibodies), hormones, antitoxins, substances for the control of pain, substances for the control of thrombosis, substances for the control of infection, peptides, proteins, human insulin or a human insulin analogue or derivative, polysaccharide, DNA, RNA, enzymes, oligonucleotides, antiallergics, antihistamines, anti-inflammatories, corticosteroids, disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, erythropoietin, and vaccines.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The mechanisms described herein can be used with a variety of drug delivery pumps configured to deliver a drug to a patient.

The pump <b>20</b> also includes a conduit <b>38</b> through which the drug <b>22</b> is configured to pass from the reservoir <b>24</b> and into an inlet fluid path <b>30</b> operatively connected to an injector assembly <b>46</b> of the pump <b>20</b> that is configured to deliver the therapeutic substance <b>22</b> into a patient. The conduit <b>38</b> is thus a tube in which the drug <b>22</b> can flow. As discussed further below, the conduit <b>38</b> includes a mechanism <b>40</b> configured to ensure that the conduit <b>38</b> is in complete communication with the drug <b>22</b> in the reservoir <b>24</b> at least when the conduit <b>38</b> is receiving the drug <b>22</b> therein from the reservoir <b>24</b>, e.g., under force of an electromechanical pumping assembly <b>26</b> of the pump <b>20</b>, regardless of an orientation of the patient wearing the pump <b>20</b>, e.g., regardless of the pump's orientation on the patient or whether the patient is standing, sitting, lying down, bent over, etc. The mechanism <b>40</b> may therefore be configured to ensure that the drug <b>22</b>, but not air, enters the conduit <b>38</b> from the reservoir <b>24</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the conduit <b>38</b> in complete communication with the drug <b>22</b> in the reservoir <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The electromechanical pumping assembly <b>26</b> is operatively connected to the reservoir <b>24</b> and is configured to cause delivery of the therapeutic substance <b>22</b> to the patient via the injector assembly <b>46</b>, e.g., through a needle or cannula of the injector assembly <b>46</b> that has been inserted into the patient. The electromechanical pumping assembly <b>26</b> is shaped to define a rigid pump chamber <b>28</b> that includes a therapeutic substance inlet <b>30</b> through which the therapeutic substance <b>22</b> is received from the conduit <b>30</b>, and hence from the reservoir <b>24</b>, into the pump chamber <b>28</b>. The rigid pump chamber <b>28</b> also includes a fluid path outlet <b>32</b> through which the therapeutic substance <b>22</b> is delivered from the pump chamber <b>28</b> to the patient via the injector assembly <b>46</b>. Although the pumping assembly <b>26</b> is electromechanical in this illustrated embodiment, the pumping assembly of the pump <b>20</b> (and for other embodiments of pumps described herein) can instead be mechanical. The mechanical pumping assembly need not include any electronic components or controls. For example, the mechanical pumping assembly can include a balloon diaphragm configured to be activated to cause delivery of a drug through mechanical action.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The pump <b>20</b> also includes a plunger <b>34</b> slidably disposed within the pump chamber <b>28</b> and sealably contacting an inside of the pump chamber <b>28</b>. The plunger <b>34</b> is configured to be in direct contact with the drug <b>22</b> in the pumping chamber <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The pump <b>20</b> also includes control circuitry <b>36</b>. The electromechanical pumping assembly <b>26</b> is configured to be driven to operate in two pumping phases by the control circuitry <b>36</b>. In a first pumping phase, the control circuitry <b>36</b> is configured to drive the plunger <b>34</b> (e.g., slidably move the plunger <b>34</b> in the pump chamber <b>28</b>) to draw the drug <b>22</b> from the reservoir <b>24</b> into the conduit <b>38</b>, then into the inlet fluid path <b>30</b>, then through an inlet valve <b>42</b> and into the pump chamber <b>28</b>. The inlet valve <b>42</b> is configured to be opened and closed such that when the inlet valve <b>42</b> is open there is fluid communication between the reservoir <b>24</b> and the pump chamber <b>28</b>, and when the inlet valve <b>42</b> is closed there is no fluid communication between the reservoir <b>24</b> and the pump chamber <b>28</b>. During the first pumping phase, the control circuitry <b>36</b> is configured to cause the inlet valve <b>42</b> to open, cause an outlet valve <b>44</b> to close, and drive the plunger <b>34</b> to draw the therapeutic substance <b>22</b> from the reservoir <b>24</b> into the pump chamber <b>28</b>, e.g., the control circuitry <b>36</b> is configured to set the inlet valve <b>42</b> and the outlet valve <b>44</b> such that the therapeutic substance <b>22</b> can flow only between the reservoir <b>24</b> and the pump chamber <b>28</b>. Thus, as the plunger <b>34</b> is drawn back, therapeutic substance <b>22</b> is drawn into pump chamber <b>28</b>. The control circuitry <b>36</b> causing the inlet valve <b>42</b> to open and the outlet valve <b>44</b> to close can be active control or can be passive control in which the valves <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are mechanical valves that automatically open/close due to the driving of the plunger <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a second pumping phase, the control circuitry <b>36</b> is configured to drive the plunger <b>34</b> to deliver the drug <b>22</b> from the pump chamber <b>28</b> through the outlet valve <b>44</b> to the outlet fluid path <b>32</b> and then to the injector assembly <b>46</b> for delivery into the patient. The outlet valve <b>44</b> is configured to be opened and closed such that when the outlet valve <b>44</b> is open there is fluid communication between the pump chamber <b>28</b> and the patient, and when the outlet valve <b>44</b> is closed there is no fluid communication between the pump chamber <b>28</b> and the patient. During the second pumping phase, the control circuitry <b>36</b> is configured to cause the inlet valve <b>42</b> to close, cause the outlet valve <b>44</b> to open, and drive the plunger <b>34</b> to deliver the therapeutic substance <b>22</b> from the pump chamber <b>28</b> in a plurality of discrete motions of the plunger <b>34</b>. For example, the control circuitry <b>36</b> can be configured to set the inlet valve <b>42</b> and the outlet valve <b>44</b> such that the therapeutic substance <b>22</b> can flow only between the pump chamber <b>28</b> and the patient, and the plunger <b>34</b> is incrementally pushed back into the pump chamber <b>28</b> in a plurality of discrete motions thereby delivering the therapeutic substance <b>22</b> to the patient in a plurality of discrete dosages. Similar to that discussed above, the control circuitry <b>36</b> causing the inlet valve <b>42</b> to close and the outlet valve <b>44</b> to open can be active control or can be passive control in which the valves <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are mechanical valves that automatically open/close due to the driving of the plunger <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the control circuitry <b>36</b> is configured to drive the plunger <b>34</b> to draw the therapeutic substance <b>22</b> into the pump chamber <b>28</b> in a single motion of the plunger <b>34</b>, e.g., plunger <b>34</b> is pulled back in a single motion to draw a volume of the therapeutic substance <b>22</b> into the pump chamber <b>28</b> during the first pumping phase. Alternatively, that control circuitry <b>36</b> can be configured to drive the plunger <b>34</b> to draw the therapeutic substance <b>22</b> into the pump chamber <b>28</b> in one or more discrete expansion motions of the plunger <b>34</b>, e.g., the plunger <b>34</b> can be pulled halfway out of the pump chamber <b>28</b> in one motion and then the rest of the way out of the pump chamber <b>28</b> in a second, separate motion. In this case, a duration of some or all expansion motions of the plunger <b>34</b> during the first pumping phase are typically longer than a duration of any one of the plurality of discrete motions of the plunger <b>34</b> during the second pumping phase.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In other embodiments, the control circuitry <b>36</b> is configured to drive the plunger <b>34</b> such that a duration of the first pumping phase and a duration of the second pumping phase are unequal. For example, a duration of the second pumping phase can be in a range of five to fifty times longer than the first pumping phase, e.g., at least ten times, thirty times, fifty times, etc. longer than a duration of the first pumping phase.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The pump <b>20</b> can also include a power source (not shown) configured to provide power to the control circuitry <b>36</b> and the pumping assembly <b>26</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the power source is a single power source configured to provide power to each component of the pump <b>20</b> requiring power to operate, which may help reduce cost of the pump <b>20</b> and/or conserve space within the pump <b>20</b> for other components and/or to help reduce an overall size of the pump <b>20</b>. The power source can, however, include a plurality of power sources, which may help provide redundancy and/or help reduce cost of the pump <b>20</b> since some components, e.g., the control circuitry <b>36</b>, may be manufactured with an on-board dedicated power supply.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The mechanism <b>40</b> can have a variety of configurations. In general, the mechanism <b>40</b> is positioned at a free (or distal) end <b>48</b> of the conduit <b>38</b> that is located within the reservoir <b>24</b>. The mechanism <b>40</b> being at the free end <b>48</b> can include the mechanism <b>40</b> defining a distal-most end of the conduit <b>38</b> or the mechanism <b>40</b> being located adjacent to the distal-most end of the conduit <b>38</b>. The free end <b>48</b> of the conduit <b>38</b> has an opening therein into which the drug <b>22</b> enters a passageway of the conduit <b>38</b> from the reservoir <b>24</b>. The pump <b>20</b> can be assembled with the mechanism <b>40</b> located within the reservoir <b>24</b>, or the mechanism <b>40</b> can be movable after pump <b>20</b> assembly from an initial position located outside of the reservoir <b>24</b> to a delivery position located inside of the reservoir <b>24</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the mechanism <b>40</b> in the delivery position.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an exemplary embodiment, the mechanism <b>40</b> includes a weight, also referred to as a weighted clunk, attached to the conduit <b>38</b>. The weight can be attached to the conduit <b>38</b> by being integrally formed with the conduit <b>38</b>. For example, the conduit <b>38</b> can have a thickened sidewall at a free (or distal) end <b>48</b> thereof so as to be heavier at the free end <b>48</b> than along a remainder of the conduit <b>38</b>. Alternative to being integral with the conduit <b>38</b>, the mechanism <b>40</b> can be a separate member fixedly attached to the conduit <b>38</b>. For example, the mechanism <b>40</b> can be a metallic element (e.g., a ball, a ring, etc.) fixedly attached to the conduit <b>38</b> formed of a polymer that is lighter than the metal of the element. The metal can be, e.g., stainless steel or titanium. The mechanism <b>40</b> can be fixedly attached to the conduit <b>38</b> by being adhered thereto with adhesive, by being embedded within material forming the conduit <b>38</b>, or by being attached to the conduit <b>38</b> using another attachment mechanism. In this exemplary embodiment in which the mechanism <b>40</b> includes a weight, the conduit <b>38</b> is formed of a flexible material that allows the conduit <b>38</b> to flex or bend within the reservoir <b>24</b>. The weighted conduit <b>38</b> is therefore configured to flex or bend within the reservoir <b>24</b> as the pump's orientation changes, with the mechanism (weight) <b>40</b> facilitating the flexing or bending of the conduit <b>38</b> by the mechanism <b>40</b> being urged in a downward direction due to gravity (where &#x201c;downward&#x201d; indicates a direction toward the ground). Since the liquid drug <b>22</b> in the reservoir <b>24</b> naturally settles at a location in the reservoir <b>24</b> due to gravity, the weighted conduit <b>38</b> is configured to maintain complete communication with the liquid drug <b>22</b> regardless of the patient's orientation. In other words, the weighted conduit <b>38</b> is configured to &#x201c;follow&#x201d; the liquid drug <b>22</b> in the reservoir <b>24</b> to the liquid drug's settled location regardless of the patient's orientation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates ten possible relative positions A-J of the drug <b>22</b> and the conduit <b>38</b> in the reservoir <b>24</b>.

Position J corresponds to the position of the drug <b>22</b> and the conduit <b>38</b> in the reservoir <b>24</b> with the pump <b>20</b> attached to the patient in accordance with the pump's provided instructions and with the patient lying down, e.g., with the patient horizontal. Positions A-J are sequential positions as the patient moves from standing or sitting upright to lying down. Additional relative positions of the drug <b>22</b> and the conduit <b>38</b> in the reservoir <b>24</b> are possible between each of the illustrated ten positions A-J, and relative positions are also possible about other axes than the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, but are not shown for ease of illustration and discussion. In each of positions A-J, the conduit <b>38</b> is in complete communication with the drug <b>22</b>, as indicated by the check mark next to each of positions A-J. In each of positions B-J the mechanism <b>40</b> is causing the conduit <b>40</b> to flex or bend to some degree in the reservoir <b>24</b> and thereby &#x201c;follow&#x201d; the settling of the drug <b>22</b> in the reservoir <b>24</b> as caused by gravity g.

In general, a thickness <b>40</b><i>t </i>of the thickened sidewall is greater than a thickness <b>38</b><i>t </i>of a remainder of the conduit's sidewall in order to provide weight at the free end <b>48</b> of the conduit <b>38</b>.

In this exemplary embodiment, the conduit <b>38</b> includes a primary (or proximal) passageway in which the liquid drug <b>22</b> flows from the conduit <b>38</b> to the inlet flow path <b>30</b>. The fork <b>40</b> includes a plurality of prongs that each includes a secondary (or distal) passageway in fluid communication with the primary passageway. Each of the secondary passageways includes a distal opening into which the liquid drug <b>22</b> enters before entering the primary passageway for delivery to the inlet flow path <b>30</b>. The liquid drug <b>22</b> in the reservoir <b>24</b> can thus enter the primary passageway through any of the secondary passageways. The forked conduit <b>38</b> thus helps ensure that at least one of the prongs is in complete communication with the liquid drug <b>22</b> regardless of the patient's orientation and regardless of where the liquid drug <b>22</b> has settled within the reservoir <b>24</b> under the force of gravity.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some circumstances in which at least one of the prongs is in complete communication with the liquid drug <b>22</b> within the reservoir <b>24</b>, at least one other of the prongs may be in communication with air within the reservoir <b>24</b>, particularly when a volume of the drug <b>22</b> in the reservoir <b>24</b> becomes low. Air may therefore enter the at least one of the prongs that is in communication with air within the reservoir <b>24</b>. However, the fork <b>40</b> may increase the percentage of the drug <b>22</b> that the conduit <b>38</b> can access in the reservoir <b>24</b>, thereby reducing chances of any of the prongs being in communication with air within the reservoir <b>24</b>. In other words, the area <b>54</b> of accessibility of the conduit <b>38</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) may be increased due to the prongs' accessibility to the drug <b>22</b> within the reservoir <b>24</b> and/or the fork <b>40</b> may allow the conduit to access about 100% of the drug <b>22</b> contained in the reservoir <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Each of the prongs of the forked conduit <b>38</b> can include a weight similar to that discussed above.
