The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment has a high lithium ion conductivity. Here, a high lithium ion conductivity is, for example, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>S/cm or more. That is, the solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment can have an ion conductivity of, for example, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>S/cm or more.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment can be used for obtaining a battery having excellent charge and discharge characteristics. An example of the battery is an all solid battery. The all solid battery may be a primary battery or may be a secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment desirably does not contain sulfur. A solid electrolyte material not containing sulfur does not generate hydrogen sulfide, even if it is exposed to the atmosphere, and is therefore excellent in safety. The sulfide solid electrolyte disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2011-129312 may generate hydrogen sulfide when exposed to the atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment contains F and can therefore have a high resistance to oxidation. This is because F has a high redox potential. At the same time, since F has a high electronegativity, the bond with Li is relatively strong. As a result, generally, the lithium ion conductivity of the solid electrolyte material containing Li and F is low. For example, LiBF<sub>4 </sub>disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-277170 has a low ion conductivity of 6.67&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>S/cm. Incidentally, LiBF<sub>4 </sub>is the solid electrolyte material used in Comparative Example 1 described later. In contrast, the solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment further includes Ti and Zr, in addition to Li and F, and thereby can have a high ion conductivity of, for example, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>S/cm or more.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to enhance the ion conductivity of the solid electrolyte material, the solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment may include an anion other than F. Examples of the anion are Cl, Br, I, O, S, and Se.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment may consist essentially of Li, Ti, Zr, and F. Here, the phrase &#x201c;the solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment consists essentially of Li, Ti, Zr, and F&#x201d; means that the molar proportion (i.e., molar fraction) of the sum of the amounts of Li, Ti, Zr, and F to the sum of the amounts of all elements constituting the solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment is 90% or more. As an example, the molar proportion may be 95% or more. The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment may consist of Li, Ti, Zr, and F only.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment may contain elements that are unavoidably mixed. Examples of the elements are hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. These elements can be present in the raw material powders of the solid electrolyte material or in the atmosphere for manufacturing or storing the solid electrolyte material.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to further enhance the ion conductivity of the solid electrolyte material, in the solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment, the ratio of the amount of Li to the sum of the amounts of Ti and Zr may be 2.0 or more and 6.0 or less.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment may be represented by a composition formula (1): Li<sub>6-4b</sub>(Ti<sub>1-x</sub>Zr<sub>x</sub>)<sub>b</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, where mathematical expressions: 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;1 and 0&#x3c;b&#x2264;1.5 are satisfied. The solid electrolyte material having such a composition has a high ion conductivity.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to enhance the ion conductivity of the solid electrolyte material, in the formula (1), a mathematical expression: 0.1&#x2264;x&#x2264;0.8 may be satisfied.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The upper limit and lower limit of the range of x in the formula (1) can be defined by an arbitrary combination selected from the numerical values of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.67, and 0.8.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In order to enhance the ion conductivity of the solid electrolyte material, in the formula (1), a mathematical expression: 0.6&#x2264;b&#x2264;1.0 may be satisfied. In order to further enhance the ion conductivity of the solid electrolyte material, a mathematical expression: 0.8&#x2264;b&#x2264;0.92 may be satisfied.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The upper limit and lower limit of the range of b in the formula (1) can be defined by an arbitrary combination selected from the numerical values of 0.6, 0.8, 0.85, 0.86, 0.92, and 1.0.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment may be crystalline or amorphous.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The shape of the solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment is not limited. Examples of the shape are needle, spherical, and oval spherical shapes. The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment may be a particle. The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment may be formed so as to give a pellet or planar shape.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, when the solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment has a particulate (e.g., spherical) shape, the solid electrolyte material may have a median diameter of 0.1 &#x3bc;m or more and 100 &#x3bc;m or less. The median diameter means the particle diameter at which the accumulated volume is equal to 50% in a volume-based particle size distribution. The volume-based particle size distribution is measured with, for example, a laser diffraction measurement apparatus or an image analyzer</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment may have a median diameter of 0.5 &#x3bc;m or more and 10 &#x3bc;m or less. Consequently, the solid electrolyte material has a higher conductivity. Furthermore, when the solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment is mixed with another material such as an active material, a good dispersion state of the solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment and the additional material is obtained.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Method for Manufacturing Solid Electrolyte Material</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment can be manufactured by, for example, the following method.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Raw material powders are prepared and mixed so as to give a target composition. The raw material powders may be, for example, halides.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As an example, when the target composition is Li<sub>2.8</sub>Ti<sub>0.4</sub>Zr<sub>0.4</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, LiF, TiF<sub>4</sub>, and ZrF<sub>4 </sub>are mixed at a molar ratio of about 2.8:0.4:0.4. The raw material powders may be mixed at a molar ratio adjusted in advance so as to offset a composition change that may occur in the synthesis process.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The raw material powders are mechanochemically reacted (i.e., by a mechanochemical milling method) with each other in a mixing apparatus such as a planetary ball mill to obtain a reaction product. The reaction product may be heat-treated in vacuum or in an inert atmosphere. Alternatively, a mixture of the raw material powders may be heat-treated in vacuum or in an inert atmosphere to obtain a reaction product. The heat treatment is preferably performed, for example, at 100&#xb0; C. or more and 300&#xb0; C. or less for 1 hour or more. In order to suppress the composition change due to heat treatment, the raw material powders are preferably heat-treated in an airtight container such as a quartz tube.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The solid electrolyte material according to the first embodiment is obtained by these methods.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A second embodiment will now be described.
