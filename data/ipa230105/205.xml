INFORMATION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, various types of shock absorbers for absorbing shock have been known and have been applied depending on intended uses. For example, shoes each can have a shoe sole including a shock absorber in order to absorb shock caused upon landing. The shock absorber provided in the shoe sole is typically made using resin or rubber.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, there have also been developed shoes each having a shoe sole including a part having a lattice structure, a web structure or the like, thereby enhancing a shock absorbing function in terms of not only material but also structure. Shoes each including a shoe sole including a part having a lattice structure are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2018/0049514.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present disclosure is to describe a novel shock absorber structurally enhanced in shock absorbing function, and a shock absorbing structure including a plurality of the shock absorbers, each of the shock absorbers and the shock absorbing structure being able to be used in various applications, and also to provide a shoe sole including the novel shock absorbers or the shock absorbing structure, and a shoe including the shoe sole.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A shock absorber according to the present disclosure has a columnar outer shape and includes, as outer surfaces: a first end surface and a second end surface that are located opposite to each other in an axial direction in which an axial line extends; and a plurality of connection surfaces connecting a peripheral edge of the first end surface and a peripheral edge of the second end surface. The first end surface has an outer shape of an N-sided polygon (N is an integer of 3 or more) when viewed in the axial direction. The second end surface has an outer shape of an M-sided polygon (M is an integer of 4 or more and more than N) when viewed in the axial direction.

The first end surface ES<b>1</b> and the second end surface ES<b>2</b> are located opposite to each other in an axial direction in which an axial line AX<b>1</b> of the shock absorber <b>1</b>A extends. The plurality of connection surfaces CS connect a peripheral edge of the first end surface ES<b>1</b> and a peripheral edge of the second end surface ES<b>2</b> to thereby define a circumferential surface around the axial line AX<b>1</b> of the shock absorber <b>1</b>A.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The first end surface ES<b>1</b> is a flat surface having a pentagonal outer shape when viewed in the axial direction. The second end surface ES<b>2</b> is a flat surface having a hexagonal outer shape when viewed in the axial direction. In other words, N represents 5 and M represents 6 in the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The plurality of connection surfaces CS include six curved surfaces in total including: one curved surface having a substantially triangular outer shape; three curved surfaces each having a substantially quadrangular outer shape; and two curved surfaces each having a substantially pentagonal outer shape.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the circumferential surface defined by the plurality of connection surfaces CS, one vertex P is disposed at an intermediate position of the circumferential surface in the axial direction. From the vertex P, one first ridgeline L<b>1</b> extends so as to reach one vertex among five vertices provided in the first end surface ES<b>1</b>. Also, from the vertex P, two second ridgelines L<b>2</b> extend so as to reach two vertices, which are adjacent to each other in the circumferential direction, among six vertices provided in the second end surface ES<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">From the remaining four vertices excluding one vertex connected to the above-mentioned first ridgeline L<b>1</b> among the five vertices disposed in the first end surface, four third ridgelines L<b>3</b> extend so as to reach the remaining four vertices excluding two vertices connected to the above-mentioned second ridgelines L<b>2</b> among the six vertices provided in the second end surface. The one first ridgeline L<b>1</b>, the two second ridgelines L<b>2</b>, and the four third ridgelines L<b>3</b> extend without intersecting with each other.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Thus, the one first ridgeline L<b>1</b>, the two second ridgelines L<b>2</b>, and the four third ridgelines L<b>3</b> define the plurality of connection surfaces CS described above. More specifically, the connection surface CS surrounded by the two second ridgelines L<b>2</b> and one side of the second end surface ES<b>2</b> corresponds to one curved surface having a substantially triangular outer shape described above. The connection surface CS surrounded by the two third ridgelines L<b>3</b> adjacent to each other, one side of the first end surface ES<b>1</b>, and one side of the second end surface ES<b>2</b> corresponds to each of three curved surfaces each having a substantially quadrangular outer shape described above. Further, the connection surface CS surrounded by the one first ridgeline L<b>1</b>, one of the two second ridgelines L<b>2</b>, the one third ridgeline L<b>3</b> adjacent thereto, one side of the first end surface ES<b>1</b>, and one side of the second end surface ES<b>2</b> corresponds to each of two curved surfaces each having a substantially pentagonal outer shape described above.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is assumed that a shock absorber has such a three-dimensional structure that, when viewed in the axial direction, a pair of end surfaces are formed to have polygonal outer shapes having a different number of vertices, vertices are provided at intermediate positions between the pair of end surfaces, and the vertices included in the pair of end surfaces and the vertices provided at the intermediate positions are connected by a minimum number of ridgelines so as not to intersect with each other. In such a case, the pair of end surfaces each may not be configured as a flat surface as described above but can be configured as a curved surface. Also, the plurality of connection surfaces each may not be configured as a curved surface as described above but can be configured as a flat surface.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The shock absorber <b>1</b>A according to the above-described present embodiment exhibits a high shock absorbing function in the axial direction in which the axial line AX<b>1</b> extends. This results from the structural characteristics (shape-related characteristics) of the shock absorber <b>1</b>A.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In other words, application of external force in the direction in which the shock absorber <b>1</b>A is compressed in the above-mentioned axial direction causes: not only a stress field by which compressive deformation in the axial direction occurs in the shock absorber <b>1</b>A; but also a stress field by which shear deformation occurs in the shock absorber <b>1</b>A. This is because the plurality of connection surfaces CS each extend in the direction intersecting with the axial direction, and thereby, such an outer shape causes complicated stress fields. In other words, since the main axis of deformation of the shock absorber <b>1</b>A is different from the direction of load (i.e., the axial direction of the shock absorber <b>1</b>A), the shear deformation is significantly more likely to occur than the prism-shaped or cylindrical column-shaped shock absorber in which this main axis of deformation extends along the direction of load.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Therefore, as shear deformation is more likely to occur, the amount of deformation per volume is increased correspondingly, so that high deformability is achieved accordingly. Thus, the shock absorber <b>1</b>A according to the present embodiment can implement a lightweight shock absorber exhibiting a high shock absorbing function.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">While shock absorber <b>1</b>A can basically be made of any material having high elastic force, it is preferably made of resin or rubber. More specifically, examples of materials of the shock absorber <b>1</b>A made of resin can be a thermoplastic resin such as ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), or thermoplastic polyamide elastomer (TPAE). Examples of materials of the shock absorber <b>1</b>A made of rubber can be butadiene rubber.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this case, the shock absorber <b>1</b>A can be formed of a foam material of various materials described above or can be formed of a non-form material. In particular, when the shock absorber <b>1</b>A is formed of a foam material made of resin or rubber, the resultant shock absorber is lightweight and capable of readily exhibiting a high shock absorbing function.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The shock absorber <b>1</b>A can be formed of a foam material or a non-foam material having a polymer composition. In that case, examples of a polymer to be contained in the polymer composition include olefin-based polymers such as olefin-based elastomers and olefin-based resins. Examples of the olefin-based polymers include polyolefins such as polyethylene (e.g., linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), and the like), polypropylene, ethylene-propylene copolymer, propylene-1-hexene copolymer, propylene-4-methyl-1-pentene copolymer, propylene-1-butene copolymer, ethylene-1-hexene copolymer, ethylene-4-methyl-pentene copolymer, ethylene-1-butene copolymer, 1-butene-1-hexene copolymer, 1-butene-4-methyl-pentene, ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer, ethylene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, ethylene-ethyl methacrylate copolymer, ethylene-butyl methacrylate copolymer, ethylene-methyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene-butyl acrylate copolymer, propylene-methacrylic acid copolymer, propylene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, propylene-ethyl methacrylate copolymer, propylene-butyl methacrylate copolymer, propylene-methyl acrylate copolymer, propylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer, propylene-butyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), propylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, and the like.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The polymer can be an amide-based polymer such as an amide-based elastomer and an amide-based resin. Examples of the amide-based polymer include polyamide 6, polyamide 11, polyamide 12, polyamide 66, and polyamide 610.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The polymer can be an ester-based polymer such as an ester-based elastomer and an ester-based resin. Examples of the ester-based polymer include polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The polymer can be a urethane-based polymer such as a urethane-based elastomer and a urethane-based resin. Examples of the urethane-based polymer include polyester-based polyurethane and polyether-based polyurethane.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The polymer can be a styrene-based polymer such as a styrene-based elastomer and a styrene-based resin. Examples of the styrene-based elastomer include styrene-ethylene-butylene copolymer (SEB), styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer (SBS), a hydrogenated product of SBS (styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene copolymer (SEBS)), styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer (SIS), a hydrogenated product of SIS (styrene-ethylene-propylene-styrene copolymer (SEPS)), styrene-isobutylene-styrene copolymer (SIBS), styrene-butadiene-styrene-butadiene (SBSB), styrene-butadiene-styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBSBS), and the like. Examples of the styrene-based resin include polystyrene, acrylonitrile styrene resin (AS), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin (ABS).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Examples of the polymer include acrylic polymers such as polymethylmethacrylate, polyvinyl chloride-based resins, silicone-based elastomers, butadiene rubber (BR), isoprene rubber (IR), chloroprene rubber (CR), natural rubber (NR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), butyl rubber (IIR), and the like.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In this case, the shock absorber <b>1</b>A can be solid or hollow. The shock absorber <b>1</b>A formed to be solid is lower in deformability but excellent in mechanical strength and superior in durability than the shock absorber <b>1</b>A formed to be hollow.
