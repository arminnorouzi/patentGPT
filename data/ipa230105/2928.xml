However, these materials have a relatively small energy gap (i.e., 1.2 eV for Si and 1.42 eV for GaAs) and a relatively low breakdown voltage that are unfavorable for high power and high frequency application. Silicon carbide (SiC) is a material that has excellent physical and chemical properties such as wide energy gap, high thermal and electrical conductivity, high withstand voltage, and high saturation drift velocity of electrons, and is expected to be used in next-generation semiconductor devices.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">SiC crystals do not exist in nature. The physical vapor transport (PVT) process is the main process for growing large-scale SiC single crystals. In this process, a SiC seed crystal is disposed in a low temperature region of a crystal growth crucible and a SiC raw material is disposed in a high temperature region. Then, the crystal growth crucible is filled with a noble gas and heated to a temperature between 1450&#xb0; C. to 2400&#xb0; C. Thus, the SiC raw material can be sublimated and epitaxially grown on the SiC seed crystal.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the growth speed of the SiC single crystal is slow and the growth mechanism of the SiC single crystal is very complex. In addition, the PVT process needs to create a temperature gradient in the growth of the SiC single crystal and thus causes difficulty in controlling of process parameters such as heat field uniformity and gas phase composition. Once the process parameters are unstable, defects such as the micropipe defect and basal planar dislocation can easily occur in the obtained single crystal structure. In particular, the micropipe defect limits the application of the SiC single crystal.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In response to the above-referenced technical inadequacies, the present disclosure provides a silicon carbide crystal having high quality.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a silicon carbide crystal including a seed layer, a bulk layer, and a stress buffering structure formed between the seed layer and the bulk layer. The seed layer, the bulk layer, and the stress buffering structure are each formed with a dopant, and the dopant of the stress buffering structure cycles between high and low dopant concentrations.

Step S<b>102</b> is disposing a seed layer and a raw material. Step S<b>104</b> is forming a stress buffering structure with a dopant that cycles between high and low dopant concentrations on the seed layer.

In the step S<b>102</b>, the seed layer <b>100</b> and the raw material M can be disposed in a reactor <b>200</b>. For example, the seed layer <b>100</b> is disposed at a top of the reactor <b>200</b> and the raw material M is disposed at a bottom of the reactor <b>200</b>. The seed layer <b>100</b> is a SiC seed crystal. The raw material M is a solid material including elements of Si and C for crystal growth, such as a SiC powder and a mixture of pulverized Si particles and carbon powder. The reactor <b>200</b> can be a graphite crucible. The reactor <b>200</b> can be covered with a thermal insulation material and disposed in a vacuum chamber (not shown).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, in the step S<b>104</b>, a process within the reactor <b>200</b> is initiated at a pressure of about 300 Torr or greater and a temperature between about 1900&#xb0; C. and about 2100&#xb0; C. After that, the dopant is fed in gas form into the reactor <b>200</b>, and the concentration thereof is controlled to gradually increase or decrease between a dopant concentration of the seed layer <b>100</b> and a first concentration higher than or close to the dopant concentration of the seed layer <b>100</b>. In the present embodiment, the dopant of the seed layer <b>100</b> is present in a reference concentration. The dopant of the stress buffering structure <b>102</b> has a variation of dopant concentration, in which the dopant concentration alternates between high and low concentrations. That is, the dopant concentration of the stress buffering structure <b>102</b> gradually increases from the reference concentration to the first concentration in each of at least three successive predetermined time intervals, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, or gradually decreases from the first concentration to the reference concentration in each of at least three successive predetermined time intervals, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.

The stress buffering structure <b>102</b> can have at least three successive gradations in dopant concentration according to particular implementations, in which a buffer layer <b>1022</b> can be formed after the completion of each of the gradations in dopant concentration.

The minimum flow rate of the nitrogen gas can reach about 0.01 sccm (standard cubic cm per minute) and the maximum flow rate of the nitrogen gas can reach about 30,000 sccm.
