The boat dock cushion apparatus <b>10</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>, includes an outer layer <b>16</b> constructed of a material that is flexible and would not damage a boat when contacted by the boat and a cushion portion <b>18</b> to prevent damage to a boat in the event forceful contact with the structural tubing <b>12</b> were to occur. The outer layer <b>16</b> also protects the cushion portion <b>18</b> of the boat dock cushion apparatus <b>10</b> and provides vertical support of the cushion portion <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The cushion portion <b>18</b> can have an inner side <b>22</b> and an outer side <b>24</b>. The inner side <b>22</b> engages at least a portion of the circumference of the tubing <b>12</b> and can be shaped to have a mating engagement with the tubing <b>12</b>, which can have any shape known in the art such as round, square, etc. The outer side <b>24</b> of the cushion portion <b>18</b> is designed to have the outer layer <b>16</b> be wrapped thereon. In one embodiment, the cushion portion <b>18</b> and the outer layer <b>16</b> are not attached to each other so that if one of them gets damaged, the damaged part can be replaced without having to replace both parts. In certain situations, the tubing <b>12</b> has a quadrilateral cross-section (e.g. rectangular, square, etc.) and the cushion portion <b>18</b> has a channel <b>26</b> disposed therein that fits the tubing <b>12</b> with the quadrilateral cross-section. The cushion portion <b>18</b> can have any desired thickness and be constructed of any desirable material to withstand the potential forces applied to the boat dock cushion apparatus <b>10</b>. It should be understood and appreciated that the inner side <b>22</b> of the cushion apparatus <b>10</b> can be shaped to fit tubing with any cross-sectional shape, such as round.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The outer layer <b>16</b> can have a support apparatus <b>20</b> for supporting the cushion portion <b>18</b> within at least a part of the outer layer <b>16</b>. The support apparatus <b>20</b> of the outer layer <b>16</b> can also be used to cover the cushion apparatus <b>10</b> depending on whether the support apparatus <b>20</b> is disposed below or above the cushion portion <b>18</b>. If the support apparatus <b>20</b> is disposed above the cushion portion <b>18</b> then its primary function is to cover the cushion apparatus <b>10</b> and prevent the cushion apparatus <b>10</b> from migrating up and out of the outer layer <b>16</b>. When the support apparatus <b>20</b> is disposed below the cushion portion <b>18</b>, one of its primary functions is to hold the cushion apparatus <b>10</b> in place within the outer layer <b>16</b> and prevent the cushion apparatus <b>10</b> from migrating downward and out of the outer layer <b>16</b> of the boat dock cushion apparatus <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment when the cushion portion <b>18</b> surrounds three sides of a tubing <b>12</b> with a quadrilateral shaped cross-section, the support apparatus <b>20</b> includes a primary ledge portion <b>28</b> that extends roughly perpendicular to a first sidewall portion <b>30</b> of the outer layer <b>16</b> wherein the inside edge <b>32</b> of the primary ledge portion <b>28</b> can touch, or very closely touch, the tubing <b>12</b>. The support apparatus <b>20</b> can also include a secondary ledge portion <b>34</b> and a tertiary ledge portion <b>36</b> that extends roughly perpendicular to a second sidewall portion <b>38</b> and a third sidewall portion <b>40</b> of the outer layer <b>16</b>, respectively. Similar to the inside edge <b>32</b> of the primary ledge portion <b>28</b>, the inside edges <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> of the secondary and tertiary ledge portions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, respectively, can touch, or very closely touch, the tubing <b>12</b>. The primary, secondary and tertiary ledge portions <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> cooperate to provide a ledge <b>46</b> that the cushion apparatus <b>10</b> can sit on when the support apparatus <b>20</b> is disposed below the cushion portion <b>18</b>. The number of ledge portions <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> corresponds to the number of sides of the tubing <b>12</b> that the cushion portion <b>18</b> of the boat dock cushion apparatus <b>10</b> extends around.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The boat dock cushion apparatus <b>10</b> can also include a securing apparatus <b>48</b> that extends from the one of the ledge portions <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> or <b>36</b>. The securing portion <b>48</b> can extend from one of the ledge portions <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> or <b>36</b> and engage a part of one of the sidewalls to secure the support apparatus <b>20</b> in place and help prevent the cushion portion <b>18</b> from moving out from between the sidewalls <b>30</b>, <b>38</b> or <b>40</b> of the outer layer <b>16</b>. The securing apparatus <b>48</b> can have a first strap <b>50</b> that extends from one of the ledge portions <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> or <b>36</b> and engage a part the sidewall <b>30</b>, <b>38</b> or <b>40</b> that is on the opposite side of the boat dock cushion apparatus <b>10</b> from the ledge portion the first strap <b>50</b> extends from. In another embodiment, a second strap <b>52</b> extends from the ledge portion <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> or <b>36</b> the first strap <b>50</b> extends from and engages a part of the same sidewall <b>30</b>, <b>38</b> or <b>40</b> that first strap <b>50</b> engages. The first or second strap <b>50</b> or <b>52</b> can be secured to the sidewall <b>30</b>, <b>38</b> or <b>40</b> in any manner known in the art, such as via hooks and loops, snap buttons, buttons, brad rivets, etc.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the first strap <b>50</b> extends from the primary ledge portion <b>28</b> to a fourth sidewall <b>54</b> on one side of the tubing <b>12</b> and the second strap <b>52</b> extends from the primary ledge portion <b>28</b> to the fourth sidewall <b>54</b> on the opposite side of the tubing <b>12</b> from the first strap <b>50</b>. The first and second straps <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> can also extend out just far enough to cover the cushion portion <b>18</b> and then be secured directly to the cushion portion <b>18</b>. It should be understood and appreciated that the boat dock cushion apparatus <b>10</b> can include a second support apparatus <b>56</b> and a second securing portion <b>58</b> for engaging the other end of the cushion apparatus <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the outer layer <b>16</b>, the support apparatus <b>20</b> and straps <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> from the securing portion <b>48</b> can be part of a single continuous sheet of material <b>60</b> that has slits <b>62</b> cut in certain parts of the sheet of material <b>60</b> to facilitate the creation of the outer layer <b>16</b>, the support apparatus <b>20</b> and the straps <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> of the securing portion <b>48</b>. The first, second and third sidewall portions <b>30</b>, <b>38</b> or <b>40</b> are also parts of the sheet of material <b>60</b>. In a further embodiment, the fourth sidewall <b>54</b> can include an overlap <b>64</b> of a first portion <b>66</b> and a second portion <b>68</b> of the sheet of material <b>60</b>. The first and second portions <b>66</b> and <b>68</b> of the sheet of material <b>60</b> used to create the fourth sidewall <b>54</b> are secured together in any manner known in the art, such as via hooks and loops, snap buttons, buttons, an adhesive material, thread, etc. The boat dock cushion apparatus <b>10</b> can be secured to the tubing <b>12</b> via screws through the first and second portions of material that make up the fourth sidewall <b>54</b>, or in any other manner known in the art. In a further embodiment, the second support apparatus <b>56</b> and straps <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> from the second securing portion <b>58</b> can also be included in the sheet of material <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present disclosure is also directed toward a method of installing the boat dock cushion apparatus <b>10</b> on tubing <b>12</b> (or dock posts).
