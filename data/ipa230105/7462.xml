For example, a significant number of additional Reference Signals (RS), synchronization mechanisms, and coordination mechanisms may be needed under the existing network specification.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The embodiments disclosed herein relate to mechanisms for a BS to provide BS status information or network information indication to a UE (e.g., a wireless communication device) or to a peer entity (e.g., another BS or a partial BS). The disclosed mechanisms have designs that are more simplified as compared to those involving additional RS, synchronization mechanisms, and coordination mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, a communication node refers to any device capable of communicating wirelessly. Examples of the communication node include but are not limited to, a BS, a relay node, a UE (a wireless communication device, such as a mobile phone), and so on. As used herein, a Type-A communication node (a first communication node) refers to any communication node that transmits its status information via signaling. The Type-A communication node can be moving (relative to a given position on the surface of the Earth) or stationary. The Type-A communication node can be terrestrial or part of a Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN). Examples of an Type-A communication node include any type of BS such as but not limited to, satellites (e.g., those in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)), HAPS (e.g., balloons, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), other suitable airborne vehicles, and so on), terrestrial vehicles (e.g., Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs)), a maritime vehicles (e.g., Unmanned Maritime Vehicles (UMVs)), a traditional, stationary BS located on the surface of the earth, and so on. As used herein, a Type-B communication node (a second communication node) refers to any communication node that receives, from a Type-A communication node, status information of the Type-A communication node via signaling. Examples of the Type-B communication node include but are not limited to, a UE, a wireless communication device, a mobile device (e.g., a mobile phone), or a peer entity (e.g., a BS or a partial BS) of the Type-A communication node.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a wireless communication method <b>100</b><i>a </i>for wireless communication between a first communication node (e.g., a Type-A communication node) and a second communication node (e.g., Type-B communication node), in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

The method <b>100</b><i>a </i>is performed by the first communication node. At <b>110</b><i>b</i>, the first communication node transmits status information related to the first communication node to the second communication node. Optionally, the first communication node communicates, with the second communication node, data based on the status information, at <b>120</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the status information includes one or more parameters for at least one of location information of the first communication node or mobility status of the first communication node, where the status information is obtained by the second communication node at <b>110</b><i>a </i>or transmitted by the first communication node at <b>110</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the one or more parameters for the location information include one or more of (1) a location of the first communication node expressed in parameters (coordinates) of a coordinate system; (2) the location of the first communication node expressed in longitude, latitude, and height; (3) a predetermined path along which the first communication node is configured or planned to move; or (4) accuracy information.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With regard to the location of the first communication node expressed based on a coordinate system, the coordinate system can be any suitable coordinate system that can be used to indicate the location of the first communication node. In one example, the coordinate system includes a spherical coordinate system with an origin at the center of the Earth. In another example, the coordinate system includes a Cartesian coordinate system with any suitable origin (e.g., at the center of the earth). In yet another example, the coordinate system includes the Earth-Center, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) or Earth-Centered Rotational (ECR) coordinate system, which is a geographic and Cartesian coordinate system having the origin at the center of mass of the Earth. In that regard, the location information may include three parameters (coordinates), each corresponding to an axis of the coordinate system.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described the location of the first communication node can be expressed in a geographic coordinate system that defines the location of the first communication node using longitude, latitude, and height (elevation). The height is determined with reference to a given point (e.g., geoid) on Earth. In that regard, the location information may include three parameters, one for each of longitude, latitude, and height.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The second communication node can determine a location/position of the first communication node at any given time using the predetermined path along which the first communication node is configured or planned to move. In that regard, the location information may include parameters that indicate locations (expressed using suitable coordinate systems) along the predetermine path that the first communication node can be, as well as, in some cases, an expect time at which the first communication node can be at each of those locations. A number of locations defined along the predetermine path can be configured based on suitably granularity. Accordingly, the second communication node can obtain the parameters associated with the predetermined path in advance and can determine the locations of the first communication node at later times without having to request updates with regard to the current location of the first communication node every time the second communication node needs to determine the current location of the first communication node. In some examples, the first communication node may receive correction data or updates relative to the predetermined path, where such correction data indicates to the second communication node the location of the first communication node if that location deviates from the predetermined path.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Examples of the predetermined path include but are not limited to, a trajectory, a flight path, or an orbit of the first communication node, in the cases in which the first communication node is a satellite. Examples of the predefined path include but are not limited to, a trajectory or a flight path of the first communication node, in the cases in which the first communication node is a movable HAPS (e.g., balloons, UAVs, other suitable airborne vehicles, and so on).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The parameters defining the predetermined path can be parameters that define an overall system (e.g., satellite ephemeris, an example of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) and parameters that define a predetermined path dedicated to a given node (e.g., a predetermined path dedicated to a particular satellite, an example of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a satellite ephemeris <b>200</b>, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the satellite ephemeris <b>200</b> includes parameters (e.g., orbital-level parameters) that provide information relating to multiple predetermined paths (e.g., N orbits <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, <b>210</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>210</b><i>m</i>, and <b>210</b><i>n</i>) of multiple satellites <b>220</b><i>a</i>-<b>220</b><i>f </i>(e.g., multiple first communication nodes) orbiting the Earth <b>201</b>, which has a center <b>202</b> (e.g., the center of mass of the Earth <b>201</b>) and an equatorial plane <b>203</b>.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the table <b>200</b><i>b </i>includes parameters (e.g., orbital-plane parameters and satellite-level parameters) that provide information relating the dedicated orbit of the satellite. As shown, the orbital-plane parameters include a square root of semi-major axis (or semi-major axis) &#x221a;{square root over (a)}, eccentricity (e), inclination angle at reference time (or inclination) i<sub>0</sub>, longitude of ascending node of orbit plane (or RAAN) &#x3a9;<sub>0</sub>, and argument of perigee (or argument of periapsis) &#x3c9;. The satellite-level parameters include mean anomaly at reference time (or true anomaly and a reference point in time) M<sub>0 </sub>and ephemeris reference time (the epoch) t<sub>0e</sub>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The accuracy information notifies the second communication node a maximum possible margin of error for the location of the first communication node, where the errors may occurs due to gravity, wind, air resistance, time delays, and other unforeseeable interfering factors. In some embodiments, the accuracy information includes one or more of an error range, variation rate, a valid time duration, or an update periodicity.

In response to determining that the partial status information stored is for the type of the first communication node (the partial status information aligns with the first communication node that the second communication node is attempting to access), the second communication node can receive and decode the remaining portion of the status information from the first communication node (e.g., in any suitable signaling method described herein).
