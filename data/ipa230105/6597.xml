For example, an electric drive system having a motor and an inverter circuit is installed to rotationally drive a rotary wing of an electric aircraft such as eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft), a screw of a ship, or a wheel of a vehicle or a train. In such an electric drive system as well, it is desired to perform an abnormality diagnosis such as failure diagnosis of a motor, as in the conventional case. The occurrence of a failure is detected when the motor or the inverter circuit is in operation, and the location of the failure is specified.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An abnormality is detected while an electric drive system including a motor and an inverter circuit is in operation. However, there may be abnormalities that are difficult to detect when the electric drive system is in operation. For example, in case where the electric drive system includes a sensor for detecting the torque, rotation speed, etc. of the motor, it is difficult to detect the offset abnormality of the sensor while the electric drive system is in operation. The normality confirmation test of the safety mechanism (fail safe) cannot be performed unless a specific condition corresponding to the occurrence of an abnormality is satisfied. If the specific condition is intentionally satisfied during the operation of the electric drive system, the influence on the moving motion of the mobile body is very large. Such an issue is not limited to the configuration in which the electric drive system has a motor, but is common to a configuration in which the electric drive system does not have a motor or the motor is separate from the electric drive system, Therefore, a technique is desired, which is capable of performing an abnormality diagnosis of an electric drive system while suppressing the influence on the moving operation of a mobile body.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, an abnormality diagnosis system is provided to diagnose an abnormality of an electric drive system mounted on a mobile body to drive a motor for moving the mobile body.

The abnormality mode is an operation mode after the EDS <b>10</b> is diagnosed as abnormal. The abnormality diagnosis mode is an operation mode for diagnosing the operation of the EDS <b>10</b>, and is set when the user manually confirms the operation of the EDS <b>10</b> separately from the abnormality diagnosis process described later. These control modes are set according to a command from the integrated control unit <b>110</b>, or are manually set by the user. Further, some of the operation modes may be set the same time. For example, when a temperature abnormality occurs, for example, when the temperature of the EDS <b>10</b> is equal to or higher than a threshold temperature, the abnormality mode and the power save mode can be set at the same time.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the electric aircraft <b>20</b> is equipped with various components for controlling each EDS <b>10</b> or for performing an abnormality diagnosis of each EDS <b>10</b>.

The first drive mode is set such that the electric aircraft <b>20</b> is moved up and down in the vertical direction by driving the motor <b>11</b>. The second drive mode is set such that the electric aircraft <b>20</b> is propelled in the horizontal direction by driving the motor <b>11</b>. The third drive mode is set such that neither the ascending/descending nor the propulsion is realized.

The &#x201c;horizontal movement A&#x201d; includes an operation of moving horizontally and ascending, an operation of moving horizontally and maintaining an altitude, and an operation of moving horizontally and descending. For example, the &#x201c;horizontal movement A&#x201d; includes an operation of driving the levitation motor when the horizontal speed of the electric aircraft <b>20</b> is low, as buoyancy by driving the motor <b>11</b> is required to maintain the altitude.

The &#x201c;horizontal movement B&#x201d; includes an operation of moving horizontally and ascending, an operation of moving horizontally and maintaining an altitude, and an operation of moving horizontally and descending, as in the case of horizontal movement A. For example, the &#x201c;horizontal movement B&#x201d; includes an operation of moving horizontally without the need for buoyancy driven by the motor <b>11</b>, since the speed of the electric aircraft <b>20</b> is high, an operation of gliding, or an operation of moving horizontally while naturally descending without maintaining the altitude, During such an operation, the integrated control unit <b>110</b> instructs the EDS <b>10</b> corresponding to the levitation rotors <b>31</b><i>a </i>to <b>31</b><i>g </i>not to drive the motor <b>11</b>, and instructs the EDS <b>10</b> corresponding to the propulsion rotors <b>32</b><i>a </i>to <b>32</b><i>b </i>to drive the motor <b>11</b>.

When it is determined that even one of the motors <b>11</b> is in the low output state, the diagnostic process (step S<b>125</b>) may be executed with all the EDSs <b>10</b> as the diagnosis target EDS. With such a configuration, the total time required for the abnormality diagnosis can be shortened.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">(E2) In each embodiment, when there are plural EDSs <b>10</b> to be diagnosed, the diagnostic processing is executed one by one according to the order specified by the diagnostic order specification processing, but the present disclosure is not limited to this. All of the EDSs <b>10</b> may be diagnosed at the same time. In such a configuration, in the diagnostic conditions of step S<b>120</b>, the SOC conditions of the power supply <b>70</b> may be determined on the premise that the diagnostic energization is performed in all of the nine EDSs <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">(E3) In the diagnosis order specification process of each embodiment, priorities for determining the diagnosis order are set from a total of four viewpoints (i) to (iv) below, but some of them may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">(i) Scheduled restart time</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">(ii) Whether the EDS <b>10</b> corresponds to the levitation rotors <b>31</b><i>a </i>to <b>31</b><i>g </i></p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">(iii) Distance from the center of gravity CM</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">(iv) Number of diagnosis results of quasi-abnormality</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">For example, the priority of the diagnostic order may be set only by the scheduled restart time. Further, in each embodiment, the priorities given from the above four viewpoints are integrated to obtain the total value, and the diagnosis order is determined based on the total value. However, instead of the integration, each priority value is multiplied, and the diagnostic order may be determined based on the values obtained by the multiplying. Further, the diagnosis order may be set by comparing the largest value or the average value of the priority value in each viewpoint. Further, the total value (priority value) may be obtained by weighting the four viewpoints and then integrating.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Of the four viewpoints (i) to (iv), (ii) and (iii) are viewpoints, in short, &#x201c;giving a higher priority to the EDS <b>10</b> having a large influence when the corresponding EDS <b>10</b> is abnormal&#x201d;. In short, (iv) is a viewpoint of &#x201c;giving a higher priority to the EDS <b>10</b> having a high possibility of becoming abnormal based on the history of abnormality diagnosis&#x201d;. Therefore, the priority may be set not only from the above viewpoints (i) to (iv) but also from any other viewpoint if being included in the viewpoints.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Further, the priority may be set in other viewpoints, in place of some of the four viewpoints (i) to (iv), or in addition to the viewpoints. For example, in case where each EDS <b>10</b> has redundancy, if some of the redundancy is abnormal or suspected to be abnormal, a higher priority (priority value) may be given to the normal EDS <b>10</b> constituting the redundancy compared with the EDS <b>10</b> in which all the redundancy is normal.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">(E4) In the diagnostic process of each embodiment, the diagnosis based on the sensor detection value before the diagnostic energization (step S<b>410</b>), the resource check of the control unit <b>13</b> (step S<b>415</b>, S<b>420</b>), the diagnosis based on the sensor detection value during the diagnostic energization (step S<b>435</b>) and the fail-safe function diagnosis (step S<b>440</b>) may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">(E5) In each embodiment, the diagnostic condition is &#x201c;the amount of electric power stored in the power source <b>70</b> is a predetermined value or more&#x201d;, but the present disclosure is not limited to this.

That is, when the electric aircraft <b>20</b> is in a takeoff and landing state and/or when the electric aircraft <b>20</b> is turning, if a malfunction of the diagnosis occurs, there is a high possibility that the impact on the flight of the electric aircraft <b>20</b> will be significant. Therefore, a diagnostic condition may be set by excluding such a situation.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">(E6) In the diagnostic processing of each embodiment, the control unit <b>13</b> applies a current of a predetermined magnitude to the extent that the influence on the torque of the motor <b>11</b> can be suppressed as a result of energization as a diagnostic energization. However, a current having a magnitude that affects the torque of the motor <b>11</b> may be supplied to the motor <b>11</b>. In such a configuration, when the EDS <b>10</b> corresponding to the plural rotors <b>30</b> among the levitation rotors <b>31</b><i>a </i>to <b>31</b><i>g </i>is the diagnosis target EDS, a part of the rotors <b>30</b> is rotated in the normal direction, and the remaining rotors <b>30</b> are rotated in the reverse direction. In this case, the total lift can be set to zero and the influence on the movement of the electric aircraft <b>20</b> may be suppressed. Further, when the EDS <b>10</b> corresponding to the rotors <b>30</b> at symmetrical positions is the diagnosis target, the EDS <b>10</b> may rotate the motor <b>11</b> in the opposite directions to each other. Even in such a configuration, the influence on the movement of the electric aircraft <b>20</b> can be suppressed. Further, when the electric aircraft <b>20</b> is turning, the rotation direction of the motor <b>11</b> may be controlled according to the turning direction. For example, the motor <b>11</b> may be turned counterclockwise while the electric aircraft <b>20</b> is turning counterclockwise, and the motor <b>11</b> may be turned clockwise while the electric aircraft <b>20</b> is turning clockwise. Even in such a configuration, it is possible to suppress the influence on the turning operation of the electric aircraft <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">(E7) In the fourth embodiment, the velocity in the height direction and the velocity in the horizontal direction are used in order to determine whether the output is low, but the present disclosure is not limited to this. An acceleration in the height (vertical) direction and an acceleration in the horizontal direction may be used. For example, when the acceleration in the height direction becomes equal to or less than a predetermined magnitude or decreases by a predetermined magnitude, it may be determined that the motor <b>11</b> corresponding to the levitation rotors <b>31</b><i>a </i>to <b>31</b><i>g </i>is in a low output state. Further, when the acceleration in the horizontal direction becomes a predetermined magnitude or more or increases by a predetermined magnitude, it may be determined that the motor <b>11</b> corresponding to the levitation rotors <b>31</b><i>a </i>to <b>31</b><i>g </i>is in a low output state.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">(E8) In the first embodiment, the electric aircraft <b>20</b> has a fixed wing (main wing <b>25</b>), but may have a tilt type wing. The rotor <b>30</b> may be installed on the tilt type wing. In this configuration, for example, when the right wing <b>26</b> or the left wing <b>27</b> of the first embodiment is tilt type, in the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the rotors <b>31</b><i>f </i>and <b>31</b><i>g </i>function for levitation and the rotors <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>function for propulsion. When the right wing <b>26</b> and the left wing <b>27</b> rotate 90 degrees from the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the rotors <b>31</b><i>f </i>and <b>31</b><i>g </i>function for propulsion, and the rotors <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>function for levitation. In such a configuration, it can be determined whether each rotor contributes to the horizontal movement or the vertical movement based on the tilt angles of the right wing <b>26</b> and the left wing <b>27</b>, and the low output state is determined in combination with the operation mode. Specifically, when it is not in the first drive mode, that is, in the case of only the second drive mode or the third drive mode, it can be determined that the motor <b>11</b> corresponding to the rotor that contributes to the vertical movement is in a low output state. Further, when it is not in the second drive mode, that is, in the case of only the first drive mode or the third drive mode, it can be determined that the motor <b>11</b> corresponding to the rotor contributing to the horizontal movement is in a low output state. The configuration described above can be similarly applied to an aircraft having a tilt rotor.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">(E9) The motor output information is the mode of the driving force of the electric aircraft <b>20</b> in the first embodiment. The motor output information is the control mode of the EDS <b>10</b> in the second embodiment. The motor output information is the instructed output value to each EDS <b>10</b>, the motor current value, the motor rotation speed, and the rotation angle in the third embodiment. The motor output information is the flight altitude of the electric aircraft <b>20</b>, the speed of the electric aircraft <b>20</b> in the height direction, and the speed of the electric aircraft <b>20</b> in the horizontal direction in the fourth embodiment. However, this disclosure is not limited to these. For example, the detection result of the posture sensor <b>44</b> may be used as the motor output information. Specifically, when the detection result of the posture sensor <b>44</b> deviates from the target posture range, for example, deviates from the target range of the angle formed between the ground and the aircraft axis AX, it may be determined that all the motors <b>11</b> are in the low output state. When the posture of the electric aircraft <b>20</b> is out of the target range, the control mode of the EDS <b>10</b> may be changed to the abnormal mode due to some abnormality, and the output of the motor <b>11</b> may be limited. Alternatively, because the output of the motor <b>11</b> is low, the posture may not be stable and may be out of the target range.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">(E10) The configurations of the abnormality diagnosis system <b>120</b>, the EDS <b>10</b>, the flight control device <b>100</b>, and the like in each embodiment are merely examples and can be changed in various ways. For example, the abnormality diagnosis system <b>120</b> is not limited to the electric aircraft <b>20</b>, and may be mounted on an electric vehicle such as an automobile or a train, or an arbitrary mobile body such as a ship. Further, the EDS <b>10</b> may be configured not to include the motor <b>11</b>. The integrated control unit <b>110</b> may be configured by, for example, a server device installed in a control tower on the ground without being mounted on the electric aircraft <b>20</b>. In such a configuration, each EDS <b>10</b> and the abnormality diagnosis system <b>120</b> may be controlled by communication via the communication device <b>60</b>. Further, for example, in each embodiment, the first to third drive modes are prepared in advance as the mode of the driving force of the electric aircraft <b>20</b>, but the third drive mode may not be prepared in advance. For example, in case where &#x201c;nothing is set&#x201d; is allowed as the mode of the driving force of the electric aircraft <b>20</b>, in step S<b>210</b> of the low output state determination process in the first embodiment, it is determined &#x201c;whether the specified drive mode includes neither the first drive mode nor the second drive mode&#x201d;, instead of &#x201c;whether the specified mode is the third mode.&#x201d; Then, when it is determined that &#x201c;the specified mode does not include either the first drive mode or the second drive mode&#x201d;, step S<b>215</b> is executed. When it is determined that &#x201c;the specified mode includes the first drive mode or the first drive mode&#x201d;, step S<b>220</b> and subsequent steps may be executed.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">(E11) The integrated control unit <b>110</b>, the abnormality diagnostic system <b>120</b> and the methods described in the present disclosure may be realized by a dedicated computer having a processor and memory programmed to perform one or more functions embodied by a computer program.
