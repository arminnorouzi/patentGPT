In particular, in a damascene wire forming process, a wiring groove formed on a substrate is buried with metal. However, excess metal is polished and removed by a substrate polishing device (a CMP device) after damascene wire formation, whereby films having different wetting properties to water such as a metal film, a barrier film, and an insulating film are present on a substrate surface. For example, a Low-k film having a low k value is used for an insulating film embedded with copper. However, since the Low-k film is hydrophobic, a water film on a substrate is easily divided. If drying is performed in a state in which the water film is divided, a defect such as a water mark (a water smear) easily occurs. Further, on these substrate surfaces, a residue of slurry used in CMP polishing and foreign matters such as a Cu polishing sludge are present. On a substrate surface having a complicated film shape and a surface property for which cleaning is difficult, if sufficient cleaning is not performed, a leak occurs from a portion of a residue or the like and a problem in reliability could be caused by defective adhesion.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, as a drying device and a drying method effective for occurrence of a defect, there has been proposed a technique for supplying rinse liquid for cleaning from a rinse liquid nozzle to a substrate rotating in a sheet type to form a liquid film covering an entire substrate surface and supplying a gas current for drying containing IPA (isopropyl alcohol) for reducing surface tension of the rinse liquid from a drying gas nozzle to a substrate to dry the substrate. As such related art, there has been proposed a substrate drying device that can suppress occurrence of a defect even if rinse liquid evaporates in a center area of a substrate where a centrifugal force is relatively small and the rinse liquid easily remains (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2011-192967 (Patent Literature 1)).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, with micro size defect grasping involved in high performance of a defect test device (a Defect test device) involved in the progress of microdevices, a defect not grasped in the past has been grasped. A more improved technique that can cope with an obvious problem and an inherent risk has been required.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the technological innovation in a semiconductor manufacturing process, in recent years, refining of a line width of a pattern formed on a substrate has been advanced. Particles on the substrate considered nonfatal particles in the past have been considered a cause of a yield. In addition, when many layers of patterns are stacked by a <b>3</b>D wiring technique or the like, there is also a concern that variation of a surface due to insignificant particles on a substrate surface after substrate polishing is amplified. Therefore, a more improved technique has been demanded. In this way, as the technological innovation is advanced, higher quality has been requested in terms of to which degree particles remaining on the substrate after being dried can be reduced through cleaning treatment, for example, after the substrate is polished.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the substrate drying device and the substrate drying method of the related art, it is difficult to sufficiently suppress occurrence of a micro size defect (for example, a defect with a defect size of 20 nm or less) requested at a higher level according to the latest technological innovation. Further improvement has been requested.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been devised in view of the problems described above and an object of the present invention is to provide a more improved substrate drying device and a more improved substrate drying method that can suppress occurrence of a micro size defect (for example, a defect having a defect size of 20 nm or less).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A substrate drying device of the present invention includes: a substrate holding unit configured to hold a substrate; a gas generator configured to generate a drying gas including at least IPA vapor and for drying the substrate; and a drying gas nozzle configured to supply the drying gas to a surface of the substrate. A filter for filtering the drying gas is provided in the gas generator. A defect size D allowed in a defect test after the drying of the substrate is set to 20 nm or less and a ratio D/F of the defect size D and a filter size F of the filter is set to 4 or more.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With this configuration, even when the defect size D allowed in the defect test after the drying of the substrate is 20 nm or less, it is possible to suppress occurrence of a defect (a defect having the defect size D of 20 nm or less) by setting the ratio of the defect size D and the filter size F of the filter (the filter for filtering the drying gas for drying the substrate). Therefore, it is possible to provide a more improved substrate drying device that suppresses occurrence of a micro size defect on the entire substrate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A substrate drying device of the present invention is a substrate drying device including: a substrate holding unit configured to hold a substrate; a substrate rotating unit configured to rotate the substrate holding unit; a rinse liquid supply mechanism including a rinse liquid nozzle for supplying rinse liquid to a surface of the substrate; a gas generator configured to generate a drying gas including at least IPA vapor and for drying the substrate; a drying gas supply mechanism including a drying gas nozzle for supplying the drying gas to the surface of the substrate; a nozzle moving mechanism for moving, according to drying treatment for the substrate, a supply position of the drying gas from the drying gas nozzle and a supply position of the rinse liquid from the rinse liquid nozzle; and a control device configured to control operations of the substrate rotating unit, the nozzle moving mechanism, the rinse liquid supply mechanism, the gas generator, and the drying gas supply mechanism. When the surface of the substrate is concentrically divided into a center area where a rotation center of the substrate is present, an inner peripheral area present on an outer side of the center area, an outer peripheral area present on an outer side of the inner peripheral area, and a peripheral edge area located on an outermost periphery of the substrate, the control device operates to perform all of following controls of (1), (2), and (3) for the substrate drying device while rotating the substrate with the substrate rotating unit. The control device (1) controls the rinse liquid supply mechanism to supply the rinse liquid from the rinse liquid nozzle to the surface of the substrate when the rinse liquid nozzle is located in the center area where the rotation center of the substrate is present, the inner peripheral area, or the outer peripheral area and stop supplying the rinse liquid from the rinse liquid nozzle to the surface of the substrate when the rinse liquid nozzle is located in the peripheral edge area, (2) controls the gas generator to set concentration of a drying component included in the drying gas supplied from the drying gas nozzle to the surface of the substrate higher when the drying gas nozzle is located in the inner peripheral area or the outer peripheral area compared with when the drying gas nozzle is located in the center area and set the concentration of the drying component included in the drying gas supplied from the drying gas nozzle to the surface of the substrate to zero when the drying gas nozzle is located in the peripheral edge area, and (3) controls the drying gas supply mechanism to supply the drying gas from the drying gas nozzle to the surface of the substrate when the drying gas nozzle is located in the center area, the inner peripheral area, or the outer peripheral area and reduce a flow rate of the drying gas supplied from the drying gas nozzle to the surface of the substrate when the drying gas nozzle is located in the peripheral edge area.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">With this configuration, when the drying gas nozzle reaches the position of the peripheral edge area of the substrate, the supply of the rinse liquid from the rinse liquid nozzle to the surface of the substrate is stopped, the concentration of the drying component (IPA) included in the drying gas supplied from the drying gas nozzle to the surface of the substrate is set to zero, and the flow rate of the drying gas is reduced. Consequently, it is possible to suppress occurrence of a defect (a defect having the defect size D of 20 nm or less) in the peripheral edge area (an edge portion) of the substrate where defect occurrence tends to be a problem.

In this embodiment, the moving mechanism <b>40</b> also functions as a rinse liquid nozzle moving mechanism and a drying gas nozzle moving mechanism. The substrate W to be treated is typically a semiconductor substrate (a size of which is typically 200 mm or 300 mm), which is a material for semiconductor element manufacturing, and is formed in a disk shape. A circuit is formed on one surface of the substrate W (this surface is referred to as &#x201c;front surface WA&#x201d;) and a circuit is not formed on the other surface (a rear surface). Note that, as another embodiment, the semiconductor substrate used as the substrate W may be a substrate, for example, a silicon wafer on which a circuit surface is not formed.

The chuck claws <b>11</b> are respectively connected to the rotation driving shaft <b>12</b> to be able to horizontally hold the surface of the substrate W. In this embodiment, the substrate W is held by the chuck claws <b>11</b> such that the front surface WA faces upward.

The rinse water R is typically pure water. However, deionized water from which dissolved salt and dissolved organisms are removed, carbon dioxide gas dissolved water, or function water such as ozone water, hydrogen water, or electrolytic ion water may be used. The deionized water is desirably used from the viewpoint of eliminating the dissolved salt and the dissolved organisms that cause water mark occurrence. Whereas occurrence of static electricity involved in movement of the rinse water R on the substrate W due to rotation of the substrate W can attract foreign matters, the carbon dioxide gas dissolved water is desirably used from the viewpoint of raising conductivity of the rinse water R to suppress electrification. In an embodiment, in the case of a substrate including a specific metal component, the use of the carbon dioxide gas dissolved water can be a cause of defect occurrence because corrosion of the substrate is accelerated. Therefore, when such a problem is concerned, as the rinse water R, the carbon dioxide gas dissolved water may be used as first rinse water R<b>1</b> and the deionized water (DIW) may be used as rinse water R<b>2</b> used next.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The drying gas nozzle <b>30</b> is a nozzle that supplies isopropyl alcohol (hereinafter simply referred to as IPA) to a film of the rinse water R covering the front surface WA of the substrate W and supplying, to the substrate W, in a state of a gas current (a drying gas current), a drying gas G that moves away the film of the rinse water R. The drying gas G is typically a gas obtained by mixing vapor of IPA in an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon functioning as a carrier gas.

The liquid surface sensor detects a high level or a low level of the IPA liquid in the container, starts a pump (not shown) to supply the IPA liquid into the container when detecting the low level, and stops the pump to stop the supply of the IPA liquid into the container when detecting the high level. To contain the IPA vapor in the drying gas current blown out from the drying gas nozzle <b>30</b>, the inert gas is blown into the IPA liquid from the inflow pipe to cause the IPA liquid to bubble. Then, the IPA vapor is saturated by the inert gas and accumulates in the container above the IPA liquid. The IPA vapor is led out from the container by the lead-out pipe and led to the drying gas nozzle <b>30</b>.

The action of the substrate drying device <b>1</b> is one mode of a substrate drying method according to the embodiment of the present invention. However, the substrate drying method according to the embodiment of the present invention may be configured to be executed by a device other than the substrate drying device <b>1</b>. Operations of members in the following explanation are controlled by the control device <b>50</b>. In a Front End process for fabricating semiconductor wafer, a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process is performed and wet cleaning is performed by chemical or the like. The substrate W in a state in which a liquid component such as chemical at the cleaning time remains on the surface (a state before being dried) is grasped by the chuck claws <b>11</b> of the rotating mechanism <b>10</b>. Wet cleaning treatment before a drying process may be performed on the same rotating mechanism <b>10</b> as the rotating mechanism <b>10</b> used when drying treatment is to be performed. When the substrate W to be subjected to the drying treatment is held by the rotating mechanism <b>10</b>, the movable arm <b>41</b> is moved until a discharge port of the rinse water nozzle <b>20</b> reaches a position opposed to a portion slightly deviating from a rotation center Wc of the front surface WA of the substrate W. At this time, the drying gas nozzle <b>30</b> is located in a place where, while the rotation center Wc of the front surface WA is present within a collision range, which is a range in which the drying gas current collides with the front surface WA, the center of gravity of the collision range is further on an upstream side in a nozzle moving direction Dn than the rotation center Wc of the front surface WA. Note that the &#x201c;collision range&#x201d; is a range in which the drying gas current collides with the front surface WA when it is assumed that the rinse water R is absent on the front surface WA (an outer edge of an axial rectangular cross section of the drying gas current at the time when the cross section is projected onto the front surface WA). The nozzle moving direction Dn is a direction from the rotation center Wc side of the substrate W to the outer peripheral side in which the drying gas current moves when the front surface WA is dried.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the movable arm <b>41</b> moves to the position described above, a rinse water current is discharged from the rinse water nozzle <b>20</b> such that the rinse water R is supplied to the front surface WA of the substrate W. When the supply of the rinse water current to the front surface WA is started, the rotation driving shaft <b>12</b> is rotated, whereby the substrate W rotates in a horizontal plane. At this time, rotating speed of the substrate W is gradually increased. However, from the viewpoint of making it possible to cover the front surface WA with a film of the rinse water R without the rinse water R scattering even if the front surface WA is hydrophobic, it is preferable to set acceleration to 300 rpm or less per one second. On the other hand, from the viewpoint of improving throughput, the acceleration is desirably set as large as possible within a range in which the front surface WA can be covered with a film of the rinse water R.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the front surface WA is covered with the rinse water R and the rotating speed of the substrate W increases to a predetermined value, the drying gas current is supplied from the drying gas nozzle <b>30</b> to the front surface WA. Since IPA included in the drying gas current is generally bipolar, even if the front surface WA is hydrophobic, the IPA is uniformly wet without unevenness (extended wetting). Since solubility of the IPA with respect to water is infinite, IPA vapor is quickly dissolved in the water adhering to the front surface WA. If the IPA vapor is water droplets, the IPA changes to liquid droplets mixed with the water droplets. The supply of the rinse water current to the front surface WA is continues even if the supply of the drying gas current to the front surface WA is started. The drying gas current is supplied to the front surface WA, whereby, even near the rotation center Wc where a centrifugal force working on the rinse water R on the front surface WA is small, the rinse water R in a portion to which the drying gas G is supplied is removed and a dried region appears on the front surface WA. When the supply of the drying gas current to the front surface WA is started, the movable arm <b>41</b> is moved in the nozzle moving direction Dn. According to the movement of the movable arm <b>41</b>, a position where the rinse water current collides with the front surface WA and a position where the drying gas current collides with the front surface WA move in the nozzle moving direction Dn. Since the drying gas nozzle <b>30</b> before the movable arm <b>41</b> starts operation is located in a place where the center of gravity of the collision range of the drying gas current is further on the upstream side in the nozzle moving direction Dn than the rotation center Wc of the front surface WA, the center of gravity of the collision range passes the rotation center Wc according to the movement of the movable arm <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The movable arm <b>41</b> moves from the rotation center Wc to the outer periphery of the substrate W while the rinse water current and the drying gas current are supplied to the front surface WA, whereby the boundary between the rinse water R and the drying gas G concentrically gradually expands and the dried region on the front surface WA is gradually enlarged. At this time, in the boundary between the rinse water R and the drying gas G, the drying gas G is blown against the rinse water R, whereby the IPA in the drying gas G is dissolved in the rinse water R and a decrease in surface tension of the rinse water R occurs. Since the concentration of the IPA dissolved in the rinse water R is lower further away from a contact position of the drying gas current, a gradient lower on the upstream side and higher on the downstream side in the nozzle moving direction Dn occurs in the surface tension of the rinse water R. According to the gradient of the surface tension, a Marangoni force with which the rinse water R is attracted to a direction in which the surface tension is large from a direction in which the surface tension is small acts. In addition, according to the rotation of the substrate W, a centrifugal force with which the rinse water R is attracted to the outer periphery side of the substrate W from the rotation center Wc side is applied. The rinse water R is appropriately removed from the front surface WA by an interaction of these forces. That is, the rinse liquid is moved to the outer periphery side by the centrifugal force and the Marangoni force to gradually expand the drying region on the substrate from the center to the outer periphery and finally dry the entire substrate surface. With the sheet-type IPA drying explained above, it is possible to suppress occurrence of a defect such as a water mark on the surface of the substrate and effectively perform drying treatment even for the hydrophobic front surface WA. Note that it goes without saying that the sheet-type IPA drying can be applied to a front surface of a hydrophilic substrate as well.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the movable arm <b>41</b> reaches the outer periphery of the substrate W, the supply of the rinse water current to the front surface WA is stopped and a supply amount of the drying gas current is reduced. At this time, the supply of the rinse water current to the front surface WA is stopped first and, subsequently, the supply amount of the drying gas current is reduced. Thereafter, the rotating speed of the substrate W is increased (in this embodiment, increased to approximately 800 to 2000 rpm) and the liquid droplets remaining at the outer peripheral end portion (the edge portion) and the rear surface of the substrate W are removed by the centrifugal force. Then, the drying process ends and, after the rotation of the substrate W is stopped, the substrate W is carried out from the rotating mechanism <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view showing a distinguished range of the front surface WA of the substrate W.

However, not only this, but the control unit <b>700</b> may be disposed on the outside of the housing <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Subsequently, a substrate cleaning method in this embodiment is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a time chart showing supply and stop of the rinse water R, a change in IPA concentration in a drying gas current, a change in a flow rate (a gas amount) of the drying gas current, and a change in rotating speed of the substrate W. Note that signs W<b>1</b> to W<b>4</b> described on the horizontal axis indicate regions of the front surface WA distinguished for convenience. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, to facilitate understanding, W<b>1</b> to W<b>4</b> are equally divided. However, this does not mean that time periods required for drying the areas are equal.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">First, control of the supply and stop of the rinse water R is explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in this embodiment, the rinse water R is supplied to the front surface WA of the substrate W when the center area W<b>1</b>, the inner peripheral area W<b>2</b>, and the outer peripheral area W<b>3</b> are dried. The supply of the rinse water R to the front surface WA of the substrate W is stopped when the peripheral edge area W<b>4</b> is dried.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Subsequently, control of the IPA concentration in the drying gas current is explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in this embodiment, when the center area W<b>1</b> is dried, the IPA concentration in the drying gas current is maintained as low concentration (for example, lower than 2 mol %). When the inner peripheral area W<b>2</b> and the outer peripheral area W<b>3</b> are dried, the IPA concentration in the drying gas current is maintained at high concentration (for example, 2 mol % to 20 mol %). When the peripheral edge area W<b>4</b> is dried, the IPA concentration in the drying gas current is set to zero (0 mol %).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Subsequently, control of the flow rate (the gas amount) of the drying gas current is explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in this embodiment, when the center area W<b>1</b>, the inner peripheral area W<b>2</b>, and the outer peripheral area W<b>3</b> are dried, the flow rate (the gas amount) of the drying gas current is maintained at a large flow rate (for example, 0.5 litter/minute to 20 litters/minute). When the peripheral edge area W<b>4</b> is dried, the flow rate (the gas amount) of the drying gas current is maintained at a small flow rate (for example, a flow rate of 0.25 litter/minute to 10 litters/minute, which is half of the large flow rate). The flow rate (the gas amount) of the drying gas current means a total gas amount of the IPA gas and the nitrogen gas N2. Therefore, for example, if the IPA concentration increases (if a gas amount of the IPA gas increases) when the inner peripheral area W<b>2</b> is dried, the flow rate (a total gas amount) of the drying gas current is maintained constant by reducing a gas amount of the nitrogen gas N2 by the increase in the IPA concentration.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Lastly, control of the rotating speed of the substrate W is explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in this embodiment, when the center area W<b>1</b>, the inner peripheral area W<b>2</b>, and the outer peripheral area W<b>3</b> are dried, the rotating speed of the substrate W is maintained at predetermined low rotating speed (for example, 100 rpm to 500 rpm). When the peripheral edge area W<b>4</b> is dried, the rotating speed of the substrate W is increased to predetermined high rotating speed (for example, 800 rpm to 2000 rpm) at rotation acceleration equal to or higher than predetermined high rotation acceleration (500 rpm/second or higher, for example, 1000 rpm/second). The high rotating speed can be called target rotating speed.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">With the substrate drying device <b>1</b> in this embodiment explained above, even when the defect size D allowed in a defect test after drying of the substrate W is 20 nm or less, it is possible to suppress occurrence of a defect (a defect with the defect size D of than 20 nm or less) by setting a pore distribution and a pore diameter of the filter <b>67</b> such that a ratio of the defect size D and the filter size F of the filter <b>67</b> (the filter <b>67</b> for filtering the drying gas for drying the substrate) is 4 or more as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the recipe in this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when the drying gas nozzle <b>30</b> reaches the position of the peripheral edge area W<b>4</b> of the substrate W, the supply of the rinse water R from the rinse water nozzle <b>20</b> to the front surface WA of the substrate W is stopped, the concentration of the IPA included in the drying gas supplied from the drying gas nozzle <b>30</b> to the front surface WA of the substrate W is set to zero, and the flow rate (the gas amount) of the drying gas is reduced. Consequently, it is possible to suppress occurrence of a defect (a defect with the defect size D of 20 nm or less), in particular, in the peripheral edge area W<b>4</b> (the edge portion) of the substrate W where defect cocurrent tends to be a problem. Therefore, it is possible to realize a more improved substrate drying treatment method for suppressing occurrence of a micro size defect in the entire substrate.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the recipe in this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when the supply of the rinse water R is stopped, by increasing the rotating speed of the substrate to predetermined target rotating speed (for example, 800 rpm to 2000 rpm) at rotation acceleration equal to or higher than predetermined rotation acceleration (500 rpm/second or higher, for example, 1000 rpm/second), it is possible to suppress occurrence of a defect (a defect with the defect size D of 20 nm or less) in the peripheral edge area W<b>4</b> (the edge portion) of the substrate W.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The embodiment of the present invention is explained above by the illustration. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the embodiment and can be changed or modified according to a purpose within the scope described in the claims.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, in an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when the inner peripheral area W<b>2</b> and the outer peripheral area W<b>3</b> are dried, the IPA concentration in the drying gas current is maintained at high concentration (for example, 2 mol % to 20 mol %). However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when the inner peripheral area W<b>2</b> and the outer peripheral area W<b>3</b> are dried, a recipe for gradually increasing the IPA concentration in the drying gas current may be used. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when the center area W<b>1</b>, the inner peripheral area W<b>2</b>, and the outer peripheral area W<b>3</b> are dried, the flow rate (the gas amount) of the drying gas current is maintained at a large flow rate (for example, 0.5 litter/minute to 20 litters/minute). However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when the center area W<b>1</b>, the inner peripheral area W<b>2</b>, and the outer peripheral area W<b>3</b> are dried, a recipe for gradually increasing the flow rate (the gas amount) of the drying gas current may be used.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when the peripheral edge area W<b>4</b> is dried, the flow rate (the gas amount) of the drying gas current is reduced to a small flow rate (for example, a flow rate of 0.25 litter/minute to 10 litters/minute, which is half of the large flow rate). However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, when the drying gas nozzle <b>30</b> is located in the peripheral edge area W<b>4</b>, the flow rate of the drying gas supplied from the drying gas nozzle <b>30</b> to the front surface WA of the substrate W does not have be changed. In this case, since the IPA concentration is reduced (the gas amount of the IPA gas is reduced), the flow rate (a total gas amount) of the drying gas current is maintained constant by increasing the gas amount of the nitrogen gas N2 by the decrease in the IPA concentration. In this way as well, it is possible to suppress occurrence of a defect (a defect with the defect size D of 20 nm or less) in the peripheral edge area W<b>4</b> (the edge portion) of the substrate W.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, when the inner peripheral area W<b>2</b> and the outer peripheral area W<b>3</b> are dried, the IPA concentration in the drying gas current is maintained at high concentration (for example, 2 mol % to 20 mol %).
