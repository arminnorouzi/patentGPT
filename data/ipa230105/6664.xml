The charge generated from a photodiode during exposure time is applied via the line to a charge sensitive amplifier to transfer the charge to a conversion stage, for example a charge-to-voltage conversion stage. The transfer of the charge has to be done in a defined transfer time (readout time) before the next pixel/photosensitive cell is connected via the line to an input node of the charge sensitive amplifier for transferring the charge generated in the photosensitive cell to the charge conversion stage.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A line sensor input stage including the charge sensitive amplifier requires high settling accuracy during short transfer times, which demands for a wide average bandwidth of the input stage and the charge sensitive amplifier. On the other hand, the noise of the input stage is optimized by a low bandwidth at the end of an integration phase in which the read-out charge is integrated. Moreover, charge sensitive amplifiers for sensor frontends require a high dynamic range. This requirement is also in contrast to the requirement that the noise of the input stage is optimized with a bandwidth of the charge sensitive amplifier that is as low as possible.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The charge sensitive amplifier might comprise a single transistor switch to transfer the input charge generated from a photodiode/photosensitive cell to the charge conversion stage. The single transistor switch might be controlled in such a way that the bandwidth is large at the beginning of the integration and is reduced at the end of the charge transfer. This can be done by using a high ohmic and a low ohmic phase for the switch during the charge transfer. It can also be done dynamically. Depending on the charge at the input, the transfer time is longer or shorter in the low ohmic phase, and the transistor switch gets more and more high ohmic during the charge removal.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In line sensors, each input stage is connected to a line of pixels where some pixels might be defect and others are not defect. If large charges are not removed by the charge sensitive amplifier of the input stage, the charges will appear on the following pixels as an image artifact. Input charge can vary over several decades, as not only the charge of the signal has to be removed by the charge sensitive amplifier of the input stage, but also excessive charges from defect pixels have to be removed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Due to the high dynamic range of the input charge applied at an input node of a charge sensitive amplifier of an input stage, a single transistor switch included in the charge sensitive amplifier to transfer the charge generated from a photodiode to the charge conversion stage is not the optimum solution as too much bandwidth is required to remove all the charge during the transfer phase and still fulfill the low noise requirements at the end of the charge transfer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is a desire to provide a charge sensitive amplifier circuit for a sensor frontend which allows the noise of the sensor frontend to be optimized without limiting the charge input range.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A charge sensitive amplifier circuit for a sensor frontend having a high dynamic input charge range for a defined conversion time without compromising the noise of the input stage is specified in claim <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an embodiment of a charge sensitive amplifier circuit for sensor frontend, the charge sensitive amplifier circuit comprises an input node to be connected to a sensor to receive an input charge, and an output node to be connected to a charge conversion circuit. The charge sensitive amplifier circuit further comprises a first transfer switch located between the input node and the output node to transfer the input charge to the output node, and a second transfer switch located in parallel to the first transfer switch between the input node and the output node to transfer the input charge to the output node.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Instead of using a single transfer switch/transfer gate a first transfer switch/transfer gate and at least a second transfer switch/transfer gate are implemented in the charge sensitive amplifier circuit. Both transistor switches have a dynamic control to lower the bandwidth at the end of the charge integration.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first transfer switch is controlled in such a way that the bandwidth is large at the beginning of the integration and is reduced by turning the first transfer switch nearly off, i.e. by operating the first transfer switch with a low conductivity, at the end of the charge transfer. The first transfer switch is advantageously not turned off completely, i.e. not operated in a completely non-conductive state, at the end of the charge transfer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a possible embodiment of the charge sensitive amplifier circuit, during the transfer of small charges only the first transfer switch is turned on, i.e. operated in a high-conductive state, whereas during the transfer of large charges both of the first and second transfer switches are turned on at the beginning of the integration/charge transfer time, but only the first transfer switch finishes the charge output to the output node. The second transfer switch only turns on, if large input charges have to be removed at the start of the integration/beginning of the charge transfer time.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another possible embodiment, the second transfer switch turns off before the first transfer switch is nearly turned off at the end of the charge transfer/end phase of the charge transfer time. As the first transfer switch turns off last, the bandwidth limitation at the end of the integration is still driven by the first transfer switch which does not require high bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, the proposed configuration of the charge sensitive amplifier circuit makes it possible to lower the noise without reducing the input charge range. The proposed charge sensitive amplifier circuit has a variable bandwidth and can overcome the contradistinction of the need for a wide average bandwidth to require high settling accuracy of the input stage and, on the other hand, requiring a low bandwidth to reduce the noise of the input stage. The proposed circuit configuration is suited for integrated circuits.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Additional features and advantages are set forth in the detailed description that follows.
