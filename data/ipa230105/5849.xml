For example, fan-out redistribution can convey signals from finely-pitched bond pads of an integrated device die outwardly for greater spacing. Fan-in redistribution can re-route from peripheral die pads to more centrally located RDL pads. Lines and pads can be formed of a conductive material (e.g., metal) and covered with a non-conductive material (an insulator), and openings in the insulator over pads can be filled, for example, with solder, metal bumps or pillars for connection to other elements.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another technique for connecting separate electronic elements, such as dies, is direct hybrid bonding, whereby both conductive and non-conductive features of an electronic element are directly bonded to the conductive and non-conductive features, respectively of another electronic element. Bonding layers can be provided with both conductive and non-conductive features. In some cases, RDL can serve as the bonding layer for direct hybrid bonding. For example, a metal layer can be deposited and patterned on a die to serve as routing lines away from the die pads. An insulator is deposited over the lines and patterned with openings in which pads are formed from another metal layer, such as by damascene techniques. The pads are exposed at the top, while the routing lines are buried under the insulator. To achieve the planarity desired for direct bonding, the insulator and pads are finely polished and prepared for direct bonding to a different element.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There remains a continuing need for improved structures and methods for connecting an element that includes an electronic component to another element.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The detailed description is set forth with reference to the accompanying figures.

Conductive features (e.g., contact pads, exposed ends of vias (e.g., TSVs), or a through substrate electrodes) of one element may be electrically connected to corresponding conductive features of another element. Any suitable number of elements can be stacked in the bonded structure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, in some embodiments, the elements (e.g., a first element <b>1</b> and the second element <b>2</b>) are directly bonded to one another without an intervening adhesive. Instead, a redistribution layer (RDL) of one element is directly hybrid bonded to a redistribution layer of another element. In various embodiments, a non-conductive material <b>11</b> of the first element <b>1</b> (e.g., a first semiconductor device die with active circuitry or a first integrated device die) can be directly bonded to a corresponding a non-conductive material <b>31</b> of the second element <b>2</b> (e.g., a second semiconductor device die with active circuitry or an interconnect structure) without an adhesive. The non-conductive material <b>11</b> can be referred to as a non-conductive bonding region of the first element. The non-conductive material <b>11</b> of the first element <b>1</b> can be directly bonded to the corresponding non-conductive material <b>31</b> of the second element <b>2</b> using dielectric-to-dielectric bonding techniques. For example, dielectric-to-dielectric covalent bonds may be formed without an adhesive using the direct bonding techniques. Suitable non-conductive bonding materials include conventional insulating materials used in semiconductive processing including but not limited to silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon carbide, silicon carbonitride, etc.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In various embodiments, direct bonds can be formed without an intervening adhesive. For example, dielectric bonding surfaces can be polished to a high degree of smoothness. The bonding surfaces can be cleaned and exposed to a plasma and/or etchants to activate the surfaces. In some embodiments, the surfaces can be terminated with a species after activation or during activation (e.g., during the plasma and/or etch processes). Without being limited by theory, in some embodiments, the activation process can be performed to break chemical bonds at the bonding surface, and the termination process can provide additional chemical species at the bonding surface that improves the bonding energy during direct bonding. In some embodiments, the activation and termination are provided in the same step, e.g., a plasma or wet etchant to activate and terminate the surfaces. In other embodiments, the bonding surface can be terminated in a separate treatment to provide the additional species for direct bonding. In various embodiments, the terminating species can comprise nitrogen. Further, in some embodiments, the bonding surfaces can be exposed to fluorine. For example, there may be one or multiple fluorine peaks at or near layer and/or bonding interfaces. Thus, in the directly bonded structures, the bonding interface between two dielectric materials can comprise a very smooth interface with higher nitrogen content and/or fluorine peaks at the bonding interface. Additional examples of activation and/or termination treatments may be found throughout U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,564,414; 9,391,143; and 10,434,749, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety and for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In various embodiments, conductive features (e.g., first and second contact pads <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>) of the first element <b>1</b> can be directly bonded to corresponding conductive features (e.g., third and fourth contact pads <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>) of the second element <b>2</b>. For example, a hybrid bonding technique can be used to provide conductor-to-conductor direct bonds along a bond interface that includes covalently direct bonded dielectric-to-dielectric surfaces, prepared as described above. In various embodiments, the conductor-to-conductor (e.g., contact pad to contact pad) direct bonds and the dielectric-to-dielectric hybrid bonds can be formed using the direct bonding techniques disclosed at least in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,716,033 and 9,852,988, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety and for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, dielectric bonding surfaces can be prepared and directly bonded to one another without an intervening adhesive as explained above. Conductive contact pads (which may be at least partially surrounded by non-conductive dielectric field regions) may also directly bond to one another without an intervening adhesive. In some embodiments, the respective conductive features can be recessed below exterior (e.g., upper) surfaces of the dielectric field or non-conductive bonding regions, for example, recessed by less than 20 nm, less than 15 nm, or less than 10 nm, for example, recessed in a range of 2 nm to 20 nm, or in a range of 4 nm to 10 nm. The non-conductive bonding regions can be directly bonded to one another without an adhesive at room temperature in some embodiments and, subsequently, the bonded structure can be annealed. Upon annealing, the conductive features can expand and contact one another to form a metal-to-metal direct bond. Beneficially, the use of hybrid direct bonding (e.g., DBI&#xae;, commercially available from Invensas Bonding Technologies, Inc. of San Jose, Calif.) techniques can enable high density of conductive features connected across the direct bond interface (e.g., small or fine pitches for regular arrays). In some embodiments, the pitch of the conductive features may be less 40 microns or less than 10 microns or even less than 1 micron. For some applications the ratio of the pitch of the conductive features to one of the dimensions of the bonding pad is less than 5, or less than 3 and sometimes desirably less than 2. In various embodiments, the conductive features can comprise copper, although other metals may be suitable.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, in direct bonding processes, a first element can be directly bonded to a second element without an intervening adhesive. In some arrangements, the first element can comprise a singulated element, such as a singulated integrated device die. In other arrangements, the first element can comprise a carrier or substrate (e.g., a wafer) that includes a plurality (e.g., tens, hundreds, or more) of device regions that, when singulated, form a plurality of integrated device dies. Similarly, the second element can comprise a singulated element, such as a singulated integrated device die. In other arrangements, the second element can comprise a carrier or substrate (e.g., a wafer).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As explained herein, the first and second elements can be directly bonded to one another without an adhesive, which is different from a deposition process. The first and second elements can accordingly comprise non-deposited elements. A skilled artisan can visibly identify and distinguish the directly bonded elements and a layer that is deposited on an element. Further, directly bonded structures, unlike deposited layers, can include a defect region along the bond interface in which nanovoids are present. The nanovoids may be formed due to activation of the bonding surfaces (e.g., exposure to a plasma). As explained above, the bond interface can include concentration of materials from the activation and/or last chemical treatment processes. For example, in embodiments that utilize a nitrogen plasma for activation, a nitrogen peak can be formed at the bond interface. In embodiments that utilize an oxygen plasma for activation, an oxygen peak can be formed at the bond interface. The nitrogen peak can be detectable using secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) techniques. In various embodiments, for example, a nitrogen termination treatment (e.g., exposing the bonding surface to a nitrogen-containing plasma) can replace OH groups of a hydrolized (OH-terminated) surface with NH<sub>2 </sub>molecules, yielding a nitrogen-terminated surface. In embodiments that utilize an oxygen plasma for activation, an oxygen peak can be formed at the bond interface. In some embodiments, the bond interface can comprise silicon oxynitride, silicon oxycarbonitride, or silicon carbonitride. As explained herein, the direct bond can comprise a covalent bond, which is stronger than van Der Waals bonds. The bonding layers can also comprise polished surfaces that are planarized to a high degree of smoothness.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In various embodiments, the metal-to-metal bonds between the conductive features can be joined such that copper grains grow into each other across the bond interface. In some embodiments, the copper can have grains oriented along the 111 crystal plane for improved copper diffusion across the bond interface. The bond interface can extend substantially entirely to at least a portion of the bonded conductive features, such that there is substantially no gap between the non-conductive bonding regions at or near the bonded conductive features. In some embodiments, a barrier layer may be provided under the conductive features (e.g., which may include copper). In other embodiments, however, there may be no barrier layer under the conductive features, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 11,195,748, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic cross sectional side view of the first element <b>1</b> and the second element <b>2</b> prior to bonding the first element <b>1</b> with the second element <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a schematic cross sectional side view of a bonded structure <b>3</b> that includes the first element <b>1</b> and the second element <b>2</b>.

The mask process can pattern etch a blanket conductive layer; the mask process can be used to form a lift-off mask pattern prior to conductive material deposition; or a shadow mask can be employed to deposit the conductive material to form the pads <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and first routing trace <b>20</b>. In another embodiment, the first contact pad <b>16</b>, the second contact pad <b>18</b>, and the first routing trace <b>20</b> can be formed in a single damascene process.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A bonding surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the first element <b>1</b> is highly polished in preparation for direct bonding.
