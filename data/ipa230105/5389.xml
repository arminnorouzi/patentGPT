A conventional pacemaker includes a main body having a battery and an electric circuit built-in; and a lead (lead wire) led out from the main body. When installing such a pacemaker in a human body, an implantation method is employed in which the main body is subcutaneously implanted and a lead extending from the main body is inserted into a vein and caused to reach the heart. By installing a pacemaker and applying electrical simulation to the heart, it is possible to correct rhythmic abnormalities in arrhythmia.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With regard to a pacemaker such as described above, since a subcutaneous pocket is formed in the skin and the main body is installed therein, there is a possibility that the main body or a lead placed in a vein may cause infection or various complications. Therefore, recently, small pacemakers (leadless pacemakers) that can be placed in the heart by reducing the size of the main body, have been used. For example, Medtronic plc is manufacturing and selling a small leadless pacemaker (MICRA; registered trademark) in which an electrical circuit, electrodes, and a battery are incorporated into a cylindrical main body having a volume of about 1 cc. This leadless pacemaker is installed, not by being implanted in the form of making an incision in the patient's skin as in conventional cases, but by directly conveying the main body into the heart (right ventricle) by means of a catheter.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above-described catheter includes a holding part (device cup) that holds a leadless pacemaker at the tip, and maneuvers for inserting the catheter mainly through the inferior vena cava in the groin area, conveying the device cup to the right ventricle via the right atrium, and locking the main body of the leadless pacemaker to the interventricular septum between the right ventricle and the left ventricle, have been adopted. Specifically, four tines (locking part) each formed into a hook shape and having elasticity are provided on the tip side of the main body, and these tines are caused to sink into the myocardium by pressing the tines against the myocardium (interventricular septum) with a constant pressing force and releasing the pressing force by manipulating the handle at hand of the catheter, so that the main body is fixed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">With regard to the operation for implanting a leadless pacemaker using a catheter such as described above, complications such as a hole in the wall of the heart, which is called perforation, are known to occur, and death cases have also been reported. For that reason, it is considered desirable that maneuvers can be trained by using a simulator in order to promote acquisition or proficiency of manipulating techniques; however, at the moment, there is no proposed simulator for training of the catheter maneuvers for a leadless pacemaker. The inventors of the invention have proposed, in a previous patent application (Patent Document 1), a simulator including a heart model according to the types of heart diseases; a container holding the heart model; and a pump circulating a stream of water to the container, so that improvement of catheter maneuvers for various heart diseases can be promoted. With this simulator, maneuvers similar to the actual operations for various heart diseases can be practiced by storing water in a small container to float a heart model, creating a flow into the heart with a pump to generate a pulsatile flow, inserting a catheter into the floating heart model, and manipulating the catheter.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">Patent Document 1: PCT/JP2016/057000</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The simulator disclosed in Patent Document 1 is effective for enhancing the skill of operations performed for actual heart diseases; however, maneuvers for installing a leadless pacemaker such as described above in the heart cannot be practiced.

A catheter simulator <b>1</b> includes a container <b>10</b> accommodating a heart model <b>100</b>; and a pump <b>50</b> (pulsatile flow generating pump) for circulating a liquid in a state in which the container <b>10</b> is filled with a liquid W such as water. The container <b>10</b> is installed so as not to be movable on a base <b>60</b>, in order to promote stabilization of installation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The catheter simulator <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment includes a pump <b>50</b> so that a liquid is circulated inside the installed heart model, and a pulsatile flow by means of blood, which is equivalent to an actual heart, can be generated. The pump <b>50</b> is configured to be intermittently driven so that a pulsatile flow is generated for the liquid filled in the container <b>10</b>. Specifically, when a pulsation in the human body that can be assumed is considered, a heart rate of 20 to 200 bpm (beat per minute) is sufficient. With regard to actual cardiac operations, since it is speculated that most cardiac operations are performed at a heart rate in the range of about 40 to 100 bpm, the capacity of the pump <b>50</b> may have a specification that can send 20 to 200 times per minute of pulsatile flow to the heart model, and it is possible to perform an effective simulation with a pump that can send at least 40 to 150 times per minute of pulsatile flow to the heart model.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Incidentally, on the occasion of simulating catheter manipulation, the pump <b>50</b> is not necessarily a required element. For example, it is possible to practice catheter manipulation even in a state of having the container <b>10</b> filled with a liquid or in a state of holding a heart model in the container.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As described above, the inventors of the invention have proposed a four-cavity model, a coronary artery model, and a TAVI (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) model as heart models in a previous patent application, PCT/JP2016/057000. These heart models are formed from materials having elasticity close to that of an actual human heart, for example, one alone or a combination of a plurality of PVA (polyvinyl alcohol), polyurethane, an epoxy resin, an unsaturated polyester, a phenol resin, a silicone, materials similar to these; and other thermosetting resins and thermoplastic resins, so that catheter manipulation is practiced with a tactile sensation close to that of human organs.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The heart model <b>100</b> according to the invention is configured in a dedicated form in which maneuvers related to installation of a leadless pacemaker, maneuvers for collecting myocardial tissue by using a catheter, such as myocardial biopsy, and the like, all of which cannot be practiced with the above-described known heart models, can be practiced. Preferably, the heart model is formed by means of a material similar to that of the above-described heart model, so that during a simulation, a feeling of touch at the time of catheter manipulation close to reality can be obtained. In this case, with regard to the color of the heart model <b>100</b>, the inner part may be made visually not recognizable by adopting the same color as that of an actual heart, so that the trainee can carry out simulation while irradiating X-radiation and observing a monitor. Alternatively, a transparent or translucent color may be adopted so that the trainee can carry out simulation while directly observing, by visual inspection, the movement of a catheter, a guide wire, and other devices, which are inserted. Incidentally, even when the trainee forms a heart model with a material that is visually recognizable, by covering the container <b>10</b> with a cover or the like so that the heart model cannot be seen, it is also possible to figure out the behavior of a catheter only on the monitor by viewing by means of X-ray fluoroscopy.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is preferable that the heart model <b>100</b> of the invention is formed integrally without having any artificial seams. As a result, generation of a flow of a liquid (blood flow) that is not seen in the human body due to seams can be prevented. Furthermore, in addition to the effect that blocking of the field of vision by seams at the time of inserting a catheter can be prevented, the appearance of unnatural shadows under X-ray fluoroscopy can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As a method of forming a heart model by using a material that satisfies properties such as mentioned above, for example, it is possible to use an optical shaping method (JP 5236103 B2) invented by the present Applicant. When the shaping method is used, a highly accurate heart model for each patient can be formed at relatively low cost in a short period of time, based on the imaging data (cardiac CT data) of a human organ. Therefore, the trainee can create a patient-specific heart model and receive simulation training for catheter manipulation, in advance of an actual operation. Furthermore, it is also possible to utilize the catheter simulator according to the invention as a preliminary preparation prior to actual catheter manipulation, such as selecting and examining a catheter or various devices optimal for the patient before an examination or an operation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the heart model <b>100</b> is formed according to the above-described optical shaping method, since a state close to the human body can be reproduced, the surface of the heart model is not smooth and includes slight surface unevenness, just like the human body. In this case, even when the heart model is formed by means of a transparent or translucent material such as described above, since visible light is diffusely reflected on the surface having surface unevenness, visibility may be deteriorated. In this case, after the heart model is formed, diffuse reflection can be reduced by coating the surface with the same material to smoothen the surface having surface unevenness, and visibility can be improved.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, the heart model <b>100</b> of the present embodiment and the catheter simulator <b>1</b> using that heart model are configured such that a liquid is circulated in the container <b>10</b> by the pump <b>50</b>, and a pulsatile flow is caused to flow inside the heart model. As a result, the main body having elasticity repeatedly undergoes expansion and contraction, and therefore, the liquid can flow as is the case of the blood flow of an actual heart. By circulating a liquid as such, in a simulation utilizing a contrast agent, the contrast agent can be suppressed from staying inside the heart, and the behavior of the catheter or the leadless pacemaker can be figured out on the monitor.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in addition to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the configuration of the container <b>10</b> of the catheter simulator where the heart model <b>100</b> is installed, and the heart model <b>100</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Incidentally, regarding the container <b>10</b> and the heart model <b>100</b> that will be described in the following embodiment, a four-cavity type including a right atrium, a right ventricle, a left atrium, and a left ventricle in the inner part of the main body of the heart model will be described as an example, so that the maneuvers related to installation of a leadless pacemaker can be effectively practiced.

The protrusion <b>201</b><i>d </i>is formed so as to surround the above-described recess <b>201</b><i>a</i>, and by forming such a protrusion, drifting of the leadless pacemaker is restricted, and it is possible to make it difficult for the leadless pacemaker to be shifted from the recess <b>201</b><i>a</i>. Furthermore, when such a protrusion is formed, it is preferable that the protrusion <b>201</b><i>d </i>is formed such that the angle of elevation thereof with respect to the bottom face of the holder (surface of the flexible part) is 90 degrees or less (inclined so as to cover the recess <b>201</b><i>a </i>where the leadless pacemaker penetrates, from above). By forming an inclined protrusion <b>201</b><i>d </i>as such, when the leadless pacemaker is brought near to a predetermined site, any sliding or bouncing movement more than necessary of the leadless pacemaker can be effectively suppressed as in the surface state of an actual heart, and it is possible to practice the manipulation of fixing the locking part as equivalent to an actual operation.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The protrusion <b>201</b><i>d </i>may be formed without having a recess. For example, in a third Modification Example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, a plurality of protrusions <b>201</b><i>e </i>are formed (three sites in the diagrams) on the surface of the flexible part <b>201</b> along the direction in which the leadless pacemaker is brought as inserted. The leadless pacemaker that is brought as inserted can be locked between the protrusions <b>201</b><i>e </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, and when a plurality of protrusions <b>201</b><i>e </i>are formed as such, the leadless pacemaker to be inserted can be locked at a plurality of positions. In this case, recesses may be formed between the protrusions <b>201</b><i>e</i>, or recess or pits where the leadless pacemaker fits in may be appropriately formed along the protrusions. That is, it is preferable that the protrusions are disposed in the form of surrounding a recess formed such that a leadless pacemaker penetrates therein. Furthermore, it is preferable that the shape of the protrusions is a shape that surrounds the recess except for the place where the catheter enters or exits, and it is also acceptable that the flesh in the human body is reproduced, and the protrusions are disposed in a stripe pattern in accordance with the shape of the tip of the catheter, or even the shape of the tip of the leadless pacemaker. By providing such protrusions <b>201</b><i>d </i>(<b>201</b><i>e</i>) and a recess <b>201</b><i>a </i>or pits <b>201</b><i>b </i>on the surface of the flexible part <b>201</b>, when the leadless pacemaker is brought near to a predetermined site, any sliding or bouncing movement more than necessary of the leadless pacemaker can be suppressed as in the surface state of an actual heart, and it is possible to practice the manipulation of fixing the locking part as equivalent to an actual operation.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Incidentally, when forming the recesses, pits, and protrusions, any one or more of them may be formed on the surface of the flexible part, and the shape, the number of pieces to be formed, the pattern of disposition, and the like of the recesses, pits, and protrusions can be appropriately modified. Furthermore, the surface shape itself of the surface unevenness may be formed into a shape to which the leadless pacemaker can be easily locked.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, holes (openings) through which a liquid can pass may be formed in the holder <b>200</b>. When a large number of such openings <b>200</b><i>h </i>are formed, for example, on the surface where the flexible part <b>201</b> is mounted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the liquid can be made to flow easily inside the main body of the heart model (in the present embodiment, a fluid can flow easily between the left ventricle and the right ventricle, and in a case where a contrast agent or the like is used, retention can be prevented).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> are diagrams illustrating the configuration of a leadless pacemaker used in the above-described heart model <b>100</b>. The leadless pacemaker <b>300</b> used in the present embodiment is referred to as MICRA (registered trademark) manufactured by Medtronic plc, and an electric circuit, an electrode, and a battery are incorporated inside a main body <b>300</b>A configured to have a cylindrical shape with a total length of 25.9 mm, a diameter of 6.7 mm, and a volume of about 1 cc. Furthermore, at the tip of the main body <b>300</b>A, tines <b>301</b> that serve as a locking part are formed at an interval of about 90 degrees along the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The leadless pacemaker <b>300</b> configured as such is accommodated inside a device cup <b>305</b> provided at the tip of a dedicated delivery catheter system (not shown in the diagram), inserted into the inferior vena cava through the groin, and conveyed into the right ventricle via the right atrium. Inside the right ventricle <b>110</b><i>b</i>, installation of the leadless pacemaker <b>300</b> can be practiced by, while placing the device cup <b>305</b> at the tip at a predetermined position of the interventricular septum (in the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the recess <b>201</b><i>a </i>portion of the flexible part <b>201</b> of the holder <b>200</b>) by manipulating a handle at hand, pressing the main body <b>300</b>A of the leadless pacemaker <b>300</b> accommodated inside the device cup <b>305</b> against the flexible part <b>201</b>, and checking whether at least two of the tines <b>301</b> are locked. In this case, when the tines <b>301</b> are deformed to face outward by applying a tensile force to the main body <b>300</b>A, it can be confirmed that the deformed tines are engaged with the flexible part <b>201</b>, and when the tines keep a hook shape without change, it can be confirmed that the tines are not engaged with the flexible part <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to the above-described heart model <b>100</b> and the catheter simulator <b>1</b>, it is possible to accurately train an operation for indwelling the leadless pacemaker <b>300</b> in the right ventricle. In this case, the heart model <b>100</b> can be caused to float in a transparent container <b>10</b>, training can be carried out while visually recognizing the heart model <b>100</b>, the container <b>10</b> is covered with a cover, a contrast agent is allowed to flow, and training can be carried out while looking at the monitor. Furthermore, in the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, when the main body <b>100</b>A of the heart model <b>100</b> is provided with an inflow port <b>150</b>, and a liquid communication part <b>104</b><i>a </i>that opens to the left ventricle <b>111</b><i>b </i>is formed in the pulmonary artery <b>104</b> communicating with the right ventricle <b>110</b><i>b</i>, a flow of a liquid as indicated by the arrow is created inside the main body, and the same flow of blood as that in an actual heart can be generated. In addition, when a contrast agent is used, the contrast agent does not stay inside the main body <b>100</b>A due to the flow of liquid inside the heart. Incidentally, for a similar purpose, a liquid communication part may also be formed between the pulmonary artery <b>104</b> and the aorta <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described above, when the heart model <b>100</b> is formed from a transparent or semi-transparent material, it is possible to practice while checking the movement of the leadless pacemaker; however, in some cases, it can be thought that the trainee may wish to practice in a situation that is more easily visually recognizable. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, it is preferable to create cutting lines <b>100</b><i>b </i>for forming an opening region to the outer shell <b>100</b>A&#x2032; of the main body <b>100</b>A so that the movement of the catheter inserted inside the main body <b>100</b>A can be visually recognized. The user can visually recognize the inner part of the main body by cutting out the outer shell <b>100</b>A&#x2032; along the cutting lines <b>100</b><i>b </i>as necessary, and when performing a simulation, the user can easily figure out the movement of the leadless pacemaker <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, according to the above-mentioned catheter simulator <b>1</b> and the heart model <b>100</b>, an operation related to the installation of a leadless pacemaker can be conveniently practiced. Furthermore, in the above-described example, practice was achieved in an environment in which the container <b>10</b> was filled with a liquid; however, it is also possible to practice the catheter manipulation in a dry environment without filling the container <b>10</b> with a liquid. Furthermore, depending on the configuration of the leadless pacemaker and the site of installation in the heart, it may be considered to change the route for approaching into the main body of the heart model (simulated blood vessel route to be used) or the locking method (method for manipulating a catheter); however, the site of installation of the holder <b>200</b> having a flexible part <b>201</b> to which a catheter can be locked can also be appropriately changed in accordance to the change in the route or locking method. For example, an opening for attaching or detaching the holder <b>200</b> may be formed directly on the outer shell <b>100</b>A&#x2032; of the main body <b>100</b>A.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Furthermore, the positions of arrangement of the above-described connection part and introduction part of the container <b>10</b> can be appropriately modified, and the position of formation of an inflow port for causing a liquid to flow into the main body of the heart model to be installed in the container can also be appropriately modified. For example, with regard to the inflow of a liquid, an inflow port may be formed in portions other than the simulated blood vessel passage in the outer shell of the main body, such as the right atrium <b>110</b><i>a </i>or the right ventricle <b>110</b><i>b</i>, or it may be configured such that an opening is formed in the simulated blood vessel passage to discharge the liquid into the container.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, regarding the catheter maneuvers, placement of a leadless pacemaker has been described; however, even for a temporary pacing catheter that has been conventionally used, training can be similarly carried out by using the present model.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, a myocardial biopsy maneuvers that can be trained by utilizing the above-described heart model <b>100</b> and catheter simulator <b>1</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Myocardial biopsy is an examination method of percutaneously collecting myocardial tissue by using a catheter, and in order to perform histological diagnosis for patients with cardiac hypofunction and cardiomyopathy of unknown cause, or for patients after heart transplantation, myocardial biopsy is an unavoidable examination. These days, myocardial biopsy is also applied to performing a genetic diagnosis from collected tissues and has greatly contributed to the diagnosis of patients with heart diseases and the decision of treatment policy. With regard to the examination, it has been reported that right ventricular perforation may occur with a probability of approximately 1%, and cases of death from cardiac tamponade have also been reported. Therefore, myocardial biopsy is a very useful examination while it is a risky examination, and operators who perform the maneuvers are required to have a high level of technique.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">On the other hand, according to the reports of the Japanese Circulation Society, the number of cases in Japan was about 7,000 as of year 2015, which is a clearly small number of cases even as compared with 500,000 cases of CAG (coronary angiography) and 250,000 cases of PCI (coronary angioplasty). That is, this number means that the maneuver is a maneuver for which the number of cases to be experienced for each doctor alone is small, and there is a mismatch that even though it is considered to be an examination with a relatively high risk, there are few opportunities for the doctors who perform the maneuvers to accumulate experience.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In many maneuvers for myocardial biopsy, a catheter is inserted into the right ventricle through the internal jugular vein via the superior vena cava, or through the femoral vein via the inferior vena cava, and myocardial biopsy forceps are delivered into the right ventricle by way of passing through the catheter.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The maneuvers are very similar to the maneuvers for embedding a leadless pacemaker of the above-mentioned embodiment; however, the major difference is that in the maneuvers for installing a leadless pacemaker, the leadless pacemaker is implanted at the interventricular septum (portion where the holder <b>200</b> is installed), whereas in the myocardial biopsy, a myocardial biopsy is delivered through the right ventricle side to the interventricular septum, and myocardial tissue is collected from the interventricular septum.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Therefore, training can be achieved by utilizing the same heart model as that in the case of the leadless pacemaker; however, it is not necessary to fix the locking part as in the leadless pacemaker, and rather it is necessary to cut off a portion into an appropriate size.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In order to realize this, it is preferable that the flexible part <b>201</b> that is fixed to the above-described holder <b>200</b> is constructed of porous sponge or a soft resin that can be grabbed with myocardial biopsy forceps. However, it is preferable that the flexible part <b>201</b> is formed from a material softer than that of the main body of the heart model so that there is no feeling of discomfort even when a contrast agent is injected under X-ray fluoroscopy, and a feeling of manipulation similar to that of an actual operation can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In clinical sites, maneuvers are performed under X-ray fluoroscopy, and for training, a transparent heart is preferred so that the behavior of a catheter can be checked during maneuvers, while it is more preferable that the free wall located on the body side of the interventricular septum is opened.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">For these reasons, it is preferable that the heart main body, the holder <b>200</b>, and the flexible part <b>201</b> attached to the holder are formed from materials having high X-ray transparency. Furthermore, the most important complication for the maneuvers of myocardial biopsy is perforation, and it is preferable that it can be checked whether the tissue could be collected from a correct position during training. Accordingly, it is preferable that the flexible part <b>201</b> is formed from a material whose difference from the heart main body can be seen at a glance, that is, a material having a different color. Since it is preferable that the heart main body is transparent as described above, it is preferable that the flexible part has a color that is easily perceivable by the trainee or the instructor, such as red color for example.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">On the occasion of the myocardial biopsy maneuvers, the myocardial biopsy forceps are manipulated using a sheath with a J-shaped tip so that the tip part of the myocardial biopsy forceps are in a perpendicular direction to the interventricular septum; however, in real clinical practice, the myocardial biopsy forceps are not necessarily perpendicular to the interventricular septum and are often slightly slanted. Therefore, it is preferable that the flexible part <b>201</b> is formed from a material that is not slippery.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In clinical sites, in order to conduct training within time constraints, it is required that the simulator can be prepared rapidly, and that the time taken to move from completion of one round of maneuver to the next round of maneuver is shortened as far as possible. As described above, with the present simulator, a plurality of trainings can be efficiently carried out by exchanging the holder part, and preparation can be made in a short period of time.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
