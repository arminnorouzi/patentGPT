The internal terminal conductors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> serve as terminals of the inductor <b>1</b>, and are partially exposed on an outer surface of the component body <b>2</b> while being disposed so as to be embedded inside the component body <b>2</b>. An external terminal conductor (not shown) may be formed, for example, with a plating film so as to cover each of the exposed portions of the internal terminal conductors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The first internal terminal conductor <b>5</b> and the second internal terminal conductor <b>6</b> are separated from each other and are respectively exposed on a side of a first end surface <b>8</b> and a side of a second end surface <b>9</b> on a mounting surface <b>7</b> facing a side of the mounting substrate of the component body <b>2</b>. Further, the first internal terminal conductor <b>5</b> is exposed on the first end surface <b>8</b> while continuing to the portion exposed on the mounting surface <b>7</b>, and the second internal terminal conductor <b>6</b> is exposed on the second end surface <b>9</b> while continuing to the portion exposed on the mounting surface <b>7</b>.
