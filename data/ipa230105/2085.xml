Together, the core and bladder may provide a habitat for humans that shelters against space debris and radiation. The bladder may expand around the area between the two ends of the core and retain oxygen in an airtight environment. A soft goods layer, such as a webbing, may cover the bladder for protection and increase the likelihood of an even pressure load distribution across the bladder. The soft goods layer may include a webbing of straps in a basket-weave configuration to maintain the shape of the bladder and to prevent straining of the bladder. But the combination of the soft goods layer and the bladder may place significant strain on the core, especially at the ends where the core connects to the bladder. A hardware interface is necessary to keep the bladder and core conjoined under this pressure. Currently, any separation of the bladder and core would result in air leakage and compromise the safety of the inhabitants and equipment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A hardware interface at the bladder and core should prevent air leaks and separation of the bladder and core at the connecting point of the core and the bladder. Further, the hardware interface should be configured to interface with the soft goods layer, which may include a vast array of straps that cover and hold the bladder together. Moreover, the hardware interface should be configured to interface with a cylindrical hollow core with openings at both ends through which cargo and personnel may pass. The core or bladder may have structural failure from significant pulling strain from the bladder and the soft goods pulling at the endpoints of the core. This pulling strain may increase as the bladder is pressurized. The strain on the core may cause air leaks near the core and the buckling of the core. Thus, a hardware interface between the cylindrical hollow core and the soft goods layer is required to properly secure the bladder to the core and maintain a safe pressurized space habitat.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The mounting flange and bracket here solves the problem of the immense strain on the core and bladder and the need to maintain an airtight seal within the habitat. Unlike previous solutions, the mounting flange and the bracket may interface between the array of straps covering the bladder and the cylindrical hollow core. The mounting flange and bracket may increase the likelihood that the bladder is secured to the core. The mounting flange and a bracket may also increase the likelihood of the bladder remaining airtight under full pressure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The bracket and the mounting flange may provide an interface between the array of straps covering the bladder and the hollow rigid cylindrical shape of the core. The mounting flange may connect to an end of the core. The mounting flange may include a lip on an outer side and various openings at the internal and external sides for bolts to interconnect the bladder and the core. The bracket may include two ends: one end or end region to connect to an array of straps covering the bladder and the other end or end region to connect to the mounting flange. The bracket may have a protrusion that goes over the lip of the mounting flange. The bracket may be further secured by two bolts to the various apertures at the mounting flange.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A clamping ring may seal the bladder to the mounting flange. The clamping ring may cover an O-ring situated between the clamping ring and the mounting flange. The mounting flange may be connected to the core via a cap or vestibule. The cap or vestibule may overlap with the core and the mounting flange. The cap or vestibule may run parallel to the mounting flange to secure the mounting flange and core together. Overall, the interplay between the bracket, the mounting flange, the clamping ring, and the cap secures the bladder and core together under immense tension.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The methods, systems, and apparatuses described herein are for a mounting flange and a bracket to maintain the bladder secure to the core and a safe airtight space habitat. The various embodiments described herein also create an interlocking play of the mounting flange, the core, and the cap.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts an example of a diagram representative of a cross-section of a space habitat having a core and bladder. The space habitat may be formed from a core <b>110</b> and a bladder <b>120</b> coupled to the core <b>110</b>. The bladder <b>120</b> may connect to the far ends of the core <b>110</b> such as at opposed ends or opposed regions of the core. The bladder <b>120</b> may expand out from the core <b>110</b> when pressurized. The bladder <b>120</b> may have a toroid shape about the core <b>110</b> in a non-limiting example. The bladder <b>120</b> may be covered by a liner <b>125</b>. The liner <b>125</b> may protect the bladder <b>120</b> from the relatively rough surface of the soft goods layer <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The core <b>110</b> may be a rigid frame for the space habitat. The core <b>110</b> may have a cylindrical shape with a hollow interior. The hollow interior may allow cargo and persons to pass from one end of the core <b>110</b> to the other end of the core <b>110</b>. The core <b>110</b> may include openings at the far ends of the core <b>110</b>. The openings may allow the space habitat to interface with other space structures to receive cargo or personnel. For example, the core <b>110</b> may be attached to a vestibule for receiving cargo. In another example, the core <b>110</b> may include a pressurization cap to maintain the pressure inside of the core <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The bladder <b>120</b> may be connected to the ends of the cylindrical core <b>110</b>. The bladder <b>120</b> may be stored uninflated at the core <b>110</b> to minimize its footprint prior to launch. Following launch, the bladder <b>120</b> may inflate under pressure. The pressurized bladder <b>120</b> may support human activity in space. The bladder <b>120</b> may be stressed by the pressurization, which potentially poses significant safety concerns to inhabitants and equipment. For example, an air leak may result at the interface between the core <b>110</b> and the bladder <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the bladder <b>120</b> may be a component for retaining gas. The bladder <b>120</b> may create an airtight seal for the space habitat. The bladder <b>120</b> may have a low gas permeability. The bladder <b>120</b> may maintain pressurized air inside the habitat to support human life. The bladder <b>120</b> may be symmetrical about the core <b>110</b>. For example, the bladder <b>120</b> may retain a toroid shape about the core <b>110</b>. In another example, the bladder <b>120</b> may have a spherical shape about the core <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the bladder <b>120</b> may bulge outward at the area proximate to the core <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the bladder <b>120</b> may have the shape of a wheel at the portion furthest from the core <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The bladder <b>120</b> may be pressurized to fill a soft goods layer <b>150</b>. The soft goods layer <b>150</b> may be a restraint on the shape and size of the bladder <b>120</b>. For example, the bladder <b>120</b> may be pressurized to fill the contours of an axial and hoop webbing restraint. The bladder <b>120</b> may be slightly oversized relative to the soft goods layer <b>150</b> to prevent overinflating. The bladder <b>120</b> may elongate to increase the likelihood that the bladder <b>120</b> reaches the constraining contours of the axial and hoop webbing restraints.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts an example of a diagram representative of a space habitat including a core <b>110</b> attached to a vestibule and a bladder <b>120</b> covered with a soft goods layer <b>150</b> and a debris shield <b>160</b>. The soft goods layer <b>150</b> may cover the bladder <b>120</b> and be interposed between the debris shield <b>160</b> and the bladder <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The soft goods layer <b>150</b> may be wrapped around the bladder <b>120</b>. Additionally, and/or alternatively, the soft goods layer <b>150</b> may be wrapped around the liner <b>125</b>. The soft goods layer <b>150</b> may comprise an axial and hoop webbing. The axial and hoop webbing may reinforce the bladder <b>120</b> and prevent uneven stress distribution across the bladder <b>120</b>. The axial and hoop webbing may be configured to increase the likelihood that the bladder <b>120</b> retains its shape. The axial and hoop webbing may be woven together to create an even stress distribution across the bladder <b>120</b>. For example, the axial webbing may alternate between going over and under the hoop webbings. Additionally, and/or alternatively, the hoop webbing may alternate between going over and under the axial webbings. Various weave patterns may be created between the axial and hoop webbings. The axial and hoop webbing may be spaced around the circumference of the bladder <b>120</b>. The axial and hoop webbing may be made of Vectran. A hoop strap may be joined to the strap <b>230</b> (e.g., axial strap) with a stitching, an adhesive, and/or the like. Similarly, the strap <b>230</b> (e.g., axial strap) may be joined to the hoop strap with a stitching, an adhesive, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A vestibule may be connected to either side of the core <b>110</b>.
