The X-ray CT apparatus <b>1</b> is an example of an X-ray diagnosis apparatus according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the X-ray CT apparatus <b>1</b> includes a gantry apparatus (which may be called a &#x201c;gantry&#x201d;) <b>10</b>, a table <b>30</b>, and a console <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the present embodiment, a rotation axis of a rotating frame <b>13</b> in a non-tilt state or the longitudinal direction of a tabletop <b>33</b> of the table <b>30</b> is defined as a Z-axis direction. Further, the axial direction orthogonal to the Z-axis direction and parallel to a floor surface is defined as an X-axis direction. Also, the axial direction orthogonal to the Z-axis direction and perpendicular to the floor surface is defined as a Y-axis direction. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts the gantry <b>10</b> in multiple locations for the sake of convenience in the explanation, the X-ray CT apparatus <b>1</b> in actuality includes the single gantry <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The gantry <b>10</b> and the table <b>30</b> are configured to operate on the basis of operations received from a user via the console <b>40</b> or operations received from the user via an operating unit provided in the gantry <b>10</b> or the table <b>30</b>. The gantry <b>10</b>, the table <b>30</b>, and the console <b>40</b> are connected so as to be able to communicate with one another in a wired or wireless manner.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The gantry <b>10</b> is an apparatus including an imaging system configured to acquire projection data obtained by projecting an image of an examined subject (hereinafter &#x201c;patient&#x201d;) P while using X-rays. The gantry <b>10</b> has, in a center part thereof, an opening (a bore) extending in the Z-axis direction and having a substantially circular cylindrical shape. In the opening, the tabletop <b>33</b> of the gantry <b>10</b> is inserted. In the present embodiment, having the substantially circular cylindrical shape include having a shape of which the cross-section is a perfect circle and having a shape of which the cross-section is oval. More specifically, the gantry <b>10</b> includes an X-ray tube <b>11</b> (an X-ray generating unit), a wedge <b>16</b>, a collimator <b>17</b>, an X-ray detector <b>12</b>, an X-ray high-voltage circuitry <b>14</b>, a Data Acquisition System (DAS) <b>18</b>, the rotating frame <b>13</b>, and a controller <b>15</b>. It is assumed that the imaging system includes, at least, the X-ray tube <b>11</b> and the X-ray detector <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The X-ray tube <b>11</b> is a vacuum tube configured to generate the X-rays by causing thermo electrons to be emitted from a negative pole (a filament) toward a positive pole (a target or an anode), with application of high voltage and a supply of a filament current from the X-ray high-voltage circuitry <b>14</b>. As a result of the thermo electrons colliding with the target, the X-rays are generated. The X-rays generated at an X-ray tube focal point of the X-ray tube <b>11</b> are, for example, formed to have a cone beam shape via the collimator <b>17</b> and are emitted onto the patient P. For instance, examples of the X-ray tube <b>11</b> include a rotating anode X-ray tube configured to generate the X-rays by having the thermo electrons emitted onto a rotating anode.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The X-ray detector <b>12</b> is configured to detect X-rays that were emitted from the X-ray tube <b>11</b> and have passed through the patient P and is configured to output an electrical signal corresponding to the amount of the X-rays to the DAS <b>18</b>. Because the electrical signal detected by the X-ray detector <b>12</b> is data obtained by projecting an image of the patient P while using X-rays, the electrical signal is referred to as projection data.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, the X-ray detector <b>12</b> includes a plurality of rows of detecting elements in each of which a plurality of detecting elements are arranged in a channel direction along an arc while being centered on the focal point of the X-ray tube <b>11</b>. Each of the plurality of detecting elements is configured to detect the amount of X-rays being incident thereto. Further, possible examples of the X-ray CT apparatus <b>1</b> include various types such as a Rotate/Rotate type (a third generation CT) in which the X-ray tube <b>11</b> and the X-ray detector <b>12</b> integrally rotate around the patient P and a Stationary/Rotate type (a fourth generation CT) in which a large number of X-ray detecting elements arrayed in a ring formation are fixed, while only the X-ray tube <b>11</b> is configured to rotate around the patient P. Any of the various types is appliable to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The X-ray detector <b>12</b> according to the present embodiment includes 320 rows of detecting elements and is capable of imaging the patient P in a wide range along the body axial direction. The X-ray CT apparatus <b>1</b> including the X-ray detector <b>12</b> that has such a large number of rows of detecting elements is referred to as an Area Detector CT (ADCT) apparatus. However, the quantity of the rows of detecting elements is merely an example, and possible embodiments are not limited to this example.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The X-ray detector <b>12</b> according to the present embodiment adopts an energy integrated acquisition method. For example, the X-ray detector <b>12</b> is an indirect-conversion type detector including a grid, a scintillator array, and an optical sensor array.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The scintillator array includes a plurality of scintillators. Each of the scintillators includes a scintillator crystal that outputs light in a photon quantity corresponding to the amount of incident X-rays. The grid is arranged on a surface of the scintillator array that is positioned on the X-ray incident side and includes an X-ray blocking plate having a function of absorbing scattered X-rays. The grid may be referred to as a collimator (a one-dimensional collimator or a two-dimensional collimator) in some situations. The optical sensor array has a function of converting the light amounts from the scintillators into corresponding electrical signals and includes optical sensors configured with Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs), for example. Alternatively, the X-ray detector <b>12</b> may be a detector of a direct conversion type that includes a semiconductor element configured to convert incident X-rays into an electrical signal.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The rotating frame <b>13</b> is configured to support the X-ray tube <b>11</b> and the X-ray detector <b>12</b> so as to be rotatable on the rotation axis. More specifically, the rotating frame <b>13</b> is an annular frame configured to support the X-ray tube <b>11</b> and the X-ray detector <b>12</b> so as to oppose each other and configured to rotate the X-ray tube <b>11</b> and the X-ray detector <b>12</b> via the controller <b>15</b> (explained later). The rotating frame <b>13</b> is rotatably supported by a fixed frame formed by using metal such as aluminum. The rotating frame <b>13</b> is configured to rotate on the rotation axis at a constant angular speed, by receiving motive power from a driving mechanism of the controller <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition to the X-ray tube <b>11</b> and the X-ray detector <b>12</b>, the rotating frame <b>13</b> is configured to further support the X-ray high-voltage circuitry <b>14</b> and the DAS <b>18</b>. The rotating frame <b>13</b> configured in this manner is housed in a casing having a substantially circular cylindrical shape in which the opening (the bore) serving as an imaging space is formed. The central axis of the opening matches the rotation axis of the rotating frame <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The X-ray high-voltage circuitry <b>14</b> includes: a high-voltage generating circuitry including electrical circuitry such as a transformer, a rectifier, and the like and having a function of generating the high voltage to be applied to the X-ray tube <b>11</b> and the filament current to be supplied to the X-ray tube <b>11</b>; and an X-ray controller configured to control output voltage corresponding to the X-rays to be emitted by the X-ray tube <b>11</b>. The high-voltage generating circuitry may be of a transformer type or an inverter type. Further, the X-ray high-voltage circuitry <b>14</b> may be provided on the rotating frame <b>13</b> or may be provided so as to belong to the fixed frame (not illustrated) of the gantry <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The rotating frame <b>13</b> is rotatably supported in a non-rotating part (e.g., the fixed frame; not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the gantry <b>10</b>. A rotating mechanism includes, for example, a motor configured to generate rotating drive power and a bearing configured to transmit the rotating drive power to the rotating frame <b>13</b> so as to cause rotation. The motor is provided in the non-rotating part, for example.

For example, the super resolution processing function <b>444</b> may perform the super resolution process on one of the projection data <b>91</b> and the CT image data <b>92</b>, by using a trained model that has learned, through machine learning, low resolution data/images and high resolution data/images.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">For example, when the super resolution process is to be performed on the projection data <b>91</b>, a plurality of training pairs are prepared, each training pair being made up of low resolution projection data serving as input information and high resolution projection data serving as target (supervisor) information, so as to obtain a trained model for the projection data <b>91</b> by training a machine learning model such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The low resolution projection data may be obtained by imaging the patient P or a phantom or may be obtained by applying a resolution lowering process to high resolution data obtained by imaging the patient P or a phantom. Similarly, the high resolution projection data may be obtained by imaging the patient P or a phantom or may be obtained by applying a resolution enhancing process to low resolution projection data obtained by imaging the patient P or a phantom. For example, high quality projection data may be high quality projection data obtained by implementing the focal point controlling method described later or may be X-ray projection data taken by using a high definition X-ray detector having a small pixel pitch.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Normally, the pixel pitch of planar X-ray detectors used in C-arm X-ray imaging apparatuses and the like is smaller than the pixel pitch of curved X-ray detectors used in CT. Accordingly, it is possible to perform a process of converting an image from such a planar X-ray detector into an image taken by a curved X-ray detector for CT so as to use the image as target information. In that situation, according to one possible embodiment, a super resolution model is obtained by training a machine learning model by using high quality projection data taken with the focal point control as target information and using relatively low quality projection data taken without the focal point control as input information, so as to apply the super resolution model to relatively low quality projection data taken without the focal point control.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In another example, it is also possible to apply an image quality enhancing process with the focal point control to each of high resolution and low resolution projection data.
