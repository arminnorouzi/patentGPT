The semiconductor component <b>2</b> is, for example, a power transistor or a power FET, and generates heat along with the operation thereof. The semiconductor components <b>2</b> are disposed on the substrate <b>1</b> at intervals from each other. Further, the semiconductor components <b>2</b> are electrically connected to the copper pattern <b>1</b><i>a </i>described above.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Next, a configuration of the cooling device <b>100</b> will be described. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cooling device <b>100</b> includes a base <b>10</b> and a bottom plate <b>12</b>. The base <b>10</b> and the bottom plate <b>12</b> are integrally formed of a metal material having a good thermal conductivity such as aluminum or copper. It is also possible to form the cooling device <b>100</b> by additive manufacturing (AM method).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The base <b>10</b> is fixed on the back surface of the substrate <b>1</b> described above (that is, a surface facing the opposite side of the surface on which the semiconductor components <b>2</b> are mounted) by the bonding material <b>1</b><i>d. </i>The base <b>10</b> has a plate shape having an area larger than the substrate <b>1</b>. An introduction port <b>13</b> for guiding the refrigerant front the outside is formed in the central part of the bottom plate <b>12</b> in a first direction d<b>1</b> (that is, the central part of a region where the plurality of semiconductor components <b>2</b> are disposed).

Note that, in addition to low-temperature water, a long-life coolant (LLC), ethylene glycol, or the like is preferably used as the refrigerant.

When the semiconductor component <b>2</b> is operated, the semiconductor component <b>2</b> generates heat due to internal resistance and the like. When the plurality of semiconductor components <b>2</b> are disposed in an integrated manner as described above, the temperature becomes high particularly in the central part of an integrated region due to the occurrence of thermal interference. Increase in such heat generation may result in thermal runaway or destruction of the semiconductor components <b>2</b>. Therefore, in the present embodiment, a configuration is employed in which the semiconductor components <b>2</b> are cooled by the cooling device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">First, the refrigerant introduced from the introduction port <b>13</b> into a channel F changes its orientation by colliding with a back surface <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the base <b>10</b>, and flows toward the end sides of the first direction d<b>1</b> (the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). During this process, the semiconductor components <b>2</b> are cooled by heat absorption by the refrigerant.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the configuration described above, the refrigerant can be supplied from the introduction port <b>13</b> directly to the central part of the region in which the semiconductor components <b>2</b> are integrated. This makes it possible to cool the semiconductor components <b>2</b> more efficiently. On the other hand, for example, when the refrigerant flows in one direction from one end to the other end of the channel F, the temperature of the refrigerant increases toward downstream side, and thus there is a possibility that a desired cooling effect cannot be obtained. However, according to the configuration described above, since the introduction port <b>13</b> is provided directly below the semiconductor components <b>2</b>, the above possibility can be reduced, and the low-temperature refrigerant can be always supplied to the semiconductor components <b>2</b> on a continuous basis.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The first embodiment of the disclosure has been described above.
