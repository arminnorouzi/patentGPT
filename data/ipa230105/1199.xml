Often, the interruptions to breathing occur during sleep, at which time the disorder is called sleep apnea. Breathing cessation may occur numerous times during sleep, in some cases hundreds of times a night. Each cessation of breathing may last for up to a minute or longer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sleep apnea has multiple classifications based on the source of the dysfunction. For example, CSA results from neurological dysfunction, while OSA results form a mechanical blockage of the airway. The mechanical blockage may be due, for example, to fatty neck tissue compressing the trachea.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">OSA, which encompasses apnea and hypopnea, is a serious disorder in which breathing is irregularly and repeatedly stopped and started during sleep, resulting in disrupted sleep and reducing blood oxygen levels. OSA is caused by complete or partial collapse of the pharynx during sleep. Muscles in a patient's throat intermittently relax thereby obstructing the upper airway while sleeping. Airflow into the upper airway may be obstructed by the tongue or soft pallet moving to the back of the throat and covering a smaller than normal airway. Loss of air flow also causes unusual inter-thoracic pressure as a person tries to breathe with a blocked airway. Lack of adequate levels of oxygen during sleep may contribute to abnormal heart rhythms, heart attack, heart failure, high blood pressure, stroke, memory problems and increased accidents. Additionally, loss of sleep occurs when a person is awakened during an apneic episode. Implantable medical devices capable of delivering electrical stimulation pulses have been proposed for treating OSA by electrically stimulating muscles around the upper airway that may block the airway during sleep and/or neurological structures innervating these muscles, such as the hypoglossal nerve.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Unlike OSA, CSA does not necessarily involve blockage of an airway. Instead, CSA involves failure of the brain to send appropriate signals to initiate action of the muscles required for respiration. CSA occurs during sleep when an acute increase in ventilation results in a decrease in the level of carbon dioxide in a patient's bloodstream (i.e., the PaCO<sub>2</sub>). When the PaCO<sub>2 </sub>falls below a threshold level required to stimulate breathing, the &#x201c;central&#x201d; (as in Central Nervous System) drive to respiratory muscles and airflow ceases, initiating central apnea. This apnea persists until the patient's PaCO<sub>2 </sub>level rises above the threshold required to stimulate ventilation, upon which the cycle of hyperpnea followed by apnea may repeat. This is referred to as &#x201c;periodic breathing&#x201d;. Implantable medical devices capable of delivering electrical stimulation pulses have been proposed for treating CSA by electrically stimulating neurological targets that control respiration, such as the phrenic nerve.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a general population of patients diagnosed with sleep apnea, approximately 90% will have OSA and approximately 10% will have CSA. Approximately 5% will have Mixed OSA+CSA (i.e., exhibit both OSA and CSA at different times).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The techniques of this disclosure generally relate to an implantable medical device (IMD) system and methods for delivering OSA, CSA, and combination OSA/CSA therapy. Therapy delivery circuitry, e.g., of an IMD, may be configured to deliver a first electrical stimulation via a first lead. The first lead may have a first plurality of electrodes. The therapy delivery circuitry may be configured to deliver second electrical stimulation via a second lead having a second plurality of electrodes. The IMD system may have processing circuitry configured to control the therapy delivery circuitry to deliver the first electrical stimulation configured to treat OSA and control the therapy delivery circuitry to deliver the second electrical stimulation configured to treat CSA. The first plurality of electrodes may be located along a distal portion of the first lead configured to be implanted within musculature of a tongue of a patient stimulating one or both hypoglossal nerves and/or motor points. The second plurality of electrodes may be located along a distal portion of the second lead configured to be implanted intravascularly proximate to a phrenic nerve within the patient.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an example technique, a method includes receiving one or more physiological signals.

In some examples, abnormal breathing patterns or other changes in patient status are detected based on accelerometer signals, cardiac electrogram, electrocardiogram (ECG), or other cardiac electrical signals, and/or impedance signals. Examples of this disclosure involve monitoring physiological signals, such as accelerometer signals, subcutaneous ECG signals and/or bioimpedance signals, using a subcutaneous IMD. In some examples, a subcutaneous IMD may use single source physiologic signal, such as an accelerometer signal, a subcutaneous ECG signal, or a bioimpedance signal, or combine them in any manner to improve detection sensitivity. In general, the physiological signal may be able to provide diagnostic information about physical parameters including respiratory rate, respiratory breathing anomalies and sleep apnea. For example, respiratory anomalies such as OSA, CSA or respiratory patterns associated with mixed OSA/CSA may be detected with a subcutaneous sensor placed on the thorax which may detect changes in respiratory rate or respiratory depth, cessation of respiration, and/or other respiratory characteristics associated with apnea. In some examples, respiratory parameters associated with &#x201c;normal&#x201d; or &#x201c;healthy&#x201d; respiration may also be identified.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram of a medical system for delivering OSA, CSA and/or mixed OSA/CSA therapy.

The sensing feedback may indicate whether the patient is experiencing apneas. The sensing feedback may further allow processing circuitry to classify the patient's respiration, e.g., the apneas, as OSA, CSA, or mixed OSA/CSA. In some examples, processing circuitry may further be configured to classify the patient's respiration as &#x201c;healthy/normal&#x201d; based on the sensing feedback, or may determine that the patient's respiration cannot be classified with a desired degree of confidence, and may turn off therapy or deliver a default or safety mode therapy, respectively, in response to these additional classifications.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As discussed, sleep apnea has two primary manifestations; OSA and CSA. In a general population of patients diagnosed with sleep apnea, approximately 92% will have OSA, approximately 3% will have CSA and approximately 5% will have MIXED apneas (i.e., the patients will exhibit both OSA and CSA at different times). For heart failure (HF) patients diagnosed with sleep apnea, approximately 54% will have OSA, approximately 6% will have CSA and approximately 40% will have MIXED apneas.

Lead <b>21</b> may include a flexible, elongated lead body <b>22</b> extending from lead proximal end <b>23</b> to lead distal end <b>26</b>. As illustrated, lead <b>20</b> includes one or more electrodes <b>30</b> carried along a lead distal portion adjacent lead distal end <b>26</b> and are configured for insertion within protrusor muscles <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, and <b>46</b> of tongue <b>40</b>. As one example, the genioglossus muscle includes oblique compartment <b>42</b>A and horizontal compartment <b>42</b>B. In this disclosure, the genioglossus muscle is referred to as protrusor muscle <b>42</b>. Protrusor muscle <b>46</b> is an example of the geniohyoid muscle.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">While protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and <b>46</b> are described, the example techniques described in this disclosure are not limited to stimulating protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and <b>46</b>. Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates one set of protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and <b>46</b> (e.g., on a first side of tongue <b>40</b>). The other side of tongue <b>40</b> also includes protrusor muscles. For instance, a left side of tongue <b>40</b> includes a first set of protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and <b>46</b>, and a right side of tongue <b>30</b> includes a second set of protrusor muscles.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, a surgeon may implant one or more leads <b>21</b> so one or more electrodes <b>30</b> are implanted within soft tissue, such as musculature, proximate to medial branches of one or both hypoglossal nerves <b>11</b>. In some examples, one or more electrodes <b>30</b> may be approximately 5 millimeters (mm) from a major trunk of hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b>. In some examples, one or more electrodes <b>30</b> may be placed in an area of protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and <b>46</b> including the motor points. This is where each nerve axon terminates in the muscle (also called the neuro-muscular junction). The motor points are not at one location but spread out in the protrusor muscles. One or more electrodes <b>30</b> may be generally in the area of the motor points so the motor points are within 1 to 10 mm from one or more electrodes <b>30</b>. Examples of motor points for protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and <b>46</b> are illustrated in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Tongue <b>40</b> includes a distal end, e.g., tip of tongue <b>40</b>, and electrodes <b>30</b> may be implanted proximate to the root of tongue <b>40</b>. The surgeon may implant one or more leads <b>21</b> so one or more electrodes are implanted proximate to bottom surface <b>49</b> of tongue <b>40</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For example, the location for stimulation for genioglossus muscle <b>42</b> may be approximately 30 mm from the Symphsis of the jaw, e.g., where the genioglossus and hypoglossal muscles insert. The location for stimulation for geniohyoid muscle <b>46</b> may be approximately 40 mm from the Symphsis. For both genioglossus muscle <b>42</b> and geniohyoid muscle <b>44</b>, the location for stimulation may be approximately 11 mm lateral to the midline on both the right and left sides of tongue <b>40</b> for stimulating respective hypoglossal nerves <b>11</b>. In some examples, rather than stimulating hypoglossal nerves <b>11</b>, the examples described in this disclosure may be configured for stimulating the motor points, as described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Stimulating the motor points may result in activation of the hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> but may generally be stimulating at a different location than direct stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> trunk or major branches. As a result, in some examples, simulation of one or more motor points may result in more precise activation of muscle fibers than may be possible with stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve trunk or major branches itself.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">One or more electrodes <b>30</b> of lead <b>21</b> may be ring electrodes, segmented electrodes, partial ring electrodes or any suitable electrode configuration. Segmented and partial ring electrodes each extend along an arc less than 360 degrees, e.g., 90-120 degrees, around the outer perimeter of lead <b>21</b>. In this manner, multiple segmented electrodes may be disposed around the perimeter of lead <b>21</b> at the same axial position of lead <b>21</b>. In some examples, segmented electrodes may be useful for targeting different fibers of the same or different nerves at respective circumferential positions with respect to lead <b>21</b> to generate different physiological effects (e.g., therapeutic effects). In some examples, lead <b>21</b> may be, at least in part, paddle shaped, e.g., a &#x201c;paddle&#x201d; lead, and may include an array of electrodes on a common surface, which may or may not be substantially flat.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As described above, in some examples, electrodes <b>30</b> are within musculature of tongue <b>40</b>. Accordingly, one or more electrodes <b>30</b> may be &#x201c;intramuscular electrodes.&#x201d; Intramuscular electrodes may be different than other electrodes placed on or along a nerve trunk or branch, such as a cuff electrode, used to directly stimulate the nerve trunk or branch. The example techniques described in this disclosure are not limited to intramuscular electrodes and may be extendable to electrodes placed closer to a nerve trunk or branch of hypoglossal nerve(s) <b>11</b>. Also, in some examples, rather than one or more electrodes <b>30</b> being &#x201c;intramuscular electrodes,&#x201d; one or more electrodes <b>30</b> may be implanted in connective tissue or other soft tissue proximate to hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, lead <b>21</b> may be configured for advancement through the soft tissue, which may include the protrusor muscle tissue, to anchor electrodes <b>30</b> in proximity of the hypoglossal nerve(s) innervating protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and/or <b>46</b>, and/or motor points connecting axons of hypoglossal nerve(s) to respective muscle fibers of protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and/or <b>46</b>. However, in some examples, lead <b>21</b> may be configured for advancement through vasculature of tongue <b>40</b>. As one example, a surgeon may implant lead <b>21</b> in the lingual veins near hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> through venous access in the subclavian vein. In such examples, one or more electrodes <b>30</b> may be &#x201c;intravascular electrodes.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, electrical stimulation therapy generated by IMD <b>16</b> and delivered via one or more electrodes <b>30</b> may activate protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and <b>46</b> to move tongue <b>40</b> forward, to promote a reduction in obstruction or narrowing of the upper airway <b>48</b> during sleep. As used herein, the term &#x201c;activated&#x201d; with regard to the electrical stimulation of protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and <b>46</b> refers to electrical stimulation causing depolarization or an action potential of the cells of the nerve. e.g., hypoglossal nerve(s) <b>11</b>, or stimulation at the neuro-muscular junction between the nerve and the protrusor muscles, e.g., at the motor points, innervating protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and <b>46</b> and motor points and subsequent depolarization and mechanical contraction of the protrusor muscle cells of protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and <b>46</b>. In some examples, protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and <b>46</b> may be activated directly by the electrical stimulation therapy.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and/or <b>46</b>, on a first side of tongue <b>40</b>, e.g., left or right side of tongue <b>40</b>), may be activated by a medial branch of a first hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b>, and the protrusor muscles, on a second side of tongue <b>40</b>, e.g., other of left or right side of tongue <b>40</b>), may be activated by a medial branch of a second hypoglossal nerve. The medial branch of a hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> may also be referred to as the XIIth cranial nerve. The hyoglossus and styloglossus muscles (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), which cause retraction and elevation of tongue <b>40</b>, are activated by a lateral branch of hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">One or more electrodes <b>30</b> may be used to deliver bilateral or unilateral stimulation to protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and <b>46</b> via the medial branch of the hypoglossal nerve or branches of hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b>, e.g. such as at the motor point where a terminal branch of the hypoglossal nerve interfaces with respective muscle fibers of protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and/or <b>46</b>. For example, one or more electrodes <b>30</b> may be coupled to output circuitry of IMD <b>16</b> to enable delivery of electrical stimulation pulses in a manner selectively activating the right and left protrusor muscles in a cyclical or alternating pattern to avoid muscle fatigue while maintaining upper airway patency. Additionally, or alternatively, IMD <b>16</b> may deliver electrical stimulation to selectively activate protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and/or <b>46</b>, or portions of protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and/or <b>46</b>, during unilateral stimulation of the left or right protrusor muscles.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For instance, in some examples, one lead <b>21</b> may be implanted so one or more of electrodes <b>30</b> deliver electrical stimulation to stimulate the left hypoglossal nerve or motor points of protrusor muscles on the left side of tongue, and therefore cause the left protrusor muscles to activate. In such examples, the electrical stimulation from one or more electrodes <b>30</b> may not be of sufficient amplitude to stimulate the right hypoglossal nerve or motor points of protrusor muscles on the right side of tongue and cause the right protrusor muscles to activate. In some examples, one lead <b>21</b> may be implanted so one or more of electrodes <b>30</b> deliver electrical stimulation to stimulate the right hypoglossal nerve or motor points of protrusor muscles on the right side of tongue, and therefore cause the right protrusor muscles to activate. In such examples, the electrical stimulation from one or more electrodes <b>30</b> may not be of sufficient amplitude to stimulate the left hypoglossal nerve or motor points of protrusor muscles on the left side of tongue and cause the left protrusor muscles to activate. Accordingly, in some examples, an adaptor may be used to apply two leads like lead <b>21</b> to stimulate each of the left and right hypoglossal nerves.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, one lead <b>21</b> may be implanted substantially in the middle (e.g., center) of tongue <b>40</b>. In such examples, one or more electrodes <b>30</b> may deliver electrical stimulation to both hypoglossal nerves or motor points of both muscles on the both sides of tongue <b>40</b> causing both hypoglossal nerves or motor points to activate respective left and right protrusor muscles. It may be possible to utilize current steering and field shaping techniques so one or more electrodes <b>30</b> deliver a first electrical stimulation stimulating the left hypoglossal nerve or motor points of protrusor muscles on the left side of tongue <b>40</b> with little to no stimulation of the right hypoglossal nerve or motor points of protrusor muscles on the right side of tongue, and then one or more electrodes <b>30</b> deliver a second electrical stimulation stimulating the right hypoglossal nerve or motor points of protrusor muscles on the right side of tongue with little to no stimulation of the left hypoglossal nerve or motor points of protrusor muscles on the left side of tongue. In examples where two leads like lead <b>21</b> are utilized, each lead may alternate delivery of stimulation to respective hypoglossal nerves or motor points. In this way, IMD <b>16</b> may stimulate one hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> or one set of motor points and then the other hypoglossal nerve or another set of motor points, which may reduce muscle fatigue.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For instance, continuous stimulation may cause protrusor muscles to be continuously in a protruded state. This continuous contraction may cause protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and/or <b>46</b> to fatigue. In such cases, due to fatigue, the stimulation may not cause protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and/or <b>46</b> to maintain a protruded state (or higher intensity of the electrical stimulation may be needed to cause protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and/or <b>46</b> in the protruded state). By stimulating one set of protrusor muscles, e.g., left or right, a second set, e.g., other of left or right, of protrusor muscles may be at rest. Stimulation may then alternate to stimulate the protrusor muscles that were at rest and thereby maintain protrusion of tongue <b>40</b>, while permitting the protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and/or <b>46</b> that were previously activated to rest. Hence, by cycling between alternate stimulation of the left and right protrusor muscles, tongue <b>40</b> may remain in the protruded state, while one of the first or second set of protrusor muscles is at rest. In some examples, one lead <b>21</b> may be implanted laterally or diagonally across tongue <b>40</b> so some of electrodes <b>30</b> may be used to stimulate the left hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> and/or motor points of the protrusor muscles on the left side of tongue <b>40</b> and some of electrodes <b>30</b> may be used to stimulate the right hypoglossal nerve and/or motor points of the protrusor muscles on the right side of tongue <b>40</b>. In such examples, IMD <b>16</b> may selectively deliver electrical stimulation to a first hypoglossal nerve and/or first motor points of the protrusor muscles on the a first side of tongue <b>40</b> via a first set of one or more electrodes <b>30</b>, and then deliver electrical stimulation to a second hypoglossal nerve and/or/or second set of motor points of the protrusor muscles on a second side of tongue <b>40</b> via a second set of one or more electrodes <b>30</b>. This may be another way in which to reduce muscle fatigue. Additional methods to reduce muscle fatigue include waveform variations, e.g., rectangle, sawtooth, triangle, or biphasic, and/or any technique to manipulate the electrical field to vary recruitment of nerve fibers.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Lead proximal end <b>24</b> includes a connector (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) coupled to connector assembly <b>17</b> of IMD <b>16</b> to provide electrical connection between circuitry enclosed by housing <b>15</b> of IMD <b>16</b>. Elongated lead body <b>22</b> encloses electrical conductors extending from each of one or more electrodes <b>30</b> to the proximal connector at proximal end <b>24</b> to provide electrical connection between output circuitry of IMD <b>16</b> and the electrodes <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">There may be various ways in which lead <b>21</b> is implanted in patient <b>14</b>. As one example, a surgeon may insert a needle (also called introducer needle) through below the jaw and in tongue <b>40</b> starting from the back of tongue <b>40</b>. The surgeon may insert the needle until the needle reaches proximate to the tip of tongue <b>40</b>, angling the needle to be proximate to the hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b>, e.g., left or right hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b>, and to the motor points. In some examples, the needle may include one or more electrodes at the distal end, and the surgeon may cause the one or more electrodes of the needle to output an electrical stimulation, which in turn causes a physiological response such as activation of protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and/or <b>46</b> and protrusion of tongue <b>40</b>. The surgeon may adjust the location of the needle based on the physiological response to determine a location in tongue <b>40</b> providing effective treatment. Using a needle with stimulating electrodes is not necessary in every example.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Once the needle is in place, the surgeon may insert a guidewire (or simply &#x201c;guide&#x201d;) through the needle and anchor the guidewire to tissue of tongue <b>40</b>.

The introducer may be referred to as an introducer, introducer sheath, or introducer/dilator. In some examples, the introducer may optionally include one or more electrodes the surgeon may use to stimulate tongue <b>40</b> to ensure lead <b>21</b> will be located in the correct location, relative to the target nerve tissue. e.g., motor points. Once the introducer is in place, the surgeon may remove the guidewire. In some examples, the introducer may be flexible or curved to ease placement of the introducer in patient <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The surgeon may put lead <b>21</b> through the introducer so one or more electrodes <b>30</b> are proximate to hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> (e.g., so distal end <b>26</b> is near tip of tongue as one non-limiting example). Electrodes <b>30</b> may be proximate to hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> and/or motor points of the protrusor muscles due to the needle creating an opening near hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> and/or motor points of the protrusor muscle. The surgeon may then tunnel proximal end <b>24</b> of lead <b>21</b> back to a connection with IMD <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this manner, the surgeon may implant one lead <b>21</b>.

The axons of hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> branch out. For example, the trunk of hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> includes multiple sets of axons including a first set of axons, and the first set of axons branch out from the trunk of hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b>. The first set of axons include multiple groups of axons including a first group of axons, and the first group of axons branch out from the first set of axons, and so forth. The locations where the branched-out axons interface with respective muscle fibers of protrusor muscles <b>42</b> and/or <b>46</b>, e.g., genioglossus and/or geniohyoid muscle, are referred to as motor points.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">For instance, a branch of hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> interfacing, e.g., connects at the neuro-muscular junction, with the muscle fiber is referred to as a terminal branch, and the end of the terminal branch is a motor point. The length of a terminal branch may be approximately 10 mm from hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> to the genioglossal or geniohyoid muscles. In some examples, there may be approximately an average of 1.5 terminal branches with a standard deviation of +0.7 for the right geniohyoid muscle, an average of 4.8 terminal branches with a standard deviation of +1.4 for the right genioglossus muscle, an average of 2.0 terminal branches with a standard deviation of +0.9 for the left geniohyoid muscle, and an average of 5.1 terminal branches with a standard deviation of +1.9 for the left genioglossus muscle.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">There may be possible advantages with stimulating at motor points <b>54</b>A, <b>54</b>B, <b>55</b>A, or <b>55</b>B, as compared to some other techniques. For instance, some techniques utilize cuff electrodes or stimulate at hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b>. Due to the different bifurcation patterns, placing a cuff electrode around hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b>, or generally attaching an electrode to hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> may be challenging. Also, where cuff electrodes or electrodes attach to hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> are used, implanting electrodes around or at each of hypoglossal nerves <b>11</b> requires multiple surgical entry points to attached to both hypoglossal nerves. Moreover, utilizing cuff electrodes or electrodes attaching to hypoglossal nerves <b>11</b> may possibly negatively impact the nerve by tugging, stretching, or otherwise causing irritation. Accordingly, utilizing lead <b>21</b> and electrodes <b>30</b> implanted proximate to the motor points may be beneficial, e.g., less surgery to implant and less impact on the nerve, as compared to techniques where cuff electrodes or electrodes implanted on the hypoglossal nerve are utilized. Another disadvantage of using a cuff is that the nerve trunk locations which may be practically accessed surgically to implant the cuff often include nerve branches going to the retrusor muscles, which when activated may move the tongue in the wrong direction closing the airway instead of opening.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore, stimulating at motor points <b>54</b>A, <b>54</b>B, <b>55</b>A, and/or <b>55</b>B, such as at the bifurcation point of a motor neuron attaching to muscle fibers, may provide advantages such as for better control of muscle movement. Because motor points <b>54</b>A, <b>54</b>B, <b>55</b>A, and <b>55</b>B are spatially distributed, by stimulating motor points <b>54</b>A, <b>54</b>B, <b>55</b>A, and/or <b>55</b>B, the amount of the genioglossus and geniohyoid muscle being stimulated may be controlled. Also, stimulating at motor points <b>54</b>A, <b>54</b>B, <b>55</b>A, and/or <b>55</b>B may allow for more gentle muscle activation. For instance, when stimulation is provided near the trunk of hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> or both motor points <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B and/or motor points <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B, even stimulation signal with relatively small amplitude may cause the genioglossus and/or geniohyoid muscle to fully protrude, e.g., there is high loop gain where small stimulation amplitudes cause large muscle protrusion. Fine tuning of how much to protrude the genioglossus and/or geniohyoid muscle may not be available when stimulating at a trunk of hypoglossal nerve <b>11</b> or both motor points <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B and/or motor points <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B. However, there may be lower loop gain stimulating at motor points <b>54</b>A, <b>54</b>B, <b>55</b>A, and/or <b>55</b>B. For instance, a stimulation signal having a lower amplitude may move causing the genioglossus and/or geniohyoid muscle to protrude a small amount, and a stimulation signal having a higher amplitude may move causing the genioglossus and/or geniohyoid muscle to protrude a higher amount when stimulating at motor points <b>54</b>A, <b>54</b>B, <b>55</b>A and/or <b>55</b>B.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The following are example locations of motor points <b>54</b>A, <b>54</b>B, <b>55</b>A, and <b>55</b>B relative to the midline (x-axis), posterior symphysis <b>51</b> (y-axis), and depth (z-axis), where the depth is from the plane formed by the inferior border of symphysis <b>51</b> and anterior border of hyoid bone <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Motor points <b>54</b>A may be for the right genioglossus muscle and may be located at 13.48 mm+3.59 from the x-axis, 31.01 mm+6.96 from the y-axis, and 22.58 mm+3.74 from the z-axis.
