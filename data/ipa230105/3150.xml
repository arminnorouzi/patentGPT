Conventional exhaust gas aftertreatment systems include any of several different components to reduce the levels of harmful exhaust emissions present in exhaust gas. For example, certain exhaust gas aftertreatment systems for diesel-powered IC engines includes a SCR catalyst formulated to convert NO<sub>x </sub>(NO and NO<sub>2 </sub>in some fraction) into harmless nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) and water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O) in the presence of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, a reductant such as a diesel exhaust fluid (e.g., an aqueous urea solution) is inserted into the aftertreatment system as a source of ammonia. The reductant facilitates the decomposition of the constituents of the exhaust gas by the SCR catalyst. During use, the reductant may be deposited on the SCR catalyst. Over time, the reductant deposits can build up and lead to reduction in a SCR catalytic conversion efficiency (CE) of the SCR catalyst. The SCR catalyst is generally heated to remove reductant deposits. However, if the temperature is not high enough or the heating duration is not long enough, the reductant deposits may not be fully removed by heating. The unremoved deposits will harden over time and can become extremely difficult to remove. Therefore, to remove reductant deposits and regenerate the SCR catalyst, the SCR catalysts are typically heated to a set temperature of greater than 500 degrees Celsius to evaporate the reductant deposits formed on the SCR catalyst and/or other locations of the aftertreatment system. However, exposure to such high temperatures on a regular basis can lead to aging of SCR catalyst and reduction in the SCR catalyst's operational life.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments described herein relate generally to systems and methods for reactive regeneration of a SCR catalyst, and in particular, to systems and methods for regenerating SCR catalysts by initially using a lower temperature than that typically used for regenerating SCR catalysts, and using a higher temperatures when the lower temperature is not sufficient to remove reductant deposits from the SCR catalyst.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, a controller for controlling regeneration of a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst of an aftertreatment system, is configured to: cause increase in a SCR catalyst temperature of the SCR catalyst to a first regeneration temperature, the first regeneration temperature being lower than a high regeneration temperature that is equal to or greater than 500 degrees Celsius;

The first regeneration temperature may be in a range of about 300 degrees Celsius to about 400 degrees Celsius (e.g., 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, or 400 degrees Celsius, inclusive), and is significantly lower than a high regeneration temperature, for example, equal to or greater than 500 degrees Celsius (e.g., 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, or 600 degrees Celsius, inclusive) at which SCR catalysts are typically regenerated.

For example, a drop in the SCR catalytic CE to below 70% may indicate that a high ammonia slip is occurring indicating decomposition of reductant deposits in the SCR catalyst <b>150</b>, and/or an amount of reductant deposits is greater than the reductant deposit threshold. In some embodiments, the controller <b>170</b> may be configured to heat the SCR catalyst <b>150</b> to the first regeneration temperature or any other regeneration temperature by inserting hydrocarbons into the aftertreatment system <b>100</b>, as previously described herein.

The time interval threshold may be in a range of about 12 hours to about 24 hours. The controller <b>170</b> may be configured to cause the increase in the SCR catalyst temperature to the first regeneration temperature in response to the time interval being equal to or greater than the time interval threshold. For example, the controller <b>170</b> may wait till the time interval is equal to or greater than the time interval threshold before regeneration of the SCR catalyst <b>150</b> at the first regeneration temperature.

If the ammonia slip is greater than the ammonia slip threshold, the controller <b>170</b> is configured to maintain the SCR catalyst <b>150</b> at the first regeneration temperature for a first time period, for example, in a range of about 5 minutes to about 15 minutes (e.g., 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, or 15 minutes, inclusive, or in any range between these time periods). The amount of ammonia slip being greater than the ammonia slip threshold indicates that the first regeneration temperature is sufficient to decompose or evaporate reductant deposits on the SCR catalyst <b>150</b>, so that a higher temperature regeneration does not have to be performed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In response to the amount of ammonia slip being less than the ammonia slip threshold, the controller <b>170</b> is configured to increase the SCR catalyst temperature to a second regeneration temperature greater than the first regeneration temperature.

In certain embodiments, the controller <b>170</b> only performs this high regeneration temperature regeneration of the SCR catalyst <b>150</b> when regeneration at low temperatures is not successful.
