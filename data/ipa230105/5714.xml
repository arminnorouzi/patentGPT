As a result, a channel length of an MOS transistor formed in the active region has also decreased. When the channel length of the MOS transistor decreases, an operation performance of the transistor decreases due to a short channel effect. Accordingly, various studies have been conducted to maximize the performance of a device while reducing the size of the devices formed on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among them, a representative example is a fin-FET device having a fin structure. Such a fin-FET device may be formed by etching a substrate such as a wafer including a silicon (Si). In this case, a roughness of a substrate surface generated during an etching process may cause a deterioration in performance of the transistor. Accordingly, in general, a damage and the roughness of the substrate surface are improved through an annealing treatment that applying radicals to the substrate surface. As a method for healing such damage, an annealing method using a hydrogen plasma has been proposed. This method is known to heal such damage by injecting a hydrogen into the process chamber and forming a plasma, making silicon atoms on the surface of the channel movable by radical hydrogen. However, in order to actually apply this to plasma treating apparatuses, several problems such as particle generation need to be solved.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the related art, in order to solve the above-described particle generation problem, a step of nitrogen passivation on surfaces of insulation members at in inner circumference of a reaction chamber was performed as a pre-step of a hydrogen plasma annealing treatment. However, a conventional passivation method may resolve the problem of the particle generation within the chamber, but there is a problem of changing a nitrogen concentration in the substrate during the hydrogen plasma annealing treatment. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(A)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(B)</figref> illustrate a substrate treating apparatus for performing a substrate treating method according to the related art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(A)</figref> illustrates a process chamber after a passivation step, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(B)</figref> illustrates a process chamber after a hydrogen plasma annealing. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(A)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(B)</figref>, in a conventional passivation step, a passivation is performed using a strong plasma having a high nitrogen concentration. Accordingly, the nitrogen concentration remaining within a chamber or at an insulation member after the passivation step is high, and thus a nitrogen concentration deposited on the substrate in a hydrogen plasma annealing step is also high.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, as the nitrogen concentration in the substrate is changed, there is a problem that a growth of an oxide film is not constant in a subsequent process after an annealing.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the inventive concept provide a substrate treating apparatus and a substrate treating method for efficiently treating a substrate.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the inventive concept provide a substrate treating apparatus and a substrate treating method for effectively performing a surface treatment of a substrate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the inventive concept provide a substrate treating apparatus and a substrate treating method which protects insulation members provided at an apparatus, and minimizes a particle contamination of a substrate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the inventive concept provide a substrate treating apparatus and a substrate treating method for constantly maintaining a nitrogen concentration in a substrate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments of the inventive concept provide a substrate treating apparatus and a substrate treating method for growing a film having a predetermined thickness.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The technical objectives of the inventive concept are not limited to the above-mentioned ones, and the other unmentioned technical objects will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The inventive concept provides a substrate treating apparatus.
