A ferrous core is attached to the moving device and as the device moves, the core moves relative to an excitation coil and two sensing coils. An excitation signal is generated on one or both of the sensing coils depending upon the position of the core. When the core is aligned between the excitation coil and the first sensing coil, the excitation signal shows up on the first sensing coil and not the second sensing coil. When the core is aligned between the excitation coil and the second sensing coil, the excitation signal shows up on the second sensing coil and not the first. For intermediate positions of the core, the excitation signal shows up proportionately on the first and second sensing coils, such that the ratio of the signals detected on the two sensing coils correspond to the position of the core. Therefore, the signals on the sensing coils are measured to determine the position of the core, and thus the position of the object.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A disadvantage of using the LVDT/RVDT is that all three coils need to be connected, which requires the use of six cables. Depending upon where the LVDT/RVDT is installed in the system, the system may require long and/or large wire bundles that can experience significant levels of noise. Another disadvantage is that relative errors in the measurements of the two sensing coils (e.g., due to differences in precision of the two measuring circuits and/or averaging circuits) can lead to result inaccuracies. Also, since root mean square (RMS) values are typically used for voltage measurements, additional delay is incurred in the measurement process due to the filtering process of the RMS values. Aspects of the present disclosure are directed to addressing at least these disadvantages.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a partially schematic illustration of a representative rocket system configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a linear transformer system used to detect linear movement of an object in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a rotary transformer system used to detect rotational movement of an object in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a linear transformer system interconnected with circuits configured to determine the position of the core of the transformer, which correlates to the position of an object connected to the core, in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates example digital waveforms corresponding to the first and second digital signals used to determine the position of the object connected to the core of the linear transformer system in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>F</figref> illustrate different pseudo-loads that include first and second impedance loads that have different phase-shifting characteristics in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a voltage-current relationship that is measured across the sensing resistor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> as the core moves along its range of motion between the first and second sensing coils in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a graph of phase change vs. displacement of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a graph that shows the effect on phase-shift of changing the capacitance value of the capacitive element of a pseudo-load attached to the sensing coils of an LVDT/RVDT in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a graph that shows the effect on phase-shift of changing the resistance value of the resistive element of a pseudo-load attached to the sensing coils of an LVDT/RVDT in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a graph that shows the effect on phase-shift as transformer losses of an LVDT/RVDT increase in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a graph that shows the effect on phase-shift of changing the inductance value of an LVDT/RVDT in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a graph that shows the effect on phase-shift of changing the resistance value of the sensing resistor on the phase change in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the technology disclosed herein are directed generally to tracking the movement of objects such as fins and nozzles within a rocket system, and associated systems and methods. In particular, an LVDT and/or RVDT can include interconnected pseudo-loads that can cause phase-shifts in signals that are representative of the movement of the object. The phase-shift can be detected remotely from the LVDT/RVDT and the object being tracked. Fewer cables are needed to operate the LVDT/RVDT with the pseudo-loads, resulting to lower weight and space requirements in the rocket system.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a partially schematic illustration of a representative rocket system <b>100</b> configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology. The system <b>100</b> can include a vehicle <b>101</b> (e.g., a launch vehicle) having a single or a multi-stage configuration. In the representative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the vehicle <b>101</b> includes a first stage <b>102</b>, a second stage <b>103</b>, and a payload <b>104</b> (shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) surrounded by a fairing <b>105</b>. The first stage <b>102</b> and the second stage <b>103</b> operate as boosters to direct the payload <b>104</b> into space. The first stage <b>102</b> can include one or more fins <b>114</b> that can be angularly adjusted to provide stability, control, and/or direction to the vehicle <b>101</b> during flight. In other embodiments, the vehicle <b>101</b> can include a single booster, or more than two boosters. In any of these embodiments, at least one of the boosters (e.g., the first stage <b>102</b>) is configured to be returned to Earth in a tail-down configuration, and is then reused on a subsequent launch.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first stage <b>102</b> can include a propulsion system <b>110</b> that can in turn include one or more main engines <b>111</b> (positioned within the first stage <b>102</b>). Each main engine <b>111</b> can include a corresponding nozzle <b>112</b>. During launch, the main engines <b>111</b> provide the primary force directing the vehicle <b>101</b> upwardly. During a tail-down reentry, the thrust provided by the main engines <b>111</b> provides a braking force on the first stage <b>102</b> as it descends and lands in preparation for its next mission. In both cases, thrust is provided along a thrust axis TA, which can be adjusted to steer or maneuver the vehicle <b>101</b>. In some embodiments, an orientation of one or more of the nozzles <b>112</b> can be adjusted to steer, maneuver, and/or control the vehicle <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Rocket systems <b>100</b> of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> include numerous actuators to control elements of the propulsion system and flight control system, among others. Sensors, including LVDTs and/or RVDTs, are often used to detect the motion of movable system components, e.g., to confirm that the actual motion matches the commanded motion. Standard LVDTs and/or RVDTs require six cables, which can result in large wire bundles that can run for a significant distance from the LVDT/RVDT to the control circuitry that commands and controls the movable object. This increases space requirements, cost, and potentially, time to troubleshoot a problem. Also, the standard LVDT/RVDT determines the position of an object by calculating an RMS value, resulting in a time delay. This can be a disadvantage in critical systems that rely on precise measurements and positioning within a very small time window.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As discussed further below, adjustments to the nozzles <b>112</b>, fins <b>114</b>, and/or other linearly and/or rotationally movable objects within the rocket system <b>100</b> can be controlled, facilitated and/or oriented by one or more linear transformer system and/or rotary transformer system. The linear and/or rotary transformers systems can be used in many other applications, including those that require long wire bundles, experience extreme heat and/or pressure conditions, and/or conditions that produce high levels of vibration. Other applications include those that may have limited space for cabling, as well as systems that can benefit from a faster determination of the position of the movable object.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a linear transformer system <b>200</b> used to detect linear movement of an object <b>212</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.
