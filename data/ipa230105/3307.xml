A valve assembly is typically composed of one or more inlets and outlets, and includes a control element or member (e.g., a valve gate, a piston, a cage, a valve plug, a control member, etc.) that operates to control fluid flow through apertures that fluidly couple the inlet(s) to the outlet(s). A control member is typically coupled to a valve bonnet that is mechanically coupled (e.g., bolted, clamped, threaded into, etc.) to the valve body. Typically, the control member is configured to engage a sealing structure (e.g., a valve seat) that encompasses a flow path through the valve.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When portions of a valve assembly are coupled together, for example a valve body to a bonnet, a valve body portion to another valve body portion, etc., various seals, such as O-rings or gaskets, are required to prevent fluid flow between the coupled portions. This can require a number of seals, for example, in a typical valve, a seal may be required between a valve body and a cage, between a bonnet and the cage, and between the valve body and the bonnet, which can increase the cost of the valve assembly and make assembly and maintenance more difficult. In addition, the gaskets or O-rings typically used in valve assemblies are soft parts that could wear, break down, and leak when exposed to high temperatures or thermal transients.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with one exemplary aspect of the present invention, a valve assembly comprises a first body portion, a second body portion secured to the first body portion, and a cage positioned between the first body portion and the second body portion.

Integrating the seal with the cage combines the trim access joint seal and the internal trim seal in one joint, reduces the number of parts in the assembly, and reduces the number of seals need in the valve assembly. In addition, the integrated seal in the cage does not require any gaskets, O-rings, or other soft parts and is robust under high temperatures and thermal transients. Compression of the cage between the body portions causes metal-to-metal contact between the cage and the body portions when the body portions are secured, which creates the seal. The cage can also include a valve seat, which can be integral and unitary with the cage, which would further reduce the number of parts in the assembly.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, an example valve assembly <b>10</b> is shown that generally includes a first body portion <b>100</b>, a second body portion <b>200</b> secured to first body portion <b>100</b>, a cage <b>300</b> positioned between first body portion <b>100</b> and second body portion <b>200</b>, and a valve plug <b>400</b> positioned in and guided by cage <b>300</b>. In the example shown, first body portion <b>100</b> is a valve body having an inlet <b>105</b>, an outlet <b>110</b>, and a passage <b>115</b> between inlet <b>105</b> and outlet <b>110</b> and second body portion <b>200</b> is a bonnet. However, first and second body portions <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> can be any portions of the particular valve, such as two body portions, bonnets, blind flanges, etc.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, cage <b>300</b> includes a generally cylindrical body <b>305</b>, a bore <b>310</b> formed longitudinally through body <b>305</b>, a top surface <b>315</b>, an opposing bottom surface <b>320</b>, an exterior surface <b>325</b>, and an opposing interior surface <b>330</b>. In the example shown, body <b>305</b> is an integral, unitary, one-piece body and has an integral, unitary annular flange <b>335</b> that extends from exterior surface <b>325</b> and around the perimeter of cage <b>300</b>. Annular flange <b>335</b> has a first surface <b>340</b> that is configured to engage first body portion <b>100</b> to form a seal between cage <b>300</b> and first body portion <b>100</b> and a second surface <b>350</b> that is configured to engage second body portion <b>200</b> and form a seal between cage <b>300</b> and second body portion <b>200</b>. The seals formed between annular flange <b>335</b> of cage <b>300</b> and first body portion <b>100</b> and annular flange <b>335</b> and second body portion <b>200</b> eliminates the need for additional seals, such as gaskets or O-rings, between these parts. The attachment of first body portion <b>100</b> to second body portion <b>200</b>, with bolts <b>405</b> and nuts <b>410</b> or any other suitable attachment means, compresses annular flange <b>335</b> of cage <b>300</b> between first and second body portions <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and the compression causes metal-to-metal contact between annular flange <b>335</b> and first and second body portions <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, creating a seal. To improve the compression of annular flange <b>335</b> between first and second body portions <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and improve the seal, cage <b>300</b> can be made of a first material and first and second body portions <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> can be made of a second material that is harder than the first material of cage <b>300</b>, which could allow annular flange to slightly deform and more closely follow the corresponding surfaces or edges of first and second body portions <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. In addition, during installation or maintenance, a machining operation can be performed on the metal-to-metal contact surfaces to ensure a tight seal. Because the joints between cage <b>300</b> and first and second body portions <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> are circular, the orientation of the first body portion <b>100</b> to the second body portion <b>200</b> does not influence the ability to create the seal.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>A</figref>, annular flange <b>335</b> can be generally triangular with first surface <b>340</b> extending at a first angle <b>345</b> that is non-perpendicular to exterior surface <b>325</b> of cage <b>300</b> and second surface <b>350</b> extending at a second angle <b>355</b> that is non-perpendicular to exterior surface <b>325</b>. To form the seal between cage <b>300</b> and first and second body portions <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, first surface <b>340</b> engages a beveled edge <b>120</b> of first body portion <b>100</b> and second surface <b>350</b> engages a beveled edge <b>205</b> of second body portion <b>200</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, annular flange <b>335</b> can be generally rectangular with first and second surfaces <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> extending perpendicular to exterior surface <b>325</b> of cage <b>300</b> and engaging parallel edges <b>130</b>, <b>215</b> of first and second body portions <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. While first and second surfaces <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> are shown to be generally planar in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-B</figref>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, first and second surfaces <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> can also be arcuate and engage an arcuate edges <b>125</b>, <b>210</b> of first and second body portions <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Rather than sealing against both first and second body portions <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, annular flange <b>335</b> could also have first surface <b>240</b> configured to engage first body portion <b>100</b> to form a seal between cage <b>300</b> and first body portion <b>100</b> and second body portion <b>200</b> can engage top surface <b>315</b> of cage <b>300</b> to urge cage <b>300</b> toward first body portion <b>100</b> and create the seal between cage <b>300</b> and first body portion <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, first surface <b>340</b> extends non-perpendicular from exterior surface <b>325</b> and engages beveled edge <b>120</b> of first body portion <b>100</b>. However, first surface <b>340</b> in this example can also extend perpendicular to exterior surface <b>325</b> and engage a parallel edge <b>130</b> of first body portion <b>100</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) or can be arcuate and engage an arcuate edge <b>125</b> of first body portion <b>100</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). In addition, annular flange <b>335</b> does not necessarily have to be integral and unitary with cage <b>300</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>. Rather, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, annular flange <b>335</b> can be a separate part that is attached to cage <b>300</b>, for example, by threading annular flange <b>335</b> onto cage <b>300</b>, which can be done with any of the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref>. Having a separate annular flange <b>335</b> that is attached to cage <b>300</b> can make maintenance easier if the seal is damaged by removing the cage from the valve, removing the flange from the cage, and replacing only the flange with a new flange.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b></figref>, cage <b>300</b> can also include a valve seat <b>365</b>, which extends from interior surface <b>330</b> of cage <b>300</b> and is configured to engage valve plug <b>400</b> with valve plug <b>400</b> in a closed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In the example shown, valve seat <b>365</b> is an integral, unitary part of cage <b>300</b>. However, valve seat <b>365</b> could also be a separate part that is attached to body <b>305</b> of cage <b>300</b> in any appropriate manner, such as by threading the valve seat to body <b>305</b>.
