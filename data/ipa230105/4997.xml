A transferable demand analysis predicts how much demand transfers between products in assortments. The assortment planner may then calculate, using the transferable demand, whether sales will increase or decrease when an item is added to or removed from an assortment. Using this, and other criteria, the assortment planner may determine what products should be included in new product assortments. The process to analyze demand transferability, however, is generally difficult since one needs to easily visualize the similarity that exists between products in the assortments, which is not provided by existing solutions. The inability to easily visualize and analyze product similarity and demand transferability for product assortments is undesirable.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A more complete understanding of the present invention may be derived by referring to the detailed description when considered in connection with the following illustrative figures.

Unless specifically noted, it is intended that the words and phrases in the specification and the claims be given their plain, ordinary, and accustomed meaning to those of ordinary skill in the applicable arts.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the following description, and for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various aspects of the invention. It will be understood, however, by those skilled in the relevant arts, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, known structures and devices are shown or discussed more generally in order to avoid obscuring the invention. In many cases, a description of the operation is sufficient to enable one to implement the various forms of the invention, particularly when the operation is to be implemented in software. It should be noted that there are many different and alternative configurations, devices and technologies to which the disclosed inventions may be applied. The full scope of the inventions is not limited to the examples that are described below.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As described more fully below, aspects of the following disclosure relate to interactive visualization of similarity and transferable demand associated with product assortment planning in retailers. In the retail industry, a product, such as clothing, may be defined by one or more attributes, including, for example, color, material, design, pattern, length or the like. Each attribute may have a different attribute value. These attribute values include, for example, red, blue, green (for color), silk, cotton, polyester (for material), fashion, basic, classic (for design), striped, floral, plaid (for pattern), long, short, high, (for length), and other like attributes and attribute values, according to particular needs. These attribute values also determine, at least in part, customer preferences, individually and as customer segments defined by similar customer shopping behavior, preferences for purchasing items with particular attribute values, or a combination of both. One goal of assortment planning is to choose an assortment of products to sell during a planning period that matches predicted customer preferences during the planning period. As an example, this may include, for a clothing retailer, choosing an assortment of different clothing products that will match the style, colors, season, and trends predicted to be favored by customers during a planning period. Although assortment planning, attributes and attribute values are described in connection with a clothing retailer, embodiments contemplate assortment planning with attributes and attribute values of any retailer, including, for example, fashion retailers, grocery retailers, parts retailers, and the like.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Summarizing assortment data may be done using a tabular format, with rows or columns corresponding to products and attribute values. Using tabular data for assortment planning is problematic because tabular data does not show the overall similarity of the assortment or how products affect the sales of other products (i.e. the transferability of demand), which gives insight to how the exclusivity percentage for one or more products in an assortment is determined. For example, if a retailer has a little black dress that is a top seller but only carries similar little black dresses in all of their stores, the retailer will lose a lot of sales because the products (the black dresses) are so similar that consumers will not purchase very many of them. Additionally, with data displayed in a tabular format, insights and intuition are dulled by excess information. The tabular format makes it difficult to assess the diversity of an assortment this way, and to determine whether a product assortment is over-assorted, under-assorted, missing in exclusive products, and the like.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of the following disclosure detail systems and methods of interactively visualizing and selecting assortment products based, at least in part, on similarity and transferable demand. According to a first approach of similarity and transferable demand interactive visualization, embodiments disclose a similarity method that computes the similarity between products and reduces the dimensionality in a set of coordinates based on the attributes that the products share in common. This approach uses a similarity function to construct a similarity matrix of the products in the assortment representing how similar each product is compared with another product. The similarity matrix is used as the basis for computing the coordinates for each product in an n-dimensional space. This approach aims at visually representing the overall inter-product similarities in an assortment by generating an interactive two-dimensional assortment visualization.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a second approach of similarity and transferable demand interactive visualization, embodiments disclose a visualization method that determines products which share a similar status in terms of their performance as well as in terms of their exclusivity. This allows assortment planning decisions to account for both individual product performance and influences a product has on other products' performances.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates exemplary supply chain network <b>100</b> according to a first embodiment.

As explained in more detail below, similarity module <b>202</b> generates similarity matrix <b>400</b> comprising the similarity of product attribute values between various products.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">At action <b>306</b>, assortment planner <b>110</b> performs a dimensionality reduction method on the similarity matrix <b>400</b>. As explained in more detail below, similarity module <b>202</b> reduces similarity matrix <b>400</b> from an n&#xd7;n matrix to an n&#xd7;2 or n&#xd7;3 matrix. At action <b>308</b>, assortment planner <b>110</b> generates n-dimensional coordinates based, at least in part, on the reduced matrix.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">At action <b>310</b>, assortment planner <b>110</b> generates a two-dimensional visualization of product similarity. As explained in more detail below, similarity module <b>202</b> displays a two-dimensional visualization, which may also comprise a user interface for selecting products in a product assortment. Although the visualization is described as a two-dimensional visualization, embodiments contemplate a three-dimensional visualization, such as, for example, displayed on a virtual or augmented reality headset or a display (such as, for example, a monitor, projector, or the like) capable of displaying three-dimensional images.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">To further describe method <b>300</b> of generating an interactive n-dimensional assortment visualization based on product similarity, an example is now given. In the following example, and after receiving product data, similarity module <b>202</b> generates a similarity matrix by computing the similarity between different products. That is, the similarity module uses a similarity function to construct a square symmetric similarity matrix of all of the products in the assortment based on the attribute values of the products and which provides data representing how similar each product is compared with another product. The square symmetric similarity matrix summarizes the similarity between every possible pair of products and as discussed below in more detail, is used as the basis for n-dimensional mapping.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary similarity matrix <b>400</b>, according to an embodiment. According to embodiments, similarity matrix <b>400</b> comprises an x-axis that lists a set of products plotted against a y-axis, comprising an identical set of products. Each intersection of a product from the x-axis with a product on the y-axis indicates the similarity between those two products, as defined by a similarity function. According to an embodiment, the similarity function quantifies the similarity between products, based on a comparison of their respective attribute values.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to a first embodiment, the similarity function comprises the percentage of attributes that share the same attribute values between two products. As a simple example only and not by way of limitation, if a first product is a blue dress and a second product is a red dress and the products are assumed to have only two attributes (type, and color), then the similarity calculated by this similarity function is 50%, because both products have the same value for the attribute (dress), but both products have a different value for the &#x201c;color&#x201d; attribute (red vs. blue).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As another example only and not by way of limitation, similarity matrix <b>400</b> indicates that the similarity between a first product (Product 0) and a second product (Product 1) is 76%, which indicates a difference between some attribute values between the two products. Because each product is represented on both the x-axis and the y-axis, the similarity of each product is also compared with itself. For example, the similarity between a first product (Product 0) on the x-axis and itself (Product 0) on the y-axis is 100%, which would be expected because this indicates the similarity between a product and itself. Other percentages of similarity between the remaining products are equal to the percentages indicated in similarity matrix <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to further embodiments, the similarity function may comprise the number of identical attribute values between two products, weighted by the importance of each attribute. According to another embodiment, the similarity function comprises a cosine distance.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Once the similarity between the products are quantified, similarity module <b>202</b> maps similarity matrix <b>400</b> onto an n-dimensional visualization by reducing the dimensionality in the set of vectors using a dimensionality reduction method to visualize the product assortment similarity. In addition, or as an alternative, similarity module <b>202</b> uses the dimensionality reduction method to produce the visualization from a set of products in an assortment that has similarity i.e., a set of products that share or do not share some attribute values.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary two-dimensional visualization <b>500</b>, according to an embodiment. Two-dimensional visualization <b>500</b> comprises various bubbles <b>502</b> that each represent a product in an assortment. As described in more detail below, the location on two-dimensional visualization <b>500</b> where bubbles <b>502</b> are displayed indicate the similarity of the products represented by bubbles <b>502</b>. Two-dimensional visualization <b>500</b> comprises an x-axis and a y-axis. The (x,y) coordinate of a given bubble <b>502</b> relative to any other bubble <b>502</b> indicates the similarity or exclusivity of the products represented by bubbles <b>502</b> in the product assortment. Products which have mostly similar attribute values are represented by bubbles <b>502</b> that are positioned closely together. Similar products may, for example, be represented by patterns of bubbles <b>502</b> clustered closely together, such as, for example, the closely clustered products in area <b>504</b>. Products which have less similar attribute values are represented by bubbles <b>502</b> that are positioned further from each other. Less similar products may, for example, be represented by patterns of bubbles <b>502</b> clustered further apart, such as, for example, the distantly clustered products in area <b>506</b>. The more distantly any of bubbles <b>502</b> are positioned from each other on two-dimensional visualization <b>500</b>, the more different the attribute values of the products represented by bubbles <b>502</b> are. Although a particular two-dimensional visualization <b>500</b> is shown and described, embodiments contemplate a three-dimensional visualization, four-dimensional visualization, or any n-dimensional visualization, according to particular needs.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As discussed above, similarity module <b>202</b> determines the (x, y) coordinates from similarity matrix <b>400</b> computed with the similarity function between all pairs of products. This is obtained by the consistent description of products by means of distinct attributes and respective possible attribute values. In one embodiment, similarity module <b>202</b> computes the similarity between two products by averaging the result of an attribute-wise comparison. Transforming the similarity matrix into (x, y) coordinates corresponds to performing dimensionality reduction on a set of vectors whose components share the same meaning.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one embodiment, similarity module <b>202</b> uses a principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm as the dimensionality reduction method to determine the product assortment similarity. This method reduces the dimensionality of similarity matrix <b>400</b> while preserving as much variance as possible in the data. In addition, similarity module <b>202</b> transforms the square n&#xd7;n matrix into a n&#xd7;2 matrix, using the two remaining components as (x, y) coordinates. This method provides for clustering similar products together, as well as, spreading dissimilar products apart.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary view of two-dimensional visualization <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, according to a further embodiment. As shown above, two-dimensional visualization <b>500</b> comprises a mouse-over of a bubble, representing a particular product illustrating a linking of other products that share similar attribute values. In addition, and as discussed in more detail below, additional information can be added to the dimensional visualization, such as, for example size and color of the bubbles representing products, which also may be used to represent past sales, exclusivity of a product, and the like. For example, as described below, user selection of a product generates a popup box with additional information or connectors which indicate its most similar neighbors. Additionally, or in the alternative, a size of the projected bubbles <b>502</b> may graphically indicate uniqueness, and a color of bubbles <b>502</b> may be used to indicate past sales performance, as described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to embodiments, and as will be explained in more detail below, visualization module <b>204</b> of assortment planner <b>110</b> displays products which share a similar status in terms of their performance as well as in terms of their exclusivity.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary interactive two-dimensional visualization <b>700</b> according to an embodiment. Visualization module <b>204</b> of assortment planner <b>110</b> provides an interactive two-dimensional visualization <b>700</b> that represents various assortment scenarios. As discussed above, each bubble <b>502</b> in two-dimensional visualization <b>500</b> represents a product in an assortment. However, according to embodiments, interactive two-dimensional visualization <b>700</b> comprises size-variable and color-coded bubbles <b>702</b>-<b>708</b>. Here, a size of bubbles <b>702</b>-<b>708</b> represents the uniqueness of the product based on the amount of demand that is exclusive to the product. For example, a larger bubble may represent a more exclusive product, and a smaller bubble may represent a less exclusive product. Bubbles <b>702</b>-<b>708</b> may comprise one or more intermediate sizes that represent exclusivity intermediate between the larger bubbles and the smaller bubbles. In other words, according to some embodiments, the larger a bubble is displayed on interactive two-dimensional visualization <b>700</b>, the more exclusive the product represented by the bubble is, and the smaller a bubble is displayed on interactive two-dimensional visualization <b>700</b>, the less exclusive the product represented by the bubble is.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, a color of bubbles <b>702</b>-<b>708</b> may represent the performance or predictive performance of the product represented by the bubble <b>702</b>-<b>708</b>. Performance or predictive performance may be based, at least in part, on, for example, historical or predicted sales performance. In this manner, bubbles <b>702</b>-<b>708</b> visually represent the exclusivity of the product, while simultaneously visually representing the performance of the product.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">To further explain bubbles <b>702</b>-<b>708</b>, several examples are now given. According to embodiments, products represented by small green bubbles <b>702</b> may have good performance (based on, for example, historical sales data) and may be highly similar to a lot of other products in the assortment, i.e. not unique top performers. That is, small green bubbles <b>702</b> may represent well-selling products that have many substitutable products. According to embodiments, when some products represented by small green bubbles <b>702</b> are removed from the assortment, global sales will remain largely unchanged, but may slightly decrease based, at least in part, on one or more good performers being removed from the assortment.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, products represented by big green bubbles <b>704</b> may have good performance and may be highly unique in the assortment, i.e. unique top performers. That is, big green bubbles <b>704</b> may represent well-selling products, which are unique. When top performers are too unique, there may be a larger risk for that product to satisfy all the demand for the attribute values of that product. According to embodiments, when additional products with similar attribute values to the products represented by big green bubbles <b>704</b> are added to the assortment, overall sales may increase, because customers have different options for a set of attribute values associated with these products.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, products represented by small red bubbles <b>706</b> may have bad performance and may be highly similar to other products in the assortment, i.e. not unique bad performers. That is, small red bubbles <b>706</b> may represent products that are not performing well and are not unique. According to embodiments, when products represented by small red bubbles <b>706</b> are removed from the assortment, sales may not be impacted much because, in this case, every customer in the store would likely find substitutable products.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Finally, products represented by big red bubbles <b>708</b> may have bad performance, and few similar products in the assortment, i.e. unique bad performers. That is, big red bubbles <b>708</b> may represent products that are not performing well, but which are highly unique. According to embodiments, removing products represented by big red bubbles <b>708</b> from the assortment may impact the global sales since only a few substitutable products exist for these products, which in turn, means that sales to customers, will likely be lost.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although particular representations of bubbles <b>702</b>-<b>708</b> are shown and described as particular colors and sizes, embodiments contemplate any particular size or color, representing any particular characteristics, according to particular needs. For example, according to some embodiments, bubbles may comprise a medium-sized bubble that indicates an amount of substitutability that is within a preselected or medium-amount of substitutability.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary view of interactive two-dimensional visualization <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, according to an embodiment. Visualization module <b>202</b> of assortment planner <b>110</b> provides a more in-depth analysis by providing a visualization of transferable demand links <b>802</b> associated with products in an assortment. For example, embodiments contemplate an ability to look at the planning problem in different ways by navigating through transferable demand links <b>802</b> to identify similar products for each product as well as overlaying information in overlay <b>804</b>. Overlay <b>804</b> may display information, such as, for example, the amount of exclusive sales that a product has as well as its historical sales performance.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The combination of different insights on a product's performance and uniqueness, provides visibility in making insightful decisions on which products to keep or remove from a product assortment. That is, interactive two-dimensional visualization <b>700</b> identifies products which are similar in the way they should be dealt with when choosing if they should be kept or removed. According to embodiments, interactive two-dimensional visualization <b>700</b> provides an interface to add or remove products from a product assortment.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary method <b>900</b> of generating a product assortment using interactive two-dimensional visualization <b>700</b>, according to an embodiment.

Although the examples are illustrated with icons comprising bubbles <b>702</b>-<b>708</b>, embodiments contemplate any suitable icon according to particular needs. As explained above, products from an assortment are graphed onto the interactive two-dimensional visualization <b>700</b> according to similarity to provide an interface to select, add, and remove products from the product assortment, where products that are closer together are more similar, and products further away are less similar.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">At action <b>904</b>, visualization module <b>204</b> modifies icons to indicate secondary information, such as, for example, sales, uniqueness, and the like. For example, as described above, a size of the projected bubbles <b>502</b> may graphically indicate uniqueness, and a color of bubbles <b>502</b> may be used to indicate past sales performance. Although size and color are used to indicate uniqueness and past sales performance, embodiments contemplate any modification of icons to represent additional information according to particular needs.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">At action <b>906</b>, visualization module <b>204</b> identifies user selection of an icon, and, in response to the user selection, automatically generates transferable demand links <b>802</b> connecting the selected icon and all icons representing products which are similar to the product represented by the selected icon. For example, transferable demand indicates the predicted change in sales based on adding or removing an item from the product assortment. According to embodiments, transferable demand links represent transferable demand that meet a preselected threshold, such as, for example, greater than 40%, 50%, or any other preselected value.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">At action <b>908</b>, based on the connections between the selected product and all similar products, a user may choose to add a new product to the product assortment or remove a current product from the product assortment. For example, according to embodiments, assortment planner <b>110</b> may remove from the assortment one or more products represented by small red bubbles which indicate products that do not bring additional sales to the assortment. Further, assortment planner <b>110</b> may add products similar to the products represented by big green bubbles to diminish the exclusivity of these products (and which may result in visualization module <b>204</b> automatically recalculating and reducing the size of these bubbles). Additionally, assortment planner <b>110</b> remove products which have transferable demand links to one or more key products to reduce or eliminate substitutable options. According to embodiments, assortment planner <b>110</b> may test different assortments, including automatically testing different assortments.

Based on the displayed bubbles <b>702</b>-<b>708</b>, transferable demand links <b>802</b>, and/or overlay <b>804</b>, a user may choose to add or remove a product from the product assortment. For example, as discussed above, small red bubble <b>706</b> represents products that are not performing well and are not unique. These products ordinarily may be removed from an assortment without likely affecting global sales. As shown below, attribute values of products linked to the exemplary product represented by small red bubble <b>706</b> share similar attribute values and, therefore, removing this product should not affect future sales.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Assuming that a user removes the product represented by the small red bubble <b>706</b> (here, a shoe), visualization module <b>204</b> identifies the modified product assortment and, in response, recomputes the size of the bubbles for the one or more products in the assortment. For example, the size of bubble <b>706</b> may grow larger when a substitutable product is removed. However, in response to the removal of the substitutable product, assortment planner <b>110</b> may remove one or more additional removals of products from the assortment (or additions of different products to the assortment) to further modify the assortment. These modifications may be based, at least in part, on the changing size and colors of the one or more bubbles. In response to a finalized product assortment, assortment purchase planner <b>210</b> initiates a supply chain process, as described above, to alter inventory at one or more supply chain entities in reflect the new product assortment.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Additionally, or in the alterative, embodiments of interactive two-dimensional visualization <b>700</b> having transferable demand links <b>802</b> provides an interface to change the values of one or more attributes associated with a product in the assortment.
