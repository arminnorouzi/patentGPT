The liquid is typically water or water-based. The machine may be configured to prepare the beverage by passing the liquid through an ingredient of the beverage to be prepared, such as at least one of coffee, tea, cacao, milk, sugar and/or soup ingredient. The ingredient may be supplied within a capsule into the machine. For instance, the liquid is mixed with the ingredient contained in the capsule by centrifuging the capsule while the liquid is passed through the capsule.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">For the purpose of the present description, a &#x201c;beverage&#x201d; is meant to include any human-consumable liquid substance, such as tea, coffee, chocolate, milk, soup, baby food, etc. . . . . A &#x201c;capsule&#x201d; is meant to include any container such as a packaging for containing a pre-portioned beverage ingredient, e.g. a flavouring ingredient, the packaging forming an enclosure of any material, in particular an airtight or pervious material, porous or non-porous material, e.g. plastic, aluminium, recyclable and/or biodegradable packagings, and of any shape and structure, including soft pods or rigid cartridges for containing the ingredient.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain beverage preparation machines use capsules containing ingredients to be extracted or to be dissolved and/or ingredients that are stored and dosed automatically in the machine or else are added at the time of preparation of the drink. Some beverage machines possess filling means that include a pump for liquid, usually water, which pumps the liquid from a source of water that is cold or indeed heated through heating means, e.g. a thermoblock or the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various outside machine configurations have been proposed to handle the machine, as for instance disclosed in WO 2009/074553, WO 2010/003932, WO 2010/015427, WO 2010/037806, WO 2011/144720, WO 2012/055765, WO 2012/093107, WO 2012/126971, WO 2013/037781, WO 2013/037782, WO 2013/037783, WO 2013/127906, WO 2015/140091, WO 2016/083484, WO 2016/156364, WO 2016/156372, WO 2017/037215 and WO 2018/219985.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Especially in the field of coffee preparation, machines have been widely developed in which a capsule containing beverage ingredients is inserted in a brewing device. The brewing device is closed about the capsule, water is injected, the beverage is produced in the closed volume of the capsule and a brewed beverage can be drained from the capsule and collected into a receptacle such as a cup or glass.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Heat management in such systems is known from EP 2393404 A1, WO 2010/089329 and in WO 2014/090850. It is also known to interrupt or reduce the powering of the thermal conditioner of a beverage machine to reduce the powering consumption of the machine when not in the process of delivering a beverage, e.g. as disclosed in WO 2011/020779 and WO 2012/007260, or to interrupt or reduce the powering of the thermal conditioner to stop or reduce the thermal conditioning of beverage ingredients in the preparation of the beverage, e.g. as disclosed in EP19181432.6. It is possible to bypass a thermal conditioner to process thermally unconditioned water for a desired beverage preparation, e.g. as disclosed in WO 2018/158179. It is also known to drive, e.g. using a pump, water through such systems, for instance as disclosed in WO 2004/014205, WO 2006/005425, WO 2009/024500, WO 2009/150030, WO 2010/108700, WO 2011/107574 and WO 2018/001750.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The preparation of a beverage by using centrifugation is known. Such beverage preparation includes: providing a beverage (flavoring) ingredient, e.g. as powder and/or leaves, in a capsule; circulating liquid into the capsule and rotating the capsule at sufficient speed to ensure interaction of the liquid with the ingredient while creating a gradient of pressure of liquid in the capsule. Such pressure increases gradually from the center towards the periphery of the capsule. As liquid passes through the ingredient, e.g. coffee bed, extraction of the ingredient, e.g. coffee compounds, takes place and a liquid extract is obtained that flows out at the periphery of the capsule. Examples of such systems are disclosed in WO 2008/148601, WO 2013/007776, WO 2013/007779, WO 2013/007780, WO 2013/007781, WO 2015/173123, WO 2017/202746 and WO 2017/046294.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention relates to a machine for preparing a beverage from at least one ingredient. Normally such beverage is then dispensed to a user, e.g. to a user-cup or user-mug.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The machine is arranged for preparing a beverage from a flavouring ingredient, e.g. coffee or tea or chocolate or cacao or milk or soup, by mixing water with the flavouring ingredient, e.g. by centrifugally driving such flavouring ingredient with water.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For instance, the machine incorporates features disclosed in WO 2008/148604, WO 2009/106598, WO 2014/096122, WO 2010/026053 or WO 2014/096123.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The beverage preparation typically includes the mixing of a plurality of beverage ingredients, e.g. water and milk powder, and/or the infusion of a beverage ingredient, such as an infusion of ground coffee or tea with water. For instance, a predetermined amount of beverage is formed and dispensed on user-request, which corresponds to a serving. The volume of such a serving may be in the range of 15 to 1000 ml such as 25 to 600 ml for instance 40 to 250 ml, e.g. the volume for filling a cup or mug, depending on the type of beverage. Formed and dispensed beverages may be selected from cold and warm beverages, for example from cold brewed tea or coffee, or warm/hot brewed tea or coffee, e.g. ristrettos, espressos, lungos, cappuccinos, caf&#xe9; latte, americano coffees, teas, etc . . . . For example, a coffee machine may be configured for dispensing coffee, e.g. an adjustable volume of 20 to 60 ml per serving, and/or for dispensing lungos, e.g. a volume in the range of 70 to 200 ml per serving, and/or for dispensing americanos, e.g. a volume in the range of 150 to 750 ml.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The machine includes a beverage processing unit formed of a first processing unit member and a second processing unit member that delimit a chamber and that are movable between a distant configuration in which the flavouring ingredient is received in the chamber and a proximate configuration in which the flavouring ingredient is held and mixed with the water in the chamber during beverage preparation. For instance, the flavouring ingredient can be supplied into the chamber within a capsule, e.g. with a capsule flange.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Typically, the chamber is provided or associated with an inlet arrangement and/or an outlet arrangement. Examples of inlet arrangements are disclosed in WO 2010/063644. Examples of outlet arrangements are disclosed in WO 2009/106175, WO 2012/100836, WO 2013/020939 and WO 2017/068134.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The beverage processing unit, typically of the centrifugal type, may incorporate features disclosed in EP 2 000 062, EP 2 155 020, EP 2 152 128, WO 2008/148646, WO 2009/106175, WO 2010/026045, WO 2010/063644, WO 2010/066705 and WO 2010/066736.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The beverage processing unit (when using ingredient capsules) may be fitted with an arrangement for opening the capsule, e.g. as disclosed in WO 2008/148656, WO 2010/026045 and WO 2010/066736.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The beverage processing unit members may be secured together in their proximate position by a corresponding arrangement, e.g. as disclosed in WO 2012/007293 and WO 2014/102048.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The capsule may have a body containing an ingredient and a peripherally projecting flange. The capsule may be of the type described above under the header &#x201c;field of the invention&#x201d;. The capsule may be a capsule that has a container-body, e.g. a generally cup-shaped or hemispherical or hemi-ellipsoidal body, having a flange to which a cover lid is attached, in particular sealed. Typically, the capsule contains a beverage ingredient.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The capsule may have a or the above body that is symmetric or asymmetric, conical or frusto-conical, pyramidal or frusto-pyramidal, cylindrical or prismatic, spherical or hemispherical or frusto-spherical, domical or frusto-domical, containing the ingredient.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The capsules (when the machine is intended to be operated with capsules, e.g. capsules of different sizes) may incorporate the features disclosed in WO 2008/148650, WO 2008/148834 and WO 2011/023711.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An automatic capsule recognition system, for instance an arrangement configured to read an identification device, e.g. a code, borne by the capsule such as a bar code e.g. a rotationally readable bar code, may be used to parameterize and adjust the processing of the flavouring ingredient contained in the above mentioned capsule automatically in line with the type of ingredient, e.g. a profile of an extraction flow (e.g. speed and/or pressure) and/or extraction temperature. Examples of such technologies and associated features are disclosed in WO2011/141532, WO2011/141535, WO 2012/010470, WO 2013/072239, WO 2013/072297, WO 2013/072326, WO 2013/072351 and WO 2015/044400.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The machine has a water source for delivering the water towards the beverage processing unit, such as a connector to be connected to a water supply line external to such machine and/or a water supply tank that has an outside opening for water filling with a water source external to such machine.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The machine can have a control device, such as a control device comprising a controller and/or processor, configured to control the delivery of water to the processing unit. Other functions may be controlled by the control device, e.g. automatic ingredient detection and/or sensing and/or capsule recognition system, water availability at the water source, etc . . . .</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The control device may be associated with a selection arrangement, e.g. a selection arrangement comprising a user-interface and/or a flavouring ingredient sensor and/or capsule recognition system, for selecting one of several available beverage preparation modes. Examples of user-interfaces are disclosed in WO 2015/096998.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The selection arrangement may be configured to initiate and/or stop a beverage preparation and/or to select a particular volume of water of a plurality of selectable available volumes to be supplied to the beverage processing unit's chamber for preparing a correspondingly resulting particular volume of the beverage and/or, when the machine is configured accordingly, to select a centrifugal speed profile of the chamber during beverage preparation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The machine includes a water guide for guiding the water between the water source and the chamber. The water guide may be free of a water pump or may comprise a water pump, such as a gear or a peristaltic or a piston, e.g. solenoid, or a diaphragm pump.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The machine has a valve arrangement for controlling, such as interrupting or allowing, a flow of water along the water guide; an actuator typically an electric actuator, such as a motor e.g. an electric motor, for actuating the valve arrangement to control the water flow along the water guide; and a support structure, such as a frame, which has a base that is stationary during beverage preparation and that supports at least the valve arrangement.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The water guide and the valve arrangement are arranged such as to fluidically connect the water source and the beverage processing unit and to control the flow of the water from the water source into the chamber.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The water supply tank, when present, may have: a resilient valve with a biased gate that is opened by actuation by a part of the base, e.g. forming a tank seat, and/or by a fluid connector of the water guide; and/or an arrangement for mechanical and/or magnetic user-reversible assembly to the base, e.g. forming a tank seat.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first processing unit member can delimit a water inlet of the chamber or delimit a beverage outlet out of the chamber or delimit both such inlet and outlet. The inlet may form an extremity of the water guide. The inlet and/or outlet can be formed by and/or associated with one or more corresponding piercing elements for piercing the above mentioned capsule.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The valve arrangement is directly or indirectly rotatably mounted to the support structure and driven in rotation at a rotational speed by the actuator to control the flow of the water along the water guide. For example, the motor is a hollow shaft motor surrounding part of the valve arrangement or a solid shaft motor.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For instance, the valve arrangement is configured to interrupt the flow of the water along the water guide when not driven in rotation and is configured to allow the flow of the water along the water guide when driven in rotation. The valve arrangement may be configured to interrupt the flow of the water along the water guide when its rotational speed is below a threshold speed and may be configured to allow the flow of the water along the water guide when its rotational speed is above the threshold speed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The processing unit can be configured to be driven in rotation by the actuator, e.g. a or the above mentioned motor, so as to mix the water with the flavouring ingredient in the chamber e.g. by centrifugation. For example, the motor is a hollow shaft motor surrounding part of the processing unit or a solid shaft motor.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The valve arrangement may be rotationally fixed to the processing unit or the processing unit may be driven by the actuator such that the processing unit and the valve arrangement have a constant speed ratio (e.g. via a gear transmission). For instance the valve arrangement is fixed to the first processing unit member.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The valve arrangement and the processing unit may be driven in rotation about parallel or collinear axis or about intersecting or skew axis.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The valve arrangement may include a rotational speed sensor that is connected to a valve gate configured to act on the water flow and/or on the water guide to control the water flow therealong.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The rotational speed sensor may be configured to be moved away or towards an axis of rotation of the valve arrangement by rotating the valve arrangement.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The valve arrangement may incorporate an automatic return device, e.g. a return spring or a return magnet, for automatically returning, or assisting a return of, the rotational speed sensor towards or away from the axis of rotation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The gate may be fixed to or integral with the rotational speed sensor or may be actuated by the rotational speed sensor.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The rotational speed sensor may form an inertia mass.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The rotational speed sensor may be sensitive to a direction of rotation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The valve arrangement may include a valve support that is rotationally driven by the actuator, e.g. a or the motor, at least one of the rotational speed sensor and the valve gate being movably mounted to the valve support, such as pivotally and/or linearly mounted to the valve support e.g. pivotally mounted at a pivoting axis.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The water guide may have a flexible part and optionally a rigid part such as one or more rigid parts that extend downstream and upstream from the flexible part. The valve arrangement can include a or the above mentioned gate that forms a compressing portion configured to compress the flexible part so as to control the flow of the water from the water source into the chamber. For instance, the gate forms a plurality of compressing portions, e.g. a pair of compressing portions, the flexible part extending between the compressing portions that are configured to squeeze therebetween the flexible part.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The machine may comprise a fluid module that includes the water guide, the valve arrangement and the first processing unit member. The fluid module can further include a fluid connector to the water source. The fluid module may be assembled as a unit to the water source and to the second processing unit member and be disassemblable by a user as a unit from the water source and from the second processing unit member. The fluid module can be assemblable to and disassemblable from the water source and the second processing unit member along an upright direction of assembly and disassembly, such as a downward direction of assembly and an upward direction of disassembly of the fluid module to the second processing unit member and/or an upward direction of assembly and a downward direction of disassembly of the fluid module to the water source.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Assemblable and disassemblable &#x201c;as a unit&#x201d; means that all the different parts of the fluid module can be preassembled prior to assembly to the water source and to the second processing unit and that these different parts can remain assembled together when separated as a whole from the water source and from the second processing unit. Hence, sequential handling of the different parts of the fluid module during assembly to and disassembly from the water source and the second processing unit can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">One of the processing unit members can be provided with a cavity delimiting the chamber, the first and second processing unit members in their distant configuration being configured for direct manual insertion into, and optionally direct manual removal out of, the cavity of the flavouring ingredient, optionally provided within the capsule. For instance, the cavity-provided unit member is configured to be able to be oriented upwards for insertion of the flavouring ingredient into the cavity and to be oriented downwards (e.g. turned upside-down) for removal of the flavouring ingredient out of the cavity, e.g. with the aid of gravity. By implementing such a simple optional configuration, the machine does not need to incorporate an ingredient transfer arrangement for inserting into and/or removing from the cavity the flavouring ingredient before and/or after beverage preparation.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The machine (when using ingredient capsules) may however have a capsule transfer device, e.g. as disclosed in WO 2012/041605, WO 2017/046294 and WO 2017/202746.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The water source, e.g. a or the above mentioned water supply tank, can be configured to contain a limited amount of water that corresponds to a maximum amount needed for a serving. The machine may be configured to deliver all the water contained in the water source for preparing a serving of the beverage. The limited amount of water can be in the range of 200 to 1000 ml, such as 350 to 750 ml. The water source may include an indication arrangement, such as a marking system on the water supply tank, to indicate different levels of water amounts below the maximum amount corresponding to different types of beverage servings. By implementing such a single optional configuration, the machine does not need to incorporate an active control arrangement to manage the volume of water required for a serving, it being sufficient that the user provides the water source only with the required amount for the desired serving and that the water is driven to the processing unit until the entire amount of water from the water source is used up.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The machine may be configured to prepare the beverage: without thermally conditioning the water delivered from the water source into the chamber, for instance the machine being free of activatable thermal conditioner or having a beverage preparation mode in which a thermal conditioner is bypassed or inactivated; or with thermally conditioning the water delivered from the water source into the chamber, for instance the machine having an activatable thermal conditioner such as a water heater and/or cooler.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It is also possible to provide thermally pre-conditioned water in the water source, e.g. heat and/or cool the water prior to supplying into to the machine.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The machine may be configured to deliver the beverage at a temperature below 30&#xb0; C. such as below 25&#xb0; C., for instance in the range of 3 to 20&#xb0; C., for example in the range of 5 to 15&#xb0; C., e.g. 7 to 10&#xb0; C. The machine may deliver the beverage at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The machine can be configured to deliver the water from the water source into the chamber at an average rate for a beverage serving in the range of 10 to 300 ml/min, for instance 20 to 100 ml/min, such as 40 to 80 ml/min. For example, the instantaneous rate of water delivery is lower or close to zero or even zero towards the beginning of beverage preparation, e.g. for pre-wetting the flavouring ingredient, and is higher towards the end of beverage preparation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The beverage processing unit may be arranged in order to rotate the chamber at a speed in the range of 500 to 10000 RPM, such as 1250 to 7500 RPM, for centrifugation of the water with the flavouring ingredient, for instance within the above mentioned capsule, to prepare the beverage.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The invention also relates to a combination of a machine as described above and a flavouring ingredient, e.g. a flavouring ingredient contained in a capsule, for preparing a beverage from the flavouring ingredient in the machine.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A further aspect of the invention relates to a method of preparing a beverage by mixing water with a flavouring ingredient, e.g. a flavouring ingredient contained in a capsule, in a machine as described above.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Another aspect of the invention relates to a use of a flavouring ingredient, e.g. a flavouring ingredient contained in a capsule, for mixing with water, e.g. by centrifugally driving such flavouring ingredient with water, in a machine as described above.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Within the context of the present disclosure, the fact that an operation can be done by a user means that no special tool or special knowledge unavailable to ordinary users is required to do such operation.
