The syringe is automatically squeezed at a specific rate to deliver a defined amount of medication to a patient over a defined time. Syringe pumps are known, for example, from EP 0 566 825 A1. DE 202 00 885 U1 discloses a syringe pump with a plunger brake. The plunger brake is mounted in a syringe bracket. The plunger brake fastens the plunger of a syringe after insertion. To enable the syringe to be squeezed, the plunger plate at the end of the syringe is gripped by a drive head with claws. To enable the claws to grip the plunger plate, the plunger of the syringe must be fixed. The plunger brake presses the piston against a contact surface and fixes it on the contact surface. The plunger brake is located in the syringe bracket, which is pulled out of the syringe pump for inserting the syringe. The syringe bracket is rotated by 90&#xb0; about its axis and is locked in the rotated position. The syringe is inserted and the syringe bracket is released from the lock. As the syringe bracket is pre-tensioned by a spring, it is pulled towards the syringe. When the spring is pre-tensioned too much, the syringe yoke will recoil. This is unpleasant for a user of the syringe pump. Furthermore, damage can occur to the syringe and/or the syringe pump if the syringe is pulled back too far.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disclosure is based on the object of providing a syringe pump including a syringe bracket, by which pleasant and high-quality closure of the syringe bracket is ensured.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosure relates to a syringe pump including a syringe bracket that fixes a syringe in a position, the syringe bracket being connected to the syringe pump via a tubular bracket arm and can be pulled out of the syringe pump and locked in the pulled-out position by means of a catch mechanism so as to insert a syringe into the syringe pump. After the catch mechanism is released, a spring preload on the bracket arm pulls back the syringe bracket to the syringe pump. According to the disclosure, retraction of the bracket arm is damped by a motion damper.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A high spring force makes undamped retraction of the syringe bracket unpleasant to a user and reduces the impression of quality and good processing of the syringe pump. Furthermore, the syringe bracket hits its contact surface at high speed, resulting in a loud noise. The impact can also result in damage to the syringe pump and/or the syringe bracket. Therefore, the rapid movement of the syringe bracket towards the syringe pump is dampened. The damping causes the syringe bracket to retract gently. There is no noise when the syringe bracket hits its stop position. Springing back of the syringe bracket is gently cushioned by damping. Thus, to a user, the gentle retraction of the syringe bracket provides a user-friendly overall impression.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another feature of the disclosure, the tubular bracket arm pierces the housing of the syringe pump at an aperture/a hole and has a seal at the aperture. The bracket arm connects the syringe pump and the syringe bracket. The bracket arm is fastened inside the syringe pump and protrudes through the aperture from the housing of the syringe pump. The aperture is sealed by a seal. Due to the seal, dust or liquid cannot enter the housing. The seal fulfills at least protection type IP44 and is implemented as a round, elastic seal.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a further feature of the disclosure, the seal is a motion damper. The seal is in contact with the bracket arm and friction is provided between the bracket arm and the seal. The seal presses a tube of the bracket arm, i.e. the seal exerts a contact pressure onto the tube of the bracket arm. When the bracket arm is moved in an axial direction friction occurs between the seal and the tube. Friction obstructs an axial movement of the bracket arm. Thus, friction also obstructs retraction of the bracket arm and thus dampens retraction of the bracket arm.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a further feature of the disclosure, the outer diameter of the tubular bracket arm increases in a longitudinal direction of the bracket arm towards the syringe bracket. Hence, when the bracket arm is pulled into the housing in an axial direction, the outer diameter of the tube, which is pulled through the hole and the seal, increases. Correspondingly, the outer diameter decreases when the tube is pulled out of the housing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another feature of the disclosure, the friction between the seal and the bracket arm increases with increasing diameter of the bracket arm. Due to the increasing outer diameter of the tube, the contact pressure of the seal on the tube increases, resulting in an increase of friction between the seal and the bracket arm. Thus, the friction increases when the bracket arm is pulled into the housing.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another feature of the disclosure, the bracket arm is connected to the syringe pump housing by a spring on a side opposite to the syringe bracket. The spring is deflected when the syringe bracket is outwardly pulled out of the housing. When the syringe bracket is released, the spring pulls the bracket arm together with the syringe bracket towards the wall of the housing. By this, the syringe bracket is pulled into the housing. The motion of the syringe bracket into the housing is dampened by the seal.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another feature of the disclosure, damping increases approximately exponentially in relation to a decreasing deflection of the syringe bracket. Since the friction force increases with decreasing deflection of the bracket arm and the spring force decreases with decreasing deflection of the spring and thus also with decreasing deflection of the bracket arm, damping increases progressively with decreasing deflection of the bracket arm. As the two effects of a decreasing spring force and increasing friction add up, the damping increases approximately in an exponential function.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a further feature of the disclosure, the increasing friction progressively dampens recoil of the bracket arm in the direction of the syringe pump. By overlapping of the effects described above, the damping increases the further the bracket arm is pulled into the housing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a further feature of the disclosure, the increasing diameter of the bracket arm is a draft angle. The tube of the bracket arm is cast. Since cast parts must be demolded, cast parts have a draft angle for easier demolding. In the tube of the bracket arm, the draft angle runs such that the diameter of the tube becomes larger towards the syringe bracket. This is desirable for the damping described above. In this way, the tube does not have to be reworked in a costly manner, but the desired bevel/diameter change already results from the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another feature of the disclosure, the syringe bracket retracts with a soft-close mechanism. A soft-close mechanism is known, for example, from drawers. A user merely needs to tap the open drawer and the drawer closes gently by itself. Retraction of the syringe bracket works in a similar way. All the user has to do is to release the locking mechanism and the syringe bracket will gently retract to the syringe pump housing by itself. The bracket arm retracts into the housing.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an isometric view of a syringe pump;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a syringe pump including an inserted syringe;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a syringe bracket in the syringe pump;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a plunger brake in the syringe bracket;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a longitudinal section through the bracket arm of the syringe bracket and a syringe pump housing; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram showing interaction of the friction of the seal and the tensile force of a spring.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a syringe pump <b>1</b>. The basic mode of operation of syringe pump <b>1</b> is sufficiently described in EP 0 566 825 A1, so that a general description of syringe pump <b>1</b> herein is dispensed with.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The syringe pump <b>1</b> serves for squeezing a syringe <b>2</b> having a syringe cylinder <b>4</b> and a plunger <b>6</b>. The syringe <b>2</b> is inserted in the syringe pump <b>1</b> in a syringe channel <b>8</b>. For this, a front flap <b>10</b> of the syringe pump <b>1</b> is lifted up downwards in order to release the syringe channel <b>8</b>. Moreover, a syringe bracket <b>12</b> fixing the plunger is pulled out of the syringe pump <b>1</b>. The syringe bracket <b>12</b> is pulled out of syringe pump <b>1</b> and can be rotated by 90&#xb0;, so as to be caught in the pulled-out position in a catch <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A drive head <b>14</b> extends laterally out of a pump housing <b>16</b> of syringe pump <b>1</b> on the outside. The syringe <b>2</b> can then be inserted into the syringe pump <b>1</b>. During operation of the syringe pump <b>1</b>, the drive head <b>14</b> presses the plunger <b>6</b> into the syringe cylinder <b>4</b> and thus empties the syringe <b>2</b>. A syringe pump <b>1</b> with inserted syringe <b>2</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The drive head <b>14</b> is extended and the syringe bracket <b>12</b> is folded down and locked in place.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">After inserting the syringe <b>2</b>, the front flap <b>10</b> is folded in. The syringe <b>2</b> is fastened in the syringe pump. For this, the syringe <b>2</b>, on the one hand, lies in syringe channel <b>8</b>. On the other hand, the syringe wings <b>15</b> of syringe cylinder <b>4</b> are held on the pump side by an axial fixation (not shown) in pump housing <b>16</b>, and on the side of the syringe bracket by a fixing on syringe bracket <b>12</b>. The drive head <b>14</b> has clamps <b>17</b> encompassing the plunger plates <b>18</b> of syringe <b>2</b>. For this purpose, the drive head is moved towards the plunger plates <b>18</b>. To enable the clamps <b>17</b> to grip the plunger plates <b>18</b>, the plunger <b>6</b> of the syringe <b>2</b> must be fixed. A plunger brake <b>20</b> fixes the plunger <b>6</b> to a contact face <b>22</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). To do this, after inserting the syringe <b>2</b>, the syringe bracket <b>12</b> is released from catch mechanism <b>13</b>. The syringe bracket <b>12</b> is pressed against the syringe through the spring load of a spring <b>24</b>. Moreover, the plunger brake <b>20</b> moves out of the syringe bracket <b>12</b> and presses the plunger <b>6</b> against contact surface <b>22</b>, thereby fixing the plunger <b>6</b>. The plunger brake <b>20</b> is known from DE 202 00 885 U1. The combination of a syringe channel <b>8</b>, an axial fixation of the syringe wings <b>15</b> and a plunger brake <b>20</b> fixes the syringe <b>2</b> in the syringe pump <b>1</b>. The mode of operation of the syringe yoke bracket is explained below.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the syringe yoke <b>12</b> in the pump housing <b>16</b> of syringe pump <b>1</b>. The side wall of syringe pump <b>1</b> and further components of syringe pump <b>1</b> were omitted in this view in order to make the syringe bracket <b>12</b> visible. The syringe bracket <b>12</b> is positioned on a side of syringe <b>2</b> facing away from syringe pump <b>1</b> and protrudes from pump housing <b>16</b>. The syringe bracket <b>12</b> is connected to syringe pump <b>1</b> via a bracket arm <b>26</b>. The bracket arm <b>26</b> passes below the syringe <b>2</b> and is aligned orthogonally to the longitudinal direction of the syringe <b>2</b>. The bracket arm <b>26</b> pierces through the pump housing <b>16</b> in a hole <b>28</b>. A seal <b>30</b> is fastened between the hole <b>28</b> and the bracket arm <b>26</b>. The seal <b>30</b> is in contact with an outer side of the bracket arm <b>12</b> and seals the hole <b>28</b> against the penetration of contaminants or liquids.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">On the side of bracket arm <b>26</b> opposite the syringe bracket <b>12</b>, the bracket arm <b>26</b> is connected to a carriage <b>34</b>, which is to be moved in the longitudinal direction of the bracket arm <b>26</b>. A drive element of plunger brake <b>20</b>, for example, an electric motor (not shown), is fixed to the carriage <b>34</b>. The motor is connected to a pull rod <b>32</b> by a thread (not shown), which is moved in an axial direction by the motor. The pull rod <b>32</b> runs inside the tubular bracket arm <b>26</b> and activates the plunger brake <b>20</b> in the syringe bracket <b>12</b>. The pull rod <b>32</b> thus forms a linear drive activating the plunger brake <b>20</b>. The carriage <b>34</b> with the motor is connected to the bracket arm <b>26</b> and thus to the syringe bracket <b>12</b> by a driver and thus can be moved with the syringe bracket <b>12</b>. For this purpose, the carriage is supported in a guide <b>36</b>, which allows a movement in the longitudinal direction of the bracket arm <b>26</b>, which is transverse to the longitudinal direction of the syringe <b>2</b>. The carriage <b>34</b> is connected to the pump housing <b>16</b> by a spring <b>24</b>, i.e. when the syringe bracket <b>12</b> is pulled out of the pump housing <b>16</b>, the carriage <b>34</b> moves along and moves away from the pump housing <b>16</b> with which it is connected through the spring <b>24</b>. This causes the spring <b>24</b> to be tensioned. When the syringe bracket <b>12</b> is released, the carriage <b>34</b> is pulled back to the docking point of the spring <b>24</b>, and thus also the syringe bracket <b>12</b> is pulled back into the pump housing <b>16</b>. The plunger brake <b>20</b> in an extended state is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">When the syringe <b>2</b> is taken from the syringe pump <b>1</b>, the syringe bracket <b>12</b> is extracted from the syringe pump <b>1</b>, as in the case of inserting the syringe <b>2</b>, is rotated by 90&#xb0; about its axis, and is locked in place. Without the syringe <b>1</b>, the path from the locking mechanism <b>13</b> to the stop point, which now is no longer the syringe <b>2</b>, but the contact surface <b>22</b> of the syringe pump <b>1</b>, is longer. Since the syringe bracket <b>12</b> is spring-loaded, the syringe bracket <b>12</b> would spring back/snap back in the direction of the syringe pump <b>1</b>. This is not ergonomic for a user and makes a loud noise. The rapid movement and the impact could damage the syringe bracket <b>12</b> and/or another component of the syringe pump <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For this reason, the bracket arm <b>26</b> has a damping device. The functioning of the damping is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a longitudinal section through the bracket arm <b>26</b> and the pump housing <b>16</b>. The bracket arm <b>26</b> substantially is an elongated tube <b>38</b>. The pull rod <b>32</b> of the linear drive of plunger brake <b>20</b> extends in the tube <b>38</b>. In the hole <b>28</b> in the pump housing <b>16</b> through which the tube <b>38</b> runs, the round seal <b>30</b> is seated. The seal <b>30</b> is made of an elastic material and is in contact with the tube <b>28</b> of bracket arm <b>12</b>, thus creating friction between the seal <b>30</b> and the outer surface of the tube <b>38</b>. The diameter of the tube <b>38</b> decreases in the longitudinal direction. On the side of the tube <b>38</b> that is closer to the syringe bracket <b>12</b>, the tube <b>38</b> has the largest outer diameter. On the opposite side closer to the spring <b>24</b>, the tube <b>38</b> has the smallest outer diameter. Due to an increasing outer diameter in the longitudinal direction of the bracket arm <b>12</b>, also the friction between the seal <b>30</b> and the tube <b>38</b> increases depending on the position, i.e., when the syringe bracket <b>12</b> is pushed/drawn into the pump housing <b>16</b> in the direction of the syringe pump <b>1</b>, friction between the tube <b>38</b> and the seal <b>30</b> continues to increase in a constant manner the further the tube <b>38</b> is pushed into the pump housing <b>16</b>. The spring has a constant force-displacement curve, i.e. the tensile force <b>24</b> of spring <b>24</b> decreases in a constant manner as the deflection of the spring <b>24</b> decreases. The interaction of the spring force and the friction force of the seal <b>30</b> results in damping the syringe bracket <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows this relationship in a displacement-force diagram. The spring force, which is characterized by a dashed line, decreases as the deflection of spring <b>24</b> decreases. The farther the bracket arm <b>26</b> is pulled into the pump housing <b>16</b> by the spring <b>24</b>, the stronger the friction force between the seal <b>30</b> and the tube <b>38</b> becomes. The friction is represented by a dotted dashed line and increases in a constant manner with the deflection. Since the two effects overlap and since both effects influence damping (continuous line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) of the syringe bracket <b>12</b>, damping increases depending on the position approximately in an exponential curve. The damping increases the farther the bracket arm <b>26</b> is pulled into the pump housing <b>16</b>. Thus, damping is increasing progressively. Thus, the syringe bracket <b>12</b> gently strikes its stop. Due to the progressive damping, a &#x201c;soft-close mechanism&#x201d; is realized.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
