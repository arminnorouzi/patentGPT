Addressing these issues is crucial in reducing the likelihood of injury as well as improving performance. Research shows that the majority of injuries take place during training, frequently from overuse, due to the repetitive nature of the strokes, technical issues, magnified by fatigue, and anatomical variants such as shoulder instability. Training in a fatigued state is necessary to increase endurance and attain beneficial training volume, however the degradation of stroke technique from fatigue can cause poor posture and improper muscle engagement, leading to increased risk for injury or agitating healing injuries.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Swimwear companies seek credibility and public exposure by focusing their research and development on innovation of technical suits worn in competition rather than during training. However, these competition suits are reserved for racing because they are uncomfortable to wear for long durations, expensive, and the fabric integrity does not withstand chlorine well. The design focus for training suits is for comfort and longevity, but fails to provide technical advantages and training benefits for the swimmer.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to swimwear garments designed for training (non-competition) applications. The swimwear garment helps to improve form and positioning in the water to reduce injuries, as well as assists injured swimmers recover from injuries already sustained, such that the swimmers can continue training while recovering from injury. More specifically, swimwear garments according to the embodiments of the invention are focused on addressing injury risk factors by promoting core muscle activation and raising body position in the water and improving shoulder posture to help reduce the possibility of injury and to provide a garment for recovering swimmers to assist posture and correct swimming form.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Swimmers often have a forward-slumped posture due to an imbalance in anterior and interior shoulder strength, which increases the load on the shoulder during swimming. Anatomical variations, such as excessive laxity and lack of anterior flexibility are correlated to further increase in shoulder pain. Butterfly, backstroke, and freestyle swimming stokes involve similar shoulder movements, so many swimmers suffer from similar injuries despite specializing in different events. Overuse is difficult to control because it is inherent to the training regimen and the fitness demands of the sport. However, posture and body position can be manipulated through a garment, alleviating or minimizing the negative effects of high-volume training demands.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, the swimwear garment can go over a traditional swimming suit or training suit. It can also be worn directly against the skin. The swimwear garment can be designed to be very tight on the wearer when it is dry, such that it can be put on when dry, but once the garment and the wearer enter the water, the garment fits properly, rather than expanding to be too large in the water.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, the swimwear garment includes a base layer covering at least part of the upper body of the wearer. The base layer may be of one material or may include at least two different fabric types. One of the fabric types may be a compressive fabric, and can be similar to a traditional racing suit or swimsuit fabric. Other fabrics which satisfy similar compressive and stretch features as described herein, are also contemplated. The compressive fabric can cover areas of the chest and arms. These are the primary areas where a swimsuit generally provides the most compression on the swimmer's muscles, as described herein. The compressive fabric should be capable of stretching, but not at the expense of providing compression on the swimmer's body.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The base layer of the garment may also include a second fabric type which is less compressive than the compressive fabric. In some embodiments this fabric is a breathable mesh fabric, such as an athletic mesh or performance nylon spandex power mesh. The mesh fabric can be used for areas of the swimming garment where compression is less desirable, such as areas of the back. Using mesh where compression is not necessary allows for breathability of the garment and reduces weight.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect of the swimwear garment, one or more elastic straps (or strips) are connected to the swimwear garment over the shoulders and upper back to add additional support and posture control to the shoulders. The straps support the shoulders in a neutral position and reinforce habits of proper posture, especially when fatigue increases the forward-slumping of the shoulders. In a swimmer with rolled forward, rounded shoulders, lifting the arm can cause impingement. This is significant because the swimming strokes all have an overhead catch phase, in which the arm is generating propulsion to move the swimmer forward in the water. These elastic straps target specific areas to control and support movements, and can be based on Kinesio taping methods. The elastic shoulder strap placement can also or alternatively be based on Morrisey's clinical taping methods. The shoulder strips can be specifically placed to run from the anterior shoulder to the center of the back, to apply force to pull the protracted shoulders back from a rounded position into a neutral position. These elastic straps can be made from waistband elastic, for example, or similar material.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect of the swimwear garment, panels on the front and back of the garment are used to provide buoyancy and core compression. The panels can be made from a buoyant material, such as neoprene or other buoyant material. The panels can be positioned around the swimmer's core muscles to add buoyancy to the swimmer and address fatigue-related body position changes due to slowing of the kicking motion and by the swimmer dropping their hips.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The panels can also provide additional tightness and compression to support certain areas of the swimmer, as the paneled areas stretch less than the areas with only the base shell fabrics. The panels act to counter the effect of fatigue-related issues, such as lack of core engagement. A lack of core engagement and inadequate rotation while swimming are also linked to improper use of muscles. Core compression with the panels can promote increased awareness of the muscles and to counteract the injury risk factor. Such core awareness improves rotation, which lessens the load on the shoulders and increases engagement between the swimmers core and the kick aspect of their swimming stroke. While compression is desirable in certain areas of the body, it is desirable to avoid in other areas. For example, the panels can be positioned to avoid excessive compression of the rib cage and lung area, which could otherwise reduce the swimmers lung capacity and can impinge on natural breathing patterns.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some aspects, the panels can also have one or more auxetic cuts or perforations. The auxetic cuts provide ease of movement and flexibility while maintaining compression. The auxetic cuts allow the neoprene or similar material of the panels to stretch and bend when the swimmer bends their core, such as during a flip turn or other swimming motion. These auxetic cuts provide the benefit of flexibility without compromising the compression provided by the panels. The auxetic cuts or perforations also allow flexibility for ease of donning and doffing the suit. Such ease of removal can be particularly advantageous for fatigued or injured swimmers who have limited flexibility or movement related pain. The auxetic cuts can be of various designs to emphasize stretching in particular directions, and can be of varying depth through the panels, as can be understood of one skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The terms &#x201c;invention,&#x201d; &#x201c;the invention,&#x201d; &#x201c;this invention&#x201d; and &#x201c;the present invention&#x201d; used herein are intended to refer broadly to all of the subject matter of this specification and the claims below.

The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. In the following description, for the purpose of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the subject matter. It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art, that embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In general, well-known structures and techniques are not necessary shown in detail.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The need for improved swimwear has existed for some time. For example, throughout the 20<sup>th </sup>century, rapid development and advancement in synthetic fibers, such as nylon and polyester, have encouraged a change in swimwear from traditional natural fibers to more water resistant and practical synthetic fabric. Development and advancement in the field was driven by not only a desire for comfort and fashion, but performance in limiting drag in the water and functionality in durability and water shedding ability.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In general terms, the inventor found that swimsuits to be worn on a regular basis, outside of competition events, lack sophistication and technical innovation which can assist the swimmer in training gains and increased performance. As the vast majority of a swimmer's routine swimming is spent in training swimwear, rather than in a racing suit, the inventor sought to develop advanced training garments to address training injury risk factors. The swimwear is designed to assist the swimmer develop and improve their form in their (often daily) training routines, while also providing a garment which minimizes drag in the water, avoids complexity or discomfort in donning and doffing, and is durable to chlorine and sun exposure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">While the various embodiments of swimwear garments shown herein are generally shown as being unisex and of particular sizing ratios, it should be understood that the swimwear garments can also be specifically shaped and designed for a particular gender, such as with adjusted hip and chest dimensions. Further, as each swimmer can have different body figures, varying sizes of the swimwear shown can be developed to specifically and more precisely fit a particular body shape.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The various embodiments of swimwear garments herein show figures which end on or near the waist of the swimmer. It may be advantageous to have a garment which ends at the waist to limit weight, drag, and complexity in putting on or taking off the garment. However, it should be understood that while the features of this garment are demonstrated as being only on the upper body, the garment could also extend around the torso or to the leg region.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a front view and rear view, respectively, of a swimwear garment <b>100</b> for training in the water. The garment <b>100</b> with a base layer <b>102</b> made from compressive fabric <b>104</b> and non-compressive fabric <b>106</b>. For explanatory purposes, the garment <b>100</b> is described as having a front section <b>110</b> and a back section <b>112</b> to describe the front and back of the garment <b>100</b> generally. The base layer <b>102</b> can cover the upper body of the wearer, and can further comprise sleeves <b>108</b> extending down the arms of the wearer. While the garment <b>100</b> is shown with sleeves <b>108</b> extending only to the mid-arm (short sleeves), it is further contemplated to have long sleeves extending for example to the wrist, even shorter sleeves extending only to the mid or upper bicep, or no sleeves at all.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The front section <b>110</b> of the base layer <b>102</b> is constructed from compressive fabric <b>104</b>, covering the chest and shoulders of the wearer. The compressive fabric can have about a 70% stretch factor in the lengthwise direction (meaning a 10 inch long section could be stretched to 17 inches), and a 100% stretch factor in the crosswise direction. The compressive fabric can be made primarily of polyester, and optionally can also be made partially of spandex, preferably being about 90% polyester and about 10% spandex.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The back section <b>112</b> of the base layer <b>102</b> can be made at least primarily from non-compressive fabric <b>106</b>. The non-compressive fabric can be made from at least nylon and spandex, preferably being made from a nylon-spandex blend of about 80% nylon and 20% spandex. Other fabrics which satisfy similar stretch features, as described, are also contemplated. The non-compressive fabric can additionally also allow for more leeway on sizing of the garment, as the flexibility of the non-compressive fabric can be more adaptable to varying body sizes and types. A suitable non-compressive or mesh fabric can have a stretch factor of about 70% in the grainline direction and 130% in the crosswise direction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For ease of donning and doffing, the garment <b>100</b> can also be fitted with a zipper <b>130</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the zipper <b>130</b> is positioned in the center of the front section <b>110</b>. In other embodiments, the zipper <b>130</b> can be located in the center of the back section <b>112</b> (like a wetsuit for example). The zipper <b>130</b> as shown runs the entire length of the garment <b>100</b>, such that the front section <b>110</b> fully separates when the zipper is opened. The full opening of the garment <b>100</b> and front opening allows for ease of donning and doffing the garment <b>100</b>, such that generally no assistance is needed from anyone else to put it on. Additionally, the full length of the zipper <b>130</b> can be useful in the case of an injured swimmer with limited range of movement or pain associated with stretching in certain directions. In construction, the zipper can be a lightweight zipper such as a #3 nylon coil separating zipper made by YKK, or others. Such a lightweight zipper allows for decrease in both weight and drag when worn in the water.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one aspect, the swimwear garment <b>100</b> includes a plurality of elastic straps <b>120</b>, for example interior elastic straps <b>120</b>A and exterior elastic straps <b>120</b>B. The elastic straps <b>120</b> span the shoulder region of the wearer. In general, the garment <b>100</b> will have equal number of elastic straps <b>120</b> on each side of the wearers body (each side of the wearers head) to apply equal compression and positioning on each shoulder muscle region. Preferably the straps can be wide waistband fabric, about 2 inches wide. The material of the elastic straps should stretch around 60% in the lengthwise direction. Once attached to the base layer of the suit, the combined base layer and elastic straps can stretch (in combination) about 40%-50%. It is shown herein that the garment <b>100</b> has two elastic straps on each side of the wearers body, discussed and shown as the interior elastic straps <b>120</b>A and exterior elastic straps <b>120</b>B. The interior elastic straps <b>120</b>A attach to the front section <b>110</b> at the base of the shoulder or pectoral region. The interior elastic straps <b>120</b>A then span over the tops of the wearer's shoulder region and towards the center of the spine.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">To help secure the elastic straps <b>120</b> to the base layer <b>102</b> it can be beneficial to sew the ends of the elastic straps <b>120</b> to the panels <b>140</b> of the garment <b>100</b> or into the seams of the base layer <b>102</b>. If the elastic straps <b>120</b> are not sewn into a seam or another feature of the garment <b>100</b> it can cause the area where it is secured to stretch away from the remainder of the garment <b>100</b>. Because the elastic straps <b>120</b> are stretched when worn, if they are not secured to a panel <b>140</b> or a seam of the base layer <b>102</b>, it may result in the base layer <b>102</b> to pull and ride in an uncomfortable position on the wearer, or otherwise shift in place. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the interior elastic straps <b>120</b>A are secured at the front within the seam where the sleeves <b>108</b> are attached to the front section <b>110</b>. Similarly, the exterior elastic straps <b>120</b>B attach at the front to the underarm seam which creates the sleeves <b>108</b> shape. On the back of the garment <b>100</b>, the elastic straps <b>120</b> are attached and secured to the back section <b>112</b> by being sewn directly into the back panel <b>140</b>B.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the exterior elastic straps <b>120</b>B overlap the interior elastic straps <b>120</b>A to attach to the back panel <b>140</b>B. The overlapping is primarily a feature to allow the exterior elastic straps <b>120</b>B to maintain the desired angle around the outside of the shoulder region. It should additionally be appreciated that the interior elastic strap <b>120</b>A could instead overlap the exterior elastic strap <b>120</b>B. Additionally, the interior elastic straps <b>120</b>A and the exterior elastic straps <b>120</b>B may merge together into one elastic strap at their point of intersection, and attach as one piece of material to the back panel <b>140</b>B.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the wearer puts on the garment <b>100</b>, the elasticity of the base layer <b>102</b> allows the base layer to stretch and fit tightly against the wearer. As the base layer <b>102</b> is stretched, the elastic straps <b>120</b> also stretch, and in so doing force is applied on the wearer. Based on the specific placement of the elastic straps <b>120</b>, force is applied in predetermined and selected directions to improve the wearers posture and positioning while swimming. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the exterior elastic straps <b>120</b>B are positioned at a more aggressive angle relative to the interior elastic straps <b>120</b>A, this resulting angle pushes the protracted shoulder from a rounded position to a neutral position. Similarly, the interior elastic strap <b>120</b>A goes more directly over the top of the shoulder, from the bicep to the spine of the upper or middle back, resulting in the elastic force pushing more directly downward on the shoulder. The resulting combination is a precise positioning of the shoulder by pushing it backwards and downwards simultaneously. In further embodiments, positioning and means in which the force is applied to the shoulders by elastic straps <b>120</b> can further be based on Kinesio taping methods, where the positioning is selected to treat pain and injured muscles by specific elastic strap configurations or shapes, such as a &#x201c;Y&#x201d;, &#x201c;X&#x201d;, &#x201c;I&#x201d;, or fan/web shape. Additional elastic straps <b>120</b> can be used to effectuate the desired shape and provide the desired pressure to the muscles.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The desired amount of force applied to the shoulder can be determined based on the material selected for the elastic straps <b>120</b>. A more resistive elastic material will push more strongly on the shoulder when worn by the wearer in comparison with a less resistive elastic material. The amount of force applied can also be varied by the length of the elastic straps when the garment <b>100</b> is manufactured. In some embodiments, for example, when the elastic straps <b>120</b> are attached to the garment <b>100</b>, the elastic straps <b>120</b> are made shorter than the distance of the two points they are intended to attach. Thus, the elastic straps <b>120</b> are stretched when attached onto the garment <b>100</b>, and thus the elastic straps are pre-stretched prior to being worn by the wearer. Therefore, once the wearer puts on the garment, the force applied to the shoulder will be both the pre-stretched force as well as the force added when the garment <b>100</b> is put on and the base layer <b>102</b> and elastic straps <b>120</b> are stretched further. Notably, manufacturing determinations can be made specifically for each of the elastic straps <b>120</b>, such that more force is applied from the interior elastic straps <b>120</b>A than the exterior elastic straps <b>120</b>B, or vice versa. Such determinations may be appropriately made by a physical therapist or other sports trainer for best results for a particular wearer, or generally for a specific swimming event.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, to add additional comfort and support to the wearer, the elastic straps <b>120</b> may further include a protective coating covering at least the inside portion of the elastic straps <b>120</b>, or preferably both sides of the elastic straps <b>120</b>. Such a protective coating can, for example, be made from polyester and add additional comfort such that the elastic straps <b>120</b> do not rub or chafe the wearer. The protective coating may also have the added benefit of protecting the elastic straps <b>120</b> from wear and tear from use, and protect the elastic straps <b>120</b> from sun exposure.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another aspect of the garment <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the garment <b>100</b> has a plurality of panels <b>140</b>, for example abdomen panels <b>140</b>A, a back panel <b>140</b>B, and oblique panels <b>140</b>C. In one aspect, the panels <b>140</b> are designed to be buoyant. For example, the panels <b>140</b> can be made of neoprene. For example, the panels <b>140</b> can be made of closed-cell neoprene and can be about &#x215c;&#x2033; thick, for example Neoprene High Quality Foam sold by The Foam Factory based in Macomb, Mich.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">To attach the panels <b>140</b> to the base layer <b>102</b> several stitching patterns can be used to sew the panels <b>140</b> to the base layer <b>102</b>. The panels <b>140</b> can be sewn to the base layer at or near the panel edge <b>146</b>. With larger panels, such as the back panel <b>140</b>B, stitching can be added down the middle of the panel <b>140</b>B to provide additional support and secure attachment to the base layer <b>102</b>. When sewing the panels <b>140</b> to the base layer <b>102</b> the panels <b>140</b> are generally too thick to use a complex stitching type (such as a cover stitch). In some embodiments, a cover layer of compressive fabric <b>104</b> can be used for some or all of the panels <b>140</b> of the garment <b>100</b>. In such embodiments, a section of compressive fabric <b>104</b> can be cut slightly larger than the panel <b>140</b> it is intended to cover. For example, the cover layer may be about an inch larger in all directions than the panel <b>140</b> it will cover. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> the panels <b>140</b> have a panel edge <b>146</b> and the cover layer has a cover layer edge <b>148</b>, where the cover layer edge <b>148</b> approximately matches the shape of the panel edge <b>146</b>, but the section of compressive fabric <b>104</b> which makes the cover layer is slightly larger than the underlying panel <b>140</b>. Once a panel <b>140</b> is sewn to the base layer <b>102</b>, the cover layer of compressive fabric <b>104</b> can be placed over the top of the panel <b>140</b> and the cover layer edge <b>148</b> can be sewn directly to the base layer <b>102</b>. As such, the cover layer creates a pocket in which the panel <b>140</b> is secured. Once constructed, the panel <b>140</b> can then be fully protected from sun exposure or damage from use. Because the cover layer edge <b>148</b> is sewn to the base layer <b>102</b> and not to the panels <b>140</b>, there is not an issue with the thickness of what is being sewn, so more complex stitching patterns can be used to provide increased durability, comfort, and decreased drag in the water. For example, a double sided 5 thread cover stitch can be used, as discussed further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the panels <b>140</b> may further include auxetic cuts <b>150</b>, which can be cut fully or partially into the material of the panels <b>140</b>. The auxetic cuts <b>150</b> allow for increased motion and flexibility while maintaining the desired compression on the wearer. The auxetic cuts <b>150</b> may be a variety of shapes to accommodate different directions where increased flexibility and motion is required. The specifics of auxetic cuts are further provided regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The garment <b>100</b> may have abdomen panels <b>140</b>A attached to the base layer <b>102</b> in the abdomen region of the front section <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, there are two abdomen panels <b>140</b>A, separated by the zipper <b>130</b>. The abdomen panels <b>140</b>A can be substantially triangular in shape, covering a substantial portion of the abdomen region of the wearer. In some embodiments, the abdomen panels <b>140</b>A can be about 11 inches tall, 5.5 inches wide, and have a hypotenuse of 8 inches (when the shape is triangular). Rather than a true triangle, in some embodiments, the hypotenuse edge of the abdomen panels <b>140</b>A has a slight angle change, where the hypotenuse edge extends more vertically towards the waist of the wearer, and a more horizontal angle as it goes upwards on the wearer. These angles are provided to accommodate maximum coverage of the abdomen region of the wearer towards the waist, while tapering the angle to follow the bottom edge of the wearer's rib cage towards the top of the abdomen panels <b>140</b>A. By extending along the rib cage, but not covering the rib cage, the abdomen panels <b>140</b>A allow for maximum coverage of the abdomen region (for additional compression and buoyancy) without adding compression to the rib cage and lung area, which could restrict breathing. The abdomen panels <b>140</b>A may further include a cover layer with a cover layer edge <b>148</b> extending slightly over the edges of the abdomen panels <b>140</b>A (as discussed for all panels <b>140</b> above).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally, the garment <b>100</b> may have at least one back panel <b>140</b>B attached to the back section <b>112</b> of the garment <b>100</b>. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is shown having one back panel <b>140</b>B, but it should be understood that multiple panels either side-by-side or spaced above and below could be provided. Additional back panels <b>140</b>B could be used to provide additional range of body motion or flexibility as desired in the back region. Such design decisions can be made based on particular swimming events or needs of a particular swimmer. The back panel <b>140</b>B may further include a cover layer with a cover layer edge <b>148</b> extending slightly over the edges of the back panel <b>140</b>B (as discussed for all panels <b>140</b> above).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The back panel <b>140</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is similar in shape to a turtle shell, and can be 2 inches at the top center and expanding to a width of 6 inches in the middle of the back, and spanning about 11.5 inches from the top to bottom. The shape was selected to provide maximum comfort to the swimmer, for example in bending or curling in a flip turn or other large back bending movements in swimming. By providing the back panel <b>140</b>B towards the waist of the wearer on the back section <b>112</b> it ensures that the back panel <b>140</b>B does not interfere with the arm movements of the wearer. Further, the back panel <b>140</b>B may be located closer to the waist of the wearer to provide buoyancy closer to the pelvic region, to particularly focus on raising the pelvic and leg region of the wearer in the water while swimming. The curved bottom edge of the back panel <b>140</b>B was designed to allow the swimmer to bend without the bottom of the garment <b>100</b> moving or ridging up on the wearer. The top edge of the back panel <b>140</b>B can be selected of a particular width and location to best receive the elastic straps <b>120</b> and provide a suitable attaching edge to sew the elastic straps <b>120</b> to the top area of the back panel <b>140</b>B.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The garment <b>100</b> may also include oblique panels <b>140</b>C at the back hips of the wearer. The oblique panels <b>140</b>C are approximately triangular in shape, for example spanning about 4.5 inches along the waist, 4 inches in height, and 5.75 inches on the hypotenuse side. The oblique panels <b>140</b>C may further include a cover layer with a cover layer edge <b>148</b> extending slightly over the edges of the oblique panels <b>140</b>C (as discussed for all panels <b>140</b> above). The oblique panels <b>140</b>C provide additional buoyancy near the waist of the wearer and further help elevate the legs and pelvic region of the wearer in the water.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The oblique panels <b>140</b>C could alternatively be removed and a back panel <b>140</b>B could instead be used that covers the region of both the back panel <b>140</b>B and the oblique panels <b>140</b>C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. However, providing additional oblique panels <b>140</b>C instead of only one back panel <b>140</b>B allows for additional flexibility and range of motion without loss of substantial surface area for the panels <b>140</b>, and therefore loss of substantial buoyancy force.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">While it is discussed herein that the panels <b>140</b> and elastic straps <b>120</b> are secured on top of the base layer <b>102</b>, it should be appreciated that the panels <b>140</b> and elastic straps <b>120</b> could be directly integrated into the base layer <b>102</b>. To clarify for example, the base layer <b>102</b> could have holes cut to match the shape of each of the panels <b>140</b> such that the panels <b>140</b> are directly in contact with the skin of the wearer, rather than over the top of the base layer <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the figures show the front and back, respectively, of an alternative embodiment of a garment <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a garment <b>100</b> having two chest panels <b>140</b>D. These chest panels <b>140</b>D are located over the pectoral or breast region of the wearer, above the abdomen panels <b>140</b>A, and provide additional buoyancy in the water. These chest panels <b>140</b>D can be constructed of the same materials and attached to the base layer <b>102</b> in the same manner as the abdomen panels <b>140</b>A.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Having panels <b>140</b> overlapping the rib cage and lung area can have both advantages and disadvantages. Applying additional compression to the rib cage with the use of chest panels <b>140</b>D can result in added weight and pressure against the lungs, which can impede natural breathing difficulty and breathing patterns. However, adding chest panels <b>140</b>D to the garment <b>100</b> provides substantially increased buoyancy and can assist in raising the body of the wearer in the water. For example, such panels can provide increased buoyancy in the shoulder and chest region, raising a swimmers head and arms.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As chest size and shaping can vary substantially between swimmers, particularly with regard to men and women, a garment <b>100</b> having chest panels <b>140</b>D may be particularly suitable for gender-specific garments. In the case of a garment <b>100</b> that is intended to be unisex, the chest panels <b>140</b>D can result in a less flexible (or even rigid) structure in the chest region, which is less capable of tightly forming to the body shape of the wearer. With variance in chest size and shape, such as with a unisex garment, the suit may not fit as tightly against the body.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is also contemplated that the chest panels <b>140</b>D can be of varying shape and size and be positioned in higher or lower on the body. Further additional (and smaller) chest panels could be provided in place of the chest panels <b>140</b>D shown. Having multiple chest panels <b>140</b>D on each side of the wearer may allow sustained flexibility of motion and a maintained elasticity of the suit to fit the wearer's form.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, an alternative embodiment of the elastic straps <b>120</b> is shown. As discussed previously, various configurations of the angles and positions of the elastic straps <b>120</b> can provide the desired force and angle of the pressure applied by the elastic straps <b>120</b>. Such angles and forces can be determined based on specific needs of a particular swimmer by, for example, a trainer or medical professional. In this embodiment, the exterior elastic straps <b>120</b>B cross the interior elastic straps <b>120</b>A higher on the back section <b>112</b>, optionally overlapping each other on the top of the shoulder (as can be seen also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). The exterior elastic straps <b>120</b>B maintain a sharper angle, spanning the back nearly at a directly horizontal angle. To accommodate this angle, the back panel <b>140</b>B is shown to come to a point tip <b>202</b> at the top, and go higher into the back section <b>112</b> of the garment <b>100</b>. As such, the pointed tip <b>202</b> of the back panel <b>140</b>B is capable of receiving the exterior elastic strap <b>120</b>B higher in the back section <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the interior elastic straps <b>120</b>A maintain a more vertical angle down the back section <b>112</b> of the garment <b>100</b>. This more vertical angle can provide a desired direction of force on the shoulder in combination with the more horizontal angle of the exterior elastic straps <b>120</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> further shows the interior elastic straps can attach in alternative positions on the back panel <b>140</b>B, such as further towards the outside of the back section <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a deconstructed view of the garment <b>100</b> is shown, such as a view of the various pieces of the garment prior to sewing the front section <b>110</b>, back section <b>112</b>, sleeves <b>108</b>, and zipper <b>130</b> together to create the garment <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the front section <b>110</b> is divided into the left front section <b>110</b>A and the right front section <b>110</b>B, and reattached with a full length zipper <b>130</b> running in between. the sleeves <b>108</b> can be raglan sleeves.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Raglan sleeves are a sleeve type, where the sleeve attaches to the front and rear sections of a shirt or other garment at a diagonal angle which spans all the way to the neck. Raglan sleeves, because the shoulder region has no seam running through it, allows freedom of motion in the shoulder region. Such a sleeve type is of particular benefit in the case of swimming due to the emphasis on shoulder motion and shoulder muscle development. The sleeves <b>108</b> are formed by cutting the compressive fabric <b>104</b> in a diamond-like shape. The sleeves are formed by sewing the fabric into a tube shape by attaching the underarm edges <b>302</b> together, by creating an underarm seam.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The structure of the base layer <b>102</b> is formed by sewing the side seams by sewing the front left edge <b>304</b> to the back left edge <b>306</b> and the front right edge <b>308</b> and the back right edge <b>310</b>. In so doing, the left side of the front section <b>110</b>A is connected with the left side of the back section <b>112</b> and the right side of the front section <b>110</b>B is connected with the right side of the back section <b>112</b>. Finally, the sleeves <b>108</b> are attached to the front section <b>110</b> and the back section <b>112</b> by sewing the raglan seams <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the elastic straps <b>120</b> are not yet attached to the front section <b>110</b> or the back section <b>112</b>, and are simply shown laying on top for reference. Thus, as discussed previously, when the underarm edges <b>302</b> are sewn to form the sleeve, the front end of the exterior elastic straps <b>120</b>B are attached and sewn into the underarm seam. Similarly, when the raglan edges <b>312</b> are sewn to form the raglan seams, the interior elastic straps <b>120</b>A are sewn into the raglan seam to be secured in place.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">With regards to the seams discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a complex stitching pattern can be used to form the seam, such as a cover stitch. Preferably, a double-sided 5 thread cover stitch is used to form the seams, as is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. This double-sided 5 thread cover stitch can be about 6 millimeters wide, and can be stitched on fabric overlapped by about 0.25 inches. Such a 5-thread cover stitch, sometimes called stitch number <b>605</b>, uses 3 needles to form the stitch. Preferably, the cover thread will be double sided for improved strength in comfort.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">It is also contemplated that similar cover stitching, such as a 4 thread or 6 thread cover stitch (stitch numbers <b>602</b> and <b>607</b> respectively). In addition, other durable stitch patterns could be used, such as a 4 or 5 thread safetystitch, or similar stitching pattern. While it is contemplated that a double sided stitch be used, a single sided stitch may also be used.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A 5 thread cover stitch provides several benefits over standard stitch patterns. In one aspect, the 5 thread cover seams are flat seams, compared to other seams which use extra fabric between the edge of the seam line and the edge of the fabric. The flat seams facing inside the suit help reduce chaffing on the wearer, and when facing outside (as they are double sided) the seam design minimizes drag in the water. In another aspect, 5 thread cover stitch provides maximum durability, as it is both strong but also flexible, allowing the fabric to stretch in use. of strength, durability, and comfort against the wearer's body. Additionally, due to the slim profile of the 5 thread cover stitch, the bulkiness, and therefore drag created in the water, will be limited.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, a close up view of a panel <b>140</b> having auxetic cuts <b>150</b> is shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, shows the auxetic cuts <b>150</b> when no stretching or bending is applied to the panel <b>140</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> shows the same view of a panel <b>140</b> having auxetic cuts <b>150</b> when a force is applied to the panels <b>140</b>. As can be seen, the auxetic cuts <b>150</b> allow additional stretch and flexibility in comparison to the normal characteristics of the panels <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> show one example of a shape of the auxetic cuts <b>150</b>, being a three-sided star. Other embodiments may have auxetic cuts <b>150</b> which are straight lines, moon shapes, X shapes, Y shapes, and the like. The orientation of the shape relative to the orientation of the panel <b>140</b> on the base layer <b>102</b> can provide specific flexibility in one or multiple directions. For example, an auxetic cut <b>150</b> in a straight line shape and extending in a vertical direction on the garment <b>100</b> can allow additional stretch in a horizontal direction, while if stretched vertically (longwise for the auxetic cut <b>150</b>) the stretching capability of the panel <b>150</b> remains relatively unchanged. Therefore, specific selection of the shape of the auxetic cuts <b>150</b> as well as size and depth of the auxetic cuts <b>150</b> can be based on desired range of motion in a particular area of the wearer's body. For example, the abdomen panels <b>140</b>A are located approximately in the abdomen region of the wearer&#x2014;an area of the body with a wide range of motion in rotating and bending. In such a region, the abdomen panels <b>140</b>A could have three-sided stars or a similar shape which allows additional stretching of the abdomen panels <b>140</b>A in multiple directions. The auxetic cuts <b>150</b> of a particular panel <b>140</b> or location on the wearer's body can also be determined based on what motion is necessary for a particular swimming stroke.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> show the auxetic cuts <b>150</b> extending fully through the panel <b>140</b> such that the underside of the panel <b>140</b> is visible and exposed when fully stretched. In alternative embodiments, the auxetic cuts <b>150</b> may only partially extend through the panel <b>140</b>, either on the outward facing side or the inward facing side. Selection of depth of the auxetic cuts <b>150</b> can vary to provide the panel <b>140</b> with more or less stretching ability. For example, an auxetic cut <b>150</b> that only extends partially through the panel <b>140</b> may provide additional stretch compared to a panel <b>140</b> not having any auxetic cuts <b>150</b>, but more than a panel <b>140</b> having auxetic cuts <b>150</b> extending all the way through the panel <b>140</b>. As such, the depth of the auxetic cut <b>150</b> can allow for specific selection of the desired stretch of a portion of a panel <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the images show experimental results of body position and posture difference when wearing the garment <b>100</b> compared to only a traditional training swimsuit.

More specifically, the results show the elastic straps <b>120</b> provide a force on the shoulders to push their posture to be straighter. As can be seen for example in the left-most images, the garment <b>100</b> applies pressure such that the wearers shoulders are rolled backward, the back of the wearer is straightened, and the chest is raised.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the images show experimental results of the garment <b>100</b> while worn in floating positions in the water. The upper row shows a test subject performing four different floating positions while in the water while only wearing a traditional training swimsuit. The second row shows the same test subject performing the same four floating positions while wearing the garment <b>100</b>. As such, each column represents the same floating position with and without the garment <b>100</b> being worn by the subject. As can be seen, for example in the left-most column of images, the test subject's legs without the garment <b>100</b> (the upper left photo) are angled downward deeper into the water. In contrast, the same floating position while wearing the garment <b>100</b> (the lower left photo) shows the test subject's legs being substantially raised in the water, and much more level with the water's surface. The torso and legs being raised in the water improves swimming forms by streamlining the body's position.
