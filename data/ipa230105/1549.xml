Further, there are installations where shorter (1 U, i.e., 44.45 mm) systems are sandwiched between deeper systems, making it difficult to access customer replaceable units (CRUs).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Particularly critical are power supplies, based on their use of a latch and safety feature that cannot be operated until the power cable is removed. A 1 U system is a component space too small, especially for larger hands, to reach, making it difficult to operate latches and locks. In these environments, release latches typically operate by pushing a tab sideways, perpendicular to the direction of extraction of the component.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a method for configuring a one-handed pull strap to a removeable component (RC), the method comprising: attaching a first end of a fixed-length strap to a handle on a RC, wherein the handle is employed to pull the RC from a chassis; encircling a release lever on the RC with a first end of a variable-length strap forming a loop in the first end of the variable-length strap, wherein the variable-length strap is connected to the fixed-length strap; and calibrating the loop diameter such that when pulling on a second end of the fixed-length strap, a pulling force is transferred to the variable-length strap for a distance sufficient to actuate the release lever without damage and then transferring the pulling force to the first end of the fixed length strap to pull the computer rack component from the computer rack.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus for a one-handed pull extractor of a removeable component (RC), the apparatus comprising: a first strap with a fixed-length loop in a first end; and a second strap with a first end connected to the first strap, and a fastener for creating a configurable length loop in a second end.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a system for a one-handed pull extractor of a removeable component (RC) from a RC chassis, the system comprising: a RC chassis; a RC; a first strap with a fixed-length loop in a first end; and a second strap with a first end connected to the first strap, and a fastener for creating a configurable length loop in a second end.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other aspects and embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, which, when taken in conjunction with the drawings, illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram depicting an adjustable length pull handle with a strap attached to a removeable unit, in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram of an adjustable length pull handle with a closed lanyard, i.e., girth hitch, attached to a removeable unit, in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method for configuring and attaching an adjustable length pull handle to a removeable unit, in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments described herein provide the capability to combine the two movements of releasing a latch and pulling a removeable component (RC) retained by a manually operated spring-loaded latch (MOSLL), e.g., a customer replaceable unit (CRU) out of a computer chassis, using only one pull-point when the direction of force applied to release the latch and the direction of the force applied to pull the RC from the chassis are effectively perpendicular to each other.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It should be noted that references throughout this specification to features, advantages, or similar language herein do not imply that all the features and advantages that may be realized with the embodiments disclosed herein should be, or are in, any single embodiment of the invention.

The loop can be of sufficient diameter to enclose a release latch <b>110</b> associated with the CRU <b>112</b> and any associated cords <b>114</b>. It should be noted that the loop <b>102</b> is not attached to the release latch <b>110</b> and engages the release latch <b>110</b> when the adjustable length pull handle <b>100</b> is pulled because the release latch <b>110</b> is captured within the loop <b>102</b>.
