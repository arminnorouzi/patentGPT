The sequence listing filed via EFS-Web is part of the specification and is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various bacterial species and bacterial strains are known to cause deleterious effects in wide-ranging systems. For example, pathogenic bacteria are known to cause disease in humans, animals, and plants. These pathogenic bacteria may be found, for example, in the digestive tract, urinary tract, respiratory tract, on or in leaves, stems, root tissues, fruits, and other tissues. Furthermore, pathogenic bacteria may be transmitted by insects or other organisms. Methods to selectively eliminate these pathogenic bacteria from the organisms that are harmed by their presence are highly desirable.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, various bacterial species and bacterial strains are known to grow on crop plants and other food products. These bacteria can cause adverse effects when the food products are consumed. Methods to selectively eliminate these pathogenic bacteria from the crops and other food products that serve as hosts for these harmful bacteria are highly desirable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Harmful bacteria are often controlled, for example, with antibiotic chemicals or with bacteriophages. These bacterial control methods are effective in many cases, but antibiotic resistant bacteria have emerged as important health threats and bacteriophage-based bacterial control methods may be hampered by an inability to sufficiently eliminate harmful bacteria. Improved methods for the elimination of harmful bacteria are highly desirable.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">CRISPR systems have been proposed as a possible technology that may be adapted to selectively eliminate unwanted and/or harmful bacteria (Gomaa et al (2014) mBio e00928-13), with a focus on Type I CRISPR systems because these CRISPR systems have a processive DNase activity wherein the CRISPR nuclease hybridizes with the targeted sequence, then processively degrades DNA following this hybridization, sometimes resulting in the near complete elimination of the targeted DNA molecule (e.g., a targeted plasmid, viral DNA molecule, circular bacterial genome, or other DNA molecule). While these properties of Type I CRISPR systems may be desirable in some applications, Type I CRISPR systems also have some drawbacks. For instance, Type I CRISPR systems are typically large, multi-component systems. Their size can make packaging of Type I CRISPR systems in commonly used plasmids, viral vectors, and other vectors difficult. Furthermore, Type I CRISPR systems may not show optimal activity in some of the bacterial strains and/or species that it may be desirable to eliminate. While CRISPR systems show promise in their ability to target and eliminate undesirable bacterial strains and/or species, alternatives to Type I CRISPR systems would be valuable. Cas9-based CRISPR systems have been explored for their ability to selectively eliminate bacteria (Citorik et al (2014) Nat Biotechnol 32:1141-1145; Bikard et al (2014) Nat Biotechnol 32:1146-1150; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/475,785); however these systems may be hampered by the mechanism of Cas9 nucleases. Because Cas9 nucleases make a single DSB, repair of this DSB may result in survival of the bacteria.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some Type V CRISPR enzymes have been shown to harbor a primary, sequence-specific, activity against a particular type of substrate; following this sequence-specific primary activity, the Type V enzyme is then able to access a secondary, collateral activity in a non-sequence-specific manner. As an example, Cpf1 (Cas12a) has been shown to harbor primary double-stranded break production activity against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). After Cpf1 hybridizes with and cleaves its primary target, the protein is then capable of cleaving single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in a non-sequence-specific manner (Chen et al (2018) Science 360:436-439). Other Type V CRISPR enzymes have been shown, for example, to harbor a primary activity against RNA, with secondary activities directed against RNA and ssDNA (Yan et al (2019) Science 363:88-91). The present invention describes the primary and secondary activities of Cms1 enzymes, a group of Type V CRISPR enzymes whose secondary activities can result in bacterial cell death.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Compositions and methods for selectively killing bacterial cells using Cms1 CRISPR systems are provided. The methods result in cell death for those bacterial cells that harbor particular pre-determined and targeted DNA sequences leaving other bacterial cells that do not comprise the targeted DNA sequences unharmed. Compositions comprise DNA constructs comprising nucleotide sequences that encode a Cms1 protein operably linked to a promoter that is operable in the cells of interest. In some embodiments, the compositions further comprise nucleotide sequences that encode at least one guide RNA that can interact with a Cms1 protein of the invention and can guide the Cms1 protein to bind with a pre-determined DNA sequence. In some embodiments, the compositions are part of a bacteriophage that is capable of infecting the bacterial cell(s) of interest. The DNA constructs comprising polynucleotide sequences that encode the Cms1 proteins of the invention, or the Cms1 proteins of the invention themselves, can be used to direct the Cms1 protein to hybridize with genomic DNA in a bacterial cell or cells of interest at pre-determined genomic loci, with this hybridization in turn leading to Cms1-mediated cell death. Methods to use these DNA constructs to selectively target and eliminate bacterial strains and/or species are described herein.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a phylogenetic tree drawn from a MUSCLE alignment of the Cms1 protein sequences of the present invention.

The CRISPR enzymes of the invention are selected from a Cms enzyme, e.g. a Cms1 ortholog or a mutated Cms1 enzyme. Cms1 is an abbreviation for CRISPR from Microgenomates and Smithella, and is so named because some bacterial species in these groups encode Cms1 nucleases; the terms Csm1 and Cms1 may be used interchangeably. Cms1 nucleases may also be referred to as Cas12f nucleases. The methods and compositions include nucleic acids to bind target DNA sequences. This is advantageous as nucleic acids are much easier and less expensive to produce than, for example, peptides, and the specificity can be varied according to the length of the stretch where homology is sought. Complex 3-D positioning of multiple fingers, for example is not required. In some preferred embodiments, the nucleic acids are guide polynucleotides such as guide RNAs (gRNAs; alternatively CRISPR RNAs or crRNAs) that are capable of interacting with a Cms1 enzyme and of hybridizing with a DNA sequence through base pairing. As used herein, guide RNAs that are capable of interacting or that are designed to interact with a Cms1 polypeptide can bind, associate with, or otherwise form a complex with the Cms1 polypeptide. Methods of measuring interaction of gRNAs with Cms1 polypeptide are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also provided are nucleic acids encoding the Cms1 polypeptides, as well as methods of using Cms1 polypeptides to target specific DNA sequences of bacterial host cells. The targeted DNA sequences may be present in genomic DNA, plasmid DNA, or other DNA elements harbored within the targeted bacterial cells. The Cms1 polypeptides interact with specific guide polynucleotides such as guide RNAs (gRNAs), which direct the Cms1 endonuclease to a specific target site. Without being limited by theory, the Cms1-gRNA complex hybridizes with the targeted DNA sequence (the &#x201c;initial hybridization event&#x201d;), at which site the Cms1 endonuclease introduces a double-stranded break (DSB). This process of hybridization and DSB production leads to a change in the structure of the Cms1 protein, resulting in a protein that is capable of degrading double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and/or RNA in a non-sequence-specific manner, leading to cell death. Since the specificity of the initial hybridization event is provided by the guide RNA, the Cms1 polypeptide is universal and can be used with different guide RNAs to target different genomic sequences. Cms1-associated CRISPR arrays are processed into mature crRNAs without the requirement of an additional trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA). Cms1 proteins can process crRNA arrays that include multiple spacer sequences; the compositions of the invention include, in some embodiments, crRNA arrays with multiple spacer sequences designed to target multiple different loci within the bacterial strain and/or bacterial species of interest. Cms1-gRNA systems can target DNA sequences adjacent to a variety of protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequences, with the PAM sequence located immediately 5&#x2032; of the DNA sequence targeted by Cms1. The initial hybridization event is sequence-specific with limited off target effects, resulting in sequence-specific killing of bacterial cells of interest without harming bacterial cells that do not harbor the sequence(s) of interest.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">I. Cms1 Endonucleases and Guide Polynucleotides</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Provided herein are Cms1 endonucleases, and fragments and variants thereof, for use in targeting sequences within bacterial cells, for example within genomic DNA, plasmids, or other DNA-containing elements found in bacterial cells. As used herein, the term Cms1 endonucleases or Cms1 polypeptides refers to homologs, orthologs, and variants of the Cms1 polypeptide sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs:41-160 and 340-341. Typically, Cms1 endonucleases can act without the use of tracrRNAs, requiring on a single gRNA for sequence specificity. In general, a Cms1-gRNA complex can perform an initial hybridization event to target a particular sequence. Without being limited by theory, following this initial hybridization event, the Cms1 protein is then able to perform a secondary collateral activity directed against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) or RNA without any sequence specificity. This collateral activity results in cell death in those cells in which the Cms1-gRNA complex undergoes an initial hybridization event. In general, Cms1 polypeptides comprise at least one RNA recognition and/or RNA binding domain. RNA recognition and/or RNA binding domains interact with guide RNAs. Typically the guide RNA comprises a region with a stem-loop structure that interacts with the Cms1 polypeptide. This stem-loop often comprises the sequence UCUACN3-5GUAGAU (SEQ ID NOs:35-37, encoded by SEQ ID NOs:38-40), with &#x201c;UCUAC&#x201d; and &#x201c;GUAGA&#x201d; base-pairing to form the stem of the stem-loop. N3-5 denotes that any base may be present at this location, and 3, 4, or 5 nucleotides may be included at this location. Some CRISPR nucleases have been shown to function with guide polynucleotides in which some of the ribonucleotide residues have been replaced by deoxyribonucleotide residues (Yin et al (2018) Nat Chem Biol 14:311-316; U.S. Pat. No. 9,650,617); the present invention also encompasses embodiments in which the guide polynucleotide is a guide RNA, embodiments in which the guide polynucleotide is a guide DNA, and embodiments in which the guide polynucleotide comprises both DNA and RNA residues. In specific embodiments, a Cms1 polypeptide, or a polynucleotide encoding a Cms1 polypeptide, comprises: an RNA-binding portion that interacts with the DNA-targeting RNA, and an activity portion that exhibits site-directed enzymatic activity, such as a RuvC endonuclease domain. Without being limited by theory, the RuvC endonuclease domain may also exhibit secondary, collateral activity directed against dsDNA and/or RNA in a non-sequence-specific manner.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Cms1 polypeptides can be wild type Cms1 polypeptides, modified Cms1 polypeptides, or a fragment of a wild type or modified Cms1 polypeptide. The Cms1 polypeptide can be modified to increase nucleic acid binding affinity and/or specificity, alter an enzymatic activity, and/or change another property of the protein. For example, nuclease (i.e., DNase, RNase) domains of the Cms1 polypeptide can be modified, deleted, or inactivated. Alternatively, the Cms1 polypeptide can be modified or truncated to alter or remove domains that are not essential for the function of the protein.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the Cms1 polypeptide can be derived from a wild type Cms1 polypeptide or fragment thereof. In other embodiments, the Cms1 polypeptide can be derived from a modified Cms1 polypeptide. For example, the amino acid sequence of the Cms1 polypeptide can be modified to alter one or more properties (e.g., nuclease activity, affinity, stability, solubility, etc.) of the protein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In general, a Cms1 polypeptide comprises at least one nuclease domain, but need not contain an HNH domain such as the one found in Cas9 proteins. For example, a Cms1 polypeptide can comprise a RuvC or RuvC-like nuclease domain. Without being limited by theory, the RuvC or RuvC-like domain may comprise three catalytic residues that are typically aspartate, glutamate, and aspartate, respectively, and may be responsible for the Cms1 nuclease activity.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the Cms1 polypeptide can comprise at least one cell-penetrating domain. The cell-penetrating domain can be located at the N-terminus, the C-terminus, or in an internal location of the protein.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In still other embodiments, the Cms1 polypeptide can also comprise at least one marker domain. Non-limiting examples of marker domains include fluorescent proteins, purification tags, and epitope tags. In certain embodiments, the marker domain can be a fluorescent protein. Non limiting examples of suitable fluorescent proteins include green fluorescent proteins (e.g., GFP, GFP-2, tagGFP, turboGFP, EGFP, Emerald, Azami Green, Monomeric Azami Green, CopGFP, AceGFP, ZsGreen1), yellow fluorescent proteins (e.g. YFP, EYFP, Citrine, Venus, YPet, PhiYFP, ZsYellowl), blue fluorescent proteins (e.g. EBFP, EBFP2, Azurite, mKalama1, GFPuv, Sapphire, T-sapphire), cyan fluorescent proteins (e.g. ECFP, Cerulean, CyPet, AmCyanl, Midoriishi-Cyan), red fluorescent proteins (mKate, mKate2, mPlum, DsRed monomer, mCherry, mRFP1, DsRed-Express, DsRed2, DsRed-Monomer, HcRed-Tandem, HcRed1, AsRed2, eqFP611, mRasberry, mStrawberry, Jred), and orange fluorescent proteins (mOrange, mKO, Kusabira-Orange, Monomeric Kusabira-Orange, mTangerine, tdTomato) or any other suitable fluorescent protein. In other embodiments, the marker domain can be a purification tag and/or an epitope tag. Exemplary tags include, but are not limited to, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), chitin binding protein (CBP), maltose binding protein, thioredoxin (TRX), poly(NANP), tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag, myc, AcV5, AU1, AU5, E, ECS, E2, FLAG, HA, nus, Softag 1, Softag 3, Strep, SBP, Glu-Glu, HSV, KT3, S, 51, T7, V5, VSV-G, 6&#xd7;His, biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), and calmodulin.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In certain embodiments, the Cms1 polypeptide may be part of a protein-RNA complex comprising a guide polynucleotide. In some embodiments, the guide polynucleotide may be a guide RNA. The guide polynucleotide interacts with the Cms1 polypeptide to direct the Cms1 polypeptide to a specific target site in a bacterial cell, where the target site comprises dsDNA that may be present in genomic DNA, plasmid DNA, or other DNA components in a bacterial cell of interest. If a suitable protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence is present immediately 5&#x2032; of the target sequence, the Cms1-guide polynucleotide complex may hybridize with the dsDNA target sequence. Following this initial hybridization event, the Cms1 enzyme may cleave the target DNA. Without being limited by theory, the Cms1 enzyme may then undergo a structural change that may allow the Cms1 enzyme to cleave dsDNA and/or RNA in a non-sequence-specific manner (&#x201c;secondary&#x201d; or &#x201c;collateral&#x201d; activity).

In this manner, methods such as PCR, hybridization, and the like can be used to identify such sequences based on their sequence homology or identity to the sequences set forth herein. Sequences isolated based on their sequence identity to the entire Cms1 sequences set forth herein or to variants and fragments thereof are encompassed by the present invention. Such sequences include sequences that are orthologs of the disclosed Cms1 sequences. &#x201c;Orthologs&#x201d; is intended to mean genes derived from a common ancestral gene and which are found in different species as a result of speciation. Genes found in different species are considered orthologs when their nucleotide sequences and/or their encoded protein sequences share at least about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, or greater sequence identity.

Thus, the determination of percent sequence identity between any two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. Non-limiting examples of such mathematical algorithms are the algorithm of Myers and Miller (1988) <i>CABIOS </i>4:11-17; the local alignment algorithm of Smith et al. (1981) <i>Adv. Appl.

Alignments using these programs can be performed using the default parameters. The CLUSTAL program is well described by Higgins et al. (1988) <i>Gene </i>73:237-244; Higgins et al.

The ALIGN program is based on the algorithm of Myers and Miller (1988) supra. A PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used with the ALIGN program when comparing amino acid sequences. The MUSCLE algorithm for multiple sequence alignment may be used for comparisons of multiple nucleic acid or protein sequences (Edgar (2004) <i>Nucleic Acids Research </i>32:1792-1797). The BLAST programs of Altschul et al (1990) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>215:403 are based on the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990) supra. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the BLASTN program, score=100, wordlength=12, to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the BLASTX program, score=50, wordlength=3, to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein or polypeptide of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>25:3389. Alternatively, PSI-BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can be used to perform an iterated search that detects distant relationships between molecules. See Altschul et al. (1997) supra. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, PSI-BLAST, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., BLASTN for nucleotide sequences, BLASTX for proteins) can be used.

A &#x201c;codon-optimized gene&#x201d; is a gene having its frequency of codon usage designed to mimic the frequency of preferred codon usage of the host cell. Nucleic acid molecules can be codon optimized, either wholly or in part. Because any one amino acid (except for methionine and tryptophan) is encoded by a number of codons, the sequence of the nucleic acid molecule may be changed without changing the encoded amino acid.

In some embodiments, these methods result in the partial or complete killing and elimination of the bacterial cell or cells into which the Cms1 or encoding polynucleotide and guide polynucleotide have been introduced. For example, the methods described herein can result in a 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 50%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 100% or 5-20%, 25-50%, 50-60%, 60-75%, 50-80%, 80-90%, 80-95%, 80-99%, 90-95%, 90-99%, or more decrease in the viable bacterial population in which the Cms1 or encoding polynucleotide and guide polynucleotide have been introduced. Bacterial cell viability can be measured by any method known in the art, including plate count (e.g., CFU, CFU/g, CFU/mL), turbidity measurement, cell lysis, or any other method known in the art.

In some embodiments, the Cms1 polypeptide can be introduced into the bacterial cell as an isolated protein. In such embodiments, the Cms1 polypeptide can further comprise at least one cell-penetrating domain, which facilitates cellular uptake of the protein. In some embodiments, the Cms1 polypeptide can be introduced into the bacterial cell as a nucleoprotein in complex with a guide polynucleotide (for instance, as a ribonucleoprotein in complex with a guide RNA). In other embodiments, the Cms1 polypeptide can be introduced into the genome host as an mRNA molecule that encodes the Cms1 polypeptide. In still other embodiments, the Cms1 polypeptide can be introduced into the bacterial cell or cells as a DNA molecule comprising an open reading frame that encodes the Cms1 polypeptide. In general, DNA sequences encoding the Cms1 polypeptide or fusion protein described herein are operably linked to a promoter sequence that will function in the bacterial cell or cells of interest. The DNA sequence can be linear, or the DNA sequence can be part of a vector. In still other embodiments, the Cms1 polypeptide can be introduced into the bacterial cell or cells as an RNA-protein complex comprising the guide RNA. In certain embodiments, the Cms1 polypeptide, Cms1-gRNA ribonucleoprotein complex, and/or Cms1-encoding polynucleotide can be introduced into the bacterial cell or cells of interest via nanoparticle-aided transformation (Kumari et al 2017 FEMS Microbiol Lett 364:fnx081; French 2019 BioRxiv dx.doi.org/10.1101/559252).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In certain embodiments, DNA encoding the Cms1 polypeptide can further comprise a sequence encoding one or more guide RNAs. In general, each of the sequences encoding the Cms1 polypeptide and the guide RNA(s) is operably linked to one or more appropriate promoter sequences that enable expression of the Cms1 polypeptide and the guide RNA(s), respectively, in the bacterial cell or cells of interest. The DNA sequence encoding the Cms1 polypeptide and the guide RNA(s) can further comprise additional expression control, regulatory, and/or processing sequence(s). The DNA sequence encoding the Cms1 polypeptide and the guide RNA(s) can be linear or can be part of a vector.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Methods described herein further can also comprise introducing into a bacterial cell or cells at least one guide RNA or DNA encoding at least one polynucleotide such as a guide RNA. A guide RNA interacts with the Cms1 polypeptide to direct the Cms1 polypeptide to a specific target site, at which site the guide RNA base pairs with a specific DNA sequence in the targeted site. Guide RNAs can comprise three regions: a first region that is complementary to the target site in the targeted DNA sequence, a second region that forms a stem loop structure, and a third region that remains essentially single-stranded. The first region of each guide RNA is different such that each guide RNA guides a Cms1 polypeptide to a specific target site. The second and third regions of each guide RNA can be the same in all guide RNAs.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">One region of the guide RNA is complementary to a sequence (i.e., protospacer sequence) at the target site in the targeted DNA such that the first region of the guide RNA can base pair with the target site. In various embodiments, the first region of the guide RNA can comprise from about 8 nucleotides to more than about 30 nucleotides. For example, the region of base pairing between the first region of the guide RNA and the target site in the nucleotide sequence can be about 8, about 9, about 10, about 11, about 12, about 13, about 14, about 15, about 16, about 17, about 18, about 19, about 20, about 22, about 23, about 24, about 25, about 27, about 30 or more than 30 nucleotides in length. In an exemplary embodiment, the first region of the guide RNA is about 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 nucleotides in length. The guide RNA also can comprise a second region that forms a secondary structure. In some embodiments, the secondary structure comprises a stem or hairpin. The length of the stem can vary. For example, the stem can range from about 5, to about 6, to about 10, to about 15, to about 20, to about 25 base pairs in length. The stem can comprise one or more bulges of 1 to about 10 nucleotides. In some preferred embodiments, the hairpin structure comprises the sequence UCUACN3-5GUAGAU (SEQ ID NOs:35-37, encoded by SEQ ID NOs:38-40), with &#x201c;UCUAC&#x201d; and &#x201c;GUAGA&#x201d; base-pairing to form the stem. &#x201c;N3-5&#x201d; indicates 3, 4, or 5 nucleotides. Thus, the overall length of the second region can range from about 14 to about 25 nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments, the loop is about 3, 4, or 5 nucleotides in length and the stem comprises about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 base pairs.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The guide RNA can also comprise a third region that remains essentially single-stranded. Thus, the third region has no complementarity to any nucleotide sequence in the cell of interest and has no complementarity to the rest of the guide RNA. The length of the third region can vary. In general, the third region is more than about 4 nucleotides in length. For example, the length of the third region can range from about 5 to about 60 nucleotides in length. The combined length of the second and third regions (also called the universal or scaffold region) of the guide RNA can range from about 30 to about 120 nucleotides in length. In one aspect, the combined length of the second and third regions of the guide RNA range from about 40 to about 45 nucleotides in length.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a preferred embodiment, the guide RNA comprises a single molecule comprising all three regions. In other embodiments, the guide RNA can comprise two separate molecules. The first RNA molecule can comprise the first region of the guide RNA and one half of the &#x201c;stem&#x201d; of the second region of the guide RNA. The second RNA molecule can comprise the other half of the &#x201c;stem&#x201d; of the second region of the guide RNA and the third region of the guide RNA. Thus, in this embodiment, the first and second RNA molecules each contain a sequence of nucleotides that are complementary to one another. For example, in one embodiment, the first and second RNA molecules each comprise a sequence (of about 6 to about 25 nucleotides) that base pairs to the other sequence to form a functional guide RNA. In specific embodiments, the guide RNA is a single molecule (i.e., crRNA) that interacts with the target site in the chromosome and the Cms1 polypeptide without the need for a second guide RNA (i.e., a tracrRNA).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In certain embodiments, the guide RNA(s) can be introduced into the bacterial cell as an RNA molecule. The RNA molecule can be transcribed in vitro. Alternatively, the RNA molecule can be chemically synthesized.

In these CRISPR arrays, the direct repeat sequences represent the portion of the gRNA that is recognized by Cms1. The direct repeat is processed by Cms1 enzymes to generate mature crRNAs that associate with the Cms1 protein to form the ribonucleoprotein complex that hybridizes with the targeted sequences in the bacterial cell(s) of interest. Direct repeat sequences for use with Cms1 enzymes may take the form, for example, of one or more of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs:35-40. In some embodiments, multiple guide RNAs may be designed to target multiple target sequences in the bacterial cell(s) of interest and may be introduced into the bacterial cell(s) of interest in the form of a CRISPR array in which the mature gRNAs are processed by ribozymes or by tRNA processing pathways (WO 2019/138052; Port and Bullock (2016) BioRxiv dx.doi.org/10.1101/046417).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The DNA molecule encoding the Cms1 enzyme and/or the guide RNA(s) can be linear or circular.

In an exemplary embodiment, the DNA encoding the Cms1 enzyme and/or the guide RNA(s) is present in a plasmid vector. Non-limiting examples of suitable plasmid vectors include pUC, pBR322, pET, pBluescript, pCAMBIA, and variants thereof.

The cleavage site can be located anywhere within the target sequence. Without being limited by theory, this initial hybridization event triggers a conformational change in the Cms1 polypeptide that allows the Cms1 polypeptide to degrade RNA and/or dsDNA in a non-sequence-specific manner. The target site has no sequence limitation except that the sequence is immediately preceded (upstream) by a consensus sequence. This consensus sequence is also known as a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Examples of PAM sequences include, but are not limited to, TTTN, NTTN, TTTV, and NTTV (wherein N is defined as any nucleotide and V is defined as A, G, or C). It is well-known in the art that a suitable PAM sequence must be located at the correct location relative to the targeted DNA sequence to allow the Cms1 nuclease to produce the desired double-stranded break. For all Cms1 nucleases characterized to date, the PAM sequence is located immediately 5&#x2032; of the targeted DNA sequence. Thus, the targeted sequence is immediately downstreatm (3&#x2032;) of the PAM sequence. The PAM site requirements for a given Cms1 nuclease cannot at present be predicted computationally, and instead must be determined experimentally using methods available in the art (Zetsche et al. (2015) <i>Cell </i>163:759-771; Marshall et al. (2018) <i>Mol Cell </i>69:146-157). It is well-known in the art that PAM sequence specificity for a given nuclease enzyme is affected by enzyme concentration (Karvelis et al. (2015) <i>Genome Biol </i>16:253). Thus, modulating the concentrations of Cms1 protein delivered to the cell or in vitro system of interest represents a way to alter the PAM site requirements associated with that Cms1 enzyme. Modulating Cms1 protein concentration in the system of interest may be achieved, for instance, by altering the promoter used to express the Cms1-encoding gene, by altering the concentration of ribonucleoprotein delivered to the cell or in vitro system, or by adding or removing introns that may play a role in modulating gene expression levels. As detailed herein, the first region of the guide RNA is complementary to the protospacer of the target sequence. Typically, the first region of the guide RNA is about 19 to 25 nucleotides in length.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The target site can be in the coding region of a gene, in an intron of a gene, in a control region of a gene, in a non-coding region between genes, etc. The gene can be a protein coding gene or an RNA coding gene. The gene can be any gene of interest as described herein. Cms1 collateral activity against RNA and/or dsDNA may be activated through an in initial hybridization event with any DNA sequence(s) in the bacterial cell(s) of interest as long as a suitable PAM site is located 5&#x2032; of the target sequence(s).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the Cms1 protein, or Cms1 protein-encoding polynucleotide, and guide RNA(s), or DNA encoding the guide RNA(s), are introduced into a plurality of bacterial cells with the guide RNA(s) designed to target sequences that are present only in a certain fraction of the cells. In some embodiments, this will result in the elimination or reduction of those cells that comprise the targeted sequence(s) that the guide RNA(s) are designed to hybridize with.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">By &#x201c;predetermined&#x201d; or &#x201c;targeted sequence&#x201d; is intended a nucleotide (e.g., DNA or RNA) sequence in the microbe of interest that is unique to that microbe.

Enrichment of Cell Types</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The compositions and methods of the present invention may be used to reduce or eliminate the presence of cells that comprise undesirable DNA sequence(s). In some embodiments, the compositions and methods of the present invention may be used to enrich for cells, cell lines, cell types, or other groupings of cells that do not comprise undesirable DNA sequence(s). Enrichment of certain cell types may be desirable, for example, following genome editing experiments or other experiments designed to modify certain known regions of a genome or other DNA molecule. In such embodiments, the genome editing experiment may be performed to produce a desired genomic modification, resulting in a pool of cells in which a portion of the cells remain wild-type while a portion of the cells comprises the desired DNA sequence modification(s). The compositions and methods of the present invention may be used to target, through the appropriate design of guide RNA(s) or other guide polynucleotides designed to hybridize with wild-type, but not with modified sequences. Introduction of a Cms1 polypeptide, or encoding polynucleotide, along with one or more appropriately designed guide RNA(s) or encoding DNA molecules, into the pool of cells (for example through the use of engineered phages or phagemids, or through the use of conjugative plasmids), results in an initial hybridization event in cells that retain the undesirable wild-type sequence(s). This initial hybridization event triggers secondary, collateral activity of the Cms1 enzyme targeted against dsDNA and/or RNA, resulting in cell death among those cells that comprise the undesirable wild-type sequence(s). The result of the targeted elimination of wild-type cells is the enrichment of cells in the cell pool that comprise the desired DNA sequence(s). Such experiments may be used, for example, to increase the likelihood of identifying and recovering cells that comprise a desirable allele or other genetic sequence, particularly in cases when such a desirable allele is relatively rare among the cells in the cell pool prior to introduction of the Cms1 polypeptide and guide RNA(s) or guide polynucleotides.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">All publications and patent applications mentioned in the specification are indicative of the level of skill of those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains.

The linear PCR products obtained with these primers were ligated to create a plasmid library. The ligation reactions were cleaned by ethanol precipitation and electroporated into <i>E. coli </i>TOP10 cells. Electroporation efficiency was verified by plating. The number of transformed cells exceeded the number of possible PAM combinations by approximately 2,500-fold. The recovered transformants were grown overnight with antibiotic selection (kanamycin) in 100 mL LB medium and harvested by centrifugation (4,000 g for 30 minutes). The targeted PAM plasmid library was purified from the pellet using MIDI Kit (Zymo Research, D4201) and cleaned by ethanol precipitation.

Before these cells were made electrocompetent, expression of the nuclease and the crRNA from the separate T7 promoters was induced using arabinose and IPTG. As a control reaction, a plasmid containing the SulfCms1 nuclease but no repeat-spacer sequence (pOD49 (SEQ ID NO:339)) was used. Electroporation efficiency was verified by plating. The number of transformed cells exceeded the number of possible PAM combinations by approximately 1,700 and 11,340-fold for the targeting treatment compared to the control, respectively. Plasmid DNA was purified from the overnight cultures. The plasmid locus containing the PAMs was PCR amplified using primers ODpr0055_PAM_Illumina_F and ODpr0056_PAM_Illumina_R. The PCR products were cleaned up with AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, A63882). The cleaned PCR products were indexed for primers having the sequences described by SEQ ID NOs:334-337 (Table 1) and cleaned once more using the AMPure beads. The final DNA amount in the resulting PCR reactions was quantified using DeNovix dsDNA Broad Range Kit (DeNovix), pooled, and sent for sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq paired-end 300 platform. The sequence data was analyzed as described previously (Leenay et al (2016) Mol Cell 62:137-147). Two biological replicates per treatment were sequenced. The sequencing data showed that SulfCms1 efficiently recognized a variety of PAM sites. These PAM sites are summarized in Table 2.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE&#x2003;2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>PAM&#x2003;sites&#x2003;recognized&#x2003;by&#x2003;SulfCms1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>NACTV</entry><entry>KGCTC</entry><entry>RTCSV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>NATVR</entry><entry>NGTRR</entry><entry>YTCGA</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BATCC</entry><entry>NGTCV</entry><entry>VTCTN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>YATGC</entry><entry>TGTGC</entry><entry>TTCTR</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>NATTN</entry><entry>NGTTN</entry><entry>NTGTV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>NCCTR</entry><entry>ATARG</entry><entry>ATTAT</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>NCTMR</entry><entry>RTACR</entry><entry>DTTCN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>VCTCC</entry><entry>NTATV</entry><entry>CTTCK</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>NCTKV</entry><entry>HTCAR</entry><entry>NTTRV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>NGCTR</entry><entry>ATCAC</entry><entry>ATTGT</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>NTTTN</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0078" num="0071">The PAM sites listed in Table 2 that are recognized by SulfCms1 represent 288 of the 1,024 PAM sequences in the five base pair PAM library.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0072">To validate the results of the PAM library screen, individual PAM sequences were tested in the same co-transformation screen to test whether the PAM sites could be efficiently recognized by SulfCms1.
