id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to an extracellular matrix scaffold derived from allogeneic or heterologous adipose tissue and a method of producing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to an extracellular matrix scaffold derived from allogeneic or heterologous adipose tissue, which has a porous structure having components similar to the human body, a wide surface area, and interconnected pores, so it can have high cell affinity and allow cells to survive for a long time, and a method of producing the same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">Regenerative medicine aims to replace or regenerate human cells, tissue, and organs. Physical trauma that causes tissue damage and functional loss and the emergence of new diseases caused by the advancement of society provide the inevitable motivation for more rapid development of the field of regenerative medicine.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Medical materials used in the field of regenerative medicine have to be deliberately selected according to the type of tissue or organ to be applied to, the type of disease or trauma, and a patient's medical history. Typically, materials most frequently selected for research are heterologous collagen and gelatin, microorganism-derived hyaluronic acid, chitosan, a vegetable cellulose-based polymer, and vegetable alginate. In addition, allogeneic materials that can be obtained from human corpses are also attracting attention as effective biomaterials that can be safely used in the field of regenerative medicine.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Safety, effectiveness, and economic/industrial interests of, particularly, adipose tissue among biomaterials are growing at home and abroad. Adipose tissue is a loose connective tissue composed of adipocytes, preadipocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and various immune cells. Adipose tissue contains an extracellular matrix such as collagen, elastin, laminin, fibronectin, or glycosaminoglycan. An extracellular matrix not only helps the support and proliferation of cells in tissue in the body but also maintains the composition of tissue by binding with cells, resulting in helping in the recovery of a damaged area of the body.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">The allogeneic or heterologous adipose tissue-derived extracellular matrix is being studied in terms of various scaffolds for the replacement and reinforcement of damaged human tissue, and cell culture. Recently, in preclinical trials, it has been reported that adipose tissue-derived extracellular matrix scaffolds affect the repair of defective tissue. In addition, it has been reported that the adipose tissue-derived extracellular matrix scaffolds affect the growth of cells, which is due to their porous structure and components.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">However, these allogeneic or heterologous adipose tissue-derived extracellular matrix scaffolds are generally produced using a combination of a surfactant and an enzyme. However, this conventional production method collapses the porous structure of the extracellular matrix and inhibits cell growth, which is the purpose of a scaffold. In addition, this method has a disadvantage in that a long-term production process is required.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">RELATED ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0007">1.

The extracellular matrix may have different components according to the type of cell or the degree of cell differentiation, and consist of a fibrous protein such as collagen or elastin, a complex protein such as proteoglycan or glycosaminoglycan, and a cell-adhesion glycoprotein such as fibronectin or laminin.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">In one embodiment, the adipose tissue may be an allogeneic or heterologous adipose tissue. The &#x201c;allogeneic&#x201d; means human-derived, and the &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d; means being derived from animals other than a human, that is, mammals such as a pig, a cow or a horse, and fish.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">That is, in the present invention, the extracellular matrix may be produced according to the production method of the present invention using allogeneic or heterologous adipose tissue.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">In the present invention, before the delipidation step, a washing step may be performed. In the washing step, the adipose tissue may be washed with sterile distilled water. Through this step, impurities in the adipose tissue may be removed.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">In the present invention, the delipidation step is a step of removing a lipid component from adipose tissue.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">In one embodiment, delipidation means the removal of a lipid component from tissue.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">In one embodiment, the removal of a lipid component may be performed by physical treatment or chemical treatment, or a combination of the physical and chemical treatments. When the physical and chemical treatments are performed in combination, the order of performance is not limited.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">In one embodiment, the type of physical treatment is not particularly limited, and the physical treatment may be performed through pulverization. The pulverization may be performed using a pulverizing means that is known in the art, such as a mixer, a homogenizer, a freezing grinder, an ultrasonic grinder, a hand blender, or a plunger mill.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">In pulverization, the particle diameter of the pulverized product, that is, pulverized adipose tissue may be 0.01 to 1 mm.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">In one embodiment, the type of chemical treatment is not particularly limited, and the chemical treatment may be performed using a delipidation solution. The delipidation solution may include a polar solvent, a non-polar solvent, or a mixed solvent thereof. The polar solvent may be water, alcohol, or a mixed solvent thereof, and the alcohol, methanol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol may be used. The non-polar solvent may be heptane, octane, or a mixed solution thereof. Specifically, in the present invention, as a delipidation solution, a mixed solution of isopropyl alcohol and hexane may be used. Here, a mixing ratio of isopropyl alcohol and hexane may be 40:60 to 60:40.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">The treatment time of the delipidation solution may be 4 to 30 hours or 10 to 20 hours.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">In one embodiment, the delipidation step may be performed by sequentially applying physical treatment and chemical treatment. The lipid component may be first eliminated from the adipose tissue through physical treatment, and the lipid component that is not eliminated by the physical treatment may be removed by chemical treatment.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">In the present invention, the decellularization step may be a step of removing cells from the adipose tissue from which the lipid component is removed in the delipidation step.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">In one embodiment, decellularization means the removal of other cell components excluding the extracellular matrix from the tissue, for example, the nucleus, the cell membrane, nucleic acids, and the like.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">In one embodiment, the decellularization may be performed using a basic solution, and as the basic solution, one or more selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, and ammonia may be used. In the present invention, as the basic solution, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) may be used. Conventionally, decellularization was performed using a surfactant and an enzyme. However, in this case, the finally produced extracellular matrix scaffold had problems of not maintaining porosity in its structure and inhibiting cell growth.

In the above time range, an extracellular matrix scaffold having a structure from which cells are easily removed and which has interconnected pores and does not collapse may be produced.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">In the present invention, after the decellularization step, a centrifugation step may be further performed before the lyophilization step. Through the centrifugation step, impurities generated in the delipidation step and the decellularization step may be removed, and a high purity extracellular matrix material (precipitate) may be obtained.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">In one embodiment, the centrifugation may be performed at 4,000 to 10,000 rpm, or 8,000 rpm for 5 to 30 minutes, 5 to 20 minutes, or 10 minutes.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">In addition, before and/or after centrifugation, a washing step may be additionally performed, and for washing, sterile distilled water may be used.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In the present invention, the lyophilization step is a step of lyophilizing the product obtained after the above-described step, that is, the decellularization or centrifugation step. The lyophilization is a method of rapidly cooling the tissue that is in a frozen state and absorbing moisture under a vacuum, and through the lyophilization, the moisture in the extracellular matrix material may be adjusted, and an extracellular matrix scaffold having a porous structure having interconnected pores may be produced.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">In one embodiment, the lyophilization may be performed at &#x2212;50 to &#x2212;80 &#xb0; C. for 24 to 96 hours.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">In one embodiment, the water content of the lyophilized extracellular matrix scaffold may be 10% or less, or 1 to 8%.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">In the present invention, after the lyophilization step, a sterilization step of sterilizing the extracellular matrix scaffold may be further performed.
