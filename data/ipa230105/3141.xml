Further, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a turbo system, e.g. a turbocharger or turbo compound, having a centering device as described in the present disclosure. Additionally, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a method of centering a turbine housing, particularly by using a centering device as described herein.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Typical turbo systems are turbochargers or turbo compounds. Today, exhaust gas turbochargers are widely used to increase the performance of internal combustion engines. An exhaust gas turbocharger typically has a turbine in the exhaust tract of the internal combustion engine and a compressor upstream of the internal combustion engine. The exhaust gas of the internal combustion engine is expanded in the turbine. The work gained is transferred by a shaft to the compressor, which compresses the air supplied to the internal combustion engine. By using the energy of the exhaust gas to compress the air supplied to the combustion process in the internal combustion engine, the combustion process and the efficiency of the internal combustion engine can be optimized. A turbo-compound engine is a reciprocating engine that employs a turbine to recover energy from the exhaust gases. Instead of using that energy to drive a turbocharger, the energy is instead sent to the output shaft to increase the total power delivered by the engine.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, a turbo system, e.g. a turbocharger or a turbo compound, include a turbine, particularly a radial turbine, encased in a turbine housing. The turbine housing has to be centered with respect to a central axis of the radial turbine. Typically, centering of the turbine housing is done by hot-gas centering, e.g. over a heat-shield or a nozzle ring provided between the turbine housing and the bearing housing. Conventional heat centering methods have the problem that equally fast heat transfer from exhaust gas to the heat centering element, e.g. a heat shield, cannot be assured, such that for transient operation conditions larger clearances between turbine wheel and turbine casing arc required. However, larger clearances between turbine wheel and turbine casing have a detrimental effect on the turbine efficiency.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, in view of the above, there is a demand for providing an improved centering of the turbine housing.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In light of the above, a centering device for centering a turbine housing, a turbo system including a centering device as described herein, and a method of centering a turbine housing according to the independent claims are provided. Further aspects, advantages, and features are apparent from the dependent claims, the description, and the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a centering device for centering a turbine housing with respect to a central axis of a radial turbine of a turbo system is provided.

Additionally, the centering device includes two or more centering elements provided on a side surface of the ring-shaped body. The two or more centering elements are configured for engaging with respective complementary centering elements provided on a bearing housing. The two or more centering elements are configured for allowing a radial thermal expansion of the ring-shaped body during engagement of the two or more centering elements with the respective complementary centering elements.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, compared to the state of the art, the centering device of the present disclosure provides for an improved centering of a turbine housing with respect to a central axis of a radial turbine.

Unless specified otherwise, the description of a part or aspect in one embodiment can apply to a corresponding part or aspect in another embodiment as well.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of a turbo system <b>100</b> having a radial turbine <b>35</b> and a heat shield <b>62</b> for centering a turbine housing <b>40</b> according to the prior art. The radial turbine <b>35</b> includes a turbine housing <b>40</b>, a shaft <b>34</b> which is mounted in a bearing housing <b>20</b> and on which a turbine wheel <b>30</b> with rotor blades <b>31</b> is provided. Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a heat shield <b>62</b> and a nozzle ring <b>61</b> arranged between the turbine housing <b>40</b> and the bearing housing <b>20</b>. According to the prior art, as exemplarily shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, hot-gas centering of the turbine housing is conducted via the heat shield. The shield shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> has a cold centering element <b>63</b> and two hot centering elements <b>64</b>. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> it is to be understood that at low temperatures the turbine housing <b>40</b> is centered via the cold centering element <b>63</b> whereas at high temperatures, i.e. upon thermal expansion of the heat shield <b>62</b>, the turbine housing is centered via the hot centering elements <b>64</b>. However, from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> it is to be understood that at transient operating condition, i.e. during start-up of the turbine, the centering may not be optimal due to uneven thermal expansion throughout the heat shield. Further, as exemplarily shown in the prior art according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, conventionally there is a void <b>65</b> between the nozzle ring <b>61</b> and the heat shield <b>62</b>, which may be detrimental for the heat transfer from exhaust gas to the heat shield for realizing the hot-centering.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With exemplary reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, a centering device <b>10</b> for centering a turbine housing <b>40</b> with respect to a central axis <b>33</b> of a radial turbine of a turbo system is described.

In particular, the inner diameter D<b>2</b> of the ring-shaped body <b>11</b> typically provides a central opening <b>14</b>. Typically, centering of the turbine housing at transient and hot operation conditions is realized via the outer radial shell surface, i.e. at the outer diameter D<b>1</b>, of the ring-shaped body.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is to be understood that typically the centering device as described herein is a separate device. In other words, typically the centering device as described herein is not part of the bearing housing or of the turbine housing.

Alternatively, the first planar guiding surfaces <b>17</b> of the two or more centering elements <b>16</b> may be inclined with respect to each other. In particular, the first planar guiding surfaces <b>17</b> may be inclined towards the center C of the inner diameter of the ring shaped body <b>11</b>, as exemplarily shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to an example, which may be combined with other embodiments described herein, the first planar guiding surfaces <b>17</b> are arranged on opposite sides of the guiding elements <b>16</b>, wherein one of the first planar guiding surfaces <b>17</b> has a first surface normal NI directed in a clockwise circumferential direction and the other one of the first planar guiding surfaces <b>17</b> has a second surface normal N<b>2</b> directed in an anti-clockwise circumferential direction of the ring-shaped main body <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Accordingly, as exemplarily shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, opposite surfaces of the complementary second planar guiding surfaces <b>18</b> of the one or more of the respective complementary centering elements <b>21</b> can be parallel to each other or inclined with respect to each other such that a relative movement of the two or more centering elements <b>16</b> with respect to the respective complementary centering elements <b>21</b> during thermal expansion of the ring shaped body <b>11</b> of the centering device can be realized.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to an alternative example, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, one or more of the two or more centering elements <b>16</b> may have a round shape (not explicitly shown).
