More particularly, the invention relates to an optical device and method for measuring the flow rate of a fluid containing particles.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many fluid processing systems involve moving fluid through one or more sections of conduit, pipe, or what generally will be referred to herein as tubing, regardless of the rigidity or material used to construct the tubing. Examples of fluid processing systems having fluids flowing through tubing include, for example, various blood processing systems that make it possible to collect particular blood constituents. For instance, whole blood typically is separated into its constituents (e.g., red cells, platelets, and plasma) through centrifugation, such as in the AMICUS&#xae; separator system from Fenwal, Inc., of Lake Zurich, Ill., which is an affiliate of Fresenius Kabi A G of Bad Homburg, Germany, or other centrifugal apheresis separation devices, or a spinning membrane-type separators, such as the AUTOPHERESIS-C&#xae; and AURORA&#xae; devices from Fenwal, Inc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the challenges with a fluid processing system is measuring fluid flow at different points within the system. This can be particularly difficult due to the type of fluids being processed. Current devices for blood processing tend to rely on pump stroke volume calculations and/or weight scale readings to estimate flow rates. At times, these techniques may have undesirable variability. Alternatively, ultrasound sensors may be considered for use, but the high cost of ultrasound flow measurement has been cost prohibitive, for example, when seeking to design cost-effective apheresis devices. Therefore, there is a need for a relatively low-cost, non-invasive sensor capable of measuring flow rates of fluids containing particles, such as for use in apheresis systems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It should be noted that optical based sensors historically have been applied in apheresis systems to non-invasively monitor the particle or cellular content of fluid within a vessel or tubing, such as cell or free Hemoglobin (HGB) concentrations, using light transmission or reflection-based techniques. Examples of reflection sensing devices are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,164,078 and 10,893,829, which are owned by the present Applicant and incorporated herein in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It may be of significant benefit for fluid processing systems to employ optical sensors. However, it generally has been known that with apheresis systems transmission-based measurements are not effective for most cell concentrations handled by such systems. For instance, the cell content of whole blood (WB) or of packed red blood cells (RBCs) prevents measurable light from transmitting through the fluid. As such, it is generally believed that transmission-based optical sensors may not function well with fluids such as WB or RBCs. However, such sensors do work very well with platelet concentrate (PC) or platelet rich plasma (PRP).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present subject matter has a number of aspects which may be used in various combinations, in various fluid processing systems and the disclosure of one or more specific embodiments is for the purpose of disclosure and description, and not limitation. This summary highlights only a few of the aspects of this subject matter, and additional aspects are disclosed in the drawings and the more detailed description that follows.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the present invention, light reflection measurements are utilized as the foundation of a device and method to measure the flow rate of a fluid containing cellular, or more generally, particle content. It may be possible to use non-invasive optical sensors to apply light transmission measurements with specific fluid types. The method requires the cell content to be high enough to detect changes in reflection and thus the method will be most effective with fluids such as WB and packed RBCs, and may not function well with fluid such as PC or PRP, although the method shall not be limited to red blood cell containing fluids. Red cell containing fluids have cell concentrations on the order of 10{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}6/uL, whereas platelet containing fluids have cell concentrations on the order of 10{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}3/uL. By way of the present application, a method is provided for measuring fluid flow using a light source and non-invasive optical sensor, for example, as part of a blood processing procedure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Importantly, the present device and method make use of certain properties of fluid flow. For instance, when fluid flows through a tubing, a laminar flow velocity profile is formed. This is shown, for example, in a diagram of a tubing cross-section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Velocity streamlines of the laminar flow profile are useful in explaining the present invention. It will be appreciated that the shear stresses in the diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> represent the forces that act upon a particle during fluid flow in such a tubing. At the tubing walls, where shear stress is largest, a no-slip condition exists in which the fluid velocity is zero. Moving toward the center of the tubing, the velocity increases with a maximum velocity streamline in the center where the shear stress is nearly zero. When cells are present in the fluid, the streamlines will force the cells to the center of the tubing, where the velocity is greatest and the shear stress is lowest. Faster flow rates lead to a greater concentration of cells in the central streamlines.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An example cell distribution profile in the fluid path is shown in the diagram of the tubing cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> for a relatively slower fluid flow rate that congregates cells toward the center, but still contains some cells in the outer streamlines toward the tubing walls. The diagram of the tubing cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> displays an example of a cell distribution profile in the fluid path for a relatively faster flow rate that congregates cells closer to the center of the tubing in comparison to the relatively slower flow rate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">If a reflection sensor, containing a light source and detector on the same side of the tubing, were to be aimed at the center of the tubing, such as at the area represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, it would become evident that at slower flow rates, when cells are more dispersed, there is more open fluid (non-particle containing fluid) permitting more light to transmit through the fluid in comparison to faster flow rates when cells would be more concentrated at the center of the tubing and within the viewing area of the sensor, causing more reflection of light. Therefore, for a fluid having particles such as cells, since the distribution of cells changes with respect to flow rate, and at a given flow rate the concentration of cells will tend to remain constant, the amount of light reflection measured by an optical sensor may be correlated to the flow rate of the fluid flowing through the tubing, so as to provide a measurement of the fluid flow.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect, a method of optically measuring a fluid flow rate in a fluid processing system is provided. The method includes optically monitoring fluid flow through a transparent portion of a tubing by measuring light reflectance of particles in the fluid, calculating the natural log relating to the reflectance of particles in the fluid, selecting two correlation curve coefficients based on a particulate value for the fluid which is input by a user, and calculating a fluid flow rate related to the two correlation curve coefficients and the natural log of the reflectance.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, a method of measuring a flow rate of a fluid having particles is provided. The method includes providing a fluid flowing through a tubing, exposing the fluid in the tubing to a light emitted by a light source so as to cause at least a portion of the light to be reflected by the fluid, receiving at least a portion of the reflected light, analyzing at least a portion of the received light to determine a reflectance measurement of the at least a portion of the received light, correlating the reflectance measurement to a particulate value input by a user, and calculating a flow rate related to the reflectance measurement and the particulate value.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In yet another aspect, a device is provided for measuring fluid flow rate using optical measurements and configured for use in combination with a tubing in a fluid processing system. The device includes an optical sensor having a light source configured to emit a light, with at least a portion of the light being exposed to a fluid flowing through the tubing and being reflected. The optical sensor further includes an optical fiber for receiving at least a portion of the reflected light, and a controller configured to correlate the received reflected light relative to two correlation curve coefficients based on a particulate value input by a user and to calculate an output indicative of the flow rate of the fluid flowing through the tubing.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect, a method of measuring a flow rate of a fluid is provided. The method includes providing a fluid flowing through a tubing, exposing the fluid in the tubing to a light emitted by a light source so as to cause at least a portion of the light to be reflected by the fluid, receiving at least a portion of the reflected light, analyzing at least a portion of the received reflected light to determine a reflectance measurement, correlating the reflectance measurement to a particulate concentration, and generating an output indicative of the flow rate corresponding to the reflectance measurement.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further aspect, an optical sensor device is provided with the device configured for use in combination with a fluid flowing through a tubing. The optical sensor device includes a light source configured to emit a light, with at least a portion of the light being exposed to a fluid in the tubing and reflected. The device further includes an optical sensor configured to receive at least a portion of the reflected light and analyze at least a portion of the received reflected light to determine a reflectance measurement, and a controller configured to correlate the reflectance measurement to an input particulate level and generate an output indicative of the fluid flow rate corresponding to the reflectance measurement.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet another aspect, a method is provided for measuring the fluid flow rate of blood in a blood processing procedure. The blood processing procedure is a procedure in which blood is processed into one or more blood components with a single-use processing kit, the processing kit including tubing through which the blood is flowed, and a reusable hardware module onto which the processing kit is mounted, the reusable hardware module including a sensing field defined by a segment of the tubing to which a non-invasive optical reflection sensor is directed. The method includes loading the processing kit onto the hardware module with a segment of the tubing positioned in the sensing field, flowing blood through the segment of the tubing, accepting input of a hematocrit level of the blood flowing through the segment of the tubing positioned in the sensing field, utilizing the optical reflection sensor to apply light to the blood flowing through the tubing in the sensing field and obtain a reflectance measurement of the segment of the tubing through which said blood is flowing. The method further includes deriving the natural log of the infrared reflectance measurement attributable to the blood flowing in the segment of the tubing, selecting correlation curve coefficients based on the input hematocrit level, utilizing the natural log of the reflectance attributable to the blood in the segment of the tubing and the correlation curve coefficients in a correlation equation to arrive at the fluid flow rate measurement of the blood flowing through the tubing in the sensing field, and outputting the fluid flow rate measurement of the blood.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It will be appreciated that the use of an optical reflection sensor to measure flow rate of a fluid flowing through a tubing may be conducted with a cost efficient, non-invasive device using an advantageous method.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram of a tubing cross-section representing a laminar flow velocity profile of fluid flowing through the tubing;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram of the tubing cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> representing the laminar flow shear stress forces that act on a particle in the fluid flow;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram of the tubing cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> representing a cell distribution profile at a relatively slower fluid flow rate;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram of the tubing cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> representing a cell distribution profile at a relatively faster flow rate;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram of the tubing cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> representing the target or general location sought to be measured by a hypothetical reflection sensor, which is the center area of the tubing;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic view of an automated fluid processing system, in the configuration of a blood separation system for processing blood including a disposable fluid flow circuit module and a durable controller or control module with the fluid flow circuit module assembled thereon;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective view of an example optical reflection sensor interacting with an example fluid tubing of a fluid processing system;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a diagram of a cross-section of the example optical reflection sensor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a graph of example correlation curves for infrared radiation (IR) reflection from WB, comparing hematocrit (HCT) to the natural log of reflection;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a graph of an example correlation curve comparing flow rates to the natural log of light reflection for 40% HCT WB flowing through a tubing; and</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flow chart of the logic for a sensor that measures Reflectance and interacts with a controller to measure fluid flow in accordance with the methods and systems disclosed herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The embodiments disclosed herein are for the purpose of providing an exemplary description of the present subject matter. They are, however, only exemplary, and the present subject matter may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting the subject matter as defined in the accompanying claims.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It will be appreciated that an optical reflection-based sensing design may be applicable to measure the amount of light reflection from a fluid flowing through a tubing. Such tubing may be included in a fluid processing device having a fixed fluid flow circuit. Alternatively, the tubing may be part of a disposable fluid flow circuit, which may be in a configuration of a module or cassette.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a disposable fluid flow circuit or module A and a reusable durable controller or module B configured to cooperate with and control flow through the fluid circuit A are schematically illustrated as part of a fluid processing system <b>100</b>. The disposable fluid circuit A as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> includes various components interconnected by flexible plastic tubing defining flow paths between the components. The fluid flow circuit or module A preferably is fully pre-assembled and pre-sterilized (with the possible exception of the unit of whole blood (WB) container and the cell preservative container). More specifically, the fluid processing system <b>100</b> is configured for processing blood, such as may be achieved with an apheresis fluid separation system. Thus, the illustrated disposable fluid circuit A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is for the processing of previously collected WB. The circuit includes WB container <b>101</b>, a cell preservation solution container <b>102</b>, blood component separator <b>108</b>, plasma collection container <b>112</b>, optional leukocyte reduction filter <b>113</b>, and red blook cell (RBC) collection container <b>115</b>. While not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the reusable module B may have hangers with associated weigh scales for supporting any or all of the containers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>112</b> and <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The WB collection container <b>101</b> may be any suitable container but is typically a flexible plastic pouch or bag in which approximately <b>450</b> ml of whole blood have been previously collected. The container <b>101</b> may be either part of a separate system during collection and then joined to the rest of the fluid circuit A or actually part of the circuit A at the time of collection. At the time collection, in accordance with customary procedure, the WB is mixed with an anticoagulant located in the primary container to prevent premature coagulation. Accordingly, &#x201c;whole blood&#x201d; (WB) as used herein may include blood mixed with anticoagulant.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Flexible plastic tubing <b>105</b> is attached to the WB collection container, such as by a sterile connection device or other suitable attachment mechanism, and defines a WB fluid flow path between the WB container <b>101</b> and a junction with cell preservative solution tubing <b>103</b>, which extends from the cell preservation solution container <b>102</b> to the flow path junction. The flow path junction between the WB flow path and all preservative flow path is located at inlet clamp <b>116</b>. From the junction, the flow path extends through tubing <b>107</b> to an inlet port in the separator <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the separator housing has an outlet that communicates with the gap between the housing and rotor and with concentrated red cell flow path tubing <b>110</b> for withdrawing concentrated red cells from the separator gap. In addition, the housing includes an outlet from the rotor that communicates with the side of the membrane facing away from the gap (for example, the interior of the rotor) and communicates with plasma flow path tubing <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For reducing the number of leukocytes that may be present in the red cells, the disposable fluid flow circuit A optionally includes a leukocyte reduction filter <b>113</b>, which may be of any suitable well-known construction for removing leukocytes from concentrated red cells without unduly causing hemolysis of red cells or reducing the number of red cells in the collected product. The concentrated red cells flow from the leukocyte reduction filter <b>113</b> through a continuation tubing <b>114</b> of the concentrated red cell flow path into storage container <b>115</b> which may be of any suitable plastic material compatible with red cell storage.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The reusable or durable controller module B, as shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> schematic, preferably includes a controller <b>119</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) and an optical reflection sensor <b>104</b>, as described more fully with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>7</b>A</figref>. The optical reflection sensor <b>104</b> measures the fluid flow of the WB flowing from the WB container <b>101</b>. A particulate value for the fluid, which in this example is an HCT value for the WB, is input by the user into the controller <b>119</b>. The HCT value to be input may be determined in advance, for example, by measuring a finger prick blood sample.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The durable reusable controller or control module B also includes an inlet clamp <b>116</b> which may be operated to control fluid from the WB container <b>101</b> or the cell preservative container <b>102</b> or, optionally, simultaneously and proportionally from both of the containers <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. For controlling flow of blood into the separator, the reusable module includes an inlet pump <b>106</b>, which also may be of any suitable construction, and may be, for example, a peristaltic type pump which operates by progressive compression or squeezing of the tubing <b>107</b> forming the inlet flow path into the separator, a flexible diaphragm pump or other suitable pump.

The components interact with the controller <b>119</b> and the pressure sensor <b>117</b> may output to the controller <b>119</b> to provide an alarm function in the event of an over-pressure condition or an under-pressure condition or both.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">To control the flow rate of concentrated RBCs from the separator <b>108</b>, the reusable module B also includes an outlet pump <b>109</b> that is associated with the outlet flow path <b>110</b>, and functions in the manner similar to that described with respect to inlet pump <b>106</b>, as directed by the controller <b>119</b>. It also may be of any suitable construction such as a peristaltic pump, a flexible diaphragm or other suitable pumping structure. The plasma flow path <b>111</b> exiting the separator is preferably not controlled by a pump, and the volumetric flow rate through the plasma flow path tubing is the difference between the inlet volumetric flow rate from pump <b>106</b> and the outlet volumetric flow rate from pump <b>109</b>. Reusable module B may, however, also include a clamp <b>118</b> for controlling flow of plasma through the plasma flow path tubing <b>111</b>.

Nos. 9,164,078 and 6,419,822 and incorporated herein), for fluid flow rates of 10 ml/min, 50 ml/min, and 100 ml/min. The correlation curves represent experimental data which correlates the IR light reflected by blood to the HCT of the blood. If the HCT remains constant, such as 40% as indicated by the heavy horizontal dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, then a new correlation curve comparing flow rates to light reflection may be formed and applied to measure the flow rate of the fluid in tubing <b>105</b>&#x2032;, which again for convenience may represent tubing <b>105</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, and therefore, the description of the interaction of optical reflection sensor <b>104</b> and tubing <b>105</b>&#x2032; applies in the same manner for optical reflection sensor <b>104</b> and tubing <b>105</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> displays an example correlation curve comparing flow rates to the natural log of light reflection for 40% HCT WB flowing through tubing <b>105</b>&#x2032;. The correlation is an exponential relationship, which is expected because there is a maximum number of cells that may be congregated in the viewing area of the reflection sensor, and as flow rates increase, the cell concentration change in the center streamlines begins tapering off as open space is taken up by cell content. Therefore, depending on the diameter of the tubing and the sensor viewing area, the method may be limited to a specific flow rate range. For example, when using relatively small diameter tubing, flow rates greater than 100 ml/min may not create significant changes in light reflection. However, use of a large diameter tubing and a sensor having a larger viewing area may permit detection of significant changes in light reflection at flow rates greater than 100 ml/min.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A flow rate vs. LN (reflectance) correlation curve would be generated for every HCT in a desired range (ex: 35-55% for WB) and stored by the system (preprogrammed) for use based on the HCT value, which is the particulate value for the fluid that will be input by the user.
