id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">Laminated glass, which is composed of a pair of glass substrates laminated via an interlayer installed on the surface of each glass substrate, is widely used, for example, as a glass member for vehicles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">In recent years, various functional members have been sealed inside laminated glass to let the laminated glass express additional functions. For example, when a light control film is sealed between a pair of interlayers, it is possible to adjust the transmittance of the laminated glass according to the environment (e.g. Patent Document 1).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">Patent Document 1: JP-A-2009-36967</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0005">When a functional member is sealed inside laminated glass, wrinkles may occur in the functional member. In particular, in a case where the glass substrate has a curved surface and the functional member has higher rigidity than the interlayers, the functional member cannot follow the curved surface of the glass substrate and wrinkles are more likely to occur.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Therefore, in order to suppress the occurrence of such wrinkles, it is conceivable to dispose functional members dividedly inside the interlayers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">However, in such a construction that a plurality of divided functional members are mutually spaced apart along the surface direction of the glass substrate, there is a high possibility that air bubbles will remain in the gaps between the functional members.

In such a disposition form of functional members, wrinkles that may occur in the functional members can be significantly reduced, as compared to the case where a single &#x201c;large&#x201d; functional member is sealed between the interlayers.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">In this application, the &#x201c;plane direction&#x201d; means the direction in which the surface on the side at which the first interlayer is installed on the first glass substrate or the surface at which the second interlayer is installed on the second glass substrate, extends.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">Further, &#x201c;viewed in plan view&#x201d; means viewing a predetermined area from the direction normal to the predetermined area.
