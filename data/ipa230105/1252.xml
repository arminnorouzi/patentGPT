More particularly, the invention relates to an exercise device having a Smith bar that includes carriage and locking mechanisms.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGOUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Exercise equipment having a cable and pulley system for lifting a stack of weights has been in use for well over a century. Such equipment comes in a wide variety of designs for performing various exercises. Some have adjustable pulley locations where a handle is attached to a cable for pulling without a defined path of movement. Equipment of this type is often referred to as a functional trainer. One type of such exercise equipment, exemplified, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,402,504, is particularly suited for upper body exercises. This apparatus has an elongated upstanding frame and a carriage that is movable up and down along vertical posts of the frame. The carriage includes one or more pulleys around which a cable is reeved. The cable is further reeved around upper and/o r lower pulleys on the frame and is coupled to a source of exercise resistance, such as a plurality of stacked weights. The cable exits the pulley on the carriage and is connected to a handle or similar pulling device. The height of the handle is readily adjustable by moving the carriage on the vertical posts and locking it into position at the selected height. This permits a wide variety of exercises to be performed for exercising muscle groups of the lower and upper body. The amount of exercise resistance is adjusted by selecting more or fewer stacked weights. The range of available exercise resistance is thus determined by the quantity of available weights.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another type of exercise apparatus is often referred to as a Smith machine. This device consists of a barbell that is fixed within a pair of steel guides, which limit the barbell to only vertical movement. Behind each vertical guide is a series of hooks, slots or holes on which the barbell can be hooked. This means that the barbell can be secured at any point, unlike an ordinary barbell that must be re-racked after a set of repetitions. This makes a Smith machine safer for those who lift without a spotter, as one only needs to twist the wrist in order to lock the barbell in place in the event that the weight becomes too great.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most Smith machines also incorporate blocks, pegs, or other devices that can be adjusted to automatically stop the barbell at a predetermined minimum height. Unlike a free-weight barbell, the bar on a Smith machine does not move forward, backward or sideways to any appreciable extent. Because lifting on a Smith machine requires less stabilization by the lifter, lifters can usually lift more weight with a Smith machine than with a free-weight barbell. Conventional Smith machines still utilize free weights loaded onto the bar as the source of exercise resistance. Free weights are not only cumbersome to move and store, but also present severe safety hazards.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides an apparatus for communicating exercise resistance comprising a carriage assembly with at least one upper and at least one lower pulley. First and second cable ends are reeved around the upper and lower pulleys, respectively, and are coupled to a source of selectable exercise resistance. An exercise member is fixedly coupled to one of the cable ends, or selectively coupled to the two cable ends such that movement of the exercise member away from the carriage is subject to a first exercise resistance when only one of the cable ends is attached and is subject to a second, greater exercise resistance when both cable ends are attached.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, a pulley on a first carriage assembly has a cable end extending from the pulley and another cable end removably attached to the carriage. The cable ends are coupled to a source of selectable exercise resistance. The cable end extending from the pulley may be used with exercise handles or bars. An exercise member is associated with a second carriage assembly above or below the first carriage assembly. The cable end extending from the pulley can attach to the second carriage to provide a first exercise resistance to the exercise member. If more resistance is desired, the cable end attached to the first carriage may be removed from the first carriage and attached to the second carriage, providing a greater resistance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, an exercise apparatus includes a frame with a pair of vertical guide rods. A carriage is slidably carried on each of the guide rods. Each of the carriages has a locking mechanism to lock the carriage at a selected vertical position and a release to disengage the locking mechanism. A horizontal exercise bar (a Smith bar) is slidably carried on the guide rods. Cables are coupled to a selectable exercise resistance, each of the cables having an end fixedly or selectively coupled to either the respective carriage or to a respective bracket at the end of the Smith bar. This arrangement allows exercises performed with the Smith bar to utilize the selectable exercise resistance rather than free weights. In some aspects, the Smith bar may include actuator brackets that are configured to engage respective ones of the carriage releases so as to selectively engage and disengage the locking mechanisms upon axial rotation of the Smith bar or by hand actuated releases on the Smith bar. The actuator brackets on the Smith bar may be further configured to selectively engage and disengage an overhead frame member upon axial rotation of the bar so that the bar can be stored overhead. The exercise apparatus may further include third and fourth cables coupled to the exercise resistance, each of these cables having an end coupled to a pull point on the first and second pulley carriages, respectively. The brackets on the Smith bar are configured for fixed or selective attachment of respective ends of the third and fourth cables. Attaching these cable ends to the Smith bar increases the exercise resistance. In this embodiment, the carriages and the horizontal exercise bar may be on the same guide rods or separate guides so long as the cables can attach to both and the actuator brackets on the horizontal exercise bar are configured to engage a respective lock and release on the carriages.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Representatively, in one embodiment, the invention is directed to an exercise apparatus including a frame; first and second vertical guides coupled to the frame; first and second carriages carried on the respective first and second vertical guides, each of the first and second carriages having an upper carriage portion, a lower carriage portion and a carriage locking mechanism operable to lock and release the lower carriage portion to a selected vertical position along the first and second vertical guides; and an exercise bar coupled to the upper carriage portion of the first and second carriages, the exercise bar operable to translate or rotate to actuate the carriage locking mechanism. In some embodiments, the first and second vertical guides comprise a number of vertically spaced openings at selected vertical positions and the carriage locking mechanism comprises an engaging member that engages with one of the vertically spaced openings to lock the lower carriage portion of each of the first and second carriages to the first and second vertical guides. In some embodiments, the carriage locking mechanism comprises a positive locking mechanism that remains in a locked position until it is released. The carriage locking mechanism may include a positive locking mechanism that requires both carriage locking mechanisms to be aligned with a hole be locked simultaneously. The carriage locking mechanism of each of the first and second carriages may include an engaging member that engages the first and second vertical guides to lock the first and second carriages to the first and second vertical guides only when each engaging member is at a same vertical height along the first and second vertical guides. The carriage locking mechanism may include upper locking components coupled to the upper carriage portion and lower locking components coupled to the lower carriage portion, and the upper locking components engage or disengage with the lower locking components to lock and release the lower carriage portion to the first and second vertical guides. The carriage locking mechanism may include a bar bracket fixedly coupled to the exercise bar and a bar locking pin fixedly coupled to the bar bracket, and wherein a rotation of the exercise bar causes the bar locking pin to engage or disengage with a lower carriage bracket coupled to the lower carriage portion to lock or unlock the lower carriage portion to the first and second vertical guides. The carriage locking mechanism may include a lower carriage lever, a lower carriage bracket and a piston assembly coupled to the lower carriage portion, and wherein the rotation of the exercise bar causes a bar locking pin coupled to the exercise bar to engage with the lower carriage lever and transition the piston assembly from a locked position in which the first and second carriages are locked to the first and second vertical guides to an unlocked position which unlocks the first and second carriages from the first and second vertical guides. The piston assembly may include a housing fixedly coupled to the lower carriage portion, a piston biased toward the locked position and a flange coupling the piston to the lower carriage lever, and wherein a rotation of the lower carriage lever in a first direction forces the piston from the locked position to the unlocked position. In some aspects, a rotation of the lower carriage lever in a second direction releases the force allowing the piston to transition back to the locked position. In some aspects, prior to locking the lower carriage portion to the vertical guide, a translation of the exercise bar relative to the first and second vertical guides moves the upper carriage portion along the first and second vertical guides while the lower carriage portion remains locked at the selected vertical position.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the exercise apparatus includes a frame; at least one vertical guide coupled to the frame; a carriage carried on the vertical guide, the carriage comprising an upper carriage and a lower carriage and a carriage locking mechanism operable to lock and release the lower carriage relative to the at least one vertical guide; and an exercise bar coupled to the upper carriage, the exercise bar operable to actuate the carriage locking mechanism to lock and release the lower carriage relative to the at least one vertical guide. The carriage locking mechanism may include a positive locking piston assembly coupled to the lower carriage. The piston assembly may include a housing fixedly coupled to the lower carriage, a piston and a flange operable to move the piston from a locked position in which the lower carriage is locked to the at least one vertical guide to an unlocked position in which the lower carriage is released from the at least one vertical guide. The carriage may be a first carriage, and the carriage locking mechanism only locks and releases the lower carriage relative to the at least one vertical guide when it is at a same vertical position as a carriage locking mechanism coupled to a second carriage of the exercise apparatus. The carriage locking mechanism may include upper locking components coupled to the upper carriage and lower locking components coupled to the lower carriage, and wherein the upper locking components engage or disengage with the lower locking components to lock and release the lower carriage relative to the at least one vertical guide. In some aspects, a rotation of the exercise bar causes the upper locking components to engage or disengage with the lower locking components to lock and release the lower carriage relative to the at least one vertical guide. In some aspects, the upper locking components comprise a bar bracket fixedly coupled to the exercise bar and a bar locking pin fixedly coupled to the bar bracket that engages with the lower locking components. In some aspects, the lower locking components include a lower carriage bracket fixedly coupled to the lower carriage, and a lower carriage lever pivotally coupled to the lower carriage, and wherein the bar locking pin engages with the lower carriage lever and the lower carriage bracket to release the lower carriage relative to the at least one vertical guide. In some aspects, the engagement of the bar locking pin with the lower carriage bracket couples the upper carriage to the lower carriage.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above summary does not include an exhaustive list of all aspects of the present invention.

No. 10,566,144 entitled Slidable Bar and Carriage Assembly, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. It should further be understood that the terms cable and cable system disclosed herein are not limiting and are intended to encompass any flexible member, for example, any flexible line, wire, rope, fiber or the like that can be used to translate a resistance from one point to another within the system.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The carriage assemblies <b>109</b>L, <b>109</b>R may each include lower carriages <b>102</b>L, <b>102</b>R and upper carriages <b>124</b>L, <b>124</b>R that may move (e.g., slide) vertically along one or more of the vertical guides <b>112</b>L, <b>112</b>R, <b>106</b>L, <b>106</b>R. The lower carriages <b>102</b>L, <b>102</b>R may be vertically slidable on vertical members <b>112</b>L and <b>112</b>R, respectively, and include a sleeve that encircles guide rods <b>106</b>L and <b>106</b>R, respectively. The lower carriages <b>102</b>L, <b>102</b>R may be locked at a desired height by locking mechanisms that engage holes <b>113</b> in vertical members <b>112</b>L and <b>112</b>R, as will be described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">When lower carriages <b>102</b>L and <b>102</b>R are positioned at a mid height, pull points <b>101</b>L and <b>101</b>R may be used to perform such exercises as standing chest presses, incline presses, decline presses, flys and close grip presses. When the carriages are positioned low, near the bottom of guide rods <b>106</b>L and <b>106</b>R, pull points <b>101</b>L and <b>101</b>R can be used to perform exercises such as shoulder presses, squats, bicep curl, lateral raise and front delt. When the carriages are positioned high on the guide rods, these pull points can be used to perform a wide lateral pull down.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The upper carriage <b>124</b>L and <b>124</b>R are coupled to ends of a Smith bar <b>120</b>. The upper carriages <b>124</b>L and <b>124</b>R may have a sleeve like portion that encircles one of the respective guide rods <b>106</b>L and <b>106</b>R and slide along the rods <b>106</b>L and <b>106</b>R. The upper carriages <b>124</b>L and <b>124</b>R therefore guide the Smith bar <b>120</b> along guide rods <b>106</b>L and <b>106</b>R. As will be explained more fully in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, the Smith bar <b>120</b> can be coupled to the weight stacks <b>104</b>L and <b>104</b>R to perform exercises commonly performed on conventional Smith machines, such as squats, dead lifts, bench press, incline press, shoulder press, decline press and upright row. Coupling the selectable weight stacks to the Smith bar eliminates the need to use free weights, as is the case with conventional Smith machines.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When not in use, the Smith bar <b>120</b> may be stowed on overhead portion <b>107</b> using any suitable storage or locking mechanism, for example, a catch and latch type mechanism. An additional safety lock can be swiveled under the Smith bar <b>120</b> to prevent falling if the Smith bar <b>120</b> is accidentally rotated. The Smith bar <b>120</b> rotates axially and may be removed from its stowed position by rotating the bar to disengage the storage or locking mechanism.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">To perform exercises with the Smith bar <b>120</b>, carriages <b>102</b>L and <b>102</b>R may first be brought to a mid position at equal heights on guide rods <b>106</b>L and <b>106</b>R. The Smith bar <b>120</b> is then removed from its stowed position and brought down to the carriages. Cable ends <b>128</b>L and <b>128</b>R, which may normally be hooked onto the respective carriages, may be unhooked from the carriages and slid over to hook onto the Smith bar, thereby coupling the Smith bar <b>120</b> to the weight stacks <b>104</b>R and <b>104</b>L.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The Smith bar <b>120</b> may further include brackets to engage the lower carriages <b>102</b>L and <b>102</b>R so that rotating the bar allows the upper and lower carriages to move up and down on the guide rods <b>106</b>L, <b>106</b>R using the Smith bar <b>120</b> to move them. In some aspects, the lower carriages <b>102</b>L, <b>102</b>R may remain locked and work as a safety when performing exercises such as squats. For example, the bar and carriages may first be lowered to a desired safety position. Then the bar may be rotated to lock the carriages in place. The selected exercise weights may remain attached to the bar by virtue of the cable ends <b>128</b>L and <b>128</b>R being hooked onto the Smith bar <b>120</b>. When done exercising, the bar may be brought back down to pick up the carriages. The exerciser then stands up and allows the carriages to lock into place. The Smith bar <b>120</b> may then be left with the carriages or brought to the top and stored on the overhead portion. An additional safety lock may be engaged with the Smith bar <b>120</b> when stored.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The exercise apparatus <b>100</b> may further include a weight multiplier for doubling the exercise resistance applied to Smith bar <b>120</b>. To engage the weight multiplier, the cable ends <b>130</b>L and <b>130</b>R of pull points <b>101</b>L and <b>101</b>R may be attached to the ends of the Smith bar <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>11</b></figref> illustrate perspective views of a carriage assembly including a carriage locking mechanism of the exercise apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. It should be understood that while a single carriage locking mechanism on one side of the exercise apparatus is shown in the Figures, for example a left side carriage locking mechanism, a second carriage locking mechanism is on the other side of the exercise apparatus (e.g., a right side locking mechanism) that functions in the same manner as that shown and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>11</b></figref>. Carriage locking mechanism <b>200</b> may therefore be understood as having both a left side (L) locking mechanism and a right side (R) locking mechanism. In some aspects, both the left and right side locking mechanisms must be locked before further operation and/or adjustment of the carriage and/or bar assemblies can occur. Representatively, the left and right side locking mechanisms are configured such that both must be locked to the vertical member at a same vertical height before movement of the Smith bar can be used to unlock the lower carriage to allow for vertical movement of the lower carriage. The carriage locking mechanism may therefore be used to set the height of the Smith bar <b>120</b> starting position. In some aspects, the carriage locking mechanism <b>200</b> may be considered a positive locking feature and each side must be lined up with a hole or opening in the vertical member before the carriages can be locked to uprights for a starting point of exercise resistance. This keeps the exercise bar horizontal and lined up properly with the uprights for smooth operation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The carriage locking mechanism <b>200</b> may include upper locking components associated with the Smith bar <b>120</b> and upper carriage <b>124</b>L, and lower locking components associated with the lower carriage <b>102</b>L. The upper locking components may include, for example, a Smith bar <b>120</b> rotationally associated with the upper carriage sleeve <b>212</b> such that up and down movement of the Smith bar <b>120</b> also moves the upper carriage sleeve <b>212</b> up and down respectively, a bar bracket <b>204</b> coupled to an end of the Smith bar <b>120</b>, a bar bracket notch <b>206</b> formed in a side of the bar bracket <b>204</b> and a bar locking pin <b>208</b> extending from a face of the bar bracket <b>204</b>. The bar bracket <b>204</b> is fixedly coupled to an end of the Smith bar <b>120</b> such that a rotation of the Smith bar <b>120</b> also rotates the bar bracket <b>204</b> as shown by the arrow. Rotation of the bar bracket <b>204</b>, in turn, causes the bar bracket notch <b>206</b> to move relative to an upper carriage pin <b>210</b> fixedly coupled to an upper carriage sleeve <b>212</b> which slides along the guide rod <b>106</b>L. Rotation of the bar bracket <b>204</b> causes the bar bracket notch <b>206</b> to catch the upper carriage pin <b>210</b> at a stop at one end or another of the bracket notch <b>206</b>. When the bar bracket notch <b>206</b> catches the upper carriage pin <b>210</b> at its lower stop as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the Smith bar <b>120</b> may be lowered to rest on the lower carriage <b>102</b>L and the bar locking pin <b>208</b> will slide into lever notch <b>216</b> of the lower carriage lever <b>214</b>. The upper carriage sleeve <b>212</b> may further be coupled to a counterbalance by a cable <b>240</b> that counterbalances the weight of the Smith bar <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the Smith bar <b>120</b> is considered to be in an unlocked position relative to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L in that is is not locked to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L. Accordingly, a vertical movement of the Smith bar <b>120</b> and the upper carriage sleeve <b>212</b> along the guide rod <b>106</b>L will be independent of the lower carriage <b>102</b>L and will not cause the lower carriage <b>102</b>L to move. The lower carriage <b>102</b>L, in this configuration, is actually locked to the vertical member <b>112</b>L and unable to move up or down. In addition, it should be understood that when the Smith bar <b>120</b> and the upper carriage sleeve <b>212</b> are in this unlocked position, a resistance (e.g., weight stack <b>104</b>L) may not yet be coupled to the Smith bar <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">To facilitate locking of the Smith Bar <b>120</b> to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L, the bar bracket <b>204</b> further includes a bar locking pin <b>208</b>. The bar locking pin <b>208</b> engages with lower locking components of the carriage locking mechanism <b>200</b> to lock the Smith Bar <b>120</b> to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The lower locking components of the carriage locking mechanism <b>200</b> may include a lower carriage lever <b>214</b> having a lever notch <b>216</b> and a lower carriage bracket <b>218</b> including a bracket notch <b>220</b>. The lower carriage lever <b>214</b> may be rotatably coupled to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L. The lever notch <b>216</b> may be a substantially vertically oriented notch formed at an end of the lower carriage lever <b>214</b>. The lever notch <b>216</b> may be formed at an end of the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> that faces the bar locking pin <b>208</b> such that an opening of the lever notch <b>216</b> is aligned with the bar locking pin <b>208</b> when upper carriage pin <b>210</b> is against the lower stop of bar bracket <b>204</b>. The lower carriage bracket <b>218</b> may be fixedly coupled to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L. The bracket notch <b>220</b> may be a substantially horizontally oriented notch formed at a side of the lower carriage bracket <b>218</b> facing the bar locking pin <b>208</b> and the lower carriage lever <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">To lock the upper carriage <b>124</b>L to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L, the Smith bar <b>120</b> is moved vertically downward so that the bar locking pin <b>208</b> is inserted into the lever notch <b>216</b>. The insertion of the bar locking pin <b>208</b> into the lever notch <b>216</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Once the bar locking pin <b>208</b> is positioned within the lever notch <b>216</b>, it becomes aligned with the horizontally oriented bracket notch <b>220</b> in the lower carriage bracket <b>218</b>. The Smith bar <b>120</b> is then rotated in the direction shown by the arrow (e.g., forward), which in turn, causes the bar locking pin <b>208</b> to move toward the lower carriage bracket <b>218</b> and into the horizontally oriented bracket notch <b>220</b>. It is noted that the bar locking pin <b>208</b> also remains inserted in the lever notch <b>216</b>. In particular, the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> is rotatably coupled to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L at pivot point <b>222</b> such that the movement of the bar locking pin <b>208</b> toward the bracket notch <b>220</b> also pivots the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> toward the bracket notch <b>220</b>. Thus, the bar locking pin <b>208</b> engages both the bracket notch <b>220</b> and the lever notch <b>216</b> when the Smith bar <b>120</b> is rotated as described. The insertion of the bar locking pin <b>208</b> into the bracket notch <b>220</b> and lever notch <b>216</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It can further be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> that when the Smith bar <b>120</b> is lowered and rotated as discussed, the upper stop (as opposed to the lower stop) of the bar bracket notch <b>206</b> now catches the upper carriage pin <b>210</b> of the upper carriage <b>124</b>L and the bracket notch <b>220</b> of the lower carriage bracket <b>218</b> catches the bar locking pin <b>208</b> thereby preventing the upper carriage <b>124</b>L from separating from the lower carriage <b>102</b>L. This engagement between the upper carriage pin <b>210</b> and the upper stop of the bar bracket notch <b>206</b> along with the engagement of the bar locking pin <b>208</b> with bracket notch <b>220</b> of the lower carriage bracket <b>218</b> facilitates locking of the upper carriage <b>124</b>L to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L. This allows the Smith bar <b>120</b> to adjust the lower carriage <b>102</b>L vertically for different starting points of resistance and safety ending positions. A resistance (e.g., weight stack <b>104</b>L) may further be coupled to the upper carriage <b>124</b>L using the cable <b>226</b> and pulley <b>228</b> to provide resistance when lifting the Smith bar <b>120</b>. In addition, a cable <b>224</b> is shown coupled to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L. The cable <b>224</b> may couple the carriage <b>102</b>L to a counterbalance to counterbalance the weight of the lower carriage <b>102</b>L.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition to locking or unlocking the lower carriage <b>102</b>L relative to the upper carriage <b>124</b>L, the rotation of the Smith bar <b>120</b> also locks or unlocks the lower carriage <b>102</b>L from the vertical member <b>112</b>L. In particular, as previously discussed, prior to locking of the upper and lower carriages <b>124</b>L, <b>102</b>L together, the lower carriage <b>102</b>L is locked to the vertical member <b>112</b>L at a particular vertical position. The lower carriage <b>102</b>L must therefore be unlocked from the vertical member <b>112</b>L before the Smith bar <b>120</b> (now locked to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L) can be moved vertically, for adjustment of a start position and new lock position of the lower carriage <b>102</b>L. It is noted that although not shown, the right side upper and lower carriages <b>124</b>R, <b>102</b>R are also locked to the right side vertical member <b>112</b>R at the same vertical position. The operation of the locking components for locking or unlocking of the lower carriage <b>102</b>L relative to the vertical member <b>112</b>L will now be discussed in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Representatively, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref> illustrate side views of the same carriage locking mechanism previously discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, however, the lower locking components of the carriage locking mechanism for locking or unlocking the lower carriage <b>102</b>L to the vertical member <b>112</b>L are further shown. In particular, it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref> that the lower locking components further include a locking assembly <b>230</b> for locking or unlocking the lower carriage <b>102</b>L to the vertical member <b>112</b>L. The locking assembly <b>230</b> may include a housing <b>232</b> fixedly coupled to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L, a piston <b>234</b> coupled to the housing <b>232</b> and a flange <b>236</b> coupling the piston <b>234</b> to the lower carriage lever <b>214</b>. In this aspect, the locking assembly <b>230</b> may also be referred to herein as a piston assembly. The piston <b>234</b> may be oriented such that it faces vertically spaced openings formed along the vertical member <b>112</b>L and is operable to slide or translate relative to the housing <b>232</b>. The piston <b>234</b> is sized to fit within the openings in the vertical member <b>112</b>L. In this aspect, the piston <b>234</b> can be moved toward the vertical member <b>112</b>L to engage with an opening in the vertical member <b>112</b>L or can be moved away from the vertical member <b>112</b>L to disengage with an opening in the vertical member <b>112</b>L. An engagement of the piston <b>234</b> with an opening in the vertical member <b>112</b>L locks the lower carriage <b>102</b>L to the vertical member <b>112</b>L so that it remains at the same vertical position until the piston <b>234</b> is removed from the opening. Once the piston <b>234</b> is removed from the opening, the lower carriage <b>102</b>L is once again free to slide along the vertical member <b>112</b>L.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The movement of the piston <b>234</b> may be caused by the movement of the lower carriage lever <b>214</b>. Representatively, as previously discussed, the piston <b>234</b> is coupled to the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> by flange <b>236</b>. The flange <b>236</b> may include one end that is attached to the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> and another end seated against a ridge of the piston <b>234</b>. The piston <b>234</b> may be biased toward the engaged position. In this aspect, the default position is for the lower carriage <b>102</b>L to remain locked to the vertical member <b>112</b>L. This default lock position is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. To disengage the piston <b>234</b> from the vertical member <b>112</b>L, the bar locking pin <b>208</b> is lowered from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> into the lever notch <b>216</b> of the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> by lowering the Smith bar <b>120</b> (not shown). Once the bar locking pin <b>208</b> engages the lever notch <b>216</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the bar locking pin <b>208</b> is moved toward the lower carriage bracket <b>218</b> by rotating the Smith bar <b>120</b> (e.g., forward toward the upper carriage sleeve <b>212</b>) as previously discussed, which in turn causes the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> to rotate toward the lower carriage bracket <b>218</b> as shown by the arrow. This rotation of the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> causes the flange <b>236</b> to move the piston <b>234</b> away from the vertical member <b>112</b>L as shown by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The movement of the piston <b>234</b> away from the vertical member <b>112</b>L pulls the piston <b>234</b> out of the opening in the vertical member <b>112</b>L to the unlocked position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Once in this unlocked position with the piston <b>234</b> disengaged from the opening of the vertical member <b>112</b>L, the lower carriage <b>102</b>L is now free to move along the vertical member <b>112</b>L along with the upper carriage <b>124</b>L. This movement allows for the vertical height of the lower carriage <b>102</b>L to be adjusted to any one of the vertically spaced openings along the vertical member <b>112</b>L and locked at the start height position desired by the user. Since the upper carriage <b>124</b>L is also locked to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L in this position, and the Smith bar <b>120</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) is pivotally connected to the upper carriage <b>124</b>L, the vertical position of the lower carriage <b>102</b>L can be adjusted by raising or lowering the Smith bar <b>120</b>. As previously discussed, although only one carriage locking mechanism <b>200</b> is described, both the left and right side locking mechanisms must be locked before further operation and/or adjustment of the carriage and/or Smith bar <b>120</b> can occur. In addition, the left and right side locking mechanisms <b>200</b> are configured such that both must be locked to the vertical member <b>112</b>L at a same vertical height before movement of the Smith bar <b>120</b> can be used to unlock the lower carriage <b>102</b>L to allow for vertical movement of the lower carriage <b>102</b>L. As previously discussed, the carriage locking mechanism <b>200</b> may be used to set the height of the Smith bar <b>120</b> starting position. For example, the carriage locking mechanism <b>200</b> may be a positive locking mechanism in which each one must be lined up with a hole or opening (e.g., opening <b>113</b>) in the vertical member <b>112</b>L at a same vertical height before the locking mechanism <b>200</b> can be locked to the vertical member <b>112</b>L by using the Smith bar <b>120</b> for a starting point of exercise resistance. This keeps the Smith bar <b>120</b> horizontal and lined up properly with the uprights for smooth operation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>10</b></figref> illustrate perspective views of the piston assembly described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, which will now be discussed in more detail. Representatively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, are cross section views where portion(s) of the lower carriage <b>102</b>L are removed so that aspects of the piston assembly <b>230</b> mounted within the lower carriage <b>102</b>L can be more clearly seen. From this view, it can be seen that flange <b>236</b> includes one end connected to the pivot point <b>222</b> (e.g., a bar member) and another end defined by a first arm <b>236</b>A and a second arm <b>236</b>B. The first arm <b>236</b>A and the second arm <b>236</b>B form a &#x201c;Y&#x201d; shaped structure and are attached at different locations along ridges of piston <b>234</b>. Representatively, the piston <b>234</b> may include an engaging portion <b>806</b>, a flange attachment portion <b>808</b> and a biasing portion <b>810</b>. The engaging portion <b>806</b> may be sized and dimensioned for insertion within the vertical member openings at the desired vertical position as previously discussed. The flange attachment portion <b>808</b> may be a wider portion of the piston <b>234</b> that facilitates the contact of the flange first and second arms <b>236</b>A-B to the piston <b>234</b>. Representatively, the first arm <b>236</b>A may contact the piston <b>234</b> at a location that is in front of the flange attachment portion <b>808</b> (e.g., between the engaging portion <b>806</b> and the portion <b>808</b>). The second arm <b>236</b>B may contact the piston <b>234</b> at a location that is behind the flange attachment portion <b>808</b> (e.g., between the biasing portion <b>810</b> and the portion <b>808</b>).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As the flange <b>236</b> is caused to rotate about the pivot <b>222</b> by the lower carriage lever (not shown) as previously discussed, the first and second arms <b>236</b>A-B will either allow the piston <b>234</b> to remain in the forward (or locked) position in which the engaging portion <b>806</b> is positioned in an opening <b>113</b> in the vertical member <b>112</b>L (e.g., locked position) or pull the piston <b>234</b> to a rearward (or unlocked) position in which the engaging portion <b>806</b> disengages the opening <b>113</b> in the vertical member <b>112</b>L (e.g., unlocked position). For example, when the flange <b>236</b> is rotated about the pivot <b>222</b> in a counterclockwise direction, the first arm <b>236</b>A pushes the piston <b>234</b> rearward causing the engaging portion <b>806</b> to be removed from the opening <b>113</b> in the vertical member <b>112</b>L. On the other hand, when the flange <b>236</b> is rotated about pivot <b>222</b> in a clockwise direction, the second arm <b>236</b>B (along with the biasing member <b>802</b>) pushes the engaging portion <b>806</b> toward the vertical member <b>112</b>L causing it to re-engage with an opening <b>113</b> in the vertical member <b>112</b>L. The biasing portion <b>810</b> is configured to support the biasing member <b>802</b> which biases the piston <b>234</b> toward the locked position. The biasing member <b>802</b> may be, for example, a spring that is positioned around the biasing portion <b>810</b>, between the attachment portion <b>808</b> and the end of the piston housing.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">From this view, it can also be seen that a linear bearing <b>804</b> is positioned within the upper carriage sleeve <b>212</b> of the upper carriage <b>124</b>L. The linear bearing <b>804</b> may be configured to facilitate the movement (e.g. sliding) of the upper carriage <b>124</b>L (and any resistance coupled thereto) along the guide rod <b>106</b>L with greater ease. In addition, a spring <b>814</b> may be positioned along the guide rod <b>106</b>L, between the upper carriage <b>124</b>L and the lower carriage <b>102</b>L, to help prevent or otherwise reduce impact between the upper carriage <b>124</b>L and lower carriage <b>102</b>L when one moves relative to the other.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrate front side perspective views of the piston assembly <b>230</b>. From these views, it can be seen that the pivot <b>222</b> is a bar like member and one end of the flange <b>236</b> is attached to the pivot <b>222</b>. The second arm <b>236</b>B of the flange <b>236</b> is shown attached behind the attachment portion <b>808</b> and around the biasing portion <b>810</b> of the piston <b>234</b>. It can therefore be more clearly understood from this view that when the pivot <b>222</b> rotates clockwise or counterclockwise, it also moves the flange <b>236</b> forward or backward causing the piston to engage or disengage with the openings <b>113</b> in the vertical member <b>112</b>L.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> illustrate side perspective views of the same carriage locking mechanism previously discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-B</figref>, however, an alternative configuration of the lower locking components of the carriage locking mechanism for locking or unlocking the lower carriage <b>102</b>L to the vertical member <b>112</b>L are further shown. In particular, it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-B</figref> that instead of a locking assembly including a piston as previously discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, the lower locking components include a locking assembly <b>1130</b> having pin <b>1134</b> for locking or unlocking the lower carriage <b>102</b>L to the vertical member <b>112</b>L. The pivoting pin assembly <b>1130</b> may include a body <b>1132</b> pivotally coupled to the lower carriage <b>102</b>L, a pin <b>1134</b> coupled to the body <b>1132</b> and a flange <b>1136</b> coupling the pin <b>1134</b> to the lower carriage lever <b>214</b>. The pin <b>1134</b> may be oriented such that it faces vertically spaced openings formed along the vertical member <b>112</b>L and is operable to move in or out of the openings when the body <b>1132</b> pivots. The pin <b>1134</b> is sized to fit within the openings in the vertical member <b>112</b>L. In this aspect, the pin <b>1134</b> can be moved toward the vertical member <b>112</b>L to engage with an opening in the vertical member <b>112</b>L or can be moved away from the vertical member <b>112</b>L to disengage with an opening in the vertical member <b>112</b>L by pivoting the body <b>1132</b>. An engagement of the pin <b>1134</b> with an opening in the vertical member <b>112</b>L locks the lower carriage <b>102</b>L to the vertical member <b>112</b>L so that it remains at the same vertical position until the pin <b>1134</b> is removed from the opening. Once the pin <b>1134</b> is removed from the opening, the lower carriage <b>102</b>L is once again free to slide along the vertical member <b>112</b>L. The movement of the pin <b>1134</b> may be caused by the movement of the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> as previously discussed. Representatively, as previously discussed, the pin <b>1134</b> is coupled to the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> by flange <b>1136</b>. The flange <b>136</b> may include one end that is attached to the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> and another end attached to the body <b>1132</b>. The pin <b>1134</b> may be biased toward the engaged position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>. In this aspect, the default position is for the lower carriage <b>102</b>L to remain locked to the vertical member <b>112</b>L. To disengage the pin <b>1134</b> from the vertical member <b>112</b>L, the bar locking pin <b>208</b> is lowered into the lever notch <b>216</b> of the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> by lowering the Smith bar <b>120</b> (not shown). Once the bar locking pin <b>208</b> engages the lever notch <b>216</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, the bar locking pin <b>208</b> is moved toward the lower carriage bracket <b>218</b> by rotating the Smith bar <b>120</b> (e.g., forward toward the upper carriage sleeve <b>212</b>) as previously discussed, which in turn causes the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> to rotate toward the lower carriage bracket <b>218</b> as shown by the arrow. This rotation of the lower carriage lever <b>214</b> causes the flange <b>1136</b> to move the body <b>1132</b> and in turn the pin <b>1134</b> away from the vertical member <b>112</b>L as shown by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. The movement of the pin <b>1134</b> away from the vertical member <b>112</b>L pulls the pin <b>1134</b> out of the opening in the vertical member <b>112</b>L to the unlocked position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. Once in this unlocked position with the pin <b>1134</b> disengaged from the opening of the vertical member <b>112</b>L, the lower carriage <b>102</b>L is now free to move along the vertical member <b>112</b>L along with the upper carriage <b>124</b>L.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a front side perspective view of the carriage locking assembly with the pulley system previously discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. From this view, it can be seen that cable <b>226</b> is reeved around pulley <b>228</b> and connected at its end at an attachment bracket <b>1202</b>A coupled to the Smith bar <b>120</b>. As previously discussed, a resistance (e.g., weight stack <b>104</b>L) may be coupled to the Smith bar <b>120</b> using the cable <b>226</b> and pulley <b>228</b> to provide resistance when lifting the Smith bar <b>120</b>. In addition, cable <b>1204</b> may be connected at its end to attachment bracket <b>1202</b>B coupled to the Smith bar <b>120</b>. Cable <b>1204</b> may be used to couple a resistance (e.g., weight stack <b>104</b>L) to Smith bar <b>120</b> in a similar manner to cable <b>226</b> (e.g., through a looped cable system).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It will be recognized that the above-described invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics of the disclosure.
